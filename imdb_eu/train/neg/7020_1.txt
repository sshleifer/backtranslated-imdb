Seeing Smother was perhaps the longest 90 minutes of my life. He did not laugh; In fact, I never remember having ever smiled. Diane Keaton was regarded as a terrifying joke of middle-aged dog, a terrifying nature of her mother, a woman with a clear personality disorder. Manipulative, combined, melodramatic, childhood, narcissistic and all, it is boring. <br /> <br /> I should briefly mention other people, but why worry? It was only a long chain of topical films, a prosperous remote social society that is trying to prevent "Industry", a woman who can only be a rude and long-lasting but fascinated father. I have not taken any more (but eventually moves beyond the discord and is desperate to go home), pillows that burst pillows, throw pillows and those who like to go away, and so on. <br /> <br /> God, what is wrong. I have never been a fan of Diane Keaton and reminded me of Smother. Overacting is overacting, no matter how many times you've made your pictures. Attempts at physical comedy were mostly humiliated. What did the director think? <br /> <br /> I like Dax Shepard, and sometimes even Liv Tyler admits that their shows were so bright and shameful that the actor had not faked about this movie. Keaton did not end up nonsense, and sometimes she seemed to be an affliction to Shepard's. At the end of the movie, I wanted to slap myself. <br /> <br /> Soul
