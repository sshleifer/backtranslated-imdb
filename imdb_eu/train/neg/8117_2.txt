"Horrible People" should be the subtitle of that movie. If you want to see what ordinary people are doing with ordinary things, check out your window in real life. But if you want to see unpleasant, you'll have to see Mike Leigh's horrible movie. The characters talk long, but never communicate with each other. Why not? I think Leigh wants all his players to be effective and pathetic, and he wants to shoot real things. But we are not, and it has failed.
