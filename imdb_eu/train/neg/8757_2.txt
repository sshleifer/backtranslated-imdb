There is a spectacular movie about the future trends of popular British music. Tommy soon? Honeycomb? The film includes songs by Spencer Davis, Animals, including the live version of the Beatles in Twist and Shout (1:20). But, in general, a bad British visual display in 1964. Oh, and Herman's Hermits.
