A small town is attacked by a horde of wild vampires. The only hope is a solitary revenge and a group of survivors. <br /> <br /> When it was released in 1993, "Darkness" received a cult after releasing it. It's easy to say why charging (and charged freaking), and energy and excitement, such as "The Dead Next Door" and "The Children of Ravensback", have been discovered in other horror films. it's really infective. <br /> <br /> Although this is true, unfortunately it is not enough to save. The film was shot at Super 8, so the image is grainy and dark, which makes it difficult to see things (it would be wonderful if the protagonist had hidden the horrible rays). The grid is also a Casio Casioz band. Keyboard and Death Metal are even more annoying (seriously, what is this horror movie bad and evil Death Metal?). Although an Oscar does not expect a good performance, the performance is still time for amateurs. frightened or threatened instead. <br /> <br /> In the end, I am sure that budget-conscious gorefests will love this. The rest, however, would be a bit more flesh.
