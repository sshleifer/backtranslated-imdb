This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I do not remember every time I remember it. I thought it was about an airplane accident investigation. What was really a chap, and it's bad. The "conflict" card was superimposed. As it seems like a shout of the first hour, there are some scenes that are impossible. <br /> <br /> * Possible alperter * <br /> <br /> The 40th minute "memorial" scene (forced black umbrellas and rain) fictitious victims were tears and I thought it would not end. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all, unless it's "conflict". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
