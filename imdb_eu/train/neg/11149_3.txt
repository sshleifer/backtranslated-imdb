Summary: The moon. A great creature, a great man, is hunting. It's not flesh or blood, but it does not seem to mind paying a snack for a while, but for a friend. She is looking for a girl. It's not a girl. Girl The empty girl (and also the male wolf, who has not yet known). Three, well, check out that two police officers (after the first scene) and the old bag can stop all that lady or, of course, knows that the people of the whole moon die and eat a man's wolf. Darkwolf is a powerful man that wasps this girl close. If he succeeds, mankind is condemned. Now, the police must find the girl, not only to convince her, but also to someone who wants to kill her, and who wants to kill her, but a man who is a green man. And then they had to stop ... <br /> <br /> Comments: this for boys, for young boys. Many of the girls who are semi-naked are less important for the plot. Especially less. Well, I think you need to get some time, because the plot is thin. Unfortunately, there is little room for girls to break the plot. Usually they become two main topics. Nudity Check Then special effects. Hmm ... Well, some things you can call effects. They are not very special. In fact, to be forceful, they are very bad. Movie seems to be missing They could not afford clothes for some girls;), and the effects are cheap. Some transformations between man and the human form, by computer, are really bad. You can leave these things aside. But Darkwolf himself is too raw and you never see any murder. Then some damaged corpses. In a film that is honestly bleeding in the blood, there is little surly blood. <br /> <br /> I do not know what to say and about the actors. They do the best they do, but sadly they overwhelm that the characters (or the actors) lose. Some of these advances can be linked to the aforementioned problems. Bad Effects or Bad Budget (?) As. That's why shooting is scarce, although the character is armed like a small army, this goal is visible (and does not move). But, well, when you're really in danger, there's no way to save your life ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He is nowhere near him and can not do it. let it stop But, surely, the makers allow them to put an end to the end ... <br /> <br /> But I would not mind seeing an actor / actor in another movie to see another attempt. Well. To give a little outcome: I do not recommend a movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
