It's really a great movie. What they have done is a television program that has never been targeted at children and has been given treatment by George Lucas (that is, it is considered by young people to be kiddifying by mere words). <br /> <br /> Well, so the Thunderbirds TV show was not the most important show, it was a pretty formula, but it was always nice to watch (especially when the patterns were lit) and the voice was not bad. <br /> <br /> This suffers from bad smelting and performance (exceptions like Sophia Myles Lady Penelope and Ron Cook Parker stand out, they seem to be the only cast members who have to play their characters) After hiding in Frakes I did not leave him a direct traffic. Everything about Thunderbirds was due to the whole family of Tracy, how they worked in groups, preventing catastrophes or bringing about the rescue. involved in disasters <br /> <br /> Avoid dirt like this pests. <br /> <br /> I only give 10 to 10.
