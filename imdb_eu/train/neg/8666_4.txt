This televised thriller is a lecture, with little action. It makes it hard for the plot to be confused, but the writing is so confusing that the exhibition continues to be very blurred. In the end I did not know about these characters any more. Nearly the "Little Indians" scene, but the moat in the middle reveals Sally Field and his killer. The field has almost never been seen by the wickedness I've ever seen. The initial entries are good, but the writings soon get away and eventually go to the top. Hysteria, thunderstorms and lightning effects (which does not add anything). Aaron Spelling and the untrue failure of producers Leonard Goldberg. With this talent, could not they be with red portraits and more than one screenplay hidden in a wardrobe Sally Field?
