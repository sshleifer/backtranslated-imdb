This movie fails at all levels. I have an idea, let's take all those who take part in this film and move it to a warm Middle East. If they are happy, they will all be shot and killed and we will not lose time again. Did I admit that I was never so bitter about a cinematic pile of my life? God, I can not think of the bad thing I have ever seen. I'd rather see Ishtar 25 times in a row for 10 minutes of this sensitive excuse for a movie. When I find anyone involved in this movie, I turn on my face and nonsense supernatural. That's my two cents.
