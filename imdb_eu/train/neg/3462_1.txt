Slash flicks are far away from a few days; So when I heard with Cut, I had a lot of hope and I heard good things. I had heard all the good things were wrong ... wrong! This flick is bad and I mean BAD. It's just a fool. About everything Especially the origin and lifestyle of the murderer and finally how he looks after him. There's nothing original or outstanding about this movie. There is only one "hip" with "slasher wannabe". "Film specialists" characters. I'm wrong that way. Someone has something different from the slash genre that literally requires new blood.
