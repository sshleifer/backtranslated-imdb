Okay, let me start at the beginning that there will be no surprise to anyone who reads other comments. That said, MY G-D, FROM THIS SHORT-BREAK! I mean, WOW, I did not know it was possible that it could throw much money, they did something and still get worse than any of Roger Corman's films! In Corman probably this film was set up at some point, but the script was bad for its quality! First of all, the only reason for this film has been said by someone: 'Hey, Zombies are well-known. Video games are popular. What games do we have in the zombies? Resident Evil? No, someone else came first. Silent Hill? No, silent. People never sit in a dark room to be terrified. Hey, does not Sega play to zombie people? They are out of the platform, we could not get the money! <br /> <br /> They basically tried to make a movie that feels like a video game, even though it started to shoot. the characters were playing. <br /> <br /> The first problem and the original game was horrible. I mean <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> a bad movie-merchandising-in-a-better-in-a-game-two-weeks-shippe morons-everything-buy -I want to say-and-his-parents-great Christmas. The graphics were boring. The monsters got bored. The level was boring. The interface was boring. CASE was boring. In other words, the game was boring. This was the version of ARCADE. The home version was even worse! With the home version, you do not get the shotgun at hand, while it was boring with the boring game! But I digress it. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that indeed they were really interested in scenes during real gameplay fighting scenes. EIN ??? Did the director not have had enough confidence in the fight? All the debates were filmed from a shot film shot, the Matrix style effects can be boring. The problem was that the game was a first-person shooter (the player starts from the POV of the character). Maybe that's why they play graphics, so you can find out about the games ... All right, whatever ... <br /> <br /> However, all this experience is the only thing that was remotely pleasing. Everyone in the theater was laughing at the movie, so my laughter took the form of hysteria and general credibility as usual and I was not expelled. <br /> <br /> Join in, do not go see this FILM! Do not call at least twice a week when the video comes out. Run Just run.
