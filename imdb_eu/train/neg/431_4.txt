Certainly, I think Al Pacino is a guilty pleasure. He was a good actress until she smelled of a woman's odor, where she apparently overdosed, without repairing it. This movie, I heard almost everything I had grown up, I expected the nice little treasure I expected. A city of political thriller that is intelligent and advanced, accurate and tough. It is not. <br /> <br /> It is a movie that draws the Town Hall, a film that works with so many characters, names and realistic cities, which you think is so broad and engaging in its plot. When you know the truth, it will blow you up. However, these infrastructures and digressions, in the end, are quite beloved and well-known in urban history, such as power corruption, two-faced politicians, police bond mafia, etc. And theoretically, this configuration allows for an exciting tension. Fear that characters are not safe and something could happen! But again it is not really. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only thing that can happen is predictable, and "confession" is a series of monologues that, in general, make up a modern one. a lesson on ambiguity about the "real world" of fables, politics and society. But after 110 minutes after the name and postless reports, and after a series of lies and spider coating, the audience usually treats them with a little satisfaction. I do not think we're leaving it at the Town Hall, but despite being a very complete movie, I will not find it very rich.
