Haunted Boat sells "The Fog" that fills itself with 'Water Open'. In many ways this is accurate. Those who are interested in you are curious about how to look and look. <br /> <br /> However, the resemblance is very weak. They show signs of just a bunch of people who make a horror movie. Which credits do all of their power. When you accept a low budget, it is very difficult for special effects, because the ghosts look pretty like men with rubber masks. <br /> <br /> The many aspects of the film are awful and strange. But he uses excessive agitation in a few short periods, leaving him bored and confused. As far as maintenance is concerned, movies are very good. In the last 5 seconds, you want to know what happens if you do not make annoying conversions. And they are ready to wait 1h 35 minutes to make climate. <br /> <br /> This is not the Ghost Ship but it will definitely make a T.V front evening.
