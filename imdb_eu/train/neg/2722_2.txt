For our great thinkers among us, "The Intruder" is a French film madness and incoherent, the so-called "art film" is a bad name. The story is about Louis Trow (Michel Subor) about an old tits that goes looking for Tahiti to get a heart transplant, but beyond that I do not know who the people in the movie were or why they were doing it. Without a coherent story without proudness, the film loses us at the beginning, although I am very pleased that I can say that the message gets a profound message from this movie. <br /> <br /> The drama that runs has been running for two hours and five minutes, although anyone with no doubt will close their closing credits.
