The NSA, the CIA, the FBI, the FSB and all other snoop agencies in the world have to watch this movie to get people information on how to spy. (According to MST3, the commentary ... "All Sanata have dirt! Santa's Tentacles reaches far and wide! She hides herself from Klaus") <br /> <br /> Thousands of million spy telescopes. Hears a thousand and ears. It's amazing that the CIA does not pay for Santa. <br /> <br /> Satan's dance routine is the horny one. Arena ... it's useless. <br /> <br /> The scope of this film is horrible. Budget very low, but so funny to see. I recommend watching the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version for more laughs. <br /> <br /> You also laugh at the misfortune of the best children. <br /> <br /> I will give it to 1 production. Quality and 10 pure and fun cheeses.
