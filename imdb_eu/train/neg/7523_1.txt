I took a chance again and rented this shit bag. Writing as a horror movie, there was not a single scene far from the distance. It's not one !! It is certain that there was a bit of nuance, but all the lesbian actions were too old. Do I suppose it was a thought that saving the grace of this film? And Dan, what a ass sacks a bag !! From the very beginning I knew that when I first spoke it, Dan spoke. And did he think he was afraid? What a laugh! In short, this movie is terribly terrifying! How can I like movies like this? If you want a movie with a few movies, do not rent this one. Teletubbies is just as exciting as this movie.
