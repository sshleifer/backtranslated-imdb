I never saw "I considered him as a student" for movies, I see, I create an opinion and that's it. But Unhinged changed everything. This film is definitely a trivial essay I have ever seen. Each child who thinks he will be the next Spielberg or Tarantino at the University will give him this movie with a manual called "How to not a movie". There is no story, filmmakers could not make a film worthy of a movie. Since I've seen it for some time, I can say that I can see high-level tracking scenes from the beginning scenes. They will never end! It's almost like throwing teeth, not just fun.
