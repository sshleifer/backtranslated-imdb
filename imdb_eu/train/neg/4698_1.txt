I mean seriously what a wonderful group of cars would sing? So, ten of them, it means that children's humor is "about being my woman", I mean seriously! Is the name pretty crisp, naked? They just have to remove their pants because ??? HOW MUCH CREATIVE. I do not know why they need a TV show, because most artists do not need a TV show about themselves, especially the bare brothers. Look at how many of them are similar. What happens with serious cinema? Jeez Nick is a clear, but serious, use in these years. Many parents did not see their children call the name of the Naked Brother, that is, the name of the stupid and creative show that comes to television.
