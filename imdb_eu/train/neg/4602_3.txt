A film without consciousness. Drifter commits herself to agree to a man to get money from a mafia. Then they duplicate it. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the deceased's wife and, without knowing that he was a murderer, goes along with him. Then she dies when she knows "accidentally". Then, in a kind of heroism of WALKING TALL, he retaliates for the mafia that crosses the mountain. The first problem is the recruitment of murders, the assignment of wages, which includes the paths, debts, and heroes. We can not accept it and, as a result, the rest do not have any moral meaning. We can not ignore this. And her wife (a playmaker Kari Wuhrer's EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS sheriff), a senior lady with a role for homeless people, at the same time loses the level of sympathy with her homeless drifter. After the death of her husband, the situation was weak. And when he knows that man? what does he do He enters his house (houses that ALL-EKIN can not open as locks) and they start to get their hands on. Stoo-pid. George Wendt, however, is terrific as a thug thefy. Stuart Gordon did much better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
