I appreciate one thing and the only thing - this woman will now be thousands of miles on a totally continent! Yes !!! This program summarizes how Victoria Beckham extends himself and his family to the name of the media with the name of himself and his family, and "Brand Beckham." <br /> <br /> Some years ago I really liked "Posh and Becks", I still admire the talent of David, but I do not respect it anymore. How can you respect someone who works like a puppet on the back of your wife's hand? <br /> <br /> Victoria got an early start at Manchester United from Victoria, and now Victoria has the same thing. Real Madrid happened. I hope Beckham earns a pile of pounds, but he has sold his soul for the American Buck and he will end the day playing with a group that tries to obtain first-class promotion in England. - But you're baseball and Basketball rule - you do not have football!) <br /> <br /> However, I digress it. Years have seen a totally false performance by 'Posh' in recent years, that is, only the headwoman named Rebecca Loosen debacle. David deserved it, but he was disappointed in his arm to keep his pound for a million pounds. <br /> <br /> This advanced PR was pathetic. Why can not he go silent with him, keep his husband through the biggest mistake of his professional career and lower his head? When did he feel so full of importance that America felt the fan cover of this great fan rate? <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw David Beckham's documentary last night. He has, at least, kept rigidity of grace and humility. His wife can do two things to learn. <br /> <br /> Another thing to do is Victoria - you're constantly hurt to complain. A small suggestion - let's not leave you as far as your stupid wife. <br /> <br /> Fortunately America !!
