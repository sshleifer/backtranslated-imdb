Other raptors of history <br /> <br /> This movie is ruin; He uses a historical story and has a love story that has a bad performance and low budget production. <br /> <br /> The movie must be 1/3, it's time to make a small series. <br /> <br /> The battle scene is so stupid and non-logical, stupid soldiers, clothing is a disaster. The Romans struggled in the open areas, when the Germans tried to fight the army in a forest, they completely destroyed the Germans. The Romans chose to fight for the city in this film, I mean real. > <br /> And Cleopatra was like a Macedonian origin, that is, a person with a smooth skin.
