Once again, a story about a man (here's a writer) who sells his soul to the devil to achieve the most desires of his life: success. Unfunny script ("we should go home and write it better"), to understand the "Christmanish" strong message lines (our only goal in life is to find love, respect and good friendship, and long-term trial.) Hopkins agent devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is not sexy or evil), he beatified this character for all the bad things. Actors' bad efforts (Baldwin was also the director, Cattrall, "Sex and the City" again with Aykroyd's limited role with some fun lines.) PD Try a well-known movie called "Alloimono stous neous" in Greece, an excellent adaptation of this myth (an old man will give the devil the devil to restore his youth).
