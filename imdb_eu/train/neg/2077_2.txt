It was a pretext to leave home when drying paint - leave the film for an hour and then paint it after dry paint. he tried to stay really. The script was not castrated, and "go and go" was wrong - come on! Uma Thurman doing things? Special effects are pretty lame. These were the oldest characters and 20-something short-lived actors. The feeling was annoying and wrong. <br /> <br /> The review is based on the first hour. I had to go home and see what I painted before painting the darker shade.
