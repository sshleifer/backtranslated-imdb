First: I bought it at the video store. The second: I saw it. The third one: it was boring. Fourth: it was not funny. Fifth: most of the antics were lame. In the end, but not least, it's not a bad movie, but a complete fiasco. <br /> <br /> I am a great fan of Adam Sandler, despite being disappointed with the movie and forgotten. Pena is his first movie. Even if you're a fan of Adam Sandler, do not worry about this movie. Instead, take the video, upload it to the yacht and throw it on board.
