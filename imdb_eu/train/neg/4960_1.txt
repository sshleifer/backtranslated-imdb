I'm a fan of Batman's comic and I was disappointed I had not found Batman: The Animated Series TV. I was excited about knowing that Batman's new cartoon was on television. I saw the first episode was released and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the animation is very poor. It looks like a cheap and inexpensive Japanese anime. Again, it's all like today's cartoon. <br /> <br /> The design of the characters is even worse. Batman is like Birdman, it's like Catwoman Chihuahuawoman, it's like a red version of Bane Hulk. Penguin is the master of Kung Fu, Mr. The freezing head is frozen with an iceberg, and it's Riddler. Marilyn Manson looks gothic (this is funny because they do not know that obsessed by inventions and puzzles are gothic). <br /> <br /> The worst design of the character is Joker. Bob Marley / Kung-Fu fighter became a monkey. Batman Joker wants to be the deadliest enemy, but this show barely threatens his crimes to be so stupid and absurd. In one episode his joke was to put Joker's poison. Oh, what's wrong! Batman is a wonderful and complex character, seeing his parents' deaths, which is why he fights against crime. This version of Batman does not fear his parents' deaths and has no interest. Also, he is not a detective, but a fighter. The enemy can not overcome it, the enemy will not analyze their weak points as a detective, because they will build a giant battle robot to defeat them. Sometimes this show does not even feel a show of Batman, it's just another non-animated anime, but it's not a no-brain fight. <br /> <br /> What is most hateful about this show for those who have been criminals. They have removed everything that turns into an exciting and corrective and has become the evil evil stereotypical. Man-Bat is one of the greatest examples. In comics, tragic scientist learns to heal his healing. When experimenting with himself, he suddenly becomes a giant bat. In this show, a crazy scientist will be transformed intentionally, a fanciful being, without apparent reason. They are all about all criminals; None of them are, except one or two, their crimes have real grounds. <br /> <br /> Mr. Freezing In the comics, Freezing scientist was merely a mad scientist Paul Dini, until he wrote the episode of "Heart of Ice" of BTAS, giving him a new melting origin by giving him a new Freeze source. The episode was so popular and the fans admitted that it was its origin and also used as a comic book. This Batman and Robin movie was also of origin. In this show, Mr. Bitxiloi is a small thief. Before turning freeze Mr. After becoming a freezer, what's up? WE HAVE AID HEAVY STONES! Great origin It is not surprising that they have used more than one created in Dino. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Batman, I do not like this show because comics do not, I also like BTAS, Batman cartoons. then Tim Burton's Batman movies and, of course, Christopher Nolan Batman's great films. None of them were 100% loyal comics, but they were still very good. The problem of this show is not similar to the comic or BTAS, because the other media in Batman is well-known for lacking any depth. <br /> <br /> I've had so many opportunities for this show. , but the more I see it, the more I find that it threatens me. I missed some good times to enjoy playing Batman cartoons.
