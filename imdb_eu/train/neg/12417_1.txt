Any movie that begins with a bachelor's degree in female wizard will not be able to give it much. The stereotyping of the hybrid 50 years ago, I was well and that was not the case. OK, all the kibbutz films featured just a small piece (like they were going through the night kitchen), but you can not show whole kibbutzas of all of them - we will say - malicious features. Each Kibutz had problems, but they did not have almost all the kibbutz. The views of Israel were excellent. I still remember in my youth Emen's garden in Emek (the valley). Yes, and the theater has been good, so it's not black, it's just a bad portrait.
