I've just finished watching Guinea Pig - Devils Experiment. This movie, although I expected to be a good FX, I expected it was better, I did not have a good movie. Honestly I can not say I liked this movie. Of course, shocking, realistic, it's an effective 43 minute torture minute, but I was very boring (and I was not as penetrating as I expected). And also, I found the torturers to be very annoying, when they talked and hardened when they seemed tough at all, they got even worse (and I'm sure there are some who agree that they will agree). I have now seen the Guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and I think one of the best is guinea pigs 2 - flesh and blood flowers. I do not know much more about the Devils experiment, Great FX, the girl's origins, not only annoying torturers, but I generally give 4 stars with a great FX account.
