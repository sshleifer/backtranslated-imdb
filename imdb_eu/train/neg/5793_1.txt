It was really bad. Ben Murphy's "Dirty Dozen" series (which at the same time did not work) was a cheap (although affordable for Yugoslavia), which was cheap (albeit cheap) with Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> I was ashamed. The members of this film, and Telly Savalas in particular. It was an old and fat routine (70 boosts) and John Wayne, who draws parallelism to Greek Telly, and John Wayne, a "Green Guy", summarizes much. > <br /> Other reviewers have emphasized some of the great abilities of this anti-cellulite crime, so I will not repeat it here. But I add that I am surprised that no one has ever mentioned that Savalas looks almost ridiculously dressed with his big head. <br /> <br /> I'm also surprised by a workout of a movie 4.7. As big as score in the IMDb. <br /> <br /> Regarding me, "1 is". "all over the table. If you want a good example of a killing franchise, why not sharpen a good example (especially after the original 20 years and over) - do not look at" The Dirty Dozen - Fatal Mission. "<br /> <br /> Awful - Avoid! !!!
