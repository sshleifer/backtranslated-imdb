Yesterday I watched the movie. I must admit, there was no tea cup. Even though it is supposed to be a horror movie. But when I was seeing this, I was thinking ... 'This movie does not make any sense.' Where did this type of dark jacket come from? Where did the girls go when they left behind? Where did a shark come from? <br /> <br /> They did not create any of the elements in this film. I felt that filmmakers had lost so much time and money in a movie I thought. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of great horror movies in my time, but one of them is the worst horror movie I've ever seen. When I finished the movie, I told myself I would not think again. So much movie in this show, I've decided to give thumbnails! Tell this! From 0 to 10!
