I can not honestly believe in entertainment. Death (and laughs with death), stereotyped jokes that lose violence, sexual assault, adult children, skin, abuse of minors, robbery, dysfunctional parents, childhood hell, African Americans, police and people. The house in the middle of the night - yes, I'm sure sounds like children's movies ... NO! Add this to dark and scary elements - a dead woman enters and turns into a house and keeps her husband in love with prisoners for more than 20 years and fears a whole neighborhood. Parents - this is really what you want to watch for your children - this is what you want to teach about life! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < As for adults, you will not find it terrifying or fun, just boring, predictable and predictable. And the characters are wrong - white parents, ignorant police, stupid and annoying friends, malicious and manipulative babysitters, and peasants who drink beer. What kind of wonderful material does it look like for kids' films? Computer animation and good voice are not enough to free this movie. Save your money, save your time, and save your children's intelligence - rent Ice Age, Monsters Inc., Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life. The best way for them is this movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis: it bothers you both, such as disaster, and then the bill as a child / family movie!
