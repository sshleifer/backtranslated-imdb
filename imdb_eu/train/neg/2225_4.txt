I can not honestly understand why this film is so valued, nor why Bakshi thought he was the best of his films. I'm a fan of Bakshi's first work - especially 'Heavy Traffic' and 'Wizards', but it's actually the best movie that made 'Wizards' (1977). He then returned to the mainstream with the name of the "Lord of the Rings" and the fray Frank Frazetta with the sword and sorcery heavyweight named "Fire and Ice". <br /> <br /> What can I say? The story is puerile, animation is a television quality - it's much worse than the 70's - and "Wizards" had real imagination, curiosity, beautiful backgrounds and underground sensation "snake and ice". Designed for 14 year old boys, it has a generous Robinson Crusoe on Mars. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you like the likes of Gor, you would like this. In my opinion, however, it was one of the quality jokes, "The Wizard", when Bakshi ever recovered (although recently he has done some things for television) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > 4.5
