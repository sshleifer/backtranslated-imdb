This is the worst film Clark Gable. Parnell was only worse. It's so rugged and the conversation is so bad that Gable and Jean Harlow do not have to be proud of anything that should be. <br /> <br /> Gables, while illegal activities go their little girl. slammer (like gangster talk?). He will make us hope that he will be correct, but he will leave there, one of which is unknown, as "family". In the end, it becomes a rogue who works well and, in some ways, they all come together in a happy ending! It seems that Gable had to take the rapa and forget about it for many years. Leonard Maltin says "the stars are good here." Which standards? The best way to welcome laughter? Like it! <br /> <br /> PS - After saying this, my wife thinks about Leonard Maltin as he is looking for me and will throw myself in. Hmmm. However, despite my comments, I think that Mr. Maltin is the planet's reviewer and the best man (I hope that has made him relaxed). <br /> <br /> Update - 2/2/08. As I did not like this movie for the first time (especially ridiculous), I decided to see it again. After all, sometimes I watch a movie again, I like it much more and I realize it was a little bit hard. Over the last few months, it has taken place in several films, I still do not like this movie - the second time. There was mostly no movie in the first part. In the first half Harlow was amazing, but at least credible. When they were sent to jail, all the clich√©s came to the end of the hilarious wedding. The basic line is that this sequence is shameless, that is, it does not make sense and turns it into a fairy tale movie, instead of a love story about two bad ones. I'm in the front of the original review (though "NOT ALL SUPPORTED"), and I think PARLIN and POLLY-KIRKAN, Gable may be the worst movie.
