Initially this Pia Zadora vehicle follows the well-known formula of Harold Robbins: the main and ambitious character, overcomes the decline, following the path chosen by the randomly chosen but glamorous world, in this case the film industry. Although this is a pre-eminent one, this movie is at the same time incredible. Zadora (as an actress, the charity is not to be inexperienced) will never be convinced as a screenwriter. A movie movie was expected to have some insights on its industry and creative process. But scriptwriters also do not give the writer the characteristics that characterize the characters: respect, ability, love and hatred of words with their own creative abilities. His character is pure. Here is the flavor of the disability that appears here. Cinematography is so dark, sometimes it's hard to see what happens. And the scene never leaves together, so it seems that in Hollywood's worst episodes it's a series of random moments. Avoid.
