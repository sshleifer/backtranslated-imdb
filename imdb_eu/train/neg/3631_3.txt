Parsifal is definitely not an opera that everyone likes, even though I like the Knappertsbusch (1951), especially. Syberber's approach is very static. Suddenly when music starts to wave ... Syberberg keeps at the same speed. Amfortas and Klingsor take the endless ones. What was the Festival edition? The result is physically tiring to see. The viewer is not transported spiritually. Your impulse to run home and record again is to confirm that Wagner should understand it correctly. Syberberg was wrong. And with those reminders of "intelligent" anti-Semitism in Wagner: will it ever be a spectator of this movie that has no prior knowledge of Wagner?
