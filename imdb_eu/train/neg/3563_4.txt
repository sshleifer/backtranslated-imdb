In most cases, the movie feels like a television effort. The direction is made with ham, the performance (except Fred Gwynne) is superabundant and soap. Denise Crosby delivers, above all, her own lines, as it does from the cold reading. Only one thing is seen in this movie, which is when Gage "Semitario" returns. Something is worrying about seeing someone who kills children, and some of them can only handle it for that reason. It is totally coolant. This movie does just one thing, but that thing goes out of the park. Only 10 minutes ago.
