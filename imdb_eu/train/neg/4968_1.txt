In Grendel, I expected the movie written by John Gardner at the end of the 1970s. Beowulf was based on the epic, but from the monster's point of view. <br /> <br /> However, if you think about Gardner's book, Beowulf's epic movie does not have to be called Grendel, when it does not tell CG the monster's pathetic scenes. It's only shown as a modifier predator mode. <br /> <br /> In addition, writers help to make the story so badly mislead and to the ongoing ignorance of public mass media in the US. <br /> <br /> <br /> Typical Hollywood is so bad <br /> <br /> Very disappointing and losing time.
