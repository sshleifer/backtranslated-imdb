"Laugh, Clown Laugh" was premiered in 1928, as the legendary Lon Chaney, the star clown of Tito. She is a beautiful young Loretta Young, named Simonetta. Tito, a lifelong girl, has lifted up a dancer. While Chaney gives his regular performance, I could not overtake Tito, now middle-aged, with Simonetta's youth sections. Although he is not a biological father, he has been raised as a daughter. This "Ick" factor occurs during the film. Tito Simonetta's fascination with young and beautiful Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetto clearly falls to the young man, but feels the fault he feels in Tito (loyalty, not romantic love). The premise of the movie is ridiculous and I find it surprising that nobody in the movie tells Tito how stupid an idiot fool is (until it finally reveals). The film only stands out with Loretta Young, who has a great career. As Chaney's brilliance acts as an actor, the whole movie seems to me to be terribly terrifying.
