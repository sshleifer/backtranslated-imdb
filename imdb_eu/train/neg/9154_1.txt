THE. Worst FILM. Never MADE <br /> <br /> After seeing this supposedly gay movie, I suspect that somebody neonazi blinded blind blindness and could ever do the worst gay film, all in an attempt to attack gay culture in some illusions. . I stopped the movie and called for a friend, when someone was not sure about me when I stopped the movie, I was surprised at how frankly, credible and plagued. <br /> <br /> In addition to all, great writing and play, illogical and stupid drawings, his own bad film. His tail could be better with dogs with a handycam attached. <br /> <br /> Seriously, after reading a few positive reviews in the movie, I suspect the writer has to have a dozen and a half IMDb accounts. This movie can be understood as something other than a joke, it pays a lie or much to say that.
