If the team behind the "Zombie Chronicles" has ever read, here are some tips: <br /> <br /> 1. In a "Twist Ending" type, it's not a good idea to include short films that are included in the initial credits. That twists them, do you know ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know you have produced this and, to be fair, you have done miracles with your budget, but please hire people to really act. Or, at least, walk, talk and gestures at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking for you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you put part of your movie in the past, do this only if you have costumes and costumes of that time. <br /> <br /> 4. Twist ends is a surprise. Of course, we do not want to make sense conversion, but as soon as the signing "reveals" a character? That is not an excellent idea. <br /> <br /> They like to help the boys, but I would honestly would not prefer ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Only for zombies supplements.
