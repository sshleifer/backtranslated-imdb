After leaving first, you think that wayans brothers can create some new jokes. Even though I do not think so. If the first one is bad enough, this one is so badly seen. With all the actors that featured this movie, you think that something could be clearer. Although they could not, the first rumors were not fun, and, in some way, they went into this movie to think that people laughed again. The thing is, though I did not laugh for the first time. These films tried to create parodies, although they failed at all levels. Most often they are just randomized jokes, which are so keen and demanding, and that it is difficult to see and enjoy it. Then, when they try to make the scenes of parody movies, they make a 20 minute scene recreation, but a joke in the whole scene. Also, I enter into the age ranges that people should like to be fun for older and older people. While many people say that they have different ideas that are fun or not, if you find it fun, you're probably not one of the most mature or intelligent people in the area. It's not like that handwriting skill, even if you want a clearer and more entertaining film, watch the Spaceballs movie. A really good and well-off movie is a parody and it does not have to use fun and nasty jokes to make it fun too.
