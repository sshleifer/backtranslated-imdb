From Shrek creators ... OK, that caught my attention. <br /> <br /> The creators of Ondo Shrek made the Madagascan. Madagascar has just as good as half as Shrek. <br /> <br /> Now, Flushed Away is just as good as half Madagascar. Animations and special effects were very good, but there were no movies. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie was only for children. It's really hard for adults to love this movie. <br /> <br /> But there were many jokes for adults. In my opinion, jokes understand that children <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am totally disappointed. 4/10
