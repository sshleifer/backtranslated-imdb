Without a doubt, Rajnikanth is the worst movie ever. The first part is maintained with a solid Goundamani comedy, but is progressively worse and worse and is totally illogical. Our hero also punches Saints (Baba) in the same name. In the first half, Rajni describes his usual lines and styles, and in the second half, he became a saint, a beginner will be led through an interdimensional portal of the Himalayas, where Babaji (formerly no famous St. Nicholas) would have special powers without apparent reason not only karma). This is really interesting now, is not it? <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie, which casts its magic and powers, and is fighting against those politicians and black magic. Frequent urge to set ridicule. Oh, and black magic has never worked for our hero, Param Virts just happened ... with him Shakti Chakra. Bad guys and ordinary political criminals are topical, overworked and ultimately totally insignificant because they are not going where they are going. <br /> <br /> But despite all the mistakes, it's been fun to kill time with Baba and hate public events. It's really fun to watch other people cheat about this movie. AR Rehman has composed tracks for his films with his mobile phone. That is what he considered important. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rajni is very popular in Japan, and has two characters (one of which is called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) This film is a Japanese origin. for the sake of it. But the way they are portrayed, dressed and treated is completely pathetic. The Japanese can not see Rajni movies after seeing it. This film was a promotional material for the inclusion of Rajni, but the film's results would kill all of their political dreams. <br /> <br /> Fun if you turn off your brain.
