I do not plan to find out about the plot synopsis to find out what the movie is about, and yet there are no plots. I have seen several reviewers of an ISOYG 'anti-rape' movie or even a feminist expression, and I'm just talking about cheerful hypocrisy of these claims. <br /> <br /> First, what did we see on the cover of this movie? It's true: behind a shapely woman. It was an attempt to make a rape against Zarchi, whether or not I was totally unaware of it. The film markets sex marketing and the degree of sexual assault, and the material is so graphic (it shows all real penetration, but it's not the best crowd for anyone to use) <br /> <br /> Rape (s)) uncomfortable, rough and watchable in the movie it is difficult. An enormous crime can be said, something like a brutal light, but this scene does not seem to last for 30 minutes. The character's victim was short-lived and only one of the rapes was developed (only moments are dying), so the scene is not emotional. Actually, it's just about to show off the extremes of sexual violence, and we can say that it's movies related to the ISOYG IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) when it attracts only the exploitation crowd. <br /> <br /> Finally, some reviewers recommend that Zarchi documentary style and soundtrack be missing. But considering how to put things in every other movie (promotion, script, etc.) I suspect that it was a financial decision and it seems that a documentary film, literally, had a camera and that its actor porn would do the same. <Br> <br /> I will not affect my horse with the content of the ISOYG. I like all exploitation / fear and video games. In fact, this movie gives me three stars, which only goes much further than with other films. However, it is wrong and, after rape, the rest of the film is very boring, we see a bunch of ho-hum and, above all, we are going to have to kill less and wait until they have been released. <br /> <br /> This is surely worth the wait to see if you are a fan of the exploitation of the 70's, but if you tell me, the movie is pretty bad and it's not really worthy of popularity.
