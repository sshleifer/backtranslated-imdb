Look, face up, there is a much better portrait of American blackheads. Although this story seems to be weak, my criticism is based on the weak performance of the story, as I mentioned, blows. <br /> <br /> This was done in the mid-80's and there is a great musical / scoring section. It's fun to see Oprah's latest crack-whore type. <br /> <br /> The bigger scenery makes Elizabeth McGovern a scrub on incense. Pure classic cinema First of all, I do not like being drunk when you react to a 1200 degree burnout (it does not matter if your performance is bad). That scene was really awake ... it was comedic. I tell you, however, I had great satisfaction in seeing Elizabeth McGovern smoking in a fake death; it hurts me.
