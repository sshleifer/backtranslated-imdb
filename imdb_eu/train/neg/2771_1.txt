The movie has been featured in Bangkok with all the fanfare and theatrical performances, it has failed without any hesitation. <br /> <br /> The story does not seem to contain water. Something was missing. In my opinion, people have to have a reason to see another than the historical image of the past. The accuracy of the story is not when you are looking for entertainment. <br /> <br /> The movie has no substance. The only way to make this movie was, as it were, a modification when it was just a story as if it were a legend. And a legend tries to tell something about the time that people have forgotten something, the main element of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. The main theme is called. <br /> <br /> The movie fails to answer, why did I see anyway? <br /> <br /> At least some mythical curious Flying Elephants, a psychic king or an eccentric king such as "King and I" would be beautiful. movie appeals I think it was not an image of vanilla than a regular movie. <br /> <br /> After getting an appeal, we're going to concentrate on the story. In terms of marketing, we call "see it". After listening to the title of the movie, the people said: "Oh, I have to see it." Now where is the appeal in Kingmaker? Why not redo the title and call it "Being a King"? and make a black comedy from the old days of Siamka "Strangelove Doctor". That would be much more interesting. The storytelling story between the first people's rewards was a very entertaining film. <br /> <br /> Most of today's film has an appeal to "see", such as Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If the characters are not known, among other things, The Island movie asks other calls when advertising asks "Do you still think it is an island?". <br /> <br /> Or to make a movie, "How to NOT be a King", you might ask: "Do you still want to be a King?" <br /> <br /> Parhat
