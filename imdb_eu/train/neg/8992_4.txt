It's a decent effort, but writing the script in the dark seems a little bit about what the zombie movie does. No, it's not CGI bugs and software companies. Actually, I do not know if I had a software company or had no subtitles, so I had to guess what they were doing. However, it was my point: instead of losing time, I got my mumble donkey, why not throw more zombies and throw more action. 2/3 of 20 minute news, mistakes, something false. And in the worse case (more boring), most deaths occur outside the screen. I know that this is quite common for an unlimited movie, but then it has been a spectacular effect (well, what), he asked me why the director (or scriptwriter, at any rate) wanted to focus on the epidemic. - It's short, nobody cares.
