In the end, maybe, lately, I've been running fast with Hindi movies. I asked the video store at Apharan (Prakash Jha), but the new version is still unavailable. So I decided to do that. I have seen the most amazing Hindi movie (and have seen a few). It's not surprising BOILDIAK is a mixer all over the world! If the reviewer has negative ratings, I would give Garam Masala -10. <br /> <br /> I remember watching a TV show in Mumbai about the premiere jazz. All the famous celebrities and their news featured. For some strange reasons, people expect good things in Piyadarashan. I do not like Hulchul, Hungama or his other films. Hulchul, dubbed in Tamil or Telugu, was probably heard on your face, but it was no longer a plus in the Bollywood movie. This last piece by CXXP proved that this guy does not have BRAINS. Who made a director, even a Bollywood director ??? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is now. What starts off as a romantic getaway becomes a nasty wandering woman. A fashion photographer who works in two magazines (is not it similar to No Entry, where 2 men share a gossip magazine and share an office? Kristians are still copying their stories!) Well, no, no It's a chef or chef trying to find one of the dodgers looking for love (ie, multi-fees + multi-time). Eventually what happened, I do not know. I turned off midtown. What a fun junk I can not even believe it. And how prone it turns with its dirty! What were the benefits of the illiterate Indian (700 million final) or the missing NRI PIREN? Yes, it does not matter. It's never a group that creates a good movie, and probably worthy of divine things. <br /> <br /> The review is short, because there's nothing to write about, but a regular rubbish bag. Bollywood should change the name of Follywood. Yes, the review is much better than the movie itself.
