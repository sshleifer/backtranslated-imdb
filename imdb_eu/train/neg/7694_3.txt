Unless twelve years old, the movie really is not worth it. Obviously, B is a low budget movie with actors, and sometimes with a genre of fantasy, sometimes a great CGI job is not good. I know it would be bad when I rented it. I like to laugh at the bad movies. I did not know how bad it was. The reason is, until 2 hour, then it really starts to burn. Styles of combat are fought between the laws of physics and the normal fighting fights. There is no real explanation for the transition. It has a plot, but again, of course, it's a child's movie. It seems that there are explicit moral teachings in the day, such as Sesame Street or something. It's a reason. But if it's much better, say, nine.
