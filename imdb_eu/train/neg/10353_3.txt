I have never read the book "Wrinkle in time". To be honest, do I want to see the movie? Well, I would not have to review this movie when it starts with that. Next I will say that the TV movie is quite unforgettable. You know why I say that? I forgot what happened to me. I forgot To be honest, it's never a better TV movie than "Merlin." <br /> <br /> How can I describe the TV movie? I have never written a review before. Well, I'm saying they're some celebrities. It's only one wrinkle in time. Alfre Woodard (or Woodward, I'm not sure), Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> Film with special effects, a gentle and interesting plot, scenes for "WTF". The movie is very bad and you can go to "WTF". What did I expect? It's a TV movie. They are not good at all. This is. It's a waste of time and a long time. Finally, you'll probably forget that the second one will end. Well maybe the second one is over. But in a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Wrinkled time: * / ****
