This movie is very idiotic. A man wants a vengeance for a crime - but when he's revenged - there's a video camera right on the go all the time. Would he be sitting on the head with a cell and have a long time before a video camera? <br /> <br /> This script can never be dressed except for someone who is not able to dress. It destroyed me ... but it's harder! <br /> <br /> Writers have serious habits for brain cells and can attack an armored plot to drive an armored tank. through <br /> <br /> PARTICLE: A man seeks a vengeance for the deceased's death, but in the center of the plot he will be completely wrong and then unexpected. <br /> <br /> <br /> Only those who wrote this story could not have written completely realistic plots that did not happen to them. I tell the writers: Find out about your serious psychic problem.
