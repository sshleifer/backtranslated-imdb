This movie is so compelling; - The whole premise is bunkum; the series killer (vampires or others) that are not around and can kill as many people as the movie is. Vampire should not look at Bela Lugosi. Most of the plays are wood as wood. Actors soften rot. I'll wait for the sound of a Steven King novel, the day (with Stand by me's exception). This film is borne by most of Stephen King's films - for the "lack of money" "special effects", for the use of bad actors, characterization and immense dialogue. This movie is cheap, evil and fails to do everything.
