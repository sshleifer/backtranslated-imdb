Two old men sitting in the park's chair. I do not really have this problem with this scene - the only problem is that the scene is not a complete movie <br /> <br /> Yup movies do not have a lower concept. In addition, they will not be boring either, but the two older men will come in worse because they are cream and cheese. Nat Moyer, who is a Yiddish communist, and the other is a black medalist with Midge Carter gloves. Let's see now a Jew and a black man sitting in a park bench. Well, I think it's possible, though it's difficult, but this movie does not play this unknown scenario with Jewish stereotypes? Why do you make a bold tribal religion that makes you murmur? The Jews that are beginning to see the film, the Jewish types of Jewish Nazi propaganda films from the 1930s are very ironic. <br /> <br /> I love being stereotyped, I do not have a problem with RAPPAPORT. It's written for a meduim that is completely different than cinema, it is based on theater theater and shows. While Walter Matthau Nat was sleeping through his function, the commentary almost slept in the whole movie
