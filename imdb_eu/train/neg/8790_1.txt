I recently saw the cable and I liked it. Here I read the comments, and it seems that everyone likes them in the second half of the first half. Personally, I liked the first story (the bad thing was not extended). The second story, I thought, was a topic. And "California Dreaming," if I hear it again ... Chungking Express is fine, but it's not something that the main audience will see as "Crouching Tiger."
