First of all, to tell the truth. I did not see all this movie. I watched the first five minutes and when I realized I was almost sleepy, I decided to go ahead and then I would be more interested in seeing ... Not that. This movie is never a story of an unreleased story, it's just a poorly-written collection, and something that would never be said, a horror movie. I think it's important that movies with special effects also feature well. This movie does not sleep and it will only make you sleep if you want to see it. In the end, it's important to say that this movie can be used in public, so that you're sure to be sure of the Internet, I'm going to show you where it's not likely to show you. Cinema Hall
