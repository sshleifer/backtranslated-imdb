Do you ever have a beautiful image in your mind, you thought it would be nice in a movie: like looking at the cracks of a fence in an abandoned house? Or do you see a woman who walks along the street is cold and intense and alert? Yes Imagine the image to stretch the whole movie, you have almost got the idea of ​​Broken, although there is no detective in this movie, I use it as a visual example. But the intense look of women is here, and 99% of the screen time has filled much more. I did not complain about that woman, this is a great opportunity to do this. <br /> <br /> I realize that I am very open to myself, enjoying all kinds of artistic expressions and really enjoying some really Moody stuff. It would be really nice to draw a scene from this movie and hang it on the wall. By this honest, the performance is excellent. I'm seeing some of the cast's facial expressions. <br /> <br /> Now, on the problem of this film. Beyond the mood, there's nothing here. The director basically obsessed an idea and walked over to what he deserved. I do not know if I'm saying a spoiler that obsession is a "mirror". Let's see, this special idea is in a bloody place and that is what the director has done. When given, there are some small arrows and rotate here and there. If you have paid attention, you will not be surprised at all, obviously aware of the holes aside. <br /> <br /> Now, I have not enjoyed collecting bones since most of the time I enjoyed most of the style of art. I still think we must judge the basis of art to express everything that artists want to express. The movie is not a piece of music or a picture, or a painting, or even a poem, and certainly not a fresh image in your head. All this is a good development of stories and characters. I think of Lynch's movie style. It is negligent and inexpensive and a loss of support. We spent two hours with movies for a reason. For this reason, we must judge in a different way instead of judging a single image frame, such as a photo or a painting. <br /> <br /> This movie is not entirely Lynch style, thank God. He has a linear development and finally he concludes. It has no great story or character development. Especially, it was presented with characters of ordinary people, so it moves away from other fantastic things. It does not offer an explanation of the fantasy item, or try to build a coherent world around you. Rarity came from nowhere and apparently isolated and unexpected. Maybe the consistency is on the head of the director, but since I've seen it does not make much effort to realize it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Where did he make his effort then? It seems to have been an effort to build humor and improve music. Music often creates tensions that eventually shame. Only in the final part of the film was scattered and tension was made. <br /> <br /> I finally felt: Okay, I know what you mean, but it's the point you're trying. spend two hours building all these volumes? It does not matter what the characters are and what their lives are. And we provide very little about who the characters are. We put all this together. I'm wrong, but I think the director does not show much work and shows it.
