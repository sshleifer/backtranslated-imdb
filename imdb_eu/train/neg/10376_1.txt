Before I watched this movie, it was given at the Beverly Hills Writers Guild Theater in the previous edition. As I recall, the film producers and directors attended, probably to boost our reaction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes recalled the smile of the audience, though it was a comedy, but it was a horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the spectators were not afraid, they seemed like filmmakers. It was released a year before. I was curious to see if they would cut it again; I think they had not been. The movie was the same lousy, it was just an older year. <br /> <br /> Almost is classified as "bad, good", but it is slow and boring.
