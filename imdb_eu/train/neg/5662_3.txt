When I read it between other comments, I felt it was very bright for this movie. I found that he lost the spark that he found lost in the previous Zatoichi movies and proves that after a long absence of the screen, it is often best to leave things. I was first agreed with the Star Trek analogy because it compared the starter Trek movie to the original series. Eight million enthusiasts excited and waited for awaiting their return. original approach <br /> <br /> Plots are sometimes incomprehensible, they are terribly gory (although Beat Takeshi's ZATOICI NEWS NEWS is much more bloody) and the heart of the original is missing. I do not care about blood, but some of them can be deactivated (especially with clipped nose and hands-cut scenes). In addition, the time has not been good with Ichi. This movie (much more than usual) seems dull and dull - and serial fans might not really want to see it. <br /> <br /> It was a very bad thing from Zatoitik. Except for myself, and if you do not want to see all of Zatoichi's movies, this is very lucrative. See one of the previous versions or the 2003 ALL-NEW version.
