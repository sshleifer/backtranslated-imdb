(First of all, sorry my naughty English). Of course, the only movie that has a relationship with Jessica Simpson may be similar. I am Norway and I felt sorry, and I was surprised by the film's director, not to take the time to study American / Norwegian films. Wikipedia is also more accurate about events in this country. <br /> <br /> So I send my corrections for my frustration: - The country is named Norway, not Norway. - "Da" is Russian, not Norwegian. The Norwegian priests never used these black fabrics with white collar books and the Protestant church is far away. It is true that traditional folk-clothing (only used as a year), but this outfit. The movie is like a German outfit. - I can not understand the name of this movie "norwegian". Jessica did not make any sense ... neighter made "norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> I only know where the Norwegian flag is (and viking hats, but this is very stereotyped by people who think about Norway - vikings !: O gosh. <br /> <br /> Well ... I guess people that made this movie never read this comment, but at least I cleaned some things and removed some of these frustrations! <br /> <br /> My I am proud of the country and I would like to say fewer stereotypical and more specific US people about this country. <br /> <br /> It was all ... Lenge leve Norge!; p
