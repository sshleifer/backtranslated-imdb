Be careful <br /> <br /> No other shit is worth it, because it is underneath! Okay, discard everything, let's say something more meaningful. <br /> <br /> Throughout the whole period of time, I have seen that they have long thought that a new material base has been taken. Wuxia of a novel is very meaningful, as Wong Kar Wai's reputation emerged. Well, despite the WKW, it has not been able to adapt the novel to the screen, according to many Wuxi fans; In particular, water droplets, sweatshirts, are just horse legs, etc. I can not get part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I would like to move forward a lot of years later when I wanted to give it to the lord after listening to many of Wong's films, especially in Cannes. I was fascinated by the latest version of 2046. A friend told me to start with Chungking Express, because his films are available. So wrong! P.o. I was wasting my time and money in this pretentious indolence. Some professional reviewers mentioned in a modern big city, as a meditation on Blah, Blah, Blah, alienation and loneliness. It's good if the director wants something to tell and tell if something happens. But no, it only shows what it is. Faye Wong's performance is a very typical Hong Kong style: a confusing enunciation, an over-the-eye expression in the dark eye, pretty acting and girls; The rest of the pieces are inspired by the same. <br /> <br /> I think, Author, the author is euphemism of a champion of something new and different, who is not acclaimed, but who does not. However, he dominated the art of cinematic theater, that is, Mr. Wong, in the last 17 years!
