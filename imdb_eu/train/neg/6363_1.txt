I still can not see this film and I think it's the first time. <br /> <br /> It was terrifying. I really did not see it at the end. It's good to see boring soap (all soaps are empty). Actors were poor and the story was bad. The person who rated 10/10 did not know what that was about. The script was horrible. 2 People were in an angry conversation, with the threats, and expecting the guy to say really well, but he did not get rid of that. He says "If you do that ... I will hurt" Hahahahaha. If comedy is your thing, see it. Please do not watch this movie ... It's CRAP !!! <br /> <br /> Summary: bad performance, bad fighting, bad script. <br /> <br /> Do not ignore it! Of course, I think.
