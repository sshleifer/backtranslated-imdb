I was waiting for you to wait for the entry of tickets to your hand, I expected an interesting fantasy film of science fiction, in the end, to feed my appetite about robot technologies, but I was disappointed that I was once again aware of it. Effects can not be bored with a boring plot, which is, I think, this year was worse. I'm also sorry for this movie, Will Smith did not show anything new to this movie, but I've never seen his actress change "Men In Black," the only success I had. Until he retired, his name did not damage the "I, Robot" and "Men In Black 2" titles. 4/10
