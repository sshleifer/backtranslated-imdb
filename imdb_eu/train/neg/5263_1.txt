This is the right movie I remember when I remember it. Everything was horrible and was delayed. The performance was horrible. The camera's work was not bad, but that was not yet available. The writer and director of this film has to suffer from underlying syndrome as the film would help her career. I want to return to live half an hour when I see it rough. I prefer to see the video of this herb. I do not know that the IMDb writes 10 lines to post it, but I feel that this movie is so bad, I have to keep telling others about it. The reason behind this movie is that he asked the girlfriend at the local library to be a movie called "Desapariciones" by Kris Kristoferson. I do not know who my fault was in my DVD player, but I feel that someone at least $ 20 had my time, pain and suffering. In the end, they hope that the director and writers of this film will meet on the street better.
