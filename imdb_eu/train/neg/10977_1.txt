I lived in Ottawa where I made this film and I do not want it. This is an incredible movie of God. I really try to protect independent films, but there is no stigma attached to this indie and this stigma is Indie Films Blow. Well, this film does nothing to make this curse flow. The director, director and director Brett Kelly does not support the genre, because it tightens the dark encounters of short films. I am very tired of catching the most threatening and unsuspecting appearance of the evil characters that cover the shadows, it is an excessive reason. <br /> <br /> I remember the whole scene, especially when I remember a scene, because the whole scene has lights of the car. Some people may say that mood and tension is the effect that they used to create, but unfortunately it was a solid budget for this movie. In addition to a movie that is dare to be afraid, the viewer is very interested in finding a real gore, with some syrup and red-hot chocolate. <br /> <br /> The most important thing that drags down this movie is the lack of development and pause, groundbreaking children are being kidnapped and parents must follow this classmate Bonesetter for a certain time. so that their children can return. This concept is not a blame for me, but I really did not find it compelling to find the two main characters to find the ones who have lost their children together. This is not so short a time that it is unthinkable, my first priority was to get her daughter back and know at least a lady before she had done it. <br /> <br /> It's the last point ... and I do not keep Kelly against it, but the movie is shot in a boring and emotional video, and it takes away the moments it really takes away. style would give the movie. If this movie was a million-dollar make-up and if history was recovered and it was a boring mistake, everything could not be preserved. I hope that something happened to Brett Kelly to avoid a sequel published on her website, a semi-sealed sitcom in a seat. <br /> <br /> Lord help us.
