I watched this movie a preview of Matthew Barney's art exhibit. He has definitely prepared me. I almost jumped the exhibition and, with retrospect, I would probably have to. As well as having a great score (Bjork) and a rich and colorful photography, the content was tedious and predictable. Yes, I really needed pearls to find out what someone's pearl-divers are. The film was mainly a mixture of Japanese cultural references and modern whale-fishing technology. The "peaks" movie has enough free shock art to turn your stomach. <br /> <br /> What was the movie? Others may think it's a piece of whale, but it justifies the whale's encouragement. Personally, Barney told me he was "blinking" among audiences, through anal, fecal, auto-cuts, and cannibalistic fetish. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Unless you really do not know Barney's art, I do not see this movie. The message is obscure, slow pace and cultural references slowly. When you were a shock-art, it's best for you to capture one of the "dead" movies or an old copy of Hustler and bring cartoons.
