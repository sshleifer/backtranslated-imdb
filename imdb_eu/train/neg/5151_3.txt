I thought it was a wonderful idea, but the boy was badly executed. We achieve a broad spectrum of complex and challenging operations in the back of a show, but no detail works. Producers may not find a way to tell a story or give the viewer "hairline". (This does not mean trying to say, but having scenarios adds to the Ring Ring cycle synopsis because the program's narratives do not work to work physically in the operating part.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We are seeing a lot of things, but few are told what people are doing and why. There is no sense in who it is, or how productive departments adapt and how they work. For example, we hear several times, in a way, a problem: nobody expects the problem and its consequences and / or how to fix it. But, instead, filmmakers generally have nothing else to do with cutting off (in general, people who are pushing people or footage of people who speak with headphones). <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is like a pastiche of images. watch it run under a show credits, rather than seeing something worthwhile.
