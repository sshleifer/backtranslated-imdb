great mystery, but the movie goes down. At the beginning, car disaster and the woman and daughter are burning alive, in front of a policeman Edward. This is traumatized and covers tablets. A mysterious letter appears asking for the help of an old girlfriend, to find her daughter. So Ed, especially a woman's island, travels. They do not like the outside. Many fills show Ed to look for girls around town. This made the movie too long. In the end, we find it a little better at the end of the ruthless ritual given by women and, finally, when we learn about the evil plan saved in Edward. <br /> <br /> In general, not well-written story and too long. <br /> <br /> LAST MINUTE: I'd skip this.
