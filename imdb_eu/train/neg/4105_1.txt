Another one that can be bad. Otherwise, it would be zero easy. One of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact, because Peckenpah did not ever think of him. Actually, I know that there was a lot of people in San Francisco and when he almost totally destroyed, he said that it was ordinary. It shows pikes. In the first part of the film, the horny thing is the only thing that deserves a second look. Gig Young was not seen. This is the real test of masochism. I was forced to scream in the limits of theater. And now, I really feel guilty, I saw everything that I saw was very nice from the limits of a comfortable sofa. What a mess, the less it seemed to have formed as they went. It's a bomb, but it's not a delay in a bmob. Yikes !!!!!
