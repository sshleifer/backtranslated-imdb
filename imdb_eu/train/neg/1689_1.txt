Wow, what a total! People think this movie is terrifying. Special effects were the direct violation of "Ring". Story Is there any one? It does not seem to me ... It's just a bunch of bright images. The whole movie was boring, stupid, confusing. I think there are always bad movies with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror movie I've ever seen this year. And that Buffy Chick? Well, it's a bad actress! As plastic and talented as Barbie ... No, wait, Barbie's talent would be an insult! I think they had contributed a lot of booklets in the box office box as it was in the PG-13, and if R was named, the IMO would bomb it! Stupid movie!
