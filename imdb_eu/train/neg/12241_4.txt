This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) without the story teller. When handling Ralphie's situation, Christopher has said he has heard in Pie-O-My's death in the incident. This is an important detail, because in this context it is quite obvious that Christopher knows from the beginning that Ralphie should die. However, there is no way Chris can report the accident. Who told him and when? When Tony called it, no one else was aware of it. Tony knows that, even worse! For this reason, when Christopher spoke about Pie-O-Myen's death, Tony would only bring Chrisk into a fire. As writers have said in the DVD, in light of the surprising process written by the writers, I do not think anyone knows the problem. The story does not work that way. It's not necessary to add Sopranos as a fan. Otherwise, I would definitely not mind.
