This movie is not just. Loss of time and money. Jokes are foreseen, characters are so topical and do not talk more fun about RPG gamers. The problem is that writers do not know how an RPG game works and, more importantly, how to make jokes about this game. Of course, the group of losers that play the RPG is like all retired and losing players. But it's not fun for me to joke about this game. The story does not make any sense. Who takes care of the game being played? The main problem of this film is that writers and actors did not try to try to joke about RPG. I saw a shame ashamed.
