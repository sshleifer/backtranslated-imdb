I would like to give this Propaganda film 6 or 7, because it shows how and how a propaganda movie is. If people see this piece, "well, they should do something that Jews should do to deal with in the WW2", then the movie is very well done to "hide and seek" and how fake people watch live. What is a more propaganda film? Here is a section that includes the American film about the Rothschild family, which is very hard here, for example. The Jewish official is never asking why the Jew maintains it. No one refers to the fiscal system within social layers. <br /> <br /> In addition, the level of excitement (or level of dissatisfaction) in the movie slowly increases and is similar to the costume of film clothing. goals and goals for propaganda. The audience will be happy and grateful for the coming moments ... well done. <br /> <br /> A kind of simplicity responds to the emotional perceptual perception of the audience in the film. The movie is like today's story, so it's not much more about it. However, in this simplicity of ethnic degradation, the caregiver may very carefully find today's cultural hate, violence, lack of dignity and integration problems. Overall, good rude.
