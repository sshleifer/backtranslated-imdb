I was one of those "little Americans" who grew up with all the wonderful creations of Gerry Andersen. Thunderbirds was a great series of the time, and writers who could make an action / adventure movie would only approach where they should approach. <br /> <br /> I expected a break, but I did. Do not expect to be targeted at that small age group. As in the lost space, this may be visually stunning and exciting. More action / adventure and the original series was aimed ... people faced with no problem. <br /> <br /> Instead of keeping Alan for the day instead of his brothers (who also threw them). nevertheless, the young person from the original). Lady Penelope and Parker were part. I did not like the original characters, but I thanked the movie. The show has stolen! <br /> <br /> Thunderbirds always enjoyed high-tech stories with stories, and even more, this did not have enough screen time for me. I would like to see the most beautiful gadgets that I would like. <br /> <br /> But then I'm a big girl ...;)
