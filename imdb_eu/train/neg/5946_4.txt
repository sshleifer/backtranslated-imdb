There's no plot in this movie ... no character development ... no climate ... nothing. But there are some pretty good fighting scenes. So, go on ... the overall movie is pretty bad, but if you want a movie without a movie that offers only the scene of good action, watch this movie. Do not expect anything more.Decent actor and not so bad directions ... Kimbo and Carano two cameo cameras ... I wanted to see Carano a bit more in this movie ... it's a good fighter. and the girl is really hot ... White is a great martial artist and a decent actor. I really hope that in the future we will be able to get a better film, so we can really enjoy her art ... White and Jaa together imagine a movie ... that would be wonderful
