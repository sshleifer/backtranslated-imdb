After listening a lot about the Cracker series in the 1990s, without seeing any of them, I look forward to this. Certainly, the combination between Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane can not go wrong. How bad I was! <br /> <br /> Polemics, often driven by repetitive and violent impulses, were very important. The production wanted to be supermodern, but the bright boxes and the sharp letter of the child were also angry. Robbie Coltrane slept for two hours without explanation or explanation and took police as an idiot in a single dimension. As a result, the ever-created tension and the latest scene (horror details of disasters) have been a laughing piece of television drama for a long time. <br /> <br /> No, I do not want to see more of them, but I will return to the DVDs of the 1990s to find out what they are doing.
