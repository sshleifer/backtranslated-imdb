I have a copy of the head, I think (television) must play every year in the next twenty years. So we do not have to forget about what it is and do not make the same mistake again. Some people like to put on the chair of the chair, where they are not. This Rappin 'movie is like the vaudevillian music, for whom he can not sing or act. This movie is just as fun as teaching a "blind" city bus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> John Hood (Peebles) has just been released from prison and has returned to the old quarter. Instead of serving time for general criminal offense, of course. Johnk returns to the old town and children dancing and singing dog dogs and their homemade peers. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this if it were a feeling or a truth. someone threw out medicines prescribed by glaucoma doctor. Anyway, it's a misguided, scriptwriter, staged and even produced (I never thought that was said) with the satirical life of the ghettos 'Hood'. However, I think it's an amortizing part of the story, by means of gang gangs and dancing numbers, they want their friends to care for their neighbors and not get rid of the ghetto and clean it. <br /> <br /> Forget Sonny spoon, Mario can win for this Oscar for Rap. Well, if you want to laugh at yourself and be ashamed of three quarters, first drink it. <br /> <br /> And please see it in a diligent way. (There is no star, the next good luck!)
