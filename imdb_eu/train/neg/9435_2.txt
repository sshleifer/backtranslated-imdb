Never heard of it I mentioned to my local DVD rental owner; Being a horror movie in the 1980s was banned from the United States, I decided to watch it. The film turned around, looked like an amateur and ugly. Sound recording is so bad that half the time of the interview is incomprehensible, but it's a new meaning in the play! <br /> <br /> Even worse, the movie continues tired of a trio of a teenager who participates in an accident and protects him from a dysfunctional family living in a remote environment. Soon, a little girl looks for help and is not heard again; Another one, still buried, is quickly extracted (after most of the time spent forgotten). The heroine interacts with the three residents that live in the home: a stingray of a dreamed mother of the Bible (the word is obviously excessive), her suppressed daughter (and suffering), and this strange brother that appears from time to time. the scene to save the guests from sleeping. <br /> <br /> The mother often hate her, often as a reminder of the table (as a means of dying love, as a backwash) and always becomes a challenge for a daughter-in-law, the film takes a sleeve; The end of the tour is as charming as it is unexpected, but it does not stop the bad taste in the film. just like a temporary gore or about 80 minutes to avoid wasting any feeling ...
