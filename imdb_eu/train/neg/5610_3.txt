This documentary starts with an interesting premise - it makes a credible and conventional argument that Jesus' belief is probably a myth. Unfortunately, however, after accelerating this, the movie changes the gears completely and becomes more than an unstoppable attack against Christianity and easily targets the goals. <br /> <br /> The writer / director clearly has certain church issues (he is a former Christian evangelist and a fierce anger) and this film is his notice. It would be interesting to see the first 20 minutes deployed, but in general, the movie is disappointed.
