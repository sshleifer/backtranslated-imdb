I scored a low score on 'Kôh tikô', because it was a bad movie, but it did not do anything to praise it. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a piece of work by Hsiao-hsien Hour previously, but it is not announced as a homage to those who do not (including myself), 'Kôhî jikô', Yasujiro Ozu. (The last film was a Japanese director in 1962). The movie is a very profound work ... with little dialogue, story, music or emotions. unemployed, a wandering character, who spends his time in the local cafe, or a Taiwanese composer who does not like him. Tadanobu Asano works with her partner, works in a cd store, and occasionally otaku interests drives trains. That's all. <br /> <br /> Yokok sees that he takes only coffee ... he walks around ... waiting for the train ... he takes the train ... he is sleeping on the train. The reality seen by Japanese people every day. Hou has the usual moments of the life of these characters, but curiosity is a non-meaningless film that can be done or viewed without any meaning.
