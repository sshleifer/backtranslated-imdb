Live! Yes, but not oppress it. <br /> <br /> The real story: some time ago, a Dutch television channel announced that they would broadcast a new reality show. It's just a contest. The main participant in this show would be a woman who is dying and killing her kidneys with progressive kidney failure. Really <br /> <br /> The country and the international media were similar throughout the story, like a fly like bones, saying that it was immensely, immoral, what-that-world-like and something similar. . Somehow, I had to be in agreement. <br /> <br /> As the months went by, the tension was built on the problem that the government could not let go of this concept or not. Instead of running the country. <br /> <br /> The show made the air and progressed to the last minute. And until the last moment, the country was in arms, the Prime Minister made talks, all the newspapers about it, all the countries breathed. Network was pushed. Towards a new TV set. And they definitely got it. They pushed the letter. <br /> <br /> We saw that the show appeared and selected the suitable candidates that we received from the kidneys, while selecting the patient's life, shortly after he died. <br /> <br /> And then, the last moment of the show revealed that the hoax was partial. The woman was not ill, but all were candidates. There was no kidney auction. The entire exhibition, with advertising and ads, and with all the discussions with all the great months, was an advertising circuit that was helpful to the organ donors to address the big shortage problem. The man who created this specific network died of kidney disease. <br /> <br /> Now, this is TV. We will leave them all surprised. <br /> <br /> Do not direct me to a badly-interpreted bad movie about a woman trying to get a Russian show in Russian roulette. <br /> <br /> As if. <br /> <br /> * I think they will get through Spoiler * FCC. In my opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court would be the basis for free expression. I think it's an end to the wandering up of women, and it's an endless issue of conscience, because one guy shot in the air. <br /> <br /> Previously done. Watch Running Man with Arnold instead. At least, it was a good end. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * Films are dirty and ridiculous. So, in the end, he filmed, this is supposed to go on the movie to let the public feel better because we left the theater because it is a kind of justice? Do not give it a word, but I would say this: leave this alone and see a test model, you will get a better quality.
