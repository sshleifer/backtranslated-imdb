This film has only been 10 minutes. I mean that there is only 10 minutes worth of content in this thing (even if it is questionable to call a movie). The initial credits of the film were a bit more promising. As the movies begin to make short comments of the man himself, he rubs his hands and follows the footage of Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave works wisely with one of Cohen's most famous songs. Cave's performance is a bit longer with Cohen, and she likes to hear even more spoken words. On the contrary, Cave's performance is only a start-up to the very beginning of performances that can be boring, literally, among those who do not have little religion to keep in your seat. What does the filmmaker really mean? Five-minute plan shots can be in a fake Austrian concert !!! What the filmmaker thinks is that he really insults the audiences by endless increase of "fake applause". The movie is a perfect torture, showing what little you can see. There's no footage in Cohen's past. Actually, except for some of his first days, there's nothing like a singer / poet! If you add all the minutes that Cohen speaks, it may not even reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are gradually being introduced gradually, inadequate camera work, which attracts people from the Cohen letters. If you want to waste your money in this movie, DO NOT! throw it in the trash and save at least your time.
