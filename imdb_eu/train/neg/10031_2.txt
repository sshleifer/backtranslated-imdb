I watched the movie in the theater. We have to talk about the movies very well. The beauty of Kareen and some songs can be. That's it. The movie is a gap in all areas. Any disappointing film related, even Mumbai Indians (now comes to the semi final in Chennai). <br /> <br /> But the worst thing I feel about the movie is the action scenes. Now Bollywood is trying to copy Hollywood's action scene. But the Hollywood director seems to have a great effect. But sadly, the Bollywood manager has no time. They spend time on the songs and advertising of the movies. The current stupid action areas will run south to see the viewer's favorite actor who kills their favorite people. In Bollywood, this will not work. I sent all the scenes of action I wanted. In the end, although some Chinese have not appeared anywhere to defeat Akshay Kumar. This is the height of stupidity. The spectator does not pay to see that stupidity. I think Bollywood's action movies need to be forgotten. They can not do The last good things I saw was "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi". Bollywood's current scenes are very enjoyable for lovers of action like me. Does the movie have finished? Could they not think that acts of slow movements (ropes) are not realistic and children? If you do not have an action scenario better if you have not managed it. I wanted to return to Amitabh, where movies like Zanjeer and Deewar had an exciting action scene. The sound effect is not very effective these days, but the visuals are far better than today's scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie should open the eyes of Bollywood film directors. Please do not make any action movies until you get art to become realistic.
