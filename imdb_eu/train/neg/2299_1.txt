Before I started, I said to God I fully believe them. I believe in heaven and hell. Kay, now, there is no way, I would like to say what they think they do these morons that are "hosts" in the world? The last host I have reviewed does not discriminate, it has fired television hats, or tries to lower their beliefs into all the unhappy souls that go into the channel. Every day, Fred Lover's lover Pat Robertson's crazy, stupid, conservative and vibrant fall. I'm all talking about conversations, but when it comes to saying that when a man who is terribly stupidly dares his life, he will soon send you to hell? This is an excellent example of why religion is causing many problems. One day we had a classroom teacher in my classroom, so we decided to watch some TV because the teachers did not work. And (against many of us) we saw the 700 Club and, of course, that Pat was about ranting and raving about the Bible, and Simon said "God says Homosexuality is sin," and I really heard a child. go "I think Hmm is correct". WTF ??? Actually, if the host tries to think that people's orientation on someone else's horror is a serious mistake, they will need to take this host seriously, they will be pushed behind a tube ribbons and a cruise deck.
