I liked the first movie, but in the drawing board is the text book of a left tracking. The first movie was a general idea, but it's not very interesting. This sequence tries to create the ideas and characters of the first film, and yet Christopher Walken is still as good as Gabriel, the idea is suddenly quite ridiculous. If you have not seen one of these films, get the first movie and forget about it, they take away all the joy of the original.
