As mentioned, this formula has been filmed several times ago, recently called "You Mail Got", with Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" with Ryan. From multiple versions, this is my favorite. In my opinion, it strikes Estudio's star charism, which is not quite cut here. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between two outputs never boils in the movie. No real spark. Van Johnson and Judy Garland reminded me of the donuts of the day, nice but simple. And when the bearers get bored, the rest of the films will only be able to continue. Judy is particularly disappointed. It does not seem like a neck! I do not know if he had any trouble or pain, but he's trying to penetrate a turtle, all screwed up and everything. I could not tell Van Johnson what he was to get so hot. As for the violinist, I would like to make a bee line. And Van was not great. I always thought Hollywood Director General and does nothing to get rid of this picture here. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of stars or in the early 1900's you're probably like this movie. There are many more entertaining romantic comedies that offer you much more than delight.
