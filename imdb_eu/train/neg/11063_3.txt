I inform you that you are far from being a biographical movie based on the real story of the grotesque killer Dahmer. "Dahmer" refuses more about mentality focused on her subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who kills more than 15 men and kills some of their bodies, is likely to be the worst killer of our generation series. However, being real beings are filmmakers of this incredible show, before deciding what to do with the terrific "dahm" project that they should look into. This is not an easy digestive short film, although Jeffrey could easily digest "brainsadillas" with some baskets or real life. Potato skates'. * Failure
