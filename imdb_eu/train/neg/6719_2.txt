It's a great idea for a movie, but unfortunately it's not a great movie. Fluffee falls in love with Fluffer as a romantic, sweet and almost goofy comedy about a love that begins with a bizarre combination of genres and raw roots, with BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA, and LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK with loans. , and even at the end of 400 BLOWS throw a strange "weird". (At least the director has done his research!) The result is not necessarily boring, but in the end, this sharp and well-produced film adds nothing. However, the actors make a play with the material, and there are some great laughs in the background of gay porn. <br /> <br /> <br />
