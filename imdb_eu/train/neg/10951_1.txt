I do not know what idiots did the movie A movie by Palm D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1999! Actually, I saw the whole thing, I could not believe that someone would make the movie blank. The painting is nothing interesting, the characters are profound and there is no attempt to make any atmosphere with music or sound effects. Also, if you decide to lose 2 hours of your life, be sure to bring something to it, because cinematography has a camera camera and you can not even bring someone who is half-time. see the main topics. This style is successfully used in films like "Blair Witch" because it creates suspense. In Rosetton, there is no plot and there is no suspension. Tomorrow, at 2:00 AM, I'd better know it would be horrible.
