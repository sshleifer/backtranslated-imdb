I hung through this movie. First of all, the plot of land has nothing to do with the story of Parson. Hollywood has tried to create a cartoon movie car. Imagine "Englebert Sings Hendrix". <br /> <br /> Do not have anything specific about this film. The title Parsons and his body robbery is used as a springboard for low-budget films to get a few Parsons legacy and his hobby budgets. Gramen's father was dead in 1973 and other general characters were fictional. This has nothing to do with Grams' life or death. watch this movie I did not want to. Something of sorrow is peculiarly shy as it is shy. I heard Grame playing in the movie as I was able to listen to his grave. If you do not know about Gram's life and heritage, do not take anything in Gram for the movie. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough bad stuff about this movie. If the Gram was alive and saw the movie, it would kill itself. Once again, he might have been afraid that he would have a movie.
