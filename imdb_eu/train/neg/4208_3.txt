A real movie is hidden under the layers "Pagemaster". The cheese is hidden under the layers. <br /> <br /> I found that when I saw it again this morning when I saw it later I left it. years old I remember hating hate for the first time, but this time, I noticed that the special effects are quite good. The land "Neverending Story" is just about creativity-endektomy, but it's good for anyone who wants to have wonderful eye candy. The animation is amazing, and I especially like the animator rather than making the characters look more realistic. I'm giving a quarterly grade * I * * I * gave him (just for parody value) when I decided to watch the movie that I intend to completely think of.
