I readily missed the back cover of this DVD movie, Best Buy, about a year ago, and I said: "It seems funny, plus Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose it!" I had to pay $ 15.99 plus tax. I took them to a friend's house and we both were terrified they wrote and acted poorly. Wooden performances are plentiful. All the "ridiculous" and "outstanding" performances were never reached. After 90 minutes, I was ashamed of the head, knowing that I could never get 90 minutes or 15.99 dollars. I literally almost cried, that is, if it was considered "comedy", I did not want to believe in movies. My friend and I continuously informed a friend about knowing that the horrors of this movie were so bad. I saw this holiday season this year, because it did not only want to see it. This was my next great mistake, as I saw I was annoyed. I started shouting at the movie, and I'm not talking in cinema. Everyone who knows who has published this movie has never seen it as the worst. My humor is sick and twitchy and it often burns my friends, but this could not be saved. This movie is not listed on the top 100 of the IMDb. Its assessment (at the time of writing) is a crime against humanity 3.6.
