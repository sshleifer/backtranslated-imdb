"Thriller" is a non-boring, boring and incoherent Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) college student hallucinations and nightmares who is continually claiming a victim's auto accident after her boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck). <br /> <br /> I can not start saying how bad it is ... never happens any importance, nor any real entertainment value. This film did not like me in this movie - it's totally incredible (again, their roles are not good). It's a joke to promote as a horror movie. Where are you afraid? No nonsense or suspense - there are some good songs, but about it. <br /> <br /> How did this earthly project achieve the green light? Writing Director Steve Carpenter has no talent. The worst, as a result, the whole movie is sensible. <br /> <br /> The alleged suspect murderer is considered to be 86 minutes of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1/10
