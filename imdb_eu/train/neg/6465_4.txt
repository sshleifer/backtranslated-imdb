Charles's departure is decent, but this is a pretty tiny performance. Marlon Brando stands out. Mira has a subtype with Sorvino and Donald Sutherland, which forgets everything and breaks the pain in the movie. I still strove for why Charlie wants to change his name. "Charles" has all the bad movies.
