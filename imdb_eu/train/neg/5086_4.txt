Terminus Paradis was extraordinary, but "Niki Arletan" is too late. We already have enough and want something new. <br /> <br /> Big managers have no problem beyond their time, not behind them. Why do they see Romania only as a post-revolutionary town? <br /> <br /> We are not born again, and no one gives old age. Most people do not want to remember or remember, and the new generation of new consumers is not understood. This should be the first day, it's not the last song - privacy! Perhaps the youngest directors should move on.
