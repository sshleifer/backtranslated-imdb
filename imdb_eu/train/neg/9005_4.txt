Alien, Jurassic Park and many other science fiction movies have your own tea cup, add a lot of sugar and you'll get it down. The film begins playing ancient England around 1100 and will then leap into the California day. Our heroine Carver (Dean Cain) is a 400-foot underground Underground Security and Military Consultant at the Science Laboratory. He has arrived (he is also a pilot Carver helicopter) with the senior scientist and we will soon find a cloning laboratory that has cloned something recently discovered. Is this a dinosaur or what? As with previous films, all the debris are released and our characters are released. The special effects of the monster are pretty good for the "live video" movie and paid by Dean Cain. But forget about the rest of the team why we have never seen them. Again, do not be with great expectations and you'll be well.
