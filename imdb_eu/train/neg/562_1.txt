I like music, but I'm a Dickens fan. ** SPOILERS MILD ** Do you have enough energy to dance and sing at home to work? Singing London's poor? Fagin and Dodger got into the dusk? It is not a completely faithful novel. As I remember, Dodger publicly hung up and Fagin was beaten in jail. ** SPOILERS OF END ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed, like Sykes, is very weak, making it a little bit more than moving her to express her illness. The worst thing, however, is Mark Lester Oliver, who often find himself so evil and passive as to be the main character you ask him. His portrait is not in any way helping to sing the best effort to double the voice of a girl. They did not guess that they were regarded as three boys in England in almost every church. <br /> <br /> The respect for hobby Dickens: David Lean's amazing 1948 film or the 6-hour adaptation of the BBC. -80 in. Avoid music whitish
