I went into this great hope album. I usually do not see my movies and filmmakers being very clever * always * fun, or I thought. I will list some good parts of this movie: -Create effects. All creatures did well, their movements were realistic, and they fit in well with other images. To be honest, the effects of the creature I gave this movie were 2 SELECTED RULES, more than 1. Now, bad things: -Image. Sir, I've seen a bad performance, but this movie is cakes. No single character is unbelievable * close. The director sent a casting call and received the worst trials. I tried very hard not to miss it, I did not like to condemn anyone in the theater, but it was really REAL. -The storyline: The whole story is full of pile holes from beginning to end. You can receive at least 5 slots in 30 minutes of the movie. Ground holes, of course, are complementary cheeses. This is probably one of the most unexpected stories I have never seen, not thought out, and it's quite slow, I had a great night's sleep when I had been sitting in the night and seeing Parasitea in the SciFi channel. - Interview: Everybody says that, probably, it is the most acclaimed and topical thing possible in every possible opportunity. In this world, it seems that all lines have previously spoken in at least 30 other low-budget films. It's the world of cheeses and clich√©s. - Special effects. Although the effects of the beasts are terribly awful, special effects fail. Yes, they are better than those seen in other films, but there is a lot in the presentation. And this movie has no presentation. The special effects of the Power Rangers series are similar, it seems to be honest. In short: Dragon Wars is not worth your time and money. The concept is good, but directs the direction, performance, dialogue and bad of the film. Wait until the next big monster movie appears. Better than that, Dragon Wars is absolutely horrible.
