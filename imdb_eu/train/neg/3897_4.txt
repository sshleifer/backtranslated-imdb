Work Comedy I.R.S. Agent Tony Randall has researched the unusual family of Maryland farms and never paid taxes. Debbie Reynolds squeezes her husband's non-interested husband. Certainly, Debbie did not share theatrical performances of that time, which is not better than or worse than the rest. The image will be alive, but at halfway it turns it into fault and nonsense. Randall is not a bad game with Reynolds, but the vehicle itself surpasses chemistry. H.E.'s "The Darling Buds of May" novel. Bates, with a bad sound mix, as if all the actors were stuck in the sounds of an echo chamber. ** ****
