I am a fan of Western Spaghetti, and I like them most. However, the worst director of Demofilo Fidani, the worst contribution of the genre, the trashiest and yet the worst part of the genre. The plots of Fidan's films were very weak and their talent was quite limited, and they tried to sell the names of the famous Spaghetti Western, called "Django", with the title "Sartana". In 1971 he added the special case "Gi첫 La Testa ... Man" by the title of "Gi첫 La Testa" by Sergio Leon ("Duck You Sucker") and "Hombre". The movie can be found in different titles ("Fistful Death", "Western Story" ...), I personally bought it with the name of "Adios Companeros", which shares a film with Fiani with the same cast. "For One Bara Piena Di Dollari", also called "Adios Companeros" in the German version. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite weak, a man called Macho Callaghan (Jeff Cameron) continues and participated in the bands against Butch Cassidy (Jack Betts) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell) . <br /> <br /> Jeff Cameron's interpretation is not very compelling. Also, Jack Betts did not find 'Butch Cassidy' as good. B-movie Gordon Mitchell, however, always wanted to try and was not a good actress, but I've always found his performances very funny and original at Spaghetti Westerns, and he really saved Fidani's films. For example, "Django and Sartana ... in the western corner". <br /> <br /> The great "Kidney Kinski" is very funny and original called "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre". A priest is playing! Kinski could imagine any role, but before seeing this movie, nobody would have guessed it as a priest. Kinski, again, is great, even though the screen has little time, and a scene, where he broke a fight, this is probably the only good scene this is. One of the most interesting things about this film is the film director Joe D'mato Sleaze and the legendary king. <br /> <br /> "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre" is a cheap and inexpensive movie, but still has some fun moments. For being a fan of Spaghetti Western, it was fun to watch, but if you're not, do not mind this movie or watch Kinsk with a priest. 3/10
