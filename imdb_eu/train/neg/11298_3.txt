This is the direct sequel to The Mummy Hand (1940), starring Stephen Banning (Dick Foran's theater) is thirty years old and is linking the story (with the footage of footage) to his son's fianc√©. . There are two unusual aspects of the film: the beginning of the death of Banning and the presence of Turhan Bey. he does not have to do anything more or to lose his arms. There is nothing scary about his presence, except for the attempt to bring Promocybe Isobel (Elyse Knox). Dick Foran gets second turnover, but he's killed in the first fifteen minutes! We have to wait until 'Psycho' (1960) before a movie character Janet Leigh! Babe Jenson (now Henson) has made her debut, much later on, much older and original without the comic shtick she made. It's hard to believe that the actress is herself! Unfortunately, the great work of theater is wasted when Kharis killed two short scenes. Afterwards, Banning's son plays John (the weird player John Hubbard) to go to the cemetery. Sheriff makes a lantern on the mafia to burn at Banning's house and kill her. Do you know <br /> <br /> Turhan Bey presents Mehmet Bey as a high priest for the care and nutrition of Tana's leaves. Because voice and appearance are "exotic", it is very badly dying. Better movies for 'Babe' to keep track of the burden of things loaded by Von Helsing, with the final decisive fight and Mehmet Bay. Instead, we have a pedestrian recalibration of different pieces of horror movies from the previous universe, Griffin Jay Hack, who wrote many other Universal Universal clunkers, even when he did the "Don Winslow Navy" (1942). Don Winslow of the Coast Guard '(1943) also presented Elyse Knox. <br /> <br /> Elyse Knox in six Joe Palooka movies with Anne Howe (1946-1949), and, of course, Turhan Bey, 43 films and television credits, "The Amazing Dr. X" (1948) The title is very good. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is much darker and atmospheric (a lot of black shadows in the sheriff's office) before the movie 'Kharis' mummy, but it is not a bit of interest or enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> I will give you 3.
