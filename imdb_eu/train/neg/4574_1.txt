I entered into this movie because he expected to be similar to Matrix or Pi. Boy, I was wrong. Yes, there's a badly-typed cartoon in the movie (CG animated cells and peptides). However, the real focus of the film is the "expert" who wear smart clothes that feel like a new age. <br /> <br /> Surely it's innocent. At first, there is a bit of real quantum physics. For example, the electrons exist as particles and waves, and most of the atoms are empty. However, the movie takes a giant (and scientific) jump, such as subatomic quantum effects that occur on large scale. They speak even more of the heads that speak. According to them, the following are true: - When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the locals could not see their ships, because their minds were not so different to perceive something. -Milling can reduce the rate of murder. - With positive thinking, you can walk in water. -Your thoughts may change the formation of ice crystals in a bottle of water. <br /> <br /> And yes, only in the first 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> The look of the film was torture. This movie felt like a movie that will show you to participate in a cult. After doing my homework, I realized that this is basically just that. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this can be seen as a lyric comedy (but not funny). <br /> <br /> Save your time and money: do not see this movie.
