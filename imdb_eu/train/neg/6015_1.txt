The causes of these films are never transparent. Let's see: WITHOUT ONE, all the television makers participate in this film is the main thing to do to whiten bread. BEFORE, most of the key Christians encourage the purchase of copies of the film, to recover their production costs and publicize the budget quote. And finally, when the movie is played at theaters, the Christians who say it is possible to see them again, if they are going to be used for buses in the multiplex, NOT the merits of the movie itself, but the opening # 1 box office will open. It is seen as a profound spiritual victory. <br /> <br /> But, of course, it's not enough. I believe that any criticism of "down the road" seems to be "an anti-Christian" Christian to "Behind Behind". <br /> <br /> Of course, the shameless manipulative marketing campaign is not surprising. anyone After all, it's a good old capitalism. It's shocking to me, people who have been immersed in the "Behind some" attitude. As one who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with a reasonable reason and reasonable rationality, he allows me to break my head. Apparently, many people who believe that happening in the near future will be "Rapture", and millions of people throughout the country will disappear at the same time. What is reality, I wonder what these people live for? Is this a "deception" really believing or something they want to believe? When they reach the end of life and when "mistakes" do not come to fruition, they will be disappointed and dissolved? Should it still be 100 years that people should immediately point out the "racket"? <br /> <br /> I mean, of course, that this event will happen! What an interesting day! It would be even more interesting if Apocalypse were to become more conspicuous, not anthropologically, portrayed by the authors of the "Left Bottom" series, but as a production of Stephen Spielbergen with bubbling clouds and trunks. Angels go down from heaven, Moon became blood, nine meters. Imagine understanding what was happening to the truth, as evangelist years had warned, and something more horrible than the cold, hard physical reality we live in. Should not something be? <br /> <br /> However, in the end, physical reality is cold, hard and physical. My life is not so absurd that the "Rapture" and "End Times" fear is needed ... do not you think God or hell bribed or I was scared to wear myself, thank you very much.
