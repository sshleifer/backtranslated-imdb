The first Cruel Intentions, original, is my favorite movie of my time. She was an absolute master's degree. So how can a sequel of the earth be so completely bad. Sarah Michelle Gellar's first movie was perfect. In this, Amy Adams is horrible. It's horrible And could not they find the cock that looked like Michelle Michelle Gellar? At least the same hair color !!! I mean that. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but it's a huge deal with Ryan Phillippe. In the first film, Sebastian is devoted, deceitful, and much worse than a prequel to Sebastian. And what is the story line? Basically, this is like this ... <br /> <br /> 1- Sebastian is a representative of former bad school, so she says the movie, but she has nothing to mention about her, dates of her life, and how has it been for girls 2- Sebastian moves to New York, and suddenly decides to turn herself on. Danielle "falls in love" (I remind you that Sarah Michelle Giller originally mentioned that "you've broken the FIRST PRAY that you love ever, she told me, how she loved her first?) And everything is nice and charming, and" person good "everything, while the sex bass plays his dad. <br /> <br /> Complete 3-80 and finishes at the end of the movie three times and then Cherry is fascinated. <br /> <br /> I mean I have a great deal, and I loved so many things before. I still have not seen third. I hope that God is better than this one.
