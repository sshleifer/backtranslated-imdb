If you've seen a eighties slasher, this is not a lot of reason. Originality is often not one of the strongest points in the film industry, and this movie is something that is seriously lacking. I can say much about Pranks, so I'll be quicker. The movie was one of the 74 films made on DPP Video Nasty, which was my sight. The plot continues in a room that stays in a Christmas dining room. As they are slasher, someone decides to start picking them up and it's one of the most mysterious mysteries ever seen in the slasher movie. The fact that the video clips are wicked is very curious, despite the fact that some of the scenes are penetrating, this film will not be ruined or depraved, much larger than this (for example, Friday 13). banned Once again, this prohibited movie is forbidden (for example, the witch coming from the sea). In any case, the result of the film is best in that regard, although the viewer does not really care about the attacker at this point; it's fine In general, the slasher slasher is sad, but slasher fans would be lost.
