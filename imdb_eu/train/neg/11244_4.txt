When robotic hordes begin to attack big cities, who will attack after the attack? Sky Captain !!! Jude Law plays Joe Sullivan through Skyways to face his unsuspecting odds with his Polny Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his airplane pair, the captain Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie). Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow may have an exciting and unforgettable movie, but it's very dull and shameful. The film's duration is 106 minutes and it's still much longer because there is no substance in this movie. The visuals were superb and the film made a pleasant job. However, there is nothing visible to support these wonderful. The movie is missing a story and interesting characters, while things are unnecessary and useless. I'm guilty of the director and writer Kerry Conran. Focuses too much on the images and has spent little time on the real story. The movie is like a girl with no personality, after a while, it's a tender and tiring touch. Sky Captain represents a beautiful girl with no personality. It's just another case of style, in front of substance. <br /> <br /> The incident is surprisingly average, which was not really due to its fault. The main reason I saw this movie is Angelina Jolie. However, advertising is quite misleading and only about 30 minutes in the film. His screening is also amazing. Jude Law plays well, but you expect a lot more. Gwyneth Paltrow was the average, nothing special. Ling Bai was the only one I really liked. As a very mysterious woman, he plays a pretty good play and has been a unique character in the whole film. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a bust. There were some "wow" and exciting scenes. There were not many of them. It's just a movie to make this hook really memorable. Actually, it was very soft and not very pleasing. It is very bad that the film is not very good, because it was so promising. In the end, Sky Captain is surprisingly below the average and it's not really worth a look. 4/10 rating
