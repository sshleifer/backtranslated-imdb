The movie is a mess, but at least it's not pretentious. The video clip kutxa art as a "backback fun" for giant movie mistakes in the 1950s. Actually, the "aliens" threshold is transparent. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers clearly wanted to take a picture of "ALIEN", but they did not have much money. Actually, they do not seem to have any money, really. I hope everyone has paid for those who have worked. <br /> <br /> It is kept on a basic plot - I include a group of people isolated from insect deadly and a land location for budget reasons. Instead of throwing film into space, no-one can hear you, the movie has been set up in the hospital, where everyone can bump your budget. It's a fun thing about "Blue Monkey" (and that's why it's just fun) filmmakers do not ignore "ALIEN" aesthetics. In the hospital, there are still some traces of attachments that are not fictional experiments, in this case the "growth hormone" plot plot. The attachment also doubles as a boiler room (or something), so we can have an explanation that seeks the warmth of the monster. The boiler has a room that is so large that it is mixed with multi-section steel sections, ideal for slats between the slats. <br /> <br /> A man who works in a greenhouse asserts that an attack creates a flower that is produced in an exotic plant that grows in a strange plant. He has touched and says "Ow", so we know he was injured. Will the finger cut be lost within a few minutes and the palms in the hospital (in a "ALIEN" image it is called a "loudspeaker"). The worm is isolated, but some malignant small children (leukemia patients) begin to develop it and "unexpectedly" give them an experimental growth hormone. You know everyone is having problems with some hospital staff who are attacking a camera by a camera, and soon a maintenance man finds compulsory vents to capture the half-convex arms of the insectoid. The rest of the movie is a semi-dark monster that is semi-dark half-dark. <br /> <br /> That returns "ALIEN". How to ask, a movie in the hospital about strobe flashing in the "ALIEN" movies? There's no problem ... power outage (or something) is wrong with the electrical system, apparently strobe lights in every room of the hospital, and they're constantly running through the film. This doubles as a minimal outfit for special effects (although the mistakes are pretty good, they do not move very well, and the joke for babies looks like a Cootie toy). <br /> <br /> Ok, so what's the "ALIEN" basics we're not covered ... OH, it's pouring water on the walls! Check ... we will distribute the massive hospital in two parts and then send some characters to the other side through raw and wet basements. The problem has been solved, we have a lot of shots to highlight today. And do not forget about the fog ... well, you never need any excuse in horror films, right? Okay, maybe inside a hospital, so we will create smoke to burn and burn a lot of things. <br /> <br /> I did not say anything about playmaking or actors. any type of script to follow. I have taken "Blue Monkey" to be pale and fun, and if so, try it nice, but the pieces do not match and the movie remains a real trace. Watch a movie called "Aliens of Return: Deadly Spawn," if you want to see a monetized movie of that type, there is less money and more active talent. This falls to the alien.
