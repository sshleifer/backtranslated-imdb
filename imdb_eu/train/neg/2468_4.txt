That was not so great. There is no fear, no hateful, forgotten anything. <br /> <br /> However, he had a sort of fuzzy and diluted air, which he never knew as to laugh or enjoy himself or go to the satire.

I know it was a comedy, but above all, the whole movie where you should keep the audience interested in the long-term, you still need a certain emotional anchor, turning the story straight through, turning it. A child hero, an old woman, two fellow students, and finally, her father, watching her zombies, or everything killing him, and bringing us all together with a wonderful smile and shoulders, I only fight in a positive way.

This was pretty well captured, it was a beautiful movie, especially the wide angle of the street and the Robinson's home. Also, the opening news was pretty, made differently but still more entertaining. <br /> <br /> And I thought Billy Connolly was well and that's not someone. Billy Connolly's fan: Movie Star. I was afraid and trying to steal each scene was frightened, but it was a lie for him and surely he took the guy in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's not great.
