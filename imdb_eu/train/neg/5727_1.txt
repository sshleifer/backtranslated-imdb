I mean it's the first review of a movie I made on the web. I felt the need to warn people about this film, because it is one of the worst film I've ever seen. Having read the interviews with the director, he respects constructive criticisms and, therefore, I avoid the movie's exception, for his sake and for my opinion, it seemed terribly terrifying to me. <br /> <br /> 1. Actors. I know the budgets are not allowed to be the greatest, but in the industry over ten years with Nicholson he probably knew some of the lowest average actors. <br /> <br /> 2. A lot of lame make-up and special effects. Again, the quote has been interfered with the target, but there is no excuse for working for so many years. <br /> <br /> 3. Significant similarities to the accommodation. Although it was not yet, he will try to get an old, successful movie. Rothe knew where the problem went and exactly how it arrived ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4. Music. It's not terribly or terribly annoying or bad. <br /> <br /> 5. In general script. All interviews were compelled and horrible! Theatrical sub-plot and storage enthusiasts have been weak and almost identical. <br /> <br /> Edition 6 WTF. How jarring, and not in a good way. he said nuf. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I would like to hear the thoughts of the director (he certainly spends his pages on the IMDb). Friend ... what did you think? Yes, at some point in time, shooting or editing, he was aware of what a turkey had in his hands ... Sorry, I do not want to be hard, but you have a lot more talent, your next movie, gutterballs movie or something I expect. It's better, fortunately, as practice progresses. <br /> <br /> But, however, avoid this as a plague. I want to return my 81 minutes with interest. (I did not pay to pay at least.)
