So let me see you as part of this movie. I was bored a good day in 1997, so I went to the movie rental shop. I asked the secretary how much movie was the worst movie. Certainly, he went to "Lucky Stiff". He told me he could relinquish $ 1 rental fee (the worst thing he would say was that he was charging me) told me to watch the whole movie. So I saw it, free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. God-horrible too. I do not need to enter the plot, with other reviews reads. The jokes do not make sense. The play was awful. I know it was a comedy, but the abominability of the main character was tiring. You can try to see something you're laughing about, but it's so bad that it's not fun anyway. Avoid!
