I enjoyed "American Movie", so I rented the first movie of Chris Smith and I thought it was a documentary. I did not see the first minute, but I went. <br /> <br /> What is the final movie? Being true will hardly work for you if you want to explore the pattern, esp. We are already familiar with the boredom. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but that's why it's going to come about 1) to suck lots of jobs and 2) most of them have boxes, minimal wages. jobs in the services sector ??? I knew that before I watched the movie. However, there is no such thing as a feeling of "real" film (hand camera, music, etc.). What happens is almost as a "real world". <br /> <br /> When an employer sent out Randy when he had received checks, when Randy had waited for 6 months to leave the girl after 3 days? Or after the day after leaving the job (and without shaking the machine), would all be so easy? <br /> <br /> A big problem is our "heroine" (?), Randy. . This guy is a loser. Because it's stuck in those jobs, or because it has a crisp, or look-out apartment. It's a drug. It does not pay much attention or try these jobs really. He has zero people. If I had to hire someone, I would not go through the conversation. <br /> <br /> I am now in front of what Chris Smith is doing, but the boy is "removing this one". The important movie "Things." American Job "does not work.
