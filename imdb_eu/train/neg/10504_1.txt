I can not see more than 14 minutes. It's a great combination of bad filmmaking and management. The drawings used are boring, all the time they break 180 degrees. It tries to hurt me to "see what you know" to see that charge. You see the dread of the "mysterious" window out of the windows lighting ... annoying. What else ... you want to scream that woman who is so badly in charge of this time. I only run shorts, but I'm pretty sure I'd be better than directing the feature ... the story is incredible, the beginning of the French-speaking scene is going to tell you it's pretty bad. . So much, try to avoid this really bad movie at all costs, it will save you $ 5, so 1h30 hours of your life have never come back ...
