This movie is not as horrible as the movie's Sci-Fi Channel. I see CGI blobs and special emotional effects, such as special effects such as close bloodshed, it is very evident through blood stomach syrup or other syrupy variations. However, I thought that Sci-Fi Channel had seen all the possible things to go. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine yourself inside a socks made from handmade socks? These are the main alien vampires in this movie. You can see the toes inside the cotton puppets. Talking about the victims attacked his hand and the vampire vampire vampire in Transylvanian can talk to Rubber Sock puppets. How did you learn from Alien Vampires? And is not Transylvania Romania? So would not they speak Romanian? Why would a small town be its language? If you can interrupt your gag reflex and pass these rubber socks, moving your foreign fingers to the heads of the foreigners; Then you have to face other alien vampires. There are "Leatherfaces" that want to wear faces to the victims. It seems that it seems like a lot of facial wounds. Then the annoying Valley Valley and their relatives are involved in human traitors and space colonies, so they can sabotage the Defense System to attack these vampires spaces. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you all guess, the previous one is fun and it is worth laughing, excluding third-party television network actors, a group of stereotypical heroes that are constantly struggling to fight. Why all the Sci-Fi Channel films are almost annoying, abrasive, raw, or completely anti-phthalmic? I was hoping to win over the losing rubber socks.
