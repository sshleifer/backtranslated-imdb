I love this book. My 5th grade teachers read us many years ago in our class. And I have read my 3rd and 5th grade classes over my last 18 years of teaching. The alleged movie has been made in the past, but I never found it. Well, my students and I were so excited, when Disney heard Madeline Engul's excellent book. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie, I had the greatest hopes. As the film progresses, I became more and more bent. They missed it badly! A favorite adaptation of your favorite book books never left. I understand that the films can not keep a book sharp, but they do not change things for the sake of it! Most of the book's exits, but not all, were not absolutely necessary! <br /> <br /> At first my opinion kept myself and my students heard the movie. Well, I was not there. Almost every one felt the same way - Madeline Engulished a great story that made her so proud. <br /> <br /> Why did they ask about star movies like Aunt Beast Chewbacca? Why could not Calvin's hair be red? Why does not his name have a similar toy as "witch-like" outfits? In essence, we all asked: why there were almost all details to be changed? <br /> <br /> I've always dreamed that I dreamed how wonderful this book is. I'm still waiting for that movie. This was a Wrinkle Time only the widest sense. I will write to Peter Jackson and I will try to do it!
