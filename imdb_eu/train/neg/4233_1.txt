I can not believe that I spent $ 14.00. The only recoverable quality is gore sharp. Duplication was worse than ever. It seems that a VHS camera shot. I think all Pfennig were used for special effects, where there are many parts of blood and body everywhere. One of the worst movies I have ever seen, but I must admit that there were not so many boring movies as the whole movie is so absurd and unbelievable.
