It seems that the cast should guarantee at least an average movie. That's why I was just sitting 102 minutes away. Ed Harris does not seem to have any kind of acting skills. Although I usually worship Sean Connery had to be a day over the whole of Just Case's shoot. The whole movie could not be convinced by an actor anymore. <br /> <br /> This made the movie look cheap and unreal. <br /> <br /> The story creates a bit. It's exciting, and the plot is unexpected. <br /> <br /> If you only see this conclusion on this movie, if you do not really do anything.
