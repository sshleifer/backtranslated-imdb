I like to see western movies, but this movie is a movie. The script and the conversation are dark. The performance was awful, where did they come from? I agree with music. Fortunately, I did not buy or rent a movie, but now I do not use it. <br /> <br /> When I started up, a stranger (martin sheen) began to tell her story. I have to admit that I've enjoyed the conflict between Hopalong and Tex that Hopalong has shot Tex's fingertips for 40 years to get his workout. But that's where all went after the form of pear. I had to watch the whole movie with the hope that it would have been better than ever.
