I am ALL of Adam Sandler's pastime, and one day, I selected Band and Help on a DVD and I saw 'Going Overboard' and I decided to rent and rent. So I went out with some friends and rented it. We got up and we were surprised when we saw Adam Sandler coming to puberty. It seems at age 12 when the movie was released. I could not see it for 30 minutes, I did not laugh, laughed, or even smiled at this movie, when I saw it really funny when I saw the movie was awful. I could not believe the film was trying hard to laugh at the audience ... and it did not work once. Although I could see the terribly awesome camera angles and a boring script, I realized why I had never heard this movie ... before I sucked it. This movie, in my opinion, was EZTABAIT made by EVER ... EVER!
