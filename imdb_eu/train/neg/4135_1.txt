This movie was so bad, I had to move faster to a large extent. What is it for? It was worth the end of the limit (those who watched the movie I know what I mean). I expected a lot from this movie on the dawn of the dead of the dead with Freddy vs. Jason, but I think of myself. The story was unforgettable, the cast was badly used and what the director was thinking about. This could be the best, but I was the most boring film I ever saw. Ok, so what was the T and A bit nice, I was gore and I am amused. Do not expect a movie to be good, but if you want to bother with bad guys, watch that path and see how it would not be a horror movie.
