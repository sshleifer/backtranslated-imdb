This movie was on the other day and I did not like it. George's first jungle was a good comedy, but the battle was ... it was absolutely horrible. The main characters of the actors and actresses were not good, they had to be the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and the original actress (I forgot his name), so this film earns a score of ten, not one. You can watch the movie that you can watch and watch on the movie, that is, buying or buying a movie or a shopping cart that you want to go to another way. It was lovely to see Ape Monkey back, but it was not as funny as the first one, he had to grow up to be the son of George's young George, and he still has to be in Bredon and (in his face). It was a bit better then.
