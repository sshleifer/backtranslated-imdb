I do not seek quality; I'm trying to get through the 74 famous video bans in Great Britain. This was banned early and re-released in 2001 with 10 seconds cut. <br /> <br /> Some college children spend Christmas holidays to renew. There are four awesome characters that hide together with four kids. What is a slasher? Actual killings are not very gory, so this video game is not very bad. Booby's flash is necessary, but it's not about college kids. <br /> <br /> I had a suspect very quickly and I was correct. Maybe I've seen many of them. The final tour was made; I have to give writers credit for this bit of originality.
