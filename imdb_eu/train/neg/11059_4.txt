"Dahmer" is an interesting movie, but I would not use it to describe "horror" or "thriller". The character of the murderer who seems to be merciless is a small investigation. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Renner describes the murderer of the series, Jeffrey Dahmer, whose male victims drowned, killed and disbanded. The film is a relationship between Dahmer and "Rodney", well-interpreted by Artel Kay√†ru. <br /> <br /> Rodney is almost an interesting character: he is in love with Dahmer and escapes after the attack, returns to Dahmer for sex and a second attack has survived. <br /> <br /> I think that the film is not linked, because it depicts the years of education of Dahmer, the human monster we can see on the screen and the belief that Dahmer does not believe his victims can have sexual zombies. The roles are played well, but the story is small.
