Yes, this wonderful rumor was incredible. We know that French people have a troubled idea of ​​the United States, that they are puritanism and sex perspectives. As an American who lives in France (Hoosier), I have a wide range of observations. And although some of these concepts are true, this feature of the western town is NOT true. Ever since 20 years ago teachers were told that he never had sex with a man anymore? Where would you find it in the world? A Juke box in a vintage bar that only plays Bluegrass? Less than two hours away from Chicago city, but without a large gas station, no TV in the home, no McDonalds, no children ... The population that knows the intimate details. the family that hates each other. Older men have planted coastlines in the local coffee shop, they have farms, but do not harvest, kill people who do not like it, and seem to flee and with the same emotions? A liberated 17-year-old French boy who is liberated by the generosity of liberty, which breaks the cornea, deflects the wind of Illinois wind only for 17 years? HELP! I'm surprised by the nonsense of this movie, and I'm surprised to be so ridiculous. Let's see for the A-to-Z primer. Gosh, I hope you do not spoil it for you!
