I've seen a lot of movies by Guy Maddin and most of them liked me, but this gave me a headache. John Gurdebek's edition is frenetic, and aside from the deformation sequence of a bull's head that shows a line of sight, the operator hinders the ability to communicate with the audience. <br /> <br /> I did not like something about this movie as it seemed to be harder than the first works of Maddin, although his films were dark elements, the sympathy for the characters gave them a sense of human feeling in cinema. This seemed like hardness toughness. <br /> <br /> <br /> I have to add more text lines before IMDB approves my review, I'm managing the "Guy Maddin" actor. facial expression studies to study quite well.
