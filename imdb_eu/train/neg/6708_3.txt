Turn your back or big difficulties to MY BOYFRIEND BACK! Happy ending is only when your innocence flourishes, when darkness and event are in full swing. It is safe to say that the whole movie is falling, showing a sarcastic view of the zombie and a supernatural nonsense nonsense. We get as much a name as "Johnny" and this "Johnny" does not go anywhere. There is no specific reason for our "dead corpse" to explore its grave, until it lasts until the daytime, so it turns the movie completely useless. Without a feeling of sadness, mother is sure to be dead to the doctor. Johnnyk Eddie is struck by his arm. The viewer's question is hard: why does the movie need this star? There is a reply All resemblances of people alive or dead coincide. It's a "life" coincidence. "Dead" has nothing to do with the movie. Show this will skip your girlfriend and the main promotion and make your life a mere catastrophe. Blah !!!
