A few weeks ago, I read the classic novel George Orwell, 1984. I was fascinated with it and I thought it was one of the best books I've read recently. When I rented the DVD, I was very curious as this adaptation was measured. Unfortunately, the movie was not even created to create a new atmosphere or develop the characters that made Orwell so much in his book. The director thinks that everyone who watches the film reads the book, because he does not try to prove why the characters do not try and feel. John Hurt, the main actor, walks all the way, until he almost never finishes any play. We never know what he is doing to live, or why he forbids the story of his love, or what political climate is and why he wants the rebellion of the main character. This book can not be made in films in the correct way, without narrative and explanation of the political system, without losing out on the political system, and the lack of it is the biggest mistake of this film. In addition, John Hurt was a great casting opportunity, Winston seemed much older than 39 years of age. In a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast was well chosen. In an ill-fated movie, they have joined the actor's actor. -Brian O.
