Drew Barrymore plays the young Holly Gooding along with the scriptwriter Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and stops her life from losing her "dobbling" or evil twin to kill her and her family. <br /> <br /> This stupid horror movie is taken seriously, although filmmakers and actors seem to be dead. "Doppelganger" is mixed with pleasant conversations. <br /> <br /> Some viewers are playing the name of Drew's character, Audrey Hepburn's "Breakfast at Tiffany's", and the name of Newbern's character. The name of the famous writer Patricia Highsmith (really trying to write "Scary" as a horror movie, believe it or not!). <br /> <br /> It's enough for you not to have credit. Your typical horror movie - Avi Nesher's writer and director seems to care for his characters, and his movie gives more plot to the standard slasher rate. <br /> <br /> After a strange criminals, everything ... -a controversial fight against terrorism, a terrible incident to be seen by believers. This film definitely does not hide on the gore. <br /> <br /> But yes! This Drew kills his mother. No, I do not play. Jaid Barrymore appears to be close to the beginning to kill him violently. <br /> <br /> Drew is always very watchful and very sexy. Newbern is as nice and kind as nice. But the main point of the film must be with Sally Kellerman on stage, to be a very attractive actress in an ancient nun, because she has begun a sex business (!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> Films are basically trash, but it's pretty funny in a small, sordid level. <br /> <br /> 4/10
