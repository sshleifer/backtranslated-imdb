I can not believe that this show lasted as it did. I think it's part of America's cliff. Personally, as David Spade says, I like this show with a better title when "Seinfeld" went. What I like most about this show, aside from the "sense of humor" and the overall smuttiness, is the title of the episode. Exceptional shows are really fun after many shows that are still repeated, such as "Rob Van Dyke Show", "Rob Van Gets Hypnotized" or "Sweets at the Workshop". In other words, it is the honor of the viewer to give them excellent programs. The writers and producers of "Friends" could describe the titles that were equally identical, before they could even see for themselves a second time, it speaks of mediocrity and lack. the original thinking of these writers, but also the most intelligent audiences. <br /> <br /> You have read comments on some of these people and you can only conclude by concluding Neverland like Hallmark Card, feeling full of greetings card. The true meaning of friendship? Want to be a friend? Do I want to live in Manhattan? Wake up These people are supposed to work in cafes and are looking for work as an actor, but somehow they live in $ 4000. apartment Get authentic. Those who want to move to Manhattan and those who want to live with idyllic New York life with Rosses and Monicas, all tell me. New York does not exist for anyone who makes less than six-figure income. However, that's all good luck. Now, close and pass Soma.
