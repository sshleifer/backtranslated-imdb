Let me tell you I'm not a fan of horror movies. I have never seen them <br /> <br /> Leave me about my experience ... <br /> <br /> I wanted to see Happy Blonde because I had seen the only reason I wanted to see my girlfriends and friends. <br /> <br /> ... I have never seen Happy Feet, but I'm sure it's better than that ... movie? However, we really did not expect it was good ... we really laughed. Enjoy me ... I have a problem in the theater for the loss of the movie for other people, but only for other couples who spoke and performed, it did not matter. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, 2 others left Borat behind, I would be glad I could see the movie again. The movie was not terrifying, and it was not stupid, so it would be fun ... it was boring. It was not horrible as "Baby Genuises", it was horrible ... it's not entertaining. Avoid it <br /> <br /> I have not heard about it now, but it seems to me that the horror industry is a problem these days: you can get boring and not scary of fearful PG-13 or R. It's a terrifying horror movie that is more bloody or horrible for people. <br /> <br /> PG-13 you want to be a terrifying fear but it's really fun? See "The Grudge". Avoid this movie like plague ... it can literally kill you. <br /> <br /> 0/10
