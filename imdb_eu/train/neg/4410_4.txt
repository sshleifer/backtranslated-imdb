Formula action film typical: A good police mix conflicts with police and Japanese gangsters. <br /> <br /> The good results include decent performances, snicker-driven agents, and some sequential actions. plus an opportunity to see Danielle Harris beautiful - who has his constant typecasting as possible as a rebel teen daughter. <br /> <br /> ** outside ****.
