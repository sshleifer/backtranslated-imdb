What can I say? I'm a secret fan of "Top" acts and horror films. Especially that brings a lot of humor and input, but I'm not a fan of Snake aircraft. <br /> <br /> There are three draws for this movie: ?? Comedy of the situation; ?? Fear; and ?? Hundreds is a snake plane. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is not written as a writer's fear or comedy, and only 1 or 2 points in the film make you smile. If you want to get the feeling of the movie, the trailer represents a really horror movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, if you expect a movie full of action and chorus, you're not disappointed. It does not stand out from other films, but it always keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the Snake of a plane is not new, but you'll think about cinema "what happened to him". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I know that this movie has a high score, but does not add it. A) Many of the reviews written before releasing the movie, and B) User ratings have a much smaller change than usual. 10/10 of the film, approximately 77% of people. 10 - Why this gorgeous void?
