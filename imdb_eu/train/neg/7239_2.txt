This movie is a great romantic comedy. It is not clear and romantic, and definitely not an effective comedy. The richness of "Tom" and pathetic riches oscillate from one very insolent disaster. Only the passions for saving are the power of Toni Collete's powers and the frequency of Paltrow's face. In general, it must be avoided!
