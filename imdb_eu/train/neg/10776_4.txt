When my wife and I decided to see this movie we could not fail. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and we love everyone loved them <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Meanwhile I felt Billy. Crystal's character was very individual and very little for the film. Of course, it broke the good jokes, but the character did not take it into space. <br /> <br /> And poor Julia Roberts. She performs well in the past as an elegant and self-determined woman. In this flick, it was completely repressed and had very little fire. This is not what my wife sees Julia Roberts. <br /> <br /> Okay, if I could find a good thing, it would be Christopher Walken. Now it's entertainment. But, like Billy Crystal, there's hardly anything to show in its nature. <br /> <br /> Good luck, if you are looking for a very expensive non-seasoned night, see. But if you're looking for romantic and intelligent comedy, this is not your movie. The previous ones are not.
