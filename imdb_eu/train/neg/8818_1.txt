Santa is a crazy and weird movie about a traumatized child (???) It grows and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart), who makes lists of people who are malicious or kind. A Christmas snaps and sets people to kill evil - of course wearing Santa. <br /> <br /> Santa is boring and just a bad killer Santa movie. If you're looking for Gore, it's not here. Only a few murders are shown and they are not fake. Most of the movies Brandon Maggart speaks to her and makes her a little mad. The script is sad, the play is awful and I'm going to put an end to the TV show. Seriously, I had to delay the tape and make sure I saw it again. It really ends really. <br /> <br /> If you want a terrific movie for Christmas, rent "Black Christmas" (original version of the 70s - NOT a huge remake). Avoid this at all costs.
