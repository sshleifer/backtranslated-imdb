This movie is very good, it's your mind, but only in the way it tells the story very bad. Stella is so incredibly raw and never learns better. Her husband is very snobby and mind-minded. It's never been better to learn. Is this realistic? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter embarrasses her bad habits and customs, but can she not only understand that she has to dump all this shades? I do not think so. Stella is a woman who is GOOD, and is a very DAYSET. To refuse herself so that her daughter can bind herself with a bunch of boys that can be confused. <br /> <br /> In a time when we could see what we can see - those who enjoy beer or two, who enjoy playing dancing in the piano - but they are roughly moral. "I can not live our children this way!" Rescue <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing: Lantogi Viewer can never be expected to get to the High Class heights. And that's just a hogwash charge.
