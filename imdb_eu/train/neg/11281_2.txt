This movie has given me 2 stars with a great movie, the movie is shown in 42 and 43 minutes ... The Russian road bar scene. In this scene the director of the film offered me an immortal line - "50 dollars ... drink and talk," but my Polish party could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I did before. talk part. I was a bit struck by the stars, this was my first experience ... and who knows ... these lines would end up like lines like "I be back" and "Quite Frankly My Dear, I Do not Do not". Cuddle. "When I spoke this line, my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminum instead of" Heavy 1 "instead of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /> <br /> I'm still lying happily telling my name that there's no movie With all this in mind. <br /> <br /> Although I spent the whole day, New South Wales, Barry Island, could not tell me what the real story was. All hostesses and apparel ladies agreed that there was swearing and nudity there. ... probably worse things could be when I'm naked in this great movie movie .... <br /> <br /> Still ..... In a positive aspect ... I talked to Rhys Ifans, I did not know who he was, "Notting Hill" was still to be released, and it was not Greek. Barry Island was terribly misleading in the 70's and 80's when I visited it. Keith Allen appeared in the production of quality I realized I was there ........
