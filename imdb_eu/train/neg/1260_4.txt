THE GET-AWAY (1941), in the last role, DALLAS (1984-1985) Mrs. Reed can never be described as CHUNKY. It's not an attractive and slim actor. Which role has been M.G.M. he rarely lived up to his talents. <br /> <br /> Andrea Reed is backed by a cast of character actors, unfortunately, this is a must-do "screw" comedy. Clearly M.G.M. he made a deep film out of the deep. A better production of COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and UNIVERSAL. No contact with Ernst Lubitsch, nor the Preston Sturges' minds would not be able to save this movie. The romantic comedies of all the trademarks of the war (World War II) all had. <br /> <br /> Irving Thalberg was still alive if there was still significant theater or rewriting. day light Louis B. Mayer got into the most challenging challenge for her family entertainment. The "DeHavilland Decision" warfare to face upcoming warfare challenges, the loss of its theatrical channels, TV shows and the drop in M.G.Ms. Fortunately with Donna Reed, her best day ends THE HERE TO ETERNITY (1953) and the Oscar for Best Actor Award.
