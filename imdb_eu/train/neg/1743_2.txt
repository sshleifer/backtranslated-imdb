Unlike the title, this film does not offer any kind, so that the audience suffers a delicious dish. All humor is forced, theater, mechanical, staggering, which reminds of the playboys available in arcade games, including manners. Everyone screams, shouts and strange things for no reason. The premise seems to be interesting, as the Hollywood Boeing Boeing is a live lift. Almost every John Abraham in all his films is wrong here, aside from the moral factor, even though strange events are apparent. Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two stalwarts are trying to get the film lifted but natural. At least three girls' characters must be contrasted to bring interesting elements, but unfortunately they seem to be unclear. Speaking of buxomed bimbettes (3Bs), playing and even screaming in a similar way. The most important hole in the plot is what did the protagonist do when three girls get to know each other in their own home? To make some sex, what else? The same can be done in hundreds of ways. Therefore, without reason, there is not so much a performance that something easy to compose the audience. But surely, it always gives a great flesh spectacle and tempting promotion. uch a great start for a movie. Now I call a pathetic taste for those who call situation comedies. The humor of the film audience is surely damaged, as they are connecting with a sad, curious and curse type of humor, where the characters laugh they are not themselves and themselves. Frustration, apparently, is how we are going to have to endure those weird senses?
