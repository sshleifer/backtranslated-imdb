This is shown on some off-network. It's wonderful. Despite the bad B movies that are on Saturdays on the Sci-Fi network, but the disaster is quite large. The play is right. Plots and scripts are quite sub-standard and the slack is very slow. Every minute of the film is what they believe is like part of the movie; not the peak of the film, cancellation. At the same time, the cast's large parts are old as they are playing. The whole thing is predictable, boring and not worth seeing. Save time There is also the time required to watch free.
