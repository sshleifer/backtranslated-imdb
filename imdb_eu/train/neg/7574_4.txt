But good action and plot is interesting. Nevsky is like a bodybuilder and does not appeal to this, the IMO. (Missing his acting capabilities!) Joana Pacula plays Sascha very well, but he needed more lines than he had provided, his character had to be developed. In this story, there are too many men, it's not romance, too much action, and the end stupid. It is very violent. However, I loved the landscape, the movie takes you to the whole world and it's a bonus. I also liked how much liking was about having some things around the underworld, not too many or fewer, but I just need to pay attention. Actors who had to be beautiful actors ... Nevsky was normal, not sexy enough, the main problem. I think that for most guys, Sascha will be hot, but they are fans of action, Nevsky has not cut off. Overall, the movie was OK, I did not love it, nor did I hate it, just another act that I found to be a normal movie.
