Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers, this will not be wrong. But what can I say? This was a huge mistake. The movie is Peter Sellers suddenly very curious and not surprising to mention the attractive hippie Goldie Hawn. The movie was very disconnected and I did not understand anything. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very entertaining people, but this film does not prove. <br /> <br /> Arabella Cinderella's song is quite pretty, but that's it. I recommend this film to people who want to see the extreme novelty movie, that is, almost definition. I think that this movie is a time when it's time for any other person, with regard to specific experimentalism and customary habits, the problem is that the quality is completely shot and written, not to mention the direction. <br /> <br /> Exactly, Peter Sellers is very successful, but Dr. Strangelove and Being There will go through his career, like mock movies and Magic Christian, which was very similar. context and style, but this movie had some fun moments. This is absurd, and I'm sad that someone was as good as Peter Sellers in this movie. No one is recommended.
