The plot of this film, character development and gag are very weak. Pure time Thanks to Grace Saving's warm and blurring, it is assumed that characters have grown during their raids. There was no such development in order to make the heat feel hot. Drug gags are topical, and a large part of the movies will not be alive. Earth supposes a tension, but the characters are not enough to keep developing. Then, thanks to the resolution of all the major problems, it seems like a minute of screen around the viewer wasted time.
