Well, there's a disillusionment in my opinion. Two, really! First of all, I think that I like to know myself about Euro-exploitation and its most prolific contributors in the 1970s, I never heard about Joseph W. Sarno. Here's a guy who has made a profitable film of exploiting worship in the seventies and I have not seen one! How Why? What happened here? Secondly, and even worse, when you think you've found a new source for dark worship movies, the director's famous and supposed "masterpiece" is a film that is boring and completely boring and unbelievable. Undoubtedly, lesbian vampire films make up a relatively small genre of sub-genres, but some have disturbing atmospheres and a bizarre sensuality (such as José Larraz "Vampyres" or Harry Kümmel's "Daughters of Darkness"). Joseph Sarno's film offers nothing but a lot of free evolution, which is also boring. This incident is hidden in an old castle, hidden deep in the German mountains, and in the past five years it has been barren and brutal (literally). His loyal disciples can cast naked dancing parties in the castle catacombs, when AUCH swells with pencils and they hope to resurrect the Baroness at any time. Suddenly (nor even asked) the castle is full of young and sexy guests, so they continue to experience more pains. It looks wonderful and entertaining, but "The Devil's Plaything" is a lot of sequel, literally nothing happens and just where the cast's facial expressions are just for nothing! Sarno has not been able to create a suspense or build a Gothic atmosphere (or it might not have been disappointed) and the actors' faculties are left in front of the camera to face the topless face and to make it really pathetic. Please, do it for yourself: you are desperately trying to see all the lesbian-vampire movies of the 70s, this is not a penny! Jess Franco and Jean Rollin's repertoires are just art.
