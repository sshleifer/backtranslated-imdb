All children ages 14-16 want to watch this movie (you only accept at age 18). They hear it's a terrifying movie and they feel very well when they see it. I am very sad that children can not see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Each scene you watch in this movie is a copy of another movie. And at the end? The end is open ... why? It's impossible to get out of a stupid story. The movie frightens you, and if you're a bit smart and know something about music, you know exactly where you are afraid. <br /> <br /> When the movie was over and they turned to my friend and they told me (a bit aloud) all that money was useless, a stupid maid seemed strange to me. Today, I can create an Oscar movie for my fish fish, if I use it right for marketing.
