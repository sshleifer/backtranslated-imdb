I'm a fan of Lucio Fulci; Many Giallo and Splatter films are among my favorites of my time, but for television, this is very similar and I have not come up with the excellent Italian director. The movie is not interesting, like Fulci's Giallo's more frequent or a panic like most of his classic worship; Thus, it is missing in the two main areas and, in the end, it certifies that the film is not very good. The film has been used in advance from a plot of land that has been used several times, but it is still an interesting idea that generates an interesting story, because it is aimed at the theme of popular life, the last known one. This film focuses on Giorgio Mainardi; A man who does not like it and the stomach after apparently killing hemorrhage does not let many people go sad. This means that his ghost is trapped somewhere between life and life, and therefore he decides to try at the bottom of his death, and his only ally is the daughter. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie as a movie that is proud of its "HP Lovecraft Style", which is one of the most important attempts to sell a movie I've ever seen. There is nothing in this reminder of the great horror writer of this story, and the reason for this reason is much better than Stuart Gordon / Lovecraft's similarity to the movie "From Beyond". The movie gets the benefit of Italian style and the score is pretty good. Unfortunately, however, Fulci is well-known for burning in every scene, and so the subject becomes annoying. The earth plays in a very boring manner, and most scenes are looking for ghosts "desperately", or the daughter's suspicions of her family members. This film was made for Italian television, so it is not surprising that they preferred it. There is a little gore with a zombie and a nightmare sequence; But this is not known and we love Fulci. In general, this film is very wrong and not a good representation of Fulci's talents. Do not get bored at work, if you are Fulci full.
