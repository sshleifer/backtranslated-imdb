William Shatner is a small dose of sustainability. Unfortunately, being a small character rather than leaving his character and fun, seemed to increase the role and abuse. As was the original Star Trek series. I never think that I am not understanding American humor, it often goes beyond the "above" message. I throw my feet. I do not see the show, because it's embarrassing, the rest of the casts are good. Shatner's role is also a blame for James Spader's behavior. In most cases, however, they prove how society will go by. I do not do the same routes. Frank
