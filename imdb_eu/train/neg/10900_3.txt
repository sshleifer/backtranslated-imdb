You can not keep it up against it for four days, and I still hoped it was fashionable. (It's not all in real campy, except for Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, except that they do not seriously take the rest of the cast right in the middle, Riley Smith is a bad exception.) The story is really ridiculous. pay attention, what kind of surprised me; I assimilated the main goal of these horizontally-anticipated films with a fantasy of sexual fantasy and I did not condemn the story, but they use a lot of words such as "much technological" and "physicality". cross his point. (Even though the story may be important for explaining why there are few partners), it's important. No one talks about that foolish story, and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mockery of cultures and soft homoeroticism. They are not so sharp. I'd rather like to have them more if they were just a few random casualties. It is a grainy movie, with a television quality look and a theater level. There are some "sexy" scenes well - when boys are in bed, feeling themselves; Or make orgasmic ties and faces while flushing wine - and some of them are fun. And I liked the findings made by L. Ron Hubbard and the story of religious worshipers who reflected on live guitar, but it's still not good. 3/10
