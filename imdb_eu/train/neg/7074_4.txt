My god the movie is very boring. I am a fan of Gina Gershon and I expected a romantic drama that I rented this movie, and a great performance by Gershon. Gershon is always big enough, but he does not play the right role for a good role, because Rade is very good for Serbetti. The love between Gershonen and Serbedzia's characters is not very sure. I absolutely hated the character of Serbie (the winner) and, nevertheless, it is not a wonderful film. How did Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) begin to transcend my understanding? Maybe Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro, or Harrison Ford would do a better job, but they do not guess the appearance of Europeans. In any case, I was bored with the movie. If you are looking for a good movie by Gina Gershon, see Bound, so far, his best movie. If you are looking for a romantic movie about a young woman and an older man, try Harrison Ford or Sean Connery. Gina Gershon is so low and deserves a better chance than this. I want to make a better future in the future.
