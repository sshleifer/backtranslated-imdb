ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth (ninth) series of the series and shows his direction inevitably. The characters of ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and JUDGE HARDY (Lewis Stone) were in front and in the middle. The rest of the team just paced the clock and checked it. The series would once again happen and have their moments, but it has been a serious decline. <br /> <br /> Lewis Stone in all series continued to reflect JUDGE HARDY's character in a pleasant way. The rest of the cast would be professionals, although they are getting less and less. On the other hand, Mickey Rooney would continue his character as if he were not learning curricula. The reaction in any ANDY situation was naive and unbelievable. He returned as a veteran service of World War II, LOVE LAUGHS AT ANDY HARDY (1946), but his "reaction to retaliation" was the same, the youngest. <br /> <br /> This film is clearly illustrated. . ANDY makes several situations credible so it can be solved with a simple explanation. This screen-writing device was known as "plot idiota". A way to extend the misspelled scenario. Maybe it was the fault of Mickey Rooneys, the director and the writers. Probably, George Seitz directed it too much and Rooney's control of excesses was more robust. To see the general view of the series, go single young man (1937).
