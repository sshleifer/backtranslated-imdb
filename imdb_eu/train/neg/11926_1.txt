I rarely move on to make these kinds of comments, but I'm sitting in most movie movies, I feel what I feel about what I really feel. I could not really adapt to the end, and I had two or more tens (about a third of the audience) in a rough plot, with wonderful conversations and aggressive characterization. This movie does not create any art. no style and substance. immense performance, real script, weighty cinematography and weighing the student's production levels. The mystery for me is how to finance it, it started and it ended. I bet you, a million fees, the release goes in general. The right critics would be torn. bad movie bad. It really is a really poor effort that is ETA, although it does not mention the spoonful of natively-kitten-get-drop-free spoons. absolutely absurd, totally light, poorly assembled; This movie is a scary thing.
