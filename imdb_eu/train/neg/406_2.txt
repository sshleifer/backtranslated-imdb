The rumors of this movie have always been the wonderful graphics that disappear from Kevin Bacon. Unfortunately they stopped there. The script had to disappear, then the set of films and, finally, all the visible elements of this film. In fact, there are no other exhibits. <br /> <br /> Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe appear as a credit for writing in this film. I do not think they exist. I think that this script has been purchased by "Scripts-R-Us", where you buy a standard "Monster Movie" script and fill in the gaps. There is a monster crossing. Split (Really "let's split" in this movie). Hit Alien / Giant-bug / Monster / Invisible-man crowbar. He is not dead yet. Revitalize the giant rabbit / Platoon / Invisible man, in an inanimate fire. He is not dead yet. You know, the standard. The number of minimal elements on an invisible man (IR glasses, which were thrown out of paint) were poorly managed. <br /> <br /> It is sad that there were many opportunities to make this wonderful movie. Psychological problems related to the subject, the process of the spirit as an invisible subject matter, and other ideas usually less than 2 seconds and much more interesting. In the end, if Kevin Bacon wanted to save him, the movie was much better. In the end, it's stunk. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie I would mention some very stupid items, but I do not want to spoil it. They think these characters are so stupid, but they do not think about connecting a machine ...
