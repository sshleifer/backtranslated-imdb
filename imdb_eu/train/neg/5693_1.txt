I can not believe the positive reviews of this movie - I thought the worst movie I've ever seen was misunderstood and misunderstood. And the plot was completely playful (sp?). When the chair is starting to be joined together? puh-lease The worst portion was not bad at all, in a stupid and stupid way. Being very strange, I could not understand why they showed him about HBO. Belushi was foolishly stupid - they were very credible as "weird men". idk, I could continue - again, I'm happy with positive reviews. The only thing that kept me looking at was that the movie that seems fascinate might go wrong and what makes it bad. And at the end it was not disappointed. "live the sword, killing the sword ..." ridiculous.
