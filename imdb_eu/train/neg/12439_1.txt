The first "Home Alone" was one of the funniest movies in the 90s. The second was fun with the same cast and jokes! Now comes "Home Alone 3". It was curious how to continue with the same story, considering that it had 17 in 1997. He could take care of him, right? So what decides the director? A child is annoying and ill. Does the child take 6 years and only leaves the mother at home? What a hack burgers are these stupid ones? I really do not want to get too much detail if you want to see this movie unfortunately. Please, I'd advise you to stay away. You do not deserve your precious time. Go to paper folding, work, pencil or nose! It's better to watch "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
