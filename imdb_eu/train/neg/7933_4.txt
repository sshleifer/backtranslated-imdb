Randolph Scott's great fan, but this movie is shy. The whole thing has a bulk, fake, sound sensation with a huge screen on the back screen. A good graphic idea that has been buried in scriptwriters' writings, which does not allow the viewers to immerse themselves in this action and to take care of all the characters. Management is a pedestrian and it only increases the scripts to help it improve. I saw a very pleasant "stage sound" before, but this is not one of them. It's all about Scott's / Boetticher's films being much appreciated. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott tosses, cuts and smiles a million dollars. It's always a pleasure ... even in its shortest film. With the exception of Scott, I wanted to see this movie, the main reason why I liked Wymore Mrs. Errol Flynn's "Rocky Mountian" movie. It's just as handsome as "Man Behind the Gun" and you can say it's a good actress, but he has had to say a few lines, and the director's blockade is horrible. I only saw Phil Carey in the "Pacific Operation", and he plays the same character here ... the proud pain he intends to inscribe. I think it's a good actress ... he hated me. There seems to be some comical reliefs with comical relief, which, in my opinion, only removes the movie. Although there are many elements to bump into it, I have to say that I really enjoy playing both Spanish songs in music numbers ... but that's not why we're going to go Randolph Scott, right? <br /> <br /> Scotten films are worse, which, of course, is not overwhelming, but, of course, it can not be considered anymore.
