I'm not a great fan of Star Trek, but I'm waiting for that. I used the previous descriptions of the Enterprise I used, its maritime tightening technologies and the sharp differences between technology. <br /> <br /> I did not see any interest. this rider I found the plot to be confusing and confusing. <br /> <br /> I admit that I liked a character development. Humans were entertaining as they were ready to go out to their youngsters. <br /> <br /> And Vulcan Babe had a horrible rack. <br /> <br /> But I do not think it's about joining this series. <br /> <br /> 3/10
