A black man fights ... and believes he won ... yes ... 1/10. Of course, fiction. <br /> <br /> So, we will present a beautiful title, a real label and a nice plot of land ... That's when it's the ending place. We got into the fiction <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Michael Jai White, black, so do not get confused with the name ... portrays a black man .. Umm, everything is called .. <br /> <br /> Finding a decent help is so difficult, that it has been hired by black friends to make a small budget, with little loss of this film, when you see the camera shadow in the first scene ... An average guy like me, an guy like me and me ... but yes ... <br /> <br /> 10 lines. review submitted. If you have paid for viewing this movie, you are wrong.
