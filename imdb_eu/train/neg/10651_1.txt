Do you want to know the secret to work a Slasher movie at a fitness center? Just out the movie out beautiful clothes for ladies super workout outfits and tie them and grind them to the floor as they are in a knights club. This is the slasher of this horrifying film makers and the little gimmick that came to the end of the observation. The slasher movie I've ever seen is the worst, but whenever I was willing to change the channel, I would add another scene to the workout girls and I stopped. Slasher as a movie, Killer Workout fails in all categories. As a showcase for beautiful girls, it's a success story. Highly recommendable hides, unless half of the movie is considered a great T & A.
