The explosion of television channels should be appreciated forever to the Randolph Scott Western production line, at any time because Randolph Scott has a similar film to at least one quote of at least one film station. <br /> <br /> "Man behind the gun" is a typical melodrama of the early 1950s, based on the values ​​of the previous WWII production, based on a mysterious plot of historically current murder. . Over the next few years, these films will be screened through TV shows such as 'Gunsmoke', 'Bonanza' and so on, and they really did a better job. Randolph Scott, who sees something particularly grumpy, is good at fighting for the bad guys who will eventually prevail. He does not feel more emotionally than the horse's sentiment, because if he asks if he asks if he will misunderstand the initial female head. Music is a stronger indicator of the emotional state of being "characters". But it is well if your boat floats; and I would not be able to "diagnose, murder," either. <br /> <br /> Career, pedestrians and aging quickly. 3 stars to be able to be united; 0 for artistic effort.
