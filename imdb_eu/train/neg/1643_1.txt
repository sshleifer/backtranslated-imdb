"Sanctioned" is one of the most amazing movies of all time. In 2000, more than any theater was a hateful piece of garbage, also called "The Grinch". As people have called, it is not a profound portrayal of modern relationships. That would be a small movie called "High Fidelity". While the movie was honest and handsome, "whipped" cinematic poisons are hostile, cynical and misanthropic. Avoid as many pests, if you do not want to see a "comedy" really bad.
