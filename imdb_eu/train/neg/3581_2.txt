I have not decided to decide whether or not this movie is very good or, to mention Enid Coleslaw, "it was so bad it was a good time and it was again bad". No matter, he forced me to look in much the same way, a strange color vomit stroke, and we offer you a variety of scenes, even if you do not like it. Ray Liotta sneering a young girl as a pig pig has told his creative writing trophy as a penis. A little later, Ray is again, who prevents Pia, and not in a garden-like fashion trophy. She is firmly determined to say what she said to her mother, who wants to get acquainted with Rayen's father. Here is the actor of the cemetery of the best line written by Pia or other people: "WWWWHHHYYYYYYY!" This garden sleeve is back, because Pia waves his face and roars "Is your favorite?" Pia and her date are so activated by other masticating salads that begin to break into each other's clothes. Pia is showered, but she is oblivious to her dress. Maybe the best is Pia's headset, but the heads are the ones who talk about the mini-speakers instead (most of them I was afraid to open my laptop). And finally, Pia is "revealing" the Hollywood pond in "The Awards". The second best part is whispering, "I think I have never been the only one to wear at the top level." I've known for a while that I have commented on "The Lonely Lady", as I have better than better than I have. But be confessed that when you see it, you will probably not be able to take your eyes off the screen until it disappears for two hours permanently.
