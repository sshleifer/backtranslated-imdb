I was tired of this movie, I felt the need to warn others. This movie has no story, no plot or no clear purpose. The movie starts with the standard entry "be scary scary", because all the watchmakers are accustomed to it. So we can completely reject the beginning. Soon we have been introduced to the main actor and from this point it is clear that you are losing your hard earnings and looking better to look static. (Unless you see the white noise - EEK) Order is OUTDOOR and all should come back to pantomime. That said, the best actors in the world would also fight this movie remotely. Their bad stances affect the catastrophe. The writing of some of the "weird" writers who are not violent and I'm just supposed to create is a movie that will surely prove your patience. When my viewer turned to me, he said: "We realized this 45 minute observation" I noticed this movie without a cup of tea like thin tea and taste. It is clear that something was missing and unfortunately there was no audience. Instead of suggesting that the movie is missing, let me tell you what it is: Dumb Blonde, victims, monster-things, a story about 2 hours, hours, days, weeks, months. ... and credits. <br /> <br /> Do you want a silver cover? Well, the blonde girl is a little bit busty looking for some scenes, but hopes to rip her face to the rest of the movie!
