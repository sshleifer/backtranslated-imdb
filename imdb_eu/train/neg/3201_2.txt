Joe Don Baker is a good actress here and here in small roles ... Goldeneye was well and Bond made a good villain in The Living Daylights and in many other films. One thing he can not do is directing a film, that is, Malta is a very bad revenge in this film. Joe Don's killing dies to kill the killer's murderer and the murderer goes to Italy, but some men are fleeing to the plane and the killer escapes. In the rest of the film, Joe Don looks after the murderer, Joe Don takes care of him several times, Joe Don tortures and interrupts a barman. The movie is pretty bad and you do not need to come out correctly for Joe Don's character. You'll be surprised how many heroes Joe Don and how randomly he is. The supreme part of the film consists of killing Joe Don with the murderer in Malta, the murderer enters a priestly dress and then ships and runs across Malta. This movie also has one of the worst lines to close the movie.
