Everyone who has read my review, "Alone en la oscura" by Uwe Boll, will remember that the hair that is reversed in the uneducated bends that was sitting on this human waste. Well, take this analogy a step closer to the rough channel, and try not to think about taking your teeth out. Do this and you will have a general idea about what is all about Eli Roth's "Cabin Fever". <br /> <br /> I never think that a film could not overcome the unfortunate dizziness that Uwe Boll will leave. as the "worst film ever made". But, honestly, I have to say that "Cabin Fever" is very close. This is another sad excuse for cinematic film that has not been the perfect reason to fully meet theatrical release. Eli Rothe has created somebody who loves the horror genre, because of the unique patch of a movie that I have seen throughout my life. How can you undo such a story? Think of this plot without the characters without written misguided characters, without any unnecessary and unnecessary comedy. A movie about a grotesque worm virus, Rothe could be much better than what we put here. This script has failed with me on several levels. And, undoubtedly, I have no doubt about the clear talent I have of this director, I definitely know that the ball could have had a horrible horror genre. <br /> <br /> Saying that producing lost chances would be a rough word. It can not be overwhelmed with many blood and special effects, and it's usually an element I am. There was really no "Cabin Fever" anyone could easily recommend to me. When three quarters of the people leave the theater, you know that the movie is fast hanging. The best advice for those who read this would be to rent before the purchase. One view was more than enough for me, I would not worry about it anymore.
