I tried to roll this movie twice and even tried to redirect it to two more times, but I still could not finish it. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how good this movie really received reviews. I believe that those who give their opinions to the market just try to get the hypothesis of the film. Their review looks very realistic and looks like an interior job, which is a wonderful thing. Pelicans must get positive comments on their steam or not. <br /> <br /> The play was reminiscent of the movie porno movie, and not in a fun way. I do not like those who have low-budget films to know if they play a bad performance. <br /> <br /> The main character seemed irritating to me. His facial expressions and humor were the baby. I thought the women's conspiracy was more enjoyable and created, but worse still. <br /> <br /> The script was too confusing (for bosses for business conferences) and unnoticed remarks. <br /> <br /> I found nothing about this short film than some of these attractive women <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I never felt that this rating was misleading. I was interested in her premises, but everything else was scared. Of course, if you want to, but I do not want others to be hopeless or waste. <br /> <br /> Maybe I alone ... Maybe not.
