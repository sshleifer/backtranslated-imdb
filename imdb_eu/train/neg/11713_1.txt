One only warning ... The worst film I've ever seen is ... I can not see the end ... It's just ... I'm sorry I've finished Snipes. create that movie There's really not much to say about that. Awesome play, very bad lines, story, everything. The only reason you would recommend watching this movie is to see how you should have a movie. To say one scene: the police are looking for Snipes, and the building is circling the helicopter and cars, they are shooting around the building, but they are still whispering that Snipes does not suspect.
