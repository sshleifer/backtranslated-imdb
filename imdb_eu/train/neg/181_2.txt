Ah, Channel 5 local t.v. Every day, from 2:00 pm on, the Horror films start at the beginning of the 70s and 2000s. The back movie was "Return To Cabin By The Lake". I'm sorry I'm watching. <br /> <br /> "The Lake by the Lake" was originally a low budget and was acceptable. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not necessarily funny, and imitates the original. Ugh. The earth is completely stupid in the whole sense of the word. <br /> <br /> The movie is a soap operas at some points, due to absurd conversations, cinematography and direction. <br /> <br /> My advice is: avoid this at all costs. It is a movie that can not be seen by anyone. Not half-heartedly for fans of filmmakers. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
