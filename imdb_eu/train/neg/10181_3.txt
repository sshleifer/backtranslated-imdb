This movie is very bad, it's fun. Scott Backula is a coach but it's not important. It is important that blacks that play on the 1st floor. First of all, he must be at least 75 years old, he still plays league baseball below, but in the second, he starts out of the movie, though he is not able to walk, run less. The coach of Backula moves brilliantly to mention it first, trying to execute it in the same place for a long time. The backlash shows the excellent coaching strategy (SPOILER) of the film, which could attack a domestic star "downtown", clearly saw that it was a "good city center" movement. He entered the home and won the match for his team, the small league team that played the twins, were the classes of the film. Now Tony Muser, manager of Royals, was a smart Backula coach and would only say to the players in the home run on all the cyclists, Royal never lost an inning game.
