OK ... This is the third in the carnosaur series. Puppets with dinosaur puppets! If you see Dino's cause at the start of the movie, when you start counting the body, you can only see Dino's eye-catching eyes, to hide the cute puppets! and maybe 16 minutes later, the special team with Scott Valentine, Scott Valentine Rance, in the film, joins the group after the Dino Rampage, after joining the warehouse and collecting parts and dead bodies. You can miss the group and you can hear the speed reactor, quite incredibly !!! and then a black girl goes ahead and now there is a blockage! A raptor's hand appears and his face cut off, but when the raptor pauses when you take your hand, can you see that it is a manual puppet? WTF! The story is easy. 1. Some terrorist attacks cause trucks by some trucks to clear their weapons. 2. There are dead dead ten tons of raptor and a giant t-Rex. How was t-rex there? 3. Some Rance and Nerds will kill some dinosaurs! Unfortunately, a blond and stupid girl told him one of them: (4th St. Jesue's predators have their deeds with wheels!) 5. Dinoa is aboard now in peace. 6: Strange I do not know that. 7. Rex has a strange thing in her neck. FINAL A good movie if you want to laugh, 5/10
