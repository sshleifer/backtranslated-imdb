Standard monster rate for "Painted Numbers", filled with a bundle of superb films on the movie frames. It was like someone who had a cartoon backpack drawn from the other envelopes, mixed up and distributed. However, the lines and characters of the agreement were created in the script. <br /> <br /> The characters are so topical, "you can guess who ends up as a monster meal" in the game you can play in less than ten minutes and surely each to the right ... including the order that will be consumed. Many characters are so bad that you can close these creatures. Some of the main characters are the clown Billy Idol, the bankrolls, the captain Ahab, a boy brat fluttering, the vendor, and the Ahab girlfriend who barks in a bar. O, and a big and big beast that needs beast management therapy. <br /> <br /> A lot of people on the road argue, they're pretty girls teasing shirts and couples make exotic beaches, blasting. They occur, the ruins of a hermitage appear, and the greasy faces fall by pirates. <br /> <br /> With great difficulty, most of all, but one of the things that confused me: the disturbance of the characters that killed other people. After a violent rape, they play a one-liner. I almost heard the photo shots. <br /> <br /> Generally, well, if you take away 90 minutes of waste, you want to laugh and make a great movie. Otherwise, you can skip this.
