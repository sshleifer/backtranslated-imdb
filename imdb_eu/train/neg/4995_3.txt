I found a real task to sit through this film. The sound was not the best and some accents were hard to understand what it was said. There was little to move around the plot and often stopped the action and a long time of interviewing seemed strange to him. These dialogues that changed between family groups and the observer combined those that linked ordinary threads. It's strange that I value a bass movie, and in this case I have been thinking about "what's the point" of the whole look and "what time I lost time".
