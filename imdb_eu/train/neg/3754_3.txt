As a long-haul of all Star Trek series, I found this wonderful section, and I think that the liberal use of "flashbacks" Will Riker's beliefs, both positive (and romantic), and negative (many pain). and the death of a crew) was a money-saving device, as well as many "bottle shows" (when all the scenes take place in Enterprise). Diana Muldaur (who appeared at least twice in the original series) deserved a better appearance for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. Loyal viewers (Star Trek also have other types in the world?) They also changed. It was the last episode of the second season; Thus, the season ended with "not a bang" but "in the end".
