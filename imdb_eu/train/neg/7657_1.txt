There should be a rule, clearly, that movies like Resident Evil should be made in the spirit of the game, in a spirit that does not reflect as much as possible. RE was a horror game that survived, and that's why it was effective, but Paul WS Anderson came in just like any other video game movie. Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of spirit as Resident Evil, so the director is a little experiment that can make a horror movie and not make a movie action. Instead, Alone in the Dark proves that there is no longer any hope of becoming video games. <br /> <br /> The land, of course, does not matter, is the most important problem. with the movie. The movies begin to be described as just a five-minute scroll text, and after a minute, the viewer stays in custody and sits only by clicking on the closest object. Then there are some orphanages, some objects, an ancient tribe, bureaucracy and some demons, and all of them mix together so that the audience can not really do it. Characters get into the plot and they are like candy. Basically, I understand that some demons have been released, and Edward Carnby (Slater) has a connection with them for their operation with their orphaned children. He finds an object that implies a demon and brings him to an anthropologist (Reid), a girlfriend, who is not directly motivated with sex. Then, nowhere, hell is released and the pair end with a military team led by a commander of the actor (Dorff), apparently Carnby hates each other. <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous, and I do not understand why it's really hard and confusing, but no one can really take care of the place. Instead, I highly recommend you to watch this movie, bring it to a mix of tennis ball or something to play on the plot of the occupation. <br /> <br /> The action of the movie action is horrible with a plot, at least this should bring a little, right? Very bad, it is similar to any other joke made with this film, with quick spoiling of chunks. That is based on a horror game, though not an action game, it is especially annoying. <br /> <br /> Cranby is one of the first actions of a man that follows a taxi that is never seen from the scene. , and the rest is not too great. The demons are quite fresh, even though they die when they kill them. There are scenes that can be seen to watch a lot of guns, at the end of which the fire is the only source of light and faster than the camera's intelligence. At night, the baby makes creams that keep the baby in bed. <br /> <br /> I would like to call the actors actors and I did not do anything. Slater does not have any major sound for the whole movie, although it seems to have more talent than it does. The same goes for Dorff, despite his talent to thank himself (something that often happened). Reid, almost exactly what she should have, the back of the sexual appeals, is a disaster at every time she tries to play it (initially an incredibly bad starter). <br /> <br /> All, this is the type of movie that worries me about future video games. If this kind of spirit continues to deteriorate, it's only time to die with the AK-47 before killing Samus Aran midway out and Tommy Vercetti is struggling with a foreign squadron. Unlike Resident Evil, however, this is not a deserving second chance, I do not think it could not help but forget how horrible this movie is. Bland is uninteresting and unexciting. This is the equivalent of the diarrhea. everything is thrown together, nothing fits well, and in the end, you're just happy. <br /> TOTAL: 4%
