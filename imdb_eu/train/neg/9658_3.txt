God, what a horrible movie! Mel Gibson's movie scene reminded me that "when we were soldiers," the company does not lose, they simply cut off. "And when other British scene officials in Pearl Harbor call it Ben Affleck," Americans like you, then God helps the nation with America! <br /> <br /> Put all three movies together and you will have enough to fertilize BULLSHIT Sahara Desert. <br /> <br /> The story of the cut-out battleship may be enough, but the movie could do without American Jingoistic propaganda preaching. They had horror rumors in the movie Pearl Harbor scene. ) The lost battalion, however, is in a class of itself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> I was really scorched and I approached myself in this morning catastrophe (this is the film) <br /> <br /> Fight scenes well done (for these 3 stars) but they are scripts The manure, then wrapped in a brightly colored ribbon, is still a manure. Other writers such as James Carabatsos wrote: Hamburger Hill, No Mercy, Heartbreak Ridge, someone please write it down earlier. <br /> < br /> Russell Mulcahy is also Australian director. God, shame!
