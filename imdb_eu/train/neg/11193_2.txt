Okay, I did not have much hope, but I could not imagine that I could not download this movie. <br /> <br /> The land that got underway, a priest of a 2-member command that investigates the creator's killer. Order made by Sin Eater. The Catholic Sin Eater makes it impossible for us to obtain salvation outside of the church's control and also with another illegitimate movie. Do not make any sense, then, the Baptist could give salvation ... we will move forward. <br /> <br /> I divide it on the floor or leave it far away: the priest goes to Rome to invest with his friend. He will bring with himself a sick head (I do not do that) to shoot at an excorism and who loves him (BTW is without his nose), as an Irish priest who drinks and as a cardinal Peter Weller. They arrive in Rome, they have found some terrible kids who do nothing in the movie, anyone who meets an anti-potato S & M Irish boy knows (it's not explained) and who gives the information to the people they killed (oh, BTW, it's a bad guy. industrial band / techno) then ... umm, seriously, I do not know. It is a meander on the plot. With Sin Eater heated with Heath, he fled to New York with King Eater for the travelers, and then there were other things (all the cameras) the anti-Pope fell and the film ended. <br /> <br /> About an hour movie is asking 1 something that really happened. In the end, something has happened, but you can no doubt be irrelevant, and most drama before cheating or off-screaming really cheats you.
