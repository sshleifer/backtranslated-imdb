This film became one of the 10 greatest films of my cinema. Amazing. <br /> <br /> There was not a continuous minute, it was not fighting with a monster or another. There was no possibility of developing any nature, he was busy busy with one sword fight. I did not have an emotional attachment except those who wanted to destroy them <br /> <br /> Scenes stole from other films, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> Examples <br /> <br /> Finally, the fantasy scene, the latest Star Wars scene stole Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /> <br />> In the beginning, the spider machine was similar to Frodo who froze Frodo's King's lap. (The victims of Elijah Wood are in two films) and wait ...... the hypnotist and gathering victims ..... hello ????? <br /> <br />> And the whole machine vs. man's subject was Matrix..o Terminator ... <br /> <br /> There are more examples but why do you lose time? And someone told me about the Nazi ?!?! Nazi in ???? <br /> <br /> The story of the youth was aimed at the youth achievement. The film could not decide if it was a movie for children's or adult's movie. <br /> <br /> Just incredibly. At least, a real disappointment. Save your money.
