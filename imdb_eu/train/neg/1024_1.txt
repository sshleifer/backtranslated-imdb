I watched this movie at the Toronto Film Festival with great expectations. The film has good results and the festival is closing, so it's good, right? how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> I knew that when we had problems, when the director talked about the film, when he directed a section of the scholar, he made an unknown actor Kevin Spacey (director of wiseguy and writer). debut = blah) ... well, Edison's director / writer Kevin Spacey has to have some sharp pictures that have killed a homeless man, because I do not see how that way (along with all the other actors in the movie) would be in any way to agree. disaster <br /> <br /> This movie is totally awesome! I'd like to mix a hard klix that was made on several occasions. Edison has nothing new. It was a bad performance and the direction was even worse. It seems similar to the aforementioned knowledge. This is the best video I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Some examples of Edison's sloppy moments ... a free wizard dancing in his apartment, music music without reason ... justin timberlake as his creative creative criticism is surrounded by his apartment. candles ... guiding a llcoolj fire ... 3 guys from the movie ... <br /> <br /> It's a real opposite movie. <br /> <br /> LEARN EDISON!
