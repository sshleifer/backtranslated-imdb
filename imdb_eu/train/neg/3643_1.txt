I know very well that there is no statistical correction between video game and real violence. The movie is a false and false one, in itself contradicting itself, that is, what I wanted to emphasize in my original review. The movie fails, I guess it's not necessarily that kids have played video games, but sets the movie as "random" and does not continue. Light me up In Aileen: The life and death of a Serial Killer, you can see the claims made by the police and control the radio waves is ridiculous, but it is so confusing that it is true. The viewer can make a distinction. In Zero Day, the two children continue to have an effect on the environment, which is obviously false in everything they say. Neonationism, along with CNN, is with Wolf Blitzer (that is, because he does not know his name, but the filmmaker is a shameless attempt to cover his bad movie). This movie does not show 'reality', it's only a phonetic to prove a point. Unfortunately you have been silent and you have not seen it and you have not received my reviews. The film takes over the hypothesis of Michael Moore and hopes to validate the application of something "real life" and fails because the hypothesis is wrong, but the movie is wrong and does not support it. Of course, I do not think that children who play video games have more opportunities to kill people, but if I do not do it wrong, the Columbin children's (or young killer) video tape is not shooting guns in the woods. Did you look or act like Doom's weapons? Hmmmmmm, the distinction that children are aware of is the media, but it is, of course, obviously balanced or intelligent. Zero Day is a bad movie, I think that there is a correlation, but the filmmaker does not know what it means and the film accepts even more. Almost almost all the ratings given to video games are so distasteful that they came back to replace Zero Day. If you want to see teenage theory 'mindless' theory directly, see Bully.
