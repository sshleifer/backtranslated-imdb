SPOILERS THROUGHS: <br /> <br /> Gettaway is primarily an action movie. And what action is there! Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and much more. They are similar to Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin Mc Coy. <br /> <br /> This is a remake and I have not seen the original, but I was not responsible for Bassenger and Baldwin's nice screen. chemistry But the movie itself is not for me. <br /> <br /> Gettaway was really hard at work. Plots are followed by one another, and as they are undergoing violence, Bassenger and Baldwin maintain a wonderful look, regardless of their dangers. In fact, when they finish the movie, they look more BETTER. I do not think that Bassenger's eye make-up is moving everywhere in the whole frame. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not very good and it's not a clean-up movie. I can not see this film enjoying it, because there is not much here. Gettaway is not so original and goes to unnecessary brutal. In my opinion, it's better to think. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Bassenger and Baldwin perform their performances well, but they do not have much to do. Sometimes it's less, the same thing is seen once again. I did not like that much.
