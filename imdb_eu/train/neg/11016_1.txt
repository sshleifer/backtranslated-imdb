Imagine Saturday Night Live and Mad TV's awesome tournament in a 90-minute movie. Now, think that the humor of these dirty little ones is replaced by stupidity. Now think about something 50 times worse. <br /> <br /> Got that? <br /> <br /> Now you can see the underground comedy movie. Simply, the vision you've had seems to be the fun ever. UCM is the worst movie I've ever seen. A few laughs ... they were very few. But they were hands. The goals of the film should be hand-held, so that it was fun. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I'm losing my only reason, I know I bought it from someone else. He squandered money. Vince offers nothing to write or correct and it is not surprising why.
