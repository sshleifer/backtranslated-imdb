Why why nobody can make a decent movie from the mythical story? It's the second adaptation of "Beowulf". I was disappointed for a year. It has to be said that the previous version ("Beowulf and Grendel", featuring Gerald Butler) was much higher. That was disappointed. This is a mess! <br /> <br /> What is it for me? Which were not added to specific reasons (human conflicts, no interest in love?), Or CGI bad, or unnecessary plots against characters or unrelated inspiration? It's even worse if Marina Sirtis looks so beautiful! And do not you even talk about that clay beam? <br /> <br /> And why they reminded us that Beowulf had 30 men's strength, and yet never showed the whole movie. He fought two monsters that fought him, helping his companions to save their bacon. Even when he was captured, he did not expel. He was much more dependent on weapons. It's like beo-wimp. This is undoubtedly the powerful Beowulf of the epic poem! <br /> <br /> I would like to finish this in a positive note, but I can not think it any worse. I can tell if you read "Beowulf", you will be disappointed that the excuse for making an adaptation will be a mistake!
