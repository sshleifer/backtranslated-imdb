When I first made the premiere I commented and they gave me a "mid-cancer" review, I would definitely benefit from the question beyond doubt in the first part. I have now donated six points in June 2006. And Batman, as a fanatic for the rest of his life, can definitely say: this show is pure. <br /> <br /> Everything is wrong. Everything. After overcoming animation and mumble designs, stories get mixed up and do not develop any personality or give any story that the secretary of this writer is interested in. <br /> <br /> And in the name of God ... It's just for me, or is Joker EPISODE EVERY at all? Gotham rotating door is a great legal system? Or, again, there is no interest in the writers to strive for other criminals (see "there is no character development", above all). <br /> <br /> And to make things worse, the Joker is the same formula as the story 3. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker gases. <br /> <br /> 2) Joker intends to make the whole city gas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh. <br /> <br /> I saw a passage that was not Joker's story. The title escapes for me, but the evil Cluemaster ... ask the episode "Think Thank Thunk". That's the worst Batman I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse, "Batman got My Basement." <br /> <br /> I can not say what I feel about this show, probably because it's against the ToS, but it starts with "B" and rhymes "fastardization". Thank you for the existence of Timm / Dini / etc. The time of entertaining, Fox and Kids WB days back. We put it right, and I should know it, unfortunately I could not last forever.
