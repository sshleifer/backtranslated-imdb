I first saw "Shades" (only) in a Sneakpreview. There was no premiere. I remember there is one of the managers' staffs, nor even remember them. It was a Belgian movie, we never heard, so we were neutral, without knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a great actor and is ahead of all the rest. He plays an actor with a horrible star. A Belgian film helps make a movie called "Shades". <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie starts, notice how sworn it is. There is nothing against this template. However, the annoyances were not far away. When Rourke uses F *** to express something, it comes naturally. However, someone of a cast, when an English-speaking speaker does not use the word F **** or S ***, becomes ruthless and aggressive. <br /> <br /> They quickly miss out on the lost amount, as many times as F and S words. Everyone was happy outside the theater. We had to give a vote, but it was difficult for us only between 0 and 10, and -10 we are looking for.
