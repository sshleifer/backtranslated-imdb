Vampire's henchman calls her five-dollar hooker in love after a very low budget horror comedy. I can not explain all the positive comments in this movie. I record over the masses, but it is confusing. The only useful factor (and this being a very generous here) may be a grandfather who is the only half-liked person in turmoil. Do not waste money or time. Actually, here's a tip, if it's put on a Troma DVD, but it does NOT do it, it's probably crap. <br /> <br /> Additional Troma DVD: Omar and Kirk commentary; second comments cast and crew deleted scenes; Bertsolaris: interactive troma; radiation march; Clips "Terror Firmer"; Theater trailer; "Rowdy Girls", "Teenage Catgirls in Heat", "Cannible: The Musical" and "Avenger Toxic 4" Tracks <br /> <br /> My grade: D
