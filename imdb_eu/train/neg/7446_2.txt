There are 2 words for you. Sean Bean. This movie is a unique presence worth the effort. But still, do not miss this movie. Even though it is the most wicked one, you do not want to waste your time. <br /> <br /> I do not like the characters (except the boy) and, indeed, I did not care if the lovers of the intersection fell together or died. The movie did not take care of me or I LOVED people who looked after each other. I have read a lot of "classic novels" to watch movies and then I did not want to read this book. The story is so boring. But I will continue and I will read the story to free myself. <br /> <br /> Stop Lorna Doone. The actress Lorna played was Sense and Sensibility, which was much better. Watch Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E has some great novels like Pride and Prejudice. Or a miniseries like Forsyte Saga. Check it out, do not worry about Lorna Doone.
