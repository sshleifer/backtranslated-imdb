Well, when the appearance of Jason Miller's appearing (even more exorcist than Exorcist IV) is at the top of a photo, what did you get? <br /> <br /> It's a small country, a bit of a rock n 'roll: when the money of two drunkards are shuffled when they move their children, with baby bundles (still thought you stuck?), the basement, bad Christopher Walken They have been working on ink and have developed a girl that could be of interest. <br /> <br /> I understand ... however, they have returned to visit their relatives. After that ... <br /> <br /> Problem: There are some flashbacks (I think) about what I need to kill a mother in a bombing car. This is never connected to anything. <br /> <br /> The problem: what does it need for the grandmother? Now, the grandmother might be interesting. Irish or Celtic or something. Maybe you can do something. The best thing to do is to have tobacco habits. That's it. <br /> <br /> Problem: they create a shameless character as their husband. Does he write (Does he sell his wife to the devil? Maybe he might wait with a trusted trustworthy fund), or he's throwing it in a different way (after all, he has a hair cut and a beautiful outfit)? He drinks it, he questions it. It's not bad Not good But impossible. Why did not they do something with her? <br /> <br /> No problem: an old friend will appear. Husband goes down. He is back to destroy his husband. (It makes them very stupid, but that character has at least one motivation.) Now, alcoholic is alcoholic; he could get married to win money. Grandmothers are locked in the bedroom. The blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show the mummy of a witch (who follows you?) Who can live. In fact, YOU CAN PROVE IT live, it breaks music. The little girl lives in the house, she takes tea to her grandmother (she unlocks the door) and her dad gives cigarettes. Regularly, the grandmother comes out. But nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The husband and wife are losing their baby at home and then losing their bedroom. He gets rid of the uncle's basement. The main female is with nose blood. Drinks her husband. They both drink it. In front of all, the great truth that was mentioned for the first voice is: - Omigod - a lawyer at the age of twelve the main women. <br /> <br /> Despite all its hangings. The ingredients, no one comes out on the screen. Among the situations there is no bridge, no fear of horror, no horror horror, no slow-moving and long sequences will go anywhere. It does not really matter, they had a seemingly responsible place ... Because grandma's grandmother is a monster, but not a bad mum. She has a great hair, good makeup. <br /> <br /> In short, there are no plots. Only random (predictable) violence in a dark library rains melts and soundtracks enter. You need more than a dog and Christopher Walken to make the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The production values ​​were good. Oh Beautiful scenery, good wardrobe. The cameraman at least knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. The poor me
