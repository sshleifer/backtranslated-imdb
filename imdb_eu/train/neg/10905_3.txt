Guy is a loser. Could not get the girls, what to build, the more powerful men that are most successful, and so on. See, watch, and move forward. I should say that Rob had to spend part of his life with Adam Sandler. And get out of Adam Sandler's plot. There are two fun parts in the whole movie. I can not finish the last 5 minutes. I was bored. "Animalia" is a direct film. Often, I enjoy movies with Adam Sandler's slogan. But that was also hard to impress. The jokes are very old. So, trust me. This is not a movie that most people can actually access. Some, however, will be nice. <br /> <br /> 3/10
