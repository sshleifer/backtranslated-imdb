John Huston's Wise Blood was more puzzled by Flannery O'Connor's book than I imagined. From dramatic performances (and it's not "Oh deliberately you did it, I'm just not" I!) As for the music partition, it was a revolting movie about Rockford Files. At first I did not want to see badly and, in fact, I expected a pleasant experience. However, he was not condemned by the southern characters, with fierce fraud in the south, until the faith was portrayed in a humorous and comedic way. By no means, because all the characters did not feel it, it failed to obey O'Connor's books in every place. The actors portraying the "southern" police can also feed dogs from street NYC stands and Godfather. Ned Beatty in Hoover Shoates, a famous representation of the famous religious compound that hears the preaching of the Church of Christ Church of Christ, and sees dollar symbols and business opportunities. The powerful book of O'Connor is known for its incredible religion in front of the "living thing" of the "Faith". The hostage of the intentions of the director of the movie Huston is that I understand most of my fans and I am so brave. I admit that I do not know what the author means, I love him enough and his work is always keen on him. Seeing Wise Blood, as Mr. Huston apparently did, I'd throw it to the trash. For the sake of Flannery, and for me, I forgive you, John Huston. The annoyance ... will take some time.
