This movie was hardly ever exposed. I think they've filmed a home-based video camera, and I think that the movie is stretching over the weeks, but the characters do not change their clothes, but the play smashed the fourth wall. . I performed at 4th stage performance. In addition, the plot is not realistic. If he thought that he would suspect, I was disappointed that all the murders were done with a gun, how gore it is. That is, the Zodiac did not copy them, because the authorities did not know if they had to use a gun. Another thing I was really worried about when I was called Disorder Identification DSM 4 is the name of a book that is not used to diagnose people with mental disorders. Generally, this movie is not a low budget movie, at least not as low as possible or it is possible to have better actors or more gore. Many people have made a low-budget tour, with Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and without having to use horrible actors with little budgets.
