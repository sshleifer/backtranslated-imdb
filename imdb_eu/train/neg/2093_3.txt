If you like Syfi opera soap, this show is for you, I'm not working like I'm worried, and after seeing 3 episodes, I can not see it. It's boring and slow, and if you think it's a show that's about 100,000 years ago based on the timeline, it's probably the same thing as a 100,000-year-old Chevy van, based on the time it takes to land on the battlestar galactica. streets and people 100,000-year-old brand name LCD TV watching. Likewise, the show is also shown together with the rest. Most of today's outfit is just forgotten, but I think that a lot of things can be done on these issues and both battlestar galactica has some of the same issues but not nearly bad. As good as the rest of the show, is not it as good as BSG and is it a bad sequel?
