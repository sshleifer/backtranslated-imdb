Rating: 10 to 10 <br /> <br /> When this miniature approached, and Sci-Fi Channel was well known for the last six months, it continued its shows with BG ads, I confess that I had more problems with the more I learned. <br /> <br /> As with any cinematographic art work that has been performed in time, people will go to see different things. In this sense, when people think Battlestar Galactica, they remember different things. For some, the chrome warriors oscillate their red light. For others, they are hobbies with special effects on their evolution at the time. Many forget about the state of special effects at the end of the 70s, especially on television. Some stories of memory are fixed around the arch. Others still remember how challenging challenges they faced with their relationships. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I'm a second team. Battlestar Galactica was a people to save one another from evil nations. Yes, evil. Cylon did not have to win anything, but the human race was murdered. Although the basic stars are moving around, men and women unite in front of their enemy with almost unlimited resources, and somehow they lasted until the next show. They did not survive, better technology or more fire. Survived the next exhibition to take care of each other and with confidence. <br /> <br /> The show had a flaw and sometimes it was sappy, but they were people who cared for it. <Br /> <br /> This writer of today's interpretation did not seem like that. In some ways, he took the most significant part of the original show, he made the name of the character and a bow of the story and called for a reincarnation of television science fiction. Since it was the goal, a trial can be made: failure. It was not re-invented. Indeed, it has long been one of the richest endeavors in science fiction. Solar loans include ST: TNG, ST: DS9, Babylon 5 and even Battlefield Earth. I find it unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Ronald D. Moore has been a science fiction contributor for more than a decade and has contributed some of the most popular TV fiction science fiction. . It seems that one of the difficulties was that there was no conflict in the Enterprise D & E bridge crew. This was the Roddenberger ST rule: TNG. So, as many of those who have lived with this rule with others who take all the opportunities to break these rules, Ron Moore has forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the science of science fiction: Gene Roddenberry. Here, instead of writing the best story possible, he has created a dysfunctional cast, as I have seen, to create as much conflict as possible. In addition to being non-functional, some of them were not very credible. Anyone who has been in the military knows that someone who prevents a top officer will not get a couple of days "hacking", could get the execution and never appear on the next day. It did not happen during the war, especially during the war. I remembered most of Ron Moore's first works, he wrote that Captain James Kirk was killed. Captain Kirk has killed him and killed Battlestar Galactica for me.
