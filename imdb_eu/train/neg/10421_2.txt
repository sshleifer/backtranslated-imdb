This movie I saw a very young girl (I'm now 27 years old) and I was not afraid for many years. I had, of course, attracted music to my music as a nightmare about all aspects of this film. My parents still argued who could see it, and they both say they never saw such a movie. I think they only say that there are feelings about it. 0) I'm reading the book (it's an evil curiosity and a classic) and it's really a great story. However, I do not think it would become a cartoon. Then Well, nowadays children might be jewelry, but weeks and weeks gave me nightmares and it's still hard to see similar rabbits to theater. They give me a little heart palsy every time. I am an evil witch, but I suggest that you read this book to show your parents parents what they want their parents to read the book or, in the first place, to certify the content. Not everyone is worried I did it but we're away; 0)
