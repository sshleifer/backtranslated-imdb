That is, it's a very unpleasant, slickly-made movie. Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, I tried two good actors, and the line-line - because a senior official should release it from a mental institution - was promising. The movie is billed in comedy mode. In our hands, because of an infinite plane, you should ask forgiveness, if it is elegant and bright, if they are internal, it shoots them in the head, the stomach, the knee, the foot, the heart (not partly). It seems that anatomy is avoided), while the conversation is vague and cryptic, some of them are supposed to be somewhat humorous in a postmodern manner. The entire Goldblumen movie interview will be included in the 3x5 card, and it has a facial expression - a sardonic smile. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do everything they can. Burt Reynolds makes a kameo. The credits were written by Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but somehow I lost them (they had a good change). The whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical, and bad; I suspect I am a successor to "Pulp Fiction", "Fargo" and "Born Born Killers" style. If you like them, you might like this.
