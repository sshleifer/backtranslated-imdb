I watched the release of this movie under the title "Extreme Horror". Horror Medieval Magician Paul Naschy is an evil medieval wizard who plays horror laws in the church room, as Abanazer plays. From his grave he raises the following stupid ones (I think he is later, as Naschy also plays) returns to his ancestors home and the magician ends his head and body. Try to stop him, he climbs up from the tomb. <br /> <br /> Of course, after returning the head and the body together, hell is released and a lot of people die. Like all good magicians, here's a great assistant Abanazer. This was a great Spanish horror game, the beautiful Helga Line. As with all women in the movie Line periodic kits turn off. In this movie there is a lot of nudity, and not only women - we get to see Naschy's corpse, this is not a pretty sight, I'll tell you. The most sexual sexuality in the movie are laughable free. There is a very entertaining scene when Naschy and Line discuss their evil plans and they suddenly decide to have a heartfelt young blond-haired blonde. <br /> <br /> Likewise, it is a relatively small place - especially a Herschell. Gordon Lewis-esquire momentuous Line lifted his hands into a man's chest to get rid of his heart. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is the beautiful zombies that come to mind at last. They are afraid of the fire and they will not return again. It's a shame. However, the scene of the zombies, the film's momentum is less. Everything that happens is a long shot, and we do not think about what happens when some images go away remotely. There are a lot of garbage like this, largely in the worst edition. When it falls to work under Naschy's head hypnosis, it seems like a large closed face that lasts forever and does not serve any purpose. <br /> <br /> Not all horror movies, but entertaining. enough Of course, I saw that the version of the double American version was probably split up. Whatever I know, the original Spanish version may be a masterpiece ...
