I am incorrigible in the skeptic and agnostic, so I hope you enjoy this movie. After looking, I think that honestly I can do better documentaries. His arguments do not appear to be four fake sources (although I did not see Richard Dawkins in the IMDb credits), they edit it together with amateur computer maker, and he does not even try. It's impartial. A narrative that is completely involved, a teenage anti-feeling Christian, almost adolescent, can really change the film's head, if it does not just preach the choir (that is, me). Although it's an interesting debate about Jesus' history, film can not be started when he started teaching at a Christian school when he was a child at the start of the hard-fought, apparently psychologically ill-conditioned organization.

Without a doubt, there are skeptically religious documentaries in the market that are missing, and this movie can help fill the gap. Instead, the director wanted to insult our mind with this piece of garbage. In the end, it was a therapeutic exercise for him. It is very bad that he has traumatized his Christian education, but he does not need to listen to the pre-public mechanism.
