My girlfriend chose this one; As I was born and growing up in South African Africa, I found the plot and the premise of this film without credibility. Class and race tendencies would be so simple and convenient that it would be hanging only before someone who was not known in the south of the birthplace. Absolutely absurd! He asks me how to get a good actress like Harvey Keitel and an Andie McDowell (such as a better one in the South).
