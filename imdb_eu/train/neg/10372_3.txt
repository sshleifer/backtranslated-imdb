I enjoyed the first comment from the reviewer since I saw the movie under second direction from the early 80's. Then, I was impressed with the creation of costumes drawn after the drawings by Tenniel. But for me, the cast was largely missed, its characters covered with masks, I think the direction is supposed to be static, and photography murky. The score written at that time was not to say anything, meaning "it's never worth sitting". <br /> <br /> Still, I'd also like to see a second look.
