"Torero" was made in 2000, but for 5 years it is being published on video for one reason. Why? Could not it be: a confusing line, an annoying conversation with Oliver Martinez and an annoying editing? It must be. I think Maritza (Michelle Forbes) was a mystical road trip by Jacque (Oliver Martinez). They frighten a lot of characters and avoid evil ones too. The movie looks great and there are many styles, but there are no substances. When most films try to make subtleties, they do not mitigate the plot development and special effects that emphasize the response. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the lid: Willem Dafoe is in 2 minutes. max.
