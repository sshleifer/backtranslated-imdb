Phew - I do not say what. Really good movie with rocky audiences. Some of the playwrights reminded me of John Waters's first offers. Perhaps I should take it: I do not want to insult Waters as a director / accountant. <br /> <br /> Especially I loved the lawyer with the "full faith and credibility" clause. By the way, it's "faith and full credit". <br /> <br /> This also reminds me of "Conrad Conrad", where the main actor is the writer, the director, the film editor, and so on. Many of the involved engagements, such as more professional cinematographic professionals who would be more technically certified, would have to leave (though some might say so) to get something like this.
