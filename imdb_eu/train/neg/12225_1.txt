My personal insight in Hell is locked in a room to close my eyes or lock my ears and play this movie forever in every room that's available. The whole idea that Streisand plays a boy / man begins to embrace a nonsensical premise. The most important way to see a movie is the concept of "credibility interrupted". . . It's impossible to make this movie.
