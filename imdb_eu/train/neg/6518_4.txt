The movie is quite fun and it's about four dates; then the guy (and even his "friends") become a huge commercial can not stand. The concept is quite interesting; The days of the film are looking for the true love of modern LA. The problem is that it's terribly (and wrong) sometimes it feels like a screenwriter and self-promoter. It's hard to watch and draw on the characters, because the writer / actor is so generous, not hateful, false, and unknown. You've been feeling sorry for the past.
