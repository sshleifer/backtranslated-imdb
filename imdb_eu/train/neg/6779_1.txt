There is a high level of excitement when watching comedy featuring Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston, and Werner Klemperer. These hopes go further when directed by Stanley Don, among others, DAMN YANKEES !, SEDZZLED and CHARADE. In the first five minutes, about expectations can be met and then it seems? Nothing We have to be a light comedy, immersed in leaden, which makes it a heavy melodrama, but it has not been necessary. In this movie, but Cary Grant also appears in flat films and wood, the aggressive Parker seems unfair. The brilliant light like Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day could also have been impossible to change the richness of the generosity, density, and completely banal script and drag the audience's interest and patience. /> The other actors, especially Ray Walston, are still breathing a bit of life in the procedure, but the enormous writing is out of order. The desperate effort of dragging a giant stranger among the last moments of the last few moments, it hurts too many injuries. <br /> <br /> This film is very desperate in every level.
