This unpleasant film is not recommended. Dolph Lundgren is better than this script or other action movies. And occasionally there will be extravagant interviews that the film can give an overwhelming insight. <br /> <br /> But not. Motivations are very dark. Most plays are similar. Script creates lies. And the attention of the director's supposition is disturbing. <br /> <br /> It is difficult for the audience to be in this movie.
