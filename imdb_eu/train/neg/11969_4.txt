If you want to entertain yourself, do not see this movie. If you want to watch the heroic battles, do not go see the movie. If you want to watch a good performance and a great script, do not miss this movie. Regardless of the glory of war, if you like the movie Hollywood War movies at the time you arrive at political accolades and greatness, GO SEE THE MOVIE this. Otherwise, do not waste your time. War films are always interested in me, if they do well, I can learn something about paradox of war and insignificant. This film shows the clusters that surround the rural area, which defines the splendid lines of the clise, defending the most vulnerable and violent violence and violence that is given to them. Films that movie filmmakers and the United States are ashamed of! Ever think of being a European or African person, or in any other country, what are you seeing and how are Americans saying? No wonder everyone hates us! Please, do not waste your waste of time; If you need it, wait and rent. 4/10
