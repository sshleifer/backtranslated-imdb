I am not in America and I know what is 'Woman's change'. When a show came out of that name, I was thrilled to see beautiful and glamorous sexual moments in the program. But I got something real. The title was frozen, there is no adult content, no nudity, no ordinary conversations (the loudspeaker pulls the Hallmark channel and I think it is correct for editing / silencing content). <br /> <br /> Today's American / Western family situation, show, overweight young people, young people infected, and family entertainment show. Each episode two wives / two mothers (as needed) each chose to live at home and each one changed the family routine with their new norm. Sometimes, its good or more are the same. In the final section, the mother will bring her husband and what happened to each family in the last days. The absorbent part of the program is that each competitor fights his rights. I liked seeing all of these adult sex beautiful instead. I mean, who does this program, than what he called the name "Woman changed"; Better to call the "mother-in-law". However, he removes all things that express the true wife's exchange. <br /> <br /> Wife's exchange = real burning.
