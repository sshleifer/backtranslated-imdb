I'm discussing at this time that I would like to see this poppycock movie. They had a pretty interesting idea with the set of buried movies, which was. An unforgettable story is not a real story. There is no set in the buried ground, some wolves are starting off with a monster, a small amulet, and hiding a bunch of worms. I would have missed it, if it were a good sense to get that nonsense, C. dg.I. very bad, stupid conversation, C.G.I. Bad, and some heroes in the role of fighting. Apart from the original idea, this film has not received much quality. I'm seeing my mistake. - MERK
