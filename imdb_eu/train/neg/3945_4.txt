My Low Cost Budget is My Name is Modesty. It tells the story of Modesty Blaise. It's not that great movie, I expected what I expected. It's been years since I was aware of the character of Blaise Modesty, I do not know that comics or graphic novels are not very popular; So I come to this movie as an outsider. This is the reason for my despair. I expected more actions and more comedies. The movie is driven by dialogue. I think the camp was looking for something of great value. Right now, My name is Modesty is a serious death movie. There are few "few" moments. At least acting by Alexandra Staden is acceptable, but there is nothing remarkable. As others have commented, it appears somewhat modest, so the title role is incredible. In my name modest action scenes are one of the weakest movies. I never bought a woman who can use a group of trained teachers. <br /> <br /> I really hope that Quentin Tarantino will continue and rumor will make Blaise a great budget character. I am convinced that the concept has a great potential and I expect that much.
