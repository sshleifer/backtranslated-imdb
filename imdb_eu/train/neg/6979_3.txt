I also saw this movie, and it was very well made, I found a heart converter and I would not recommend it to women with children. When the mother's face is terrified, seeing the plague is a really wonderful train. And it's the worst thing: he dies inside. Finally he returned to the Applaciar mountains. The money in the world of making dolls does not hide the pain. I remember his desperate face when he took out his clothes to try to heal his son. I think this movie is happening in Detroit, because I had seen that people came to Cincinnati, Ohio. This was also the way to the poor for the mountain.
