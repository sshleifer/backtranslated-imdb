I watched the movie premiere on MTV. I must say that this was very modest (mostly). The conversation did not explain the story very well, and I felt like there was a lot of excitement. As a result of this adaptation, there is not a pleasant character in the poor adaptation. I find all the characters as their owners when it comes to those who love them. Also, Cate and Heath's love is very strange. It looks like a brother and sister rather than a lover. I do not understand why my father would accept something like that under his roof. <br /> <br /> I saw some of the actors I respected and enjoyed in the previous films, but I said it is very hard for a character. Katherine Heiglen's performance was awesome and that surprised him. She was a symbol of Edward's elder sister, and there was not enough line in Aimee Osbourne to criticize her performance for me. Johnny Whitworth has done well and was very good at seeing something new, and despite being a bit kooky character, I was the only person who was fascinated. With Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were to be our heroes, but they were rumors and excesses. <br /> <br /> I had nothing to enjoy in this movie or in music. Christian Punk was a short look at MxPx, but this little look did not persuade me to see this movie again. MTV did a great job to persuade me that this movie was not. It seemed so different to me.
