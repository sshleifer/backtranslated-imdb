Scary Movie 3 is hard enough to write the word. Films like Most Wanted Most Wanted plays like Oscape material, let's say. <br /> <br /> The Original Scary Movie was a fun, one of the best films of the 90s, a group that had been previously drilled. world with Dont be a menace while South Central drank your juice in the hat. But what happened to hell ?! Scary Movie 2 was after the tragedy, I thought the cast and crew changes will help the problems, but it's even worse. <br /> <br /> I smiled twice in about 20 minutes. It's not a laugh, they were jokingly recycled and, of course, the originality was not a factor. Writing at this point, most of the people on this website have voted for 10/10, I feel physically ill. When they come up with wonderful movies like Rock of School, if you have jokes that are really fun, then someone will have to pay for money in the trip that loses their money.
