<br /> <br /> After dismissing some applause, the fear / monster flick was pretty decent. So I'll give you the best points: the dragon was quite compelling, especially while the tunnels were looking for lunch (it's like humans). - The action was quite stagnant, and after a weak start, I was quite absorbed in the story. - To apologize, it was a revival for the dragon - surely the most beloved and consistent character of the film. <br /> <br /> Now, for some unexpected things ** some spoilers **: - If you were looking for a daze for fire-breathing in 1100, would you throw it into your cave under gunpowder under your arm? Duh. - Do you want to guess what a woman with an American name is, blonde hair and a Slavic accent when it comes to Spanish? Eh? - Scientist, you can cut Slavic accents with a knife and think that Chicago was born, educated in the U.S.? - Does a military helicopter carrying out his repairs carry a giant carrier transporting him with another crew and is he a gunman and is he fighting for the soldiers? ADOS. Uh huh I will not talk about communicating with its signal by giving 3 different signals for 2 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's still a lot better than some Japanese movie monster in the 60s, but not much. If you're lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, though, of course, the end is left open. Or maybe they will hire a real director the next day. <br /> <br /> However, I gave 4 films out of 4 films. Add 2 more parcels to be rewritten and Dean Cain gets it. eat in the first ten minutes <Grina>
