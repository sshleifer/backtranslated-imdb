102 DALMARIA [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of the previous episode and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, full story, Glenn Close's dramatic play, as each scene plays. His games, and a lot of lead actor and unusual interests. Again, dogs are the only "actors" that seem "real" and a stretch. Other wasted efforts here. GRADE: D
