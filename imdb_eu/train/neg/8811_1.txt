SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I saw half of this movie and I did not like it. <br /> <br /> The first reason: boring. Nothing happens, women sit around and talk about their terrific life and, as they do not hope, they burn their weeds, read magazines, take care of their sick friend and occasionally cut their dead body. BORING !!!! <br /> <br /> The second reason: there are not many things left to be explained. A scene devoted to a zombie hunter who randomly arrests men, slows them down in a chair and interrogates them. Who are these men? How can you know that something is an illegal activity for those who eat meat products? Why do you die and leave another? <br /> <br /> In addition, I thought at first I thought that the flesh had a disease, but it fucks its fist with a stronger wall than it has. As we originally thought, never explained! What frustrating is that? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I found women annoying, a story that is irrelevant, a duologist boring, and no action. Also, the superficial one is misleading because you believe that this movie will be horrible. Based on some of the reviews made on this website, I rented this movie, and although some people would like this film, I assure you that I have read more than two reviews in a movie. to avoid renting another movie I see.
