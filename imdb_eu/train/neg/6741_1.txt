Seriously, I'm a famous romantic comedy, and I come across Miss Congeniality as Easy as Easy ... but is this movie? It does not make sense! And I do not even talk about a breakdown of sufficient credibility. Why does his family live in England? Or, at least, why does not the British accent? His father has a comfortable father and he has not forgiven himself for the last two years. (For that matter, no one has ever done much for doing away with it). And what was the bachelor's party with the bad outfit? I will never go in for the paid schoolmate to fall in love with him ... making movies that could be perfect. I'm just saying that characters, settings, and plots are not enough to make a cohesive story. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is a consistent way for filmmakers to use the most dreadful angles in Deborah Messing's nose. I would take the film if it were to swear! I mean, honestly, that I am a woman, but why, in seven and loyal years of Will and Grace, I have never realized how very odd her nose is. Oh! These producers have agreed to it! This movie, like my favorite movie, is like blame for filmmakers and non-actors like Armageddon. I can find Messing and McDermott with these writers, directors and producers in these roles. <br /> <br /> I can easily get my votes as one of the worst movie wasting time. I'm glad that a friend borrowed his DVD, so I lost everything. If I had a way to do this review for ZERO, I would do it anyway.
