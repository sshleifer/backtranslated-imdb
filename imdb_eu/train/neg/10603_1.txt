I saw this movie twice and I could not get the latest credits twice. For the first time I sat down by the first fight sequence and then I lost interest. During the second period, on a bad schedule, I offered SFX tears and bad directions, forcing myself to digest. Pales than the original. <br /> <br /> Anyone heard the ET Atari 2600 old fiasco? Let me not keep those who do not. In 1982 ... ET is one of the biggest windows of all seasons ... Atari will decide to throw a movie on the 2600 home console system. The game fell a bit of time to cut down on the long and financially painful story, and the thousands of thousands of Atari 2600 ET dumpsters could not stop them. <br /> <br /> What is the Universal Soldier: translation with this story? Check the 3.2 rating and see yourself. <br /> <br /> The horrible film ... The IMDb made me 10 to 10, because their rating systems were not less than 0. negative
