This amazing waste of production money is a political film that is rich and famous as politicians can be as stupid and useless. It was featured by Tennessee Williams and directed by Joseph Losey (with the dead man) with Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward. This project on a spectacular Mediterranean island on the Mediterranean island of the Mediterranean should be sure of the winner of the universe presented in 1967. The result is so absurd and boring that it almost defies superstition. It's impressive, it's spectacular, but it's about getting the strength of nature up and setting it up instead of a real home set. Taylor's rumors shine as Burton's sleeping asleep, sleepy conversations, hairy conversations, Noel Coward's laughter, a horny story and absurd outfits. BOOM is embarrassing, the loss of money and talent and the praiseworthy celebration of the celebrated people is clear evidence that they are like the rest of the planet's plebs. It's not even fun. Stunning wastes and scary stupid ones.
