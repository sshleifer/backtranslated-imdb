Sean Bean is great, as well as photography, locations and costumes. However, the plot is somewhat mixed and the conclusion is flat. Land changed by Cornwell's novel and not better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better read. Sharpe was very close here, in comparison to his literary situation, though he was more intelligent and determined to be arrested in a new role as a newly promoted official. I really enjoyed the short scene that had been sharpened by an "authentic" Sharpe officer and, after a swift and strenuous look, he pushed back the stunned and struck officer. He has rehearsed the tests as an official officer. <br /> <br /> Value: "10" "10".
