Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter and cynical journalist who investigates unexplainedly. He travels to this small town, where a witch (Ita Ever) frightens the community. <br /> <br /> The car station and a small building take shelter, and will find a beautiful and mysterious girl. Suddenly, he turns demons and kills him, and the city is asking himself to kill his wife ... I think he was a witch, but I'm not sure. Ivan is now looking for his spirit or something, and must be faith or overcome. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian films. The actors, the story is stupid and with minimal effects. This is not just a Christian movie ... but also a foreigner. The voice of Ivan's actor was more terrifying as the film was completely comical, as it was so brutal and noisy. You do not lose much, without losing this movie.
