First, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie, and it's just scary. This movie moves the horror theme into imagination and plays badly. Sexual abuse sex. Comical (no) horny jock. Chick fresh snack. Colorful local calm color. Parents' type pairs. The virgin virgin that will suddenly die in these films. The conversation is so terribly terrifying and it is given in depth in a pool. He would almost kill him as soon as possible. I recently watched this movie, but it was somehow worse. Of course, the funniest thing here is the ghost trying to eat Jameson implants, but it's hardly worth the rent of this dog. Avoid at all costs.
