The movie "Do not Drink the Water" is disbelief. Woody Allen is based in Broadway in 1966. Jackie Gleason is a comic genius behind the "Honeymooners". Howard Morris has appeared in various comedies of Mel Brooks (Life Stinks, High Anxiety, Silent Movie) and has been shown in animation (among others, "Pooh", "Jughead" and "Beetle Bailey".) What happened? /> <br /> The problem is that the premise is seriously considered to work effectively. Allen's original play was a language, which is why he worked on Broadway and Allen's 1994 version. RS scriptwriter Allen and Harvey Bullock kill premise and original It makes too many changes to the theater. Gleason's wife getting into this version of airhead is just an example when she's a pretty woman. It's not just an operation. <br /> <br /> The operation is not much better. Gleason does everything he can Gleason was a comic genius, but also a good actor in the proofs of "The Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain." His aberrant identity could work here, but a false guess the owl does not allow Bad. Estelle Parsons's wife will air after 20 minutes. See how soon it will last. This is also a shame because he is a good actor, as he has been activated in two brilliant performances of "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel", one of the other actors is not doing well. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen condemned so much the film, retrieving the 1994 film and with Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson). They knock all the right notes and the movie itself is a masterpiece comic. Finally the video after a long struggle against rights. Get out and find that version. Everything in 1969 will be welcome to clean unwanted guests who overwhelm a long invitation. <br /> <br /> From 4/2 * 4 stars
