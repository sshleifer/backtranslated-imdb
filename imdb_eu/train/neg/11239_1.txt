Do not worry about the comments behind the curtain! Most people who leave positive comments on this movie should get their rights. In all respects it is a horrible movie. Imagine children of small school without money and without humor, making a slasher / comedy video. For this they would receive D. School children were asked to receive a F or leave school. Since this monstrous "professionalism" has been supposed to be in prison, or at least it would be a screen test. I like to watch bad movies like "Plan 9 From Outer Space", but that is not part of that category. Screenplay, play, sound and direction are so bad that it is almost impossible. If you like to watch movies that are entertaining, Ed Wood, blaxploitation or horror films in the 1970s. After seeing this, you feel that you've lost half and a half of your life.
