I really expected to see Planet of the Apes, but it was a great diversion. <br /> <br /> Settings and masks are superb, but that's the only good part of the movie. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg is not acting, it's just a movie, looking stupid. No other actors are too good. <br /> <br /> But the story is the worst of all. It's totally ridiculous! For example: lightning is credible in the ground, but humans are not attacked until they wait again. This is just an example of a stupid story, but it would take him all the time.
