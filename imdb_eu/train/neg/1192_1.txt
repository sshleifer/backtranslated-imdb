I totally agree with Jamrom4 ... the movie I ever saw was terrifying ... the rough saga was awesome ... they warned me not to see it ... and I stupidly watched it anyway ... About 10 minutes Experience I completely gave up atrocity to see ... but to sit to the end ... I could only see ... I did well, and now I would not like it ... it was disgusting ... it did not happen and the end was full preaching ... there is no surviving film the right to remain, we can ask all of you for the fear of bus drivers ... if I had the same reminder ... please keep yourself from this movie ... I feel like those who like it are involved in the production of the film ... and everyone on the planet's face they should be deleted.
