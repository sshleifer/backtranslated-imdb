The Duke we love is well, but what is this cast? To start, as Jessica Simpson Daisy, there's one thing about this girl about the country and Daisy was not ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest to being like the original. Burt was not a fault, but I never noticed that Boss HOg was so tall. Boss Hog's humor was its size. Did they try someone like Danny Devito?!? Okay, now get this Jessica Simpson thrown out for anyone to look at her husband? Luke Duke agrees with a T-shirt !!!!!! It is important that these producers were not the appearance of old old members. The screen never appeared in the competition! This triggered the movie from the beginning. I give this a giant.
