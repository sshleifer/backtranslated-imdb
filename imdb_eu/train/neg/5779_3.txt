A few days ago I saw the movie ... what was the hell? <br /> <br /> I like Brian O'Halloran movies, it's fun and enjoyable. When I saw a title and genre name I thought it was great, this could be really good ... slashers or other gore movies, some parody ... but ... then I read a preview and thought it might be right though. ... but it was not ... <br /> <br /> My opinion: they seem like a bit like a documentary like movies, they're a bit of a comedy with Moore's films or an Alien autopsy. . this was empty. <br /> <br /> and put the comedy title ... no comments ... a bad joke
