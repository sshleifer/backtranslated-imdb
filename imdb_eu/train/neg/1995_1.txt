Well, I paid a dollar for a DVD for this movie, and that was not worth it. It seems that the bad form is in the public domain, I guess. <br /> <br /> Neagle - despite his glory, prizes and fame, a young British man can not dance or dance dancing. or act out. <br /> <br /> Here you should think about the old, beautiful old actresses of Hollywood who were doing a classic. Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's husband) has always thought that Anna was the most exciting and talented woman in the screen. It was wrong After Britain and the Second World War, it was unknown. Her "serious" roles are even more playful than her own music here. <br /> <br /> A couple of famous songs come in and nobody is feeling well. Skip this and find one of Doris Day out. At least you will get some dance of comedy and professional style!
