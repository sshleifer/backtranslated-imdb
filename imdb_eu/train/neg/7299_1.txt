I've seen bad movies in my life, but it was so bad that I was angry at the theater. I wanted to get my money back. I asked the director to request the return of my movie ticket, but I did not receive a refund (or a reply), but that is important. I'll give you this movie on 1-10 scale -42 Why did "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer?) Stop until it hit a boy? Why did the bats "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ????) hit the frog first and foremost, instead of cracking the thigh of that bum? It was thin, a movie full of the movie, and it just made no sense.
