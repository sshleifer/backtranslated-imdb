DEAD HUSBANDS is a rigid foolish comedy, creating wives that are turning away from each other. There are some comedies that can never be shameful, but never gives his power. Imagine what this might be if Farrelly brothers directed Ben Stiller's Carter Elson role. <br /> <br /> Oh, is it based on Jerry Springer's Carter? It's just curious, Dr. The phrase of Elson's show is "taken care of and spoken".
