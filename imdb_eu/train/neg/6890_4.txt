... except Jon Heder. This man saved the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was entertaining. The 29-year-old son Heder lives with a widow (Keaton), who responds to a new love (Daniels). Slacker's son jealous and anxiety will lose his life and try to sabotage the relationship. She also knows a girl (Faris). <br /> <br /> I really liked Daniels and, above all, the Faris performances, but Hader had thrown away dogs that would have been better than having lunch at the beach. The performance of Heders is annoying, that is to say, they will be good things because they are annoying men, the problem is that the actor acts as an actor wrong acting as his ending favorite. In the end, you still would like to face the guy and face the end of the guy. Every future guy with a movie is not for me!
