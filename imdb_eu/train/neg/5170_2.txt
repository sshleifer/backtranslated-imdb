Wow, it might be linked to a movie, linked to Brittany Daniels, Im thinking we're cool. We're going back to the flash, but nothing starts filming the movie with the child. This movie probably will be better if it's not for play. I mean, the actor was a terrific sign. I think they had to face the poor actors with lines. I think they can do it as well as possible ... However, it has ruined me for the movie. They were the only ones who were twins. some performances ... The crash of a long supposedly huge movie .. I've seen all the worse low budget movies but considering that this was the hype I killed 8 movies I was very disappointed ... By the way, they were ... some reviewers claim that gore and stuff that they were. I saw the same film ... Well, that is, eight out of four, and so far it has only been good.
