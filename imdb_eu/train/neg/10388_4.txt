After reading all the comments posted on the IMDb, this movie seems a lot like this, but I do not think it's wrong. In fact, I've seen a lot worse. <br /> <br /> "Where the bad house" is a story about her husband and his wife, Laura and Fletcher, and his daughter, Amy, goes to them. Japanese house They do not know that a Japanese ninja attacked his wife and lover, and he died 100 years ago with a samurai sword. As in the case of rare things in the home, the ghosts of the previous population begin to rely on their bodies of life and intend to rebuild the bloody murder that took place 100 years earlier. <br /> <br /> I saw this. He decided to give a movie and a chance, it seems like a decent ghost story. It was a routine and crisp, but I saw it worse. The ghostly sequences passed a bit, the images of the color blue color that are visible appear randomly around the family, and they take their bodies. Actually, the ghosts of this movie reminded me of the ghost of the Disneyland Haunted Mansion. It may be wrong, but after seeing this, "Japanese-horror movie" "Ju-On: The Grudge" and some American remake of this American movie were stolen. The Japanese house was brutal, a ghost, a curse in the house, and so on. But I'll be wrong. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a nice ghost story. Do not go to see it, but if you like such things and you will come up with a shot on TV. 4/10.
