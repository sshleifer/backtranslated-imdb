The movie was disappointing. It seems people have no substance, the main character Martin Cahil is not a zero recovery value, all of them Jon Voight ice cream. I would not recommend the movie to anyone. Violence is unpleasant, though true. Black shooting, I saw at least printed in this category. A disappointment.
