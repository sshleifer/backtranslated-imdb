For a start, I told him I read several reviews before I rented this movie and what I expected. However, I was shocked at what was bad. <br /> <br /> I am a sharecropper and I often see forgiving pardon. Most of them have sub-par effects, bad performance, and weak stories (from the previous film). Until now, with the exception of some of the "Howling" series, this is the worst. <br /> <br /> First of all, the story. In reviews of this site several times, I will not give any details. However, it is evident that the writer does not associate myth with lycanthropy. As it happens, horror film occurs as a writer given to a writer who plays "above". She is well, but she's trying to be a desperate enthusiast, and she does not care about the mind and sophistication of the horror viewers, and that's why she's starting to write. Land is like a parody of male films, and the imagined facts are so fake, I felt that my mind was seriously insulting. Television news footage, for example, never shifts journalists away from the public. Give the characters and viewers the ability to stop the scene with bad credit without using the flashing signal neon. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> With regard to the effects, I have never seen them less prone. I would be happier with Lon Chaney Jr in crepe. They liked a lot of used beasts ... well, just like a man with a cheap rubber outfit, some hair stuck and really animated. And I know that many people criticized CG, but my God was horrible. A scene changes by a woman, and the actress starts with a CG version, naked but with some reasons without nipples. My first thought was, "Hey, why is it" a ReBoot character to become a werewolf seeking fool? "<br /> <br /> However, they liked looking for positives in any movie, and there were not a few. Cinematography was appropriate (movie It was very interesting to see that Tippi Hedron was the most beautiful homeless in the world and the bad name of Kane Hodder, and Yellow Power Ranger has grown ... and well-damned. And if you're looking for a skin, there are pretty tasty examples that end the piglet segment of the review. <br /> <br /> In general, if you want a good bush film, try "An American Werewolf in London", the original "The Howling "," Dog Soldiers, "or" Wolf "(even if there were so many wolves). Lycanthrope is full and then take a breath, otherwise, miss this one.
