I could not hardly tried to get mad at this annoyance, but I could not do that. Brad Dourif's was totally immersed and all the helpers were not only worse. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is wonderful, FX laughs at the FX laugh, from the stupid plot. <br /> <br /> Time lost completely; do not worry Root Channel therapy would be nice. Bamboo plates under the nails would be nice. <br /> <br /> Watching a Uwe Boll movie would be worse than this. Got the idea?
