Slasher movies are often derivative, repetitive and truly curious. I'm going to become a horror movie fan, but the movie was so bad, the words failed. The script is missing, the plot is ridiculous, surprisingly. It's just a stinker of all, I missed my life's time. This was the first short film that had a total value of 15 entertainment. <br /> <br /> Who mixed this news? <br /> <br /> I liked two things in this movie. The first one was the killer mask. The second one was Austrailian with a profane connotation.
