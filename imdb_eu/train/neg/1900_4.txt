Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired retired automobile and has been attacked by his "brother" young man, when his young brother dies for a request from British director Raymond Calitri. The work will "raise cars" 24 hours in 24 hours or the penalties of Calitri. So Raines can build a crew that can rely on himself and give him the task. But the police hit him and some cars on the list were not easy. It seems that the end work is impossible. <br /> <br /> Throw in 60 seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan and Timothy Olyphant. Everyone deserves it. There is enough horsepower to push a Porsche 998 Turbo. The problem is, that is, too many cars too much parking lot is in case there is not enough zest. The start is undoubtedly the production of Bruckheimer / Simpson, mixed with noisy and whirlwind cheese, and directed by Dominic Sena correctly. Basically, H.B. With Halley's independent film of the same name in 1974, offering the car's potential adrenaline car base. Unfortunately, he never realized. One or two moments of great impact are certain, but it's nice. But if he asks for forgiveness, the movie is never expelled from the first tool, he works harder with the cartoon characters trying to do {Scott Rosenberg}. <br /> <br /> Car fans will receive something (the cars are in front of them), just like the fans of comedian enthusiasts will look at {Ecclestone's carpenter's momentum}. But no, all that is very poor. 4/10
