You are not satisfied with this budget-free thriller; But pray, who wants it? A young couple goes through the authentic end of the world hidden in the laboratory of some aliens like church people. <br /> <br /> Chokotx's themed small outings, THE WORLD'S NEWS, lack intelligence and shame and style. Only similar movies in the 50s. And this is not only, but EOTW acts as a hybrid, not just emoticons, but the convent also creeps. The evil movie character is a popular actor. <br /> <br /> This shameless slapdash seems to be a piece of conventual exploitation, a genre of the 70s, which is so fun today. However, the convent secret laboratory is a bad part of the futuristic deco! Christopher Lee is proud of the end of the world. But the end of the world is not its pride!
