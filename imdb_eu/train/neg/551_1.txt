I have been through the list of 100 AFI comedies and I must say that this is really the worst. I have not seen the list in only 90 movies, but I have never seen any movie. Some funny drunks, Dudley is not. Liza almost deserved, but, oh ... see detained development if you want to see something good. Seriously, is Dudley laughing and drinking cheerful? I'd recommend almost any other movie about AFI's 100 top comedy, more than just laughing. If you want to watch "drunken" fun, try Thin Man. The funniest movie in general will kill any movie in Marx Brothers (especially if Arthur is drunk).
