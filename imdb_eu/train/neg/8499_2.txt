This is now shaking the movies. After all, Feierstein's Flex Crush wants to know that Real Men does not see Truffaut. <br /> <br /> It might be interesting if Truffaut says this. The camera-voyeur motif was not new. We all forgot Sica's "Bicycle Thief"? Or something about Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> So, all of us are extending the metaphor of the young Truffaut, who spends his free time in "shaking his eyes" in the cinema, accusing him of class discipline and accusing him. plagiarism (many small robberies), and in the end, social limitations to escape 'his movie'. Sorry ... I was there to do that too much for that.
