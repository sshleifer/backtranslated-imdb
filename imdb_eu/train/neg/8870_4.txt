Stefan's work is a heroine to Germany, Germany, which should easily go. <br /> <br /> In Germany, Stefan Elli knows, that is, selling a Bosnian machine. Stefan does not see what he sees and decides with Elli for his misery. When his father Elli de War escaped to Sweden, Stefan goes to Sweden today. In order to face the past, Stefan commits him to help Elli to seek his father, regardless. Eventually everything in Sweden seems to be more complicated than Stefan thought. <br /> <br /> This film does not seem to fit into Swedish classics as usual. lots Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist make an average, because the effect is too much film. See and act yourself. <br /> <br />
