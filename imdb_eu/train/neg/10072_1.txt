Unfortunately, I made a mistake and I paid 7 euros in the movie theater to see this absurd nonsense movie. My points: <br /> <br /> The film focuses on 2 things; <br /> <br /> 1) Point of view: As in most American Films, the writer thinks as an expert. After learning about 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But, unfortunately, it's not enough. Knowing the names of the owner and other two foods does not understand a person's culture. For example, the beard is a sign of pure Asian life, but everyone tried to stop that girl. The Lebanese are Christians (they have succeeded) and their cultural forms, beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arab countries. The main difference between eastern and western culture is not ethnocentrism. So, we do not judge people after the first question about our lives, as my father did in all the pictures in the movie. <br /> <br /> 2) The sex revolution of a girl: anything can be said about this. I showed that these 10 girls would say that I had sex to wake up worse than me. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment because the producer is promoting the movie as a mood generation. Check out Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. A black mood must reflect the truth and focus on the entertaining parts of the audience. Where's the truth? Where is the meaning of the movie
