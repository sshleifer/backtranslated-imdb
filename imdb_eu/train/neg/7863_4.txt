THHE2 is entertaining, because you are scattered a lot and are sure to say "oh sh * t!" and "get out of your dirty face," or those lines, but I do not know if it is worth seeing ... I was very angry at the huge military characters that are not very apparent. Knowing the first thing about the fight. <br /> <br /> Yes, more violence, gore, and body amounts were higher than before but I am still discussing whether or not my whole feeling is abolished. How ridiculous it was (and do not waste it like Dead Alive or Feast). It would be better for me to watch the fifth time at Ajaen's time. <br /> <br /> So look for some laughter, or go for some gore, but do not be happy to get out.
