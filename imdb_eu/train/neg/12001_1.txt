The honest advice to all of you: do not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not go to the theater that is playing this movie !! Even worse, it is a very bad health. serious no joke at 3.30 in the morning. and I came back from the most beautiful movie in the universe. LAU HOURS DAMN !!! I'm proud after that I was alive! If survival is called. <br /> <br /> I am very frustrated. angry. disappointed time was lost! Money was drained! no plots I hope tomorrow I am awake and without memories of the night! RUBBISH MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Happy one day in the Republic and all :)
