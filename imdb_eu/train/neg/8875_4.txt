If someone's "favorite" movie is, they need serious help. There is nothing fun or clear about this crapfest. I did not see the original movie (a film of the 1950s), but it has to be newer than it is more recent. <br /> <br /> A military leader extols an unlimited item and teaches children of a ROTC school. Unfortunately, the main one is Daman Wayans ... children get annoyed and humorless worlds. Wayans loses the losers? Could it be possible to make a man a little? Film is bombarded by most Wayans films, with bright moments. It gets about a minute after William Hickey's screen, it's scarce. This charming man, known as the "Christmas Tales from the Crypt," is known as the "Christmas Holiday" uncle named Louis, is not so much at this time. <br /> <br /> In addition, Bam Bam Bigelow appeared as a biker. I would not mind a little bit more about Bam Bam, but I think that he has made the role of "biker" as far as the military can do. <br /> <br /> And then it is an attractive teacher, someone who falls to Payne, even if the child is treated badly, has no social skills and becomes someone who is not an impossible time. He must either be stupid or very desperate. I do not know what it is (even though it seems "stupid" since it is clear from the movie's timing). <br /> <br /> Wayans had a glittering moment: he performed a dance sequence. a series of movements (including a very nice "robot") and 2 Live Crew music. This scene has been enjoyable, but it's hardly a film to make something bigger than the dog. <br /> <br /> Really try this movie. If you want to see a movie that turns kids into a hero for losers, rent or buy "Ernest Goes to Camp." At least a loser is lovable and it's really fun. The main payer, maybe, if he struggled with Aztecs, I would feel better, but he did not. Forget Payne, forget about Wayans ... you can do better.
