It seems to be the only film directed by John Saxon, and he had the sense to stop and stay in front of the camera. This movie is a dog from the beginning to the end, and it is dull and woody and nothing is done. A Viet Nam war hero takes over a task for mafia bosses, he gets a very pleasant wife and then sends his wife to the bosses of the underworld and the war hero and send him to the death row. Now, this specific prison is undergoing an experiment with prisoners, and men are testing this formula to make the man become the ultimate slaughter machine (a zombie). Of course, everything is wrong and then all the infected people are trapped, some of which are becoming zombies and, suddenly, the rest of those who do not want to. This is just and continues and, especially, to show or say anything, and I ended before it was over, which seemed like it had come a few times, but it did not seem to have started to take off on a different and dull path. Seeing the end if the zombie itself becomes itself, do not risk it. 10 to 10
