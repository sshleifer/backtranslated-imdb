My wife and I started watching this movie. It was hot and moving He started well; But soon, it was boring and really stupid for a while. It was badly turned out, the movie was badly interpreted and honest, we could not understand or understand why or how to wear this woman! You have lost the legacy because of the rough and acting, singing and cleaning. I would promise. And, of course, like most Hollywood movies and T.V series, we have to throw a "gay" character! This movie was boring. Diane Keaton hoped for more!
