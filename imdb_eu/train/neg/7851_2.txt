As several times, "The Hills Have Eyes 2" is NOT rebuilding (ignoring) Wes Craven's 1980s second part of the original 1977s. But Craven (with his son, Jonathan's double threat) has written a movie of equal quality to the official stamp of restoration of postmodern sequel, in English, IZUGARRIA. Martin Weisz's former music and video director takes Alexandre Aja's basics and is clear in more than one mind. We still think about how Cravens' screen 101 shorts could be created. The characters are not only (in this case, the National Guard's goofball team (a remake of the remake of the original remake of the mountains) is very wrong and tends to be a great tendency (they play without the irony's kisses, beware), but constantly fun jokes they are breaking During a training exercise, after seeing his complete ineptitude, his sharp expectations of it are immensely obvious. Only this time - like the sequel to the 1980s - the script is so simplistic (it does not exist) that the potential sub-lexicals may be ignored to increase the repulsive symptoms (combined with the combination of the combination). fraudulent fraud over the initial credits, plus free rape for those who have not expelled the DVD from the middle!). The mutants of this outbreak are also freakless, with no memorable heights; It seems like FX-like makeup looks and gummy, just like the rest of the movie, it tries to embarrass your face. I was very proud at the end of the great Aja movie, and the producers set the "literally" scene at the end of "Hills 2". Partial ... but Cravens and Weisz have created a movie that is so cynical about the work they did in the versions of 1977/2006, when they frighten their faces looking for audiences.
