This movie is completely rubbish. Some intelligent intellectuals, who make themselves healthy, claim the superiority of the aristocracy over the working class. More than one piece of self-adhesive padlock. Nasty <br /> <br /> If this type of movie is set in the U.S., it's probably a joke. And because we create "on the other side", it will become a masterpiece, because it cleans the brain and / or cleans some Western Western ones (some of them George W. Maybe :). Typical sessions of cold war, however, some jokes. <br /> <br /> I would like to say, that is to say, as is the case in this movie, what the Soviet intellectuals thought of all those years, they deserved the misfortunes that they missed. BUT NOT! Like others, I have read and seen real masterpieces made by real intellectuals. For example, something important with the dog, "White Bim Black Ear" - Gavriil Troyepolsky's book and Stanislav Rostotsky's movie - is a true masterpiece. Real life, true tragedy, real sad, true pride and dignity, the best of the Soviet era.
