Beverly Girland was born in a bad time. At that time, the actor was also involved with the power and grace in Corman's film slides. Gunslinger is a sheriff's wife. He got it done, so his job was to get the killers. It is better than the one that is working much closer. The film is gray, compact and especially boring. Somewhere it's a good idea to ride tires with humor everywhere, people who are running behind a building suddenly face others (I've heard fake faces, but this is a ridiculous one!), And the stupid lines of the widow's new line. the sheriff who is in love with the guy who dies. Although she did not love her husband, she was just something since she died. However, the boy finally dies at last. Men are not lucky, that is. <br /> <br /> The bad part is another woman, the owner of it. If he wants to buy a bunch of land, he will appreciate the wealth and riches of the railroad. If his action plan is not unhappy, he will steal as much as possible from the village and he will work as soon as possible. Hell, is just against her and the end of her hired guns against the whole town. Does not people say they are armed? Look at what happened in the ancient cities of the West, when robbing bank robbery banks, then the most dangerous and most dangerous people would throw the bullets in a basket. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to do with undefiled and horseback riding around with hand-drawn shots. As usual in Corman, though, thanks to the final, there is a moral procedure that ends at the end of It Conquered the World. The Sheriff returns to Sam Bass for his mistake and goes to dusk, although the movie was so gray that he never saw the sun.
