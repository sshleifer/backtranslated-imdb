As much as I do not say, I'm not sure what other people are saying, it's totally true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing to do with the end of the 90's. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You can see a movie that does not allow someone to be forbidden. Because it does not look like a Hollywood product, it's not credible. <br /> <br /> Even worse, there is no plot to be visible (Russia and many people also have a lot of lots of places, as well as very old women, drinking a lot of vodka) I'm nauseating some images so unnecessarily as my second Rolaids- I'm with the package. <br /> <br /> In terms of disapproval, however, the movie is a narration thread. I can not write one, when I try. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money, and do not mix it with this good Russian film.
