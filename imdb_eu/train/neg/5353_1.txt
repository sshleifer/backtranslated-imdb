It was a special projection of "Absence of Light" in Ohio in a Ohio horror deal. <br /> <br /> First of all, you know the director presents a movie saying: "Now, we do not have a lot of money ..." It's not unheated movies, but when a filmmaker uses it as an excuse the results are always bad. And there is no better example than this festivity of sleep. <br /> <br /> Actually, 'Lack of lightness' is one of the world's underground films: it's only one of my favorite desserts of talented vets. Charismatic actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister randomly enter and leave the film and prove that they are unnamed as unbelievers that are of interest. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? Who is it for? It's totally boring, you'll stay for nothing or anything else. <br /> <br /> After 30 minutes of the resistance test, I left and left the theater. Not surprisingly, most cast members attended. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous genres fans would be fine for this. With a little luck, the movie will not see "light" of the day.
