A couple of farmers live in a small Chinese town. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) bought O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in the main roles, talking with false mistakes and highlighting stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good wife, many children and land are the best things they can have. They are seen as property and investment. It is a quintessential movie, because many extras are collaborating, large sets are built and special effects occur, filmmakers could not compromise the most popular actors. Luise Rainer won the Oscar for this performance, definitely the worst film. His invariable faces create a barrier between himself and the public. O-Lan is the best character with the family's heart and sympathy. On the other hand, Paul Muni gives a better performance, shows his talents again. Another problem with the movie is the end. It seems Franklin did not know when to finish the photo. This film can be dangerous, as a true example of Chinese culture and traditions.
