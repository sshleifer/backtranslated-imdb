This documentary about 30 years ago, one of the poorest regions of Spain in the 1930s, Bu単uel, in my opinion, is one of the weakest films. First of all, let's confess 70 years later that Spain is much richer (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can have problems on its own, as excessive individualism and consumerism, although all are far from rich. Here is a better condition here If poverty was delayed in Spain, Bu単uel was somewhat like socialism with Western capitalism in Western Europe, but one of the most amazing things in the film is that in a scene, the narrator is angry at school, the child's value is taught in P. Poor people teach math, fear The darkest runners in Bu単uel are here, as you can imagine, that access to the latest knowledge and technology that will help them to overcome their situation is poor. What does it propose? What children should teach in school? Does not it mean that Bu単uel's poor technology compared others? Is it missing from modern?
