This movie was so daunting. To see Phantom Love (why is it called?), I expected something Art and thought it to me. He had some interesting images, but they seemed often random and meaningless. In fact, it seems that they had to meet the time they were involved. Eventually the effect was peeling. <br /> <br /> I think film was intended to be atmospheric, but it was just that. The lack of a consistent plot does not matter. It might be a mysterious one, but I think it was just in the mood. <br /> <br /> The main character was worried but the plot did not penetrate enough to take care of her situation. Without looking at the list, I would not know that you see the main character of the children. The film has a small context for time, place or nature. I am not absurd, but the sex scene (several) seemed unconcerned and confused me, I knew Lulu but I did not know the same man, different man, lover, or his prostitution. When I saw the credits I found the hairy back to start his lover. What was supposed to be an amazing movie (involving mother's sequels with the mother of Lulú) seemed a bit boring. <br /> <br /> The spikes file really made sense because of the emotional state of Lulú. I do not complain about the actor, as I have had to do a lot of work. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the context or flow of the films was considered unfavorable or unfavorable. But the final result was boring. <br /> <br /> I can not talk more about that.
