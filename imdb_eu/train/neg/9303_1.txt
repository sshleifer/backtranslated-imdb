I'm writing this review for a few months now that I've seen ... the purchase of this excuse for a movie that I expected was enough for the trailer. The joke is complete ... and it is literally real, as opposed to the real classics of horror generation such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), which could be compared to the back cover. The producer who made Brandon would have to flourish burgers and burgers should greasy. The lighting was badly bad and the great discrepancy in the movie, sometimes the faces of the actor could not be seen. I do not remember, moreover, the members of the sad member of the committee to make them unforgettable as a memorable one. This is all the time I will lose in this review. You can keep it as far away as possible from this scrap yard, even if you do not get more than 25 cents, do the gum. <br /> <br /> If you want a quintessentially low budget quote, much better than this ... then check out a Jeff Hayes movie ... because it's talented and talented for being a talent! <br /> Covering the star 1 art ... I gave this star the only thing that deserves a "movie". <br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
