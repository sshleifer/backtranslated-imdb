I want to start saying that I am a Republican, although I do not agree with many things in the office. And I love the daily show and the Colbert report. They must be two of my favorite TV shows. I enjoy Conan, Letterman, Leno's jokes, because I do not recognize Language as Wk would not have the most famous man (I think that's not that unmarried.) But it's a good enough moment. It's not really fun. I can see where it can be fun and that's it (it makes fun of the ridiculous image of the authority). It's a central comedy, however, trying hard to make fun. I mean a special episode, but the whole series is a dumb move. Apparently, CC seems to tell joke that I've heard WAY a lot. I can not really see this show in season 1.
