A sexually obsessed chef carries an innocent life: as a man married to the ten-year-old boy "happily", each other is a sex god. Most of the documentary film continues in five consecutive days and Nastassja Kinski is told unnoticed as a sexual therapist, listens to her story, and intelligently explores her. Nastassjea's role is very restrictive and it is the only adult who does not remove her clothes. If it did, this movie "F." I would rate a big fat. Previously, it values ​​an F +, although it does not get bored unless it is bored. It's probably more interesting to clean the garage for ninety minutes. The "Sexual Addict of Diary" movie gets into a category once it's seen that nobody wants to.
