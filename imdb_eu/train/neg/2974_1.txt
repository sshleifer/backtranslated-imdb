I am a guy and I am also a tolerant gender to think myself. And, therefore, I mean that I try to take a movie in the context of the genre that lives. Just, so I'd like to say really bad things to myself, as I'm talking about people or movies. I do not like doing it. <br /> <br /> The plot of this was clearly evident, which is a very low and valuable production, simplistic. The event occasionally became a good territory for high school. One day I shot the feeling - I told him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, sex, although quite abundant, was quite everyday, at least it was prevented in my copy. It was not related to the "above sound" action (the weather was pain and echoes before a chair was lying down a bed). Certainly there was no "edge" - anything distinctive or interesting, and with surprisingly sharp cuts. <br /> <br /> My vote is "1" with the following summary statement: it would have been better if the club's filler material was enlarged, and if the rest of the films were condensed.
