Here are other European blasphemous stories that frustrated their country's religion. (These atheist filmmakers are ongoing). Here we see the brutal explosions of Catholic and / or Catholic Catholics (and I am not Catholics). Probably the stories that seemed to be very weak in the Catholic and religious beliefs in general. One of the main characters is a priest who cares about food. It's just an idiot. It is not surprising that the secular Academy loves this film. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a dull stupid who tells the guy who rejects religion, to marry a four-story daughter. The daughters turn to a "seminary" student (who has learned for six years, but is said to be an agnostic). I mean, how bad this movie is! <br /> <br /> This is a shame and another great example of the secular-progressive bigotry of the film business throughout the world (not just Hollywood).
