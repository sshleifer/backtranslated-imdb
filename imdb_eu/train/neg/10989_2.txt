* Warning - there is no plot disaster, but the debris of the movie anyway ... * My significant thing was that he rented to me that he thought it would be a great love with all the stars. Wow - very, very wrong. This movie is a pretext, tightening and an excuse for a 15-year-old filming of a movie to release a student's movie! The copyright in the box was in 2005, but in the first wrapping sequence, I studied the clothes and hair that were supposed at the beginning of the 1960s, and especially the girls in the late 80's / 90's dresses and their hair. He seems to have filmed 20 or 20 years earlier than short films. I tried to go back in comfort, and I thought it was an apparent old age, but before the 60s or XXI. It seemed more than 60 decades of the century ... then one of the main characters is an adult colleague, and then looks like boys in the flashback sequences (but a different and much older character, as the youth flashbacks appear). I was totally blurry with a short film including special features - all the decades of the 1990s, I filmed this movie as a full-length movie for students with the same title! We also have comments that include children's minors (and, in fact, the scene in 2005). So this movie is just a story that is woven around an old ancient theater theater, to make the excuse to get to the theater scene. The story recorded in 2005 mainly refers to a man who has lost his wife, and he finds a cure and rescue in the dance class, which will instead give him a wizard who participates (something that promised the man who dies). At the beginning of the 60s, his girlfriend would meet on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year - an excuse to shoot some of 2005's old movies? It is a good thing, for example, a confusing score that is repeated in almost every new scene, a topical action that affects the new film. Do not worry Why you never heard this movie though. The well-known throwing - it's horrible.
