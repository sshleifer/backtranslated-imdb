This is one of the funniest movies ever seen. I rented it as a joke, I expected the first scene to take a look at it, and let me tell you I never found it so difficult in my life. The first scene, where the first scene that rages and breaks the ninjas out of a fire and a fire fight, is one of the most entertaining moments of my life. This is not a dinosaur movie, but it's a fun act (and does not mean). I did not see the first two, but considering the complexity of the plot, I do not think I lost a lot. If you want to watch the movie with six packages or herbs, you can rent and rent this movie and watch 100-year preview and roll it to the trash.
