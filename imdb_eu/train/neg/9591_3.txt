If you read the original novel, as I did, you probably hate it. <br /> <br /> _Absolute Beginners_ is a conglomerate nightmare that tries to create "pieces of time" in the 1980's anachronism. At the end of the 1950s and when he was not re-created or reprimanded, _Dirty Dancing's US monsters are similar to 1963, although the film is economically successful, despite the fact that it is a great screen image. In addition to "look over the 80s," the characters have changed, organized and shattered, with the only features of the novel being the smallest appearance and, of course, their small character. names: Suze's usual story girlfriend and a troubled black-faced story, which deliberately plans to hide the money of marrying an old queen (for her first pages first), famous and na√Øve "glory" and glamor, exploited and somehow deceived her bosses , it was not surprising that Van Dyke and strict hairstyle. Regarding the film, under the title "Colin" (after the author of the book) there is a link to the narrator called Colin MacInnes. <br /> <br /> Big Jill's character, apparently a lesbian still fop-like in her 20s as a group of lesbians and heads of bubbles, is one of the closest friends of the narrator, giving the narrator a wisdom franchise, few names "few incident "mode, with only a few. Throwing lines and tone costumes. Fabulous Hoplite, a gay young man and a close friend of the narrative narrator, are not reduced to the movie. , camped-up and all, but ignored. <br /> <br /> The narrator's father's novel is a lesser kind of sad, but in the film, he's clearly optimistic and odd-eyed, he clearly played out neighbors, and as his mother's marriage seems to be the mother of the narrator, it seems to be practically not ignore it <br /> <br /> On the other hand, music (what it is). It is well-formed and the production and writing team must give credit to a book line ("... some days, music in the 1950s will write ...") as an inspiration to write a music, but in the worst music scene outside, that is, between. _Shock Treatment_ or _Starstruck_ is treated as an essential part of the plot. Unlike _Apple_, the flow of music numbers and spoken conversations differs and differs. <br /> <br /> It can not be blamed in the 1980s when it was created in the 1980s. In 1981, he released a new version of Annie_, a tribute to the appearance and feeling of New York in the 1930s, and in Napoleon Dynamite in the 1980s he made a great look and appearance. a small budget in 2003 (but not explicitly set in the 1980s, those who have lived in the decade can not deny that the movie "feels in the 1980s"). Obviously, it's possible to do something good, especially considering the status of an iconic novel source in the UK, but apparently fails in appearance and feeling, as well as in the treatment of sources. totally inadequate. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if you do not intend to read the novel and if you do not intend to read it, you might enjoy anachronism of the 1980s by shaking a parody of a modern jazz set in Soho London in the 1950's. Without a doubt, I can see what the writer team tried to do, but they can definitely do it better. With the addition of musicians and mixed groups to Boy George and to the UK in 1986, they did not have to bowdle, as they did in the end. Indeed, writers were told by writers that they criticized books and movies - it was rough to a bunch of grown-ups and treated as audiences targeted at young teens. to make it so dull.
