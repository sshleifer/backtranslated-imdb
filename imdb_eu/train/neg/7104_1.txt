The producers of this film have funeral expenses for anyone who fears watching this movie. Specialized psychotherapy should be offered. A young couple moves to a house, where a woman who looks like a couples woman lived. Very boring and very predictable. In the end, I tried not to care for anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs.
