I love Seth Green. His appearing in the 70's' was always worth watching, but last night I felt the need to review the show. Four young single people inherited an apartment in the city of New York, many of us could have died. The grandmother had to be the heir to have space for the first time. So I felt the need for realism to be thought. In any case, the plot of the four best friends to get this apartment was not incredible. I would be glad that I could offer humor and misuse with my parents. There seems to be no humor. I only see it because my name is falling after nightfall after the Earl winner. I think they should go back, to undo this series and start again. We need more series of family series. Seth and his friends will go on with their bad parents when they burn fire in their neighborhoods. Dabney Coleman could play dad and Christine Estabroo, dysfunctional mother and relatives. The list of options for people like Seth Green is endless and it raises the network.
