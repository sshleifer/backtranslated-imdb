Especially with more suckers and rocket holes with more cheese holes! Directors and writers claim that they wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. Well, here, at least, they are like vinegar and oil. Launch comedy is not very funny and the youngest. Moreover, the movie is not realistic. Freedoms are considered by French citizens as regards the will of the law and the easing of the medication in the system of lawyers. I watched this movie on my big screen on TV and I still cried at the movie. Finally, at length, I quickly forwarded the last long speech of the main son of the main character. By that time, he was angry with the shameless plot that was with the dead lover, the comfort of marriage and the former lover. Sometimes, the plot deviates between the two main characters, and then one of them returns: Ismael or Nora mainly. At the expense of the public, the views vary according to Nora and Ismael, his former lover against his will in a psychiatric hospital. Two potential interesting movies may not be well developed. The epilogue does not gather a lot of sub-plot, and it seems that the audience thinks it will make it a happy way to Nora, even though the situations given in real life are similar to a snowfall in hell. The actors are the best and most attractive, but this is not enough to overcome all the failures, writing and non-focusing.
