When you select a movie, do you expect a factor that you take into account, do the actors of the film use their reputation to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way? This is not a moral affirmation of the political affirmation of society. A comedian / actor should ask us about sexual and racist remarks about adolescents and their father (I accept that behavior)? In that case, Mr. Foxx's behavior tricks the social fabric that teaches good behavior, is better than hating good love. Mr. Foxx should remember that it is the only entertainment and that's the chance. Sorry to say hello not to be removed. It will not hurt you, or eliminate bad behavior that extends to the young. There's a way to stop this behavior from being so enthusiastic. It is no longer seen what they are involved. We can not change them, but we are able to stop the reputation we give them.
