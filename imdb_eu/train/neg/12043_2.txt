I really like Brad Pitt. He is an actor with brain and mind, without mentioning faces, pectorals and all the rest. As I saw in "Thelma and Louise," he has caused me a thought, who reminds me of it? "Troy" he did for me. Brigitte Bardot is new. Differences are known. Male, American, and so on, but Brigitte Bardot still finds out. So it's so beautiful that it is the most effective against it. "California" "12 Monkeys" "Fight Club" "Snatch" His humor is undeniable, it is almost available. Fortunately, "Troy" will soon be forgotten. Pitt with simple photos only, in beautiful expressive positions, the naked brick faces of the legions of fans of the carved sculptures will be decorated. Strange, "Das Boot" XX. It's one of the biggest movies of the second half of the century. What does Wolfgang Petersen direct? Well, it would be very difficult to work with the new Brigitte Bardot.
