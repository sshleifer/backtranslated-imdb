You know that the bad movie is one of the most important moments for "Jeopardy!" It's watching <br /> <br /> The sadest thing about White Men Can Jump Jump is that it has great potential. For several years I was in a similar field that was depicted in this movie; racial tensions were very high and they all meant basketball. A movie about "Basketball-related" may be very interesting, but White Men can not do anything to do it, and leave the script that is in short supply. <br /> <br /> Movie sequences of events. it's cyclic. First of all, Billy wins or loses money by playing basketball. Then he returns to his house and goes with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. Most stories come to a certain point, but I saw that "the highest point" was just another sequence ("in this case" Billy makes money or loses his basketball match "). The development of land needs to be resolved , and this dilemma should be interesting if the film is also interesting. It seems the White Men Can Jump Jump writers have forgotten this rule, because the plot should be summarized as "it has to pay Billy's bills." But I've changed the pace of some other cinematic sports. ... It was so horrible. I paid less attention if Billy had made the money to pay his apartment rent. <br /> <br /> However, White Men Can not Jump is a successful movie, it seems that they will have time to write adamant sports enthusiasts basketball for some scenes, others, I am sure, put great names on the protagonists, so I'm asking you before casting If it were replaced with a completely unknown actress, would you replace the basketball theme with a lacrosse? I really do not think so. <br /> <br /> I will give ten stars to this movie; Additional star "Jeopardy!" da. It kept me awake for a few minutes. Thank you, Trebek.
