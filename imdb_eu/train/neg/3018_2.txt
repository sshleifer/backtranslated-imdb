What you have achieved with topical backpacks that combines a group of people with no direction and mixing, creating a spectacular visual style that stops trying to fail, and smoothes overhead and humor. and a great budget? Why you get one of the most intolerable films you've ever made! Of course, I mention Domino. <br /> <br /> Here are some people you can say when you watch this movie: <br /> <br /> "Ooh, wow, story to keep Sequence not told, that's not a million times before. much more skilled than this movie. "<br /> <br />" Wow, look at all the bright lights and film granite textures and practice. The director tries hard to get things done and visualize the visual style! It is very bad that none of these effects They have nothing to add to the movie or make sense with scenes, and it's bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Uh, do they not reveal a quarter of an hour's time? It's surprising?" <br /> <br /> "If this movie shows" Chick hard ", it shows up standing While he is ... why does not he do much? "<br /> <br />" I can not believe how innocent this is. "> <br />" How long is this time? I feel that I see them four hours since then. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> "I do not know what happened, but I also do not feel motivated. "<br /> <br />" Is it still over? "<br /> <br />" I want to get my money back. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />" "<br /> <br />" It's ironic that all curliches that take away the effect of each one. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> In short, this movie almost fails in all its aspects. If your home is playing in a single room with fire and a flammable movie, you should turn it hard instead of burning <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> more than two hours watching this movie and not I liked it a lot.)
