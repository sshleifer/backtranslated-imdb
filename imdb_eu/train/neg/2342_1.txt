I do not know what a great movie about this movie would be. Even worse, why should anyone worry about this? First of all, there's no story. It might even be said that seeing movies may not be worthwhile because they call a strong feeling (laughter, crying, fear ...), but I think that this movie does not do that too. <br /> <br /> You are viewing images +/- 2 hours. More things are available. <br /> <br /> I think that because of a movie experiment, you can say that all is brave. But does it cost 2 hours your valuable time and 7 euros your money? The answer to me is: no.
