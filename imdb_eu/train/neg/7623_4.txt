This little show is, of course, stupid roots / spin off of the original series. <br /> <br /> With the series of live series, the show is pure. Direct shows had smart jokes and story lines. The animated series is basically a sour tone to digest young audiences, but I think maybe the kids get rid of it. <br /> <br /> The story of all the episodes, especially Sabrina, has only a stupid and ridiculous dill. magic uses to solve it. That is the idea in every episode. The most unusual event that made Sabrina magic became the Gem and Gem Sabrina. So, the Gem becomes a witch and becomes a hybridization for her slave. This brings a curious and quite interesting scene, "It's what I like at the moment," Harvey pulls his hands and knees down and kisses his feet like a god. (that is, because it is a slave to control the mind). But this madness is not worth the time or effort.
