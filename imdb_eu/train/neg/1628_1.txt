Asked about one of the most shameful productions of the 70s, GAOTS really seems to be something really important. True, it is tragic at all levels so valuable, but it can not help laughing. The landing of Ingmar Bergman's landmaps is desperately eagerly awaiting a couple of a farm farmer's day ... they go on shadows, and at the same time, like KK. Berkeley coffee clatch. Most of the lines in the dialogue published here are all bad ("I feel that life is like small gemstones like this grenade ... but it's beautiful?"). Etymologically after all. It's happening (well ... well ... it treats us with some soft nudity and soft sex scenes), there is a lot of fighting against Nam theater in the end, the Nam's age of the nature theater and the pretty ballad folk dance. with acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> There was no interest or interest in the whole FILM. Larry Buchanan I thought the image "Strawberries Rain Rain" was a poor example of Bergman's homage. "Golden Apples" is a very bad thing, but the random random talk that is presented is horrible. 1/10
