Please! Do not waste any money in this movie. Blair Witch is just a story that is boring in German by some high school children. I could not see it, and I usually like to see all kinds of B-movies. How could a land distributor be found? !!! Funny thing, however: look at Wikipedia "dark gun". The typing input type must be completely absent. Maybe the producer brought a lot of money. Money for action, camera and edition. That would not help, because there is no interesting idea behind this film. Unfortunately, the "dark spot" is already paying attention. Please, the director of this film, the producer and the author, as STOP films do ... do not do it for you. The world would be a better place without this film.
