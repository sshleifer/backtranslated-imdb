This film is so badly written that the writing is very bad, and this is the blame for the American writer Robert James Waller. In addition, the author of Bridges of the Madison region. Writing is bad, because the plot is completely boring and the conversation is woody and invincible. An unmarried couple alternates a scene with these powerful scenes by a powerful crime that directs a well-off American woman with a locked American writer and a shameful woman with a shaky story. Show the hottest part for the murderer, it leaves the killer unfit for the murderer, who is as bad as he can see before anyone else. Nothing is going to be a success for this film, not even the face of Scott Glenn, but attractive Latinity like Giovanna Zacar√≠as, Luz, as well as a powerful interpretation by Harvey Keitel of the CIA specialist. Severe loss of time.
