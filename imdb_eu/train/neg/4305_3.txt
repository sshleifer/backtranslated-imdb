I recently watched this movie on a Video CD. <br /> <br /> I had the good points above mentioned. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to at least try at first. It is not favorable, as a character is not black and the other is white. The two main characters are friends and they live very well in a country and economy that does not grow and at the same time they do not fail. Families unite together and have parties and make their favorite sport, shooting at the Sport Rifle, not as a competitor as a friend. <br /> <br /> But, after 15 minutes, the plot enters the junction. The public believes that strangers should hate each other for unknown reasons. That's why some unknown reasons are now on the way to the Bosnian conflict. Of course, the characters seem to watch television videos that watch live programs, but 1993 did not start in 1992 when the war began. <br /> <br /> History, the 1990s, and the people that caused the war are not mentioned. The film tries to blame Karadzic, who has been the presidential candidate for the second largest parliament in Bosnia (SDP). According to the Bosnian Constitution, the SDP was chaired in 1992, but in January it was a dome. The Islamic Democratic Party of Bosnia achieved full control and made a separate referendum in March, which was declared by the law of Bosnia and announced the Secession. <br /> <br /> The IDAP story starts with Alija Izetbegovic, a Bosnian Muslim. There is no man called "STtH". The Nazi student was in the WW2. He wrote his own "Mein Kampf", where he stated: "In truth," peace or coexistence is not possible between "Islamic Religion" and non-Islamic social and political organizations. "In 1990, IDAP elections "Former Yugoslavia" Fikret Abdic, Bosnian Muslim, lost the Christian Serbs with the Civil War and treated his supporters as a brother. When he was defeated by election, Abdic was left with power, he took over power. <br /> <br /> Top-notch movies are missing, but they are factual events that lead to war. <br /> <br /> Problems with props were also used. Serbian soldiers in the movie used WW2 helmets, but they were not used. Only soldier M-1944 A WW2 rifle was the only one that used the SESK, not the Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> The Director and Script Writers had the opportunity, but they re-wrote the story.
