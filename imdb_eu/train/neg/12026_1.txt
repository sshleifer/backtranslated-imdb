I really want to try to make people really fun when they're comedied. This is the movie you can sit on, but it's nothing special. After seeing this, you would say that was fine. It was not boring to see, but instead of laughing at the audience, he did not joke. Entertainment means that you get more than just something. story This movie wanted to be "Tootsie," but failed. <br /> <br /> I gave him 10 to 10.
