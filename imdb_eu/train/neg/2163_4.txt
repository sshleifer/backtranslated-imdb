Pity really - I rarely see the movie and I feel disappointed at the end. I saw some adaptations of Ira Levin: 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Stepford Wives' - and they liked it, but that did not seem to me. <br /> <br /> When I read the sketch scheme - The prize-winning playwright (Michael Caine) killed one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and decided to raise his script for his success - I was excited. I like thriller, Michael Caine is a good actor, good director Sidney Lumet and Ira Levin's work is generally good. <br /> <br /> I still do not see anyone who will see it. To say, there are bends that are loaded. It is so hard to explain the line of the film in detail, without giving it up. The first ... I enjoyed 45 minutes, before and after turns, and at that moment my interest and enjoyment disappeared. I'm obliged to end the looting credits I was dissolving. <br /> <br /> Boot Principal: Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth have all been excellent in their roles. Although Worth had got a bit of false Russian accent despite a bit of nerves (I think it's not personal Irene, I'd like to have any fake accent actor). There is no doubt about whether Cannon was an annoying character, but Dyan was wrong and funny at the same time. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads this - I do not want to see this. my opinion: maybe give it a chance, maybe not. Everything is about opinion.
