Oh my ... bad outfit, worse synthesis and worse: David Hasselhoff. In the 80's, Witchery has become a revenge for an American-Italian co-production, the evil Joe 'D'Amato, in charge of production and short director (thanks to little miracles) director Fabrizio Laurenti. Sam Raimi's Evil Dead Italian (known as "La Casa") was released. Witchery offers some bad food and bad performance. <br /> <br /> A ghost story mix. possessions and witchcraft; the film bounces from scene to scene, without seriously stalking the wooden actors and ridiculous day and night without losing the end of hope of anticipation, WTF will receive serious surprises. (I love the look of her face ...) Surprisingly, Laurent adds more than a few on recovery and wickedness; unfortunately for him, these short images of soft magical films go down quickly and efficiently. <br /> <br /> Is it more on the sides when the gore enthusiast enters? This department is quite effective and entertaining in the late 80's and red paint style, since things are hand-made, just like the little ones could afford.

Do not wait too long with this rainy afternoon, and you'll probably be at least happy. In addition, it helps your little heart filled with fear of the eighties of the 80s. And speaking with heart - every movie that has undergone a large metal object with David Hasselhoff and deeply blooms in the rooms and corridors has to be the right place. <br /> <br /> This is my truth - what is yours?
