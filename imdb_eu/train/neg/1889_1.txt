This movie is not at all entertainment, but deeply in the depths of human darkness. 15 depictions of liberty related to depravity, perverted sex, greed, violence and intolerance. The whole action takes place during some very hot and sticky days in the heat of the heat of Vienna and is in some way responsible for the fury and hatred of the film. For me, the seller of security equipment, the treatment of the girl was the worst apparition, following the scenes of "drunkenness" of perversity and madness. You'll be slapping and I'm terrified of this movie. I hated it but I had to see it. 1/10 'fun' 8/10 'men', like sometimes.
