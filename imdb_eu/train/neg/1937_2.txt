I liked the first half and hour of this movie. The clear love of Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was very nice and I wanted to see what could not happen to them. However, after the move to Ingrid's fianc√© home, he fell completely. Instead of romanticism and charm, some paralyzed characters appear enormously because they ruin the movie. Loving daughters and military purchases looked like a stupid look at the maidservant - just like the subway in an old section of Love Boat. In my opinion, what gives us the charm and elegance of the first part of the film. This movie has been an outstanding attempt by Renoir to make it a success in the recovery of the rules of the game, because the movie is very similar, when it is going to the country of action (as in the other film). I was not a fan of the game, but ELENA and HER MEN, the works and nuances of the original movie, were appreciated to me.
