Can I give down this score? No Well, let me see this I have seen most atrocious films I've ever seen. It was painful Boringus Maximus. On the plot (?) It is well hidden in several levels of nebulosity. I rented this movie with a friend and, in order to improve it, it was better for thirty minutes, so we decided to improve a bit "fast forward" to improve things. It never gets better. Two films that have kidnapped these girls seem to be interesting, but it's really boring. It's never a matter of distraction. If you see it, do one side, try "PLAN NINE OUTER SPACE" instead.
