Bad writing with no fun characters. Being a comedy, I had to laugh. Two friends are talking about witchcraft so that women can get to bed (not a sex scene) and sometimes they are deceived by another friend (semi-ordinary), but it is considered as a man of overdose. The three women distinguish themselves (Amanda Peet). In a way, it really does it without a dream. The fact that the three boys are friends are stopped, along with their individual dating. Their friendship stunned women as they frightened her. - Bad movie
