Melisa's sixteen birthday is next to the corner and she knows her sexuality with the boys. But all the boys who like to kill all winds in the 80's of the 80's. The daughter of Dan Burke, sheriff of the town of Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch, and Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th of Friday 3), the daughter of a mysterious and mysterious fairy, came to the bottom of these murders. <br /> <br /> This film deals with aspects of the mystery and melodrama of the film, and it is less likely to be diminished, so it is possible to distinguish between the 80 Slasher brothers. It does not hurt that Alesia has a magnificent body (I feel more noticeable when I say that the actor is over 18 and I'm not too perverted). According to the effort, some of the unpowered plot sites are unpaved, which are often used in the grid and the anti-semitic climate. But the good goes wrong (barely). Give this a rent, but I would not buy it. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her tits, bushes and butt <br /> <br /> My Grade: C <br /> Code Red DVD Extras: Aleisa Shirley star input and director Scott Spiegel Intruder; Both theater and theater of the director's movie; Shirley star and audio interview with director Jim Sotos; Interview with Shirley, Sotos and Bo Hopkins; still gallery; theatrical trailer of this film; and Trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals and Balalaika Conspiracy
