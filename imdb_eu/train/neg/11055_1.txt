I watched this movie on high definition television. I'm on the wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and I like to see films about those with physical disability. At first I thought it was a noble and brilliant character. It's great that the time of life that worked in the fight for disabled disabled people involved in the labor market. And my problem is not the real person who has done these things. He was a great man. But this film is completely contradictory and hypocritical in the face of the message that he preached, they have found that they are insulting. <br /> <br /> First, they did not throw any one's title role with real physical disability. . Surely they were competent actors, but it seems completely different from hiring disabilities, and then there is no such ability to CUSTOMIZE in the film. Even more, when he sees that a man plays a pods on a pods across a single scene, he seems to have only one leg. But CGI in this scene is so evident as shameful. What Could it not be found anywhere in the movie? A 5-second shot was more financially sound than doing CGI effects, just like hiring a sick person? At that time, I found fraudulent films and totally found messages when I came to think of it as a threat to it as a messy message. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Note.
