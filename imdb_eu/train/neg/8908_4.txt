This series responded to Big Valley's success by the CBS networks. It was 90 minutes from the West, like ABC programs. Although it was a response, he did not do things for the 2nd season. <br /> <br /> The problem really turned out to be a reality in this show. For example, in a passage, Johnny looks at his stick with a stick. It's amazing, at the end of the show, Johnny was completely healed. At the same time, his stories were not as strong as The Big Valley. Think that CBS was very bored, they reused the well-known ones. This was the last western CBS series, because westerners were not well known in the 1970s.
