BRIEF ENCOUNTER, in 1945, is a stunning and amazing version of the classic David Lean based on Noel Coward's "Still Life" play. A doctor removes a particle that removes a woman's eye at the railway station, she has a miserable relationship, the old Italian social worker is happily married. They encounter accidents at another moment, they make up an immediate attraction and meet each other on a Wednesday. The couple will fall in love, but after a few afternoon they realize they do not take part in a realistic and fortunate opportunity. It was a commonplace to love Coward's original play. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two Super Stars and veterans of Hollywood Epic, are not the "ordinary people" ideas. Loren is particularly confusing - it's just true that working with Sophia Loren, a million dollars, is a voluntary social worker in a Citizen Care Office. Burton, hairy look, dyed hair, too much makeup and shoes, does not play your average medicine. That said, you can not really blame her after seeing her husband and wife. Burton is married to a literary night critic, poisonous night, and treats his husbands with disdain. Loren's husband, Jack Hedley, is a potters all over the world, and is constantly boring. The most exciting things he has ever had are an affair with almost any age. They will promote the final scene together with disabilities ("Long, you're too far away" ...). The great British actor John LeMesurier has a three-minute headline as a friend of Burton, and seems to be a bit annoyed, talking his lines in a loud voice. It is a sad and unforgettable behavior that is performed in a salty and badly restored classical film. Avoid at all costs.
