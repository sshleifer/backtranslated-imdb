Okay So, there are not many great movies around. The latest gems like American Dream, The Straight Story and Toy Story 2 are not usually so close. But guys (!) This film makes a good quality balance. <br /> <br /> I do not know what people were thinking about. In this world, financiers can easily convince **** to fund the hole? I just now see ... <br /> <br /> Producer - "That's why we have Joe Fiennes, it's very nice as a button and Shakespeare's love has been pretty good, and we've got Rhys Ifans, Notting Hill It's nice but nice, we're going to be confused with a really mediocre score, a few post-Britpop unforgettable melodies, hemlock rolls and lizards and a thousand millennial movie worst, and believe me, it'll be hard work for something like that in the next few years. " <br /> <br /> The Bank - "I like it, an unfavorable sex? The bad movements of the camera? And what? Devil's bad side on this side?" <br /> <br /> Producer - "Yes, of them We have many. " <br /> <br /> Bank - "Ok, where do we sign up?" <br /> <br /> Please, please.
