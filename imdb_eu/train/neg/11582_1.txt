I'm glad that most of the people that are watching here do not think much about that movie. He has some great names, but that's it. No other recommendations, save some beautiful women you can do in a thousand movies. <br /> <br /> The story does not understand anything, focusing itself on string burning, rather than the "hip" characters. I like all national critical cinemas ... and most of the public can not stand up. <br /> <br /> Oklahoma accents are fake, they are huge, southern stereotype racists are Hollywood liberal liberals and 101 stories are depressing.
