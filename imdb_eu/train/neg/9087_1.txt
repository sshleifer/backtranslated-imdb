The Canadians are very polite, but when the audience of the Toronto Film Festival left their theater, they said they would rate 0 or 1 on their buttons. The premise is a modern filmmaker from the 17th century. She plays the century fable with the love of shepherds and shepherds, the leaders of the love afflicted in the distant past. Working in three periods presents a wide variety of options including anachronisms, including stupid and non-practical dresses and special spiritual rites that are really bad for poetry. The fans are divided according to jealousy and stricken behavior because idiotic behavior codes, cross dressing and different fictional situations. The film could have been a ridiculous piece of Monty Python, which is very similar, but Rohmer's effort is very flat. The audience laughed at the sight, but slowed the rhythm. All this ending is in rush and it's really awesome. The movie is empty and your movie is wasting it.
