What the hell was all that? I saw Matrix and I was surprised. It was the most spectacular film ever made. To make this movie, I am only aware of the Wachowski brothers. <br /> <br /> There are no plots, you can not argue with that. Basically all of this movie talked, and I was not misunderstood. I do not produce problems with movie tricks, but everything in The Matrix Reloaded is meaningless. Then a long-term battle would be longer, then more absurd driven, and then another, too much fight, the scene of the fight, and all this is achieved with the greatest anti-squatting. A bit of a bizarre block that removes an incomprehensible bull of 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> In addition, Keanu Reeves still gives his worst performance. He knew the actor was not good, but he was beyond a joke. Films that were seen on his films would seem to be a bit worse. God knows what his performance Something Gotta Give! Keanu Reeves: The only wooden plate with the actress. <br /> <br /> After the first brilliance of the film, it was a massive deviation. If you have not seen the first movie, we recommend that you watch it, but do not miss out on your pile of turd outdoors. <br /> <br /> <br />
