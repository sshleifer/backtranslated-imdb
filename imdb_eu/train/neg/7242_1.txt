Pallbearer's disappointment and, at times, it's boring just because the love story that Gwyneth Paltrow's (Julie) movie does not match. Gwyneth Paltrow goes through the whole film on his face with a curious look, and it's hard to tell David Schwimmer what he's even seen. <br /> <br /> However, in spite of that, Pallbearer is fun, especially for church scenes and group scenes. They laugh at their friends but this is basically. Check out these Pallbearer scenes only and move forward quickly. Believe me you will not miss a lot.
