I have been convinced to write this review for many reasons: 1) This is definitely the worst movie ever I've ever seen 2) If it does not get more reviews, it will not be. The bad films list will be listed in the list - worth 3) I was fortunate - I paid five pounds. I've seen 15 pounds in stores. DO NOT USE THIS MOVIE! You will be very angry 4) There is a lot of horror genre horror films (and I think), giving you a higher score than with these films <br /> <br /> Earth's summary: a man without a friend encounters a world that drives a vehicle - yes, another magic abilities like someone. Our hero becomes unhappy teenager and ties in with their little body - sitting on the floor, sitting for babies. It kills them one by one to keep track of the police and find them. <br /> <br /> Why is it so bad? It's very bad at the beginning. Someone else compared to school production. No, it's worse than any play I've ever seen at a school stage. <br /> <br /> I bought some of the previously banned DVD companies from some vipco movies and I was not so disappointed. Well, the performance is bad, but the movie fails in every other way. It was a good idea to do this film, even though there is no gore! well, no gore What can this film offer this offer? Breats? No, no diploma! <br /> <br /> It is true that this film could have a particular charm with its unique ability, but the buyers or potential viewers of this film should be quite discouraged, at least, worthy of this film. only ten.
