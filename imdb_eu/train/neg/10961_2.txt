Although the movie Lewis's book might have been "true" (the script essentially the word was verbatim), it did not get the magnitude that would link that epic story like this. They are drawn from the legendary creatures (unicorns, centaurs, griffins, ghouls, ghosts) *, and as in the previous review, the green wing of the screen was very hard to swallow. I laughed almost when I saw the naughty kidneys with their giant ribbons and white teeth; I cried to him when I heard the "lake" of the wolf, a man in gray blubbery, perhaps, shouting as much as possible, and a little girl as he cried. <br /> <br /> All assets are compulsorily forced, especially like little Lucy Penvensie ... I could not get so much indignation, disappointment and red teeth (I saw the movie in fourteen hours). The actress that plays White Witch in all her histories seems to be more at home on the stage, where a strong voice, opening arms and shaking a look at Shakespeare's enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The sets are claustrophobic, whether the scenes are made on the inside or outside. Inside, if the BBC is spending just $ 100 to build a set, so it's very small, and all the characters get together constantly. The White Witch Castle is a rotten English castle with mirrors and illuminated countryside. When Penvensie's kids go through the woods - it's just a scene of any forest - it just feels like going through the circles. <br /> <br /> The only thing that looks decent on the film is Aslan, but you can bet that the BBC was the whole budget of the film to build a mechanical feline. It looks great when it stays and before starting to talk, but when you start moving, you can not help the poor man who has to stay behind in the back of the lion's club. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you're a hard-working Narnia fan, you might want to see this version, because Lewis's only word has ever been written - but Lewis certainly has no scriptwriter and many of them. The conversation screen feels rough and inaccurate. When the children are in Beavers and the scene is ready to escape from the wolves, Mrs. Beaver is constantly "oh, it's just one thing, helpless, and then we'll be ready", children's score. Crying and sighing at the same time and "No, Mrs. Beaver, crying!" - A great comic scene, so inadequate (supposed to escape from the supposed danger, whether to ask whether the sewing machine is picked up or not), removes the drama that might otherwise be the scene. Actually, the entire film is directed by faux passwords, for example. <br /> <br /> I would recommend seeing the new Narnia (Disney 2005). The new movie, updated effects, spectacular computer animation, an excellent season around and White Witch (scene-stealing) captures a beautiful robbery (which acts as an adjunct to the evil of an expert politician). The grandeur and grandeur of the Narni world, removing the least of Lewis's original perspective (at least). Lucy much cuter (Buck Dents, YAY!), Beavers as well (and in real size), and BBC Edmund Bratty have nothing in the divine, Desperately-Hungry-for-Acceptance-Insecure-and-Angsting-with. -Enge-Inferiority-Complex Edmund Disney's newer versions. <br /> <br /> If you're wasting a little bit of time, you'll swear to laugh at movie makers, I would not recommend the movie to anyone.
