HEY ARNOLD! In 1996 I started to air, I saw it. It was one of my favorite shows. Then the same sections appeared repeatedly, so I waited for new episodes and I did not see them. I was amazing when I heard HEY ARNOLD! Because it is a FESTIVAL, because they are well-known as some cartoon Nickelodeon like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. However, without having to do anything, I saw the movie anyway. When I entered the theater, I did not expect much. I expected a version of the children's cartoon version, like RECESS. I think what I expected. Kiddie was a dumb movie and nothing more. There were good parts here and there, but most of it was the movie. Simply for kids.
