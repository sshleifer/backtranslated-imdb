It's a terribly frightening 80's (haha!) 80's, but it's just as frightening as thirteen decades, but it's fun if you see it in a good state of mind. Special effects are evil, theater and script want to lose some indispensable paragraphs! "The Brain" takes place in a typical setting of the tranquil-American city, where all teens work at the same dinner and in the high school, fresh boys will clean their buckles in the toilet. Dr. Blake is here and a TV guru who nominates his adulating pet as the head of the nation's control. Under the label of "independent thinkers", a giant cheek cleans the waves through television and the viewer is killed by innocent people. What's cool Now it's about the Meadowvale's rebellion to save the world! The funniest thing about Earth's crust never explains why Dr. Blake and her horrible brain come from. There are references to the extraterrestrial life, but about it. Meh, who needs a background in that movie, really? Unfortunately, there is a lot of blood flow and the "bad" sore brain looks like a sock puppet. More or less interesting elements for horror fans are to watch the cast and crew that made this movie. Ed Hunt and Barry Pearson's writers are the same men who made "Bloody Birthday" ("guilty pleasure for me") and "The Plague". Both films are much better and they decided to leave the cinema industry wisely. Cast's most popular face is David Gale, a horror enthusiast forever reveres for Re-Animator's role. A girl named Christine Kossak offers a nudity factor and, of course, has a great talent? He has 3 films in his repertoire, which is "masterpiece". He debuted as his "innocent model" and named "3 men and baby", his character is called "Jack's Girls". I really wonder how he feels his career as an actor?
