My money is a boring film I have ever spent. These great stars were the wrong choices of losing their reputation. Boring! boring! boring! Each character represented less than an inspirational way. He is not an acting talent. Alecek can usually be realistic characters. Gwynyth makes ugly to get a foolish look. Annette advises all the tips to select the movies he chooses, all the big stars that left me left. a lot of fun in a function that can be diverted to a desired function. "Execute scissors" means that the public expects a good pace in a movie that is tense and deep emotion. There was not a moment in cast when it could lead to the interpretation of the screen. Perhaps he was the director's fault.
