the movie was awesome I thought something decent, it would be better. do not waste time. Eva Longoria was a scary parker. He was desperate to stick to the housewife. Paul Rudd B has become an actor. The confusion that made the movie, it was said to me that you could never have been your woman. The lagoon's hood was nice, but it needed more definitive teaching. Watch the sky with Reese Witherspoon ... it was a bit better. or any other ghost movie. If you do not waste your valuable time, you will not be grateful. I love you PS, it goes beyond serious religions! 7 hours to start watching movies over 7 and 7 people and listening to people who have already watched.
