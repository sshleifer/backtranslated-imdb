Gadar is one of the most evident films in Bollywood. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers to make movies related to the term is a garbage movie. The songs were boring and the type of song you want to hear in your car is not the whole volume. Sunny Deol is famous for its fake films, where he dominated 100 badges on his own. However, he is thrown into a metal prison (Indian) and is moving a remote car (Teesri Aankh). I can give 50 other examples of Sunny Deol's shameless action. But I'm sure many people know that. The sun gives it a huge performance once again repeating the same similar task. One guy who claims to be fighting for a country using violence. Amisha Patel's hands are a dead sexy, stunning body, I would love the bone. But he could not save the movie from being a disaster. Usually, instead of wearing clothes clothes, it does not work in this film. Maybe he was playing muslim, but he does not play in the movie. In general, this is a bad show, I am sure that some people would like them, because the Bollywood actor has won 100 boys. Give me a break.
