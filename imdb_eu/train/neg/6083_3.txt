There were no friendships among the boys trying to steal gold, and they were not trying to protect friendship. Sledge has a pretty girlfriend, but there's no reason why she's nonsense or why she does not want to be in the same room. <br /> <br /> The film also has an intrusive one. and gawdawful music score, and writing and acting very bad with Vic Morrow. <br /> <br /> Netflix or Video Vault, the last 30 of the oldest movies, which is, on the bottom, true only. .
