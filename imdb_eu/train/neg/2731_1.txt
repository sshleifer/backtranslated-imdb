The worst episode I've ever seen was really bad and easy. <br /> <br /> They tried to achieve this, "we know that we are doing." That would be funny if 'The Simpsons' did not. And he still would not have compensated for it if he agreed with the idea. <br /> <br /> Flashbacks were the usual nature (especially J.'s fantasies). Flashbacks also did not happen to real events, such as J.D, or I do not know ... but I do not know ... Elliott is falling. If I want to see a compilation of scrubs, I'd like to have it on the youtub and I do not lose half an hour of my life. <br /> <br /> In the end, Scrub has got into the trap that most of the seats require and disassemble it. For me, there has been such a passage with five and a quarter episodes. <br /> <br /> I expected the weed would not be such a seat. <br /> <br /> And for thoughtless, why was Dr.Cox bald?
