This movie really is a rare 2/3 day enjoyment. Unfortunately, the movie remains "confused". I know that some of the lies on the plot include "the police policemen have a standard for the characters I have met with, but at the end of the day, the movie has been using the macula too much, I missed the mockets and crutches. </ B> <br /> Filmmakers made the same stuff and only the same characters and we saw who they are and who identified two police officers at the beginning. We created our opinion to be a force, instead of feeding their vision through constant bickering. <br /> <br /> In the end, too much happens and it greatly reduces the getaway It might be nice. Here's what Joe is about at the end of the movie: Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford): 1. His real estate offers 2. The relationship of his radio-psychic 3. He is currently investigating internal problems 4 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you add Casey's concerns, he wants to be an actress and revenge his father's death. Now some of these things get together Entonces se vuelven y se unen bien, pero todos los terrenos se recuperan, en medio de este falso gigante de tan largo y patético, casi no sé si hay tiempo para romper mi ennui y darles algo. Amazing acrobatics screenplay can not be overcome by bad filmmaking. <br /> <br /> If there is no ridiculous sequence of bullying, one of four sections that can last for about half an hour is not bad enough. Joe Gavilan calls on the real estate deal while the crime continues with the gun. All of these lines and jokes in that territory are meaningless for me to capture the criminals. At this point we've forgotten or no longer underwent caring for murder at this time, because we have understood how many plots and mischievous sweets have been understood. They destroy a decent story, I do not. This could be a very pleasant formula, but it was too big for his fiction, and he became a redundant. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett have done well and have a small look at Gladys Knight. Unfortunately, one of the actors can not do it without having to forget about this movie. <br /> <br /> Better than better than "Hulk" and "Lara Croft II" will probably be better. good movie I heard that when Harrison Ford said he only made films that he thought he would make money, I do not know if that is true. It's true that you do not want to get a good boxer to get a good movie or a good actress, this film does not play in its main roles. I'd be hinted at by Harrison Ford: you can still run at least one Indiana Jones.
