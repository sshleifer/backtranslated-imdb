According to Stephen King, it's just a full gore party. Two tabloid reporters, a mumble (Miguel Ferrer) and not so well-known (Julie Entwisle), the series killer (Michael H. Moss) think they may be a vampire. The strange thing is that today's blood balance does not fly naturally, but it looks like a black Cessna victim. Gore is getting really awesome because the movie is approaching its stupid end. Note that Mr. King has nothing to do with this film. I admit that it is scary at night hours.
