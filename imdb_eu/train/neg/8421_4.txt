It's fun to find myself forced to review this movie, but I'm here. <br /> <br /> I'm reviewing, because recently, R.C. Sheriff's "Journey's End" play on stage in New York, featuring Belasco Theater, Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as David Grindley's mastery. <br /> <br /> I left the theater to break it. I do not create any more abusive. After almost two and a half hours of imagining and imagining the soldier, I speculate on the trenches of Somme (I speculate), at the beginning of the world, they gave life to life, all those who participated, I got out of the theater. shakes <br /> <br /> Note that I am not surprised or sensitive. I am an actress and director of theater. So I know deeply the buttons to get emotionally or psychologically. <br /> <br /> But there was just so much life that I witnessed. I left the backbone afraid. <br /> <br /> There was not one of those emotions in the "Aces High" show, a theater-based movie and even a screen, in collaboration. With Sherif RC himself, before he dies. <br /> <br /> The adaptation of the screen is in heaven in France. So, at the beginning, claustrophobic environments begin. <br /> <br /> The only advantages of the film are the aerial fighting scenes that look like their own special effects, compared to current standards, but the flight tactics approved on the screen are still very valid. <br /> <br /> Given the trains and not in the sky, Erich Maria Remarque's "All Quiet on Western Front" screen adaptations have been. But that was "German" if things were to take a look at things, such as things like things. <br /> <br /> "Journey's End" is the other side of the medal, and it would make it a great movie, left alone and in full. <br /> <br /> The DVD is inadequate in transfer, even though it is adapted to the wide screen and 16: 9 on TV screens, it is the same as the quality of the movie. cinematic theater Nothing more, nothing less. It detects several errors, such as small scratches and points, but the rest, the rest, is clear. <br /> <br /> If you want a WWI movie in your collection, especially those who love and enjoy. Airborne battles between ancient temples, then this is a picture for you. However, I would like to propose a "Von Richthofen and Brown" suggestion, although it is a movie full of errors. <br /> <br /> Your rest, for those who love theater and good performance, I would like to leave it. Buy the play Go play, if you can get a decent revival near you, but do not keep that adaptation. <br /> <br /> It's a warlike film, given but the most vulnerable. I've never seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The presence of actors like Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud is just a bluff, which is very weak and very visible. Short films that have been short films. <br /> <br /> McDowell, a talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and a talented Peter Firth, all show very weak performances, not due to lack of skills, but rather a lack of truth. and strong directions. <br /> <br /> It has too many gaps and, as you say, it's dangerous. Dubious in the original theater, one of the men who know and adore is not alive. They have all been killed in a fatal and abusive mission. They all die in the movie, except Malcolm McDowell, who is still alive in other days as the commanding officer of the misfortune, to kill another three riders and kill him for another reason. <br /> <br /> At the end of the play leaves the darkness to the end. The cannons are just listening to listening to you, they wake up with machine weapons and the Grenadian impacts throughout the theater. Then, suddenly, peace and silence. The curtain comes out. Lights. And here they are all. Line-up, straight and rigid standing. Obedient corpses <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> For me, if I had money and contacts, I would play the play and it would be a way to develop it. Here and there, there is an action scene in the rural area, to see the horror "outer horror" in the vast areas of France, around the men involved, but only then it only concentrates sharply what is happening, from the point of view and from the edge of the world ... <br /> <br /> Do you like that movie? <br /> <br /> Then ask. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is not it.
