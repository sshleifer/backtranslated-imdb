Hmm, a 7.5 rating of the IMDb, good comments, blah, bla ... well, two of my friends and I, we ordered pizza, sat down and saw something like Ichi, or we wanted to see something like Versus. But Naked Blood sucked. It's a waste Well, the woman who wants to eat is a great scene. But that is it. Nothing more, nothing less. I did not plot any sterilization, the others already did, I wanted to stop hype. But see and value yourself. Maybe we can push that score where it is. I find another thing: the soundtracks Carpenter is worse than ever ... well, John cool ... :) 2/10
