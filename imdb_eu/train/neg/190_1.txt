I have always felt a good plot for a movie. This exact movie was missing and I think it would be more efficient with a plot. This made it even worse that it lasted forever; Finally I wanted to finish. However, I noticed that it was just 123 minutes; It felt like four hours. There was not only a plot, but the film did not have a striking conflict. I did not see the worst movie I had ever seen, but I said "until I saw The Fast and The Furious". So, I do not think that my review only requires an action for someone. I hate most of today's action movies; This movie is on the other side of the spectrum. There's a lot going on in this movie. However, the landscape and the costumes were nice.
