This is a very old and inexpensive movie - it's a bit of a low budget B-West in so many ways. Gary Cooper is not yet a star and this movie remembers John Wayne's first film for "rows of poverty" studios. Both actors, well-known styles and characters were not fully formed. Gary Cooper's imprint does not appear like Cooper a few years later (earlier in this film he speaks faster, among others). <br /> <br /> However, unlike the average B-movie, there are at least some interesting elements that make this film unique (if not good). If you want to see a woman married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita is interested in women's love, which is a very curious casting, because she has a lot of accent (French) and there was no "movie star pretty". Incidentally, he also married Michael Curtiz. <br /> <br /> But for me, the most memorable and curious aspect of the movie is apparently gay, like a BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN from the 1930s (that is, what we thought was the NEW idea). Gary Cooper's character made two men who hated women and did everything they did through a large part of the movie, to make women Cooper clear. Only this misogyny does not mean much, but there are so many clues over the film that the film makers are actually trying to portray them as gay couples. Especially when one of them dies at last, the other is shot by an arrow and dying long enough to crawl through the body of his fallen friend and then fall. This is an amazing time, and I think this is truly fascinating to this film. Cooper and plot, the movie is a bit of a despair and a great seller. If you are not curious about strange shades of dumb or homosexual, make yourself one side and find a better Western.
