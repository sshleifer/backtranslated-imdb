When I met the favorite memory of this show and the group with a series of friends of the NBB, I had a great atmosphere and I took a CD and a DVD of their songs and a series of DVDs and photographs. They danced to the group and went to the fire and danced a happy dance while singing "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead". That was the show, and this show is stupid with a capital, God is a wonderful show. I hate so much. Load the empty car. Really yours You damaged the entire channel! You do not need any crime or anything to do, you have to get a life, I mean, really, who can do the stupid show with a stupid singer! You are really awesome and you have to get a hobby or something else, except Roselina. It's really nice. But still, you guys!
