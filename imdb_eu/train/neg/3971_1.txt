Give me my money! Give me my life! You gave me some credit. It was a good movie. Useless and long time What energy is lost and totally useless. Well, I understand the sound of the premise and the idea, but give it to us! Next, give me money and leave me. Lost children, mothers remorse, husband's fault! Klixea bai ~! Life! Sorry, this movie was my time, my money and the loss of my being. I'd rather cook eggs! There was no explanation for that. Prison? Why? Galley it's clear but why? It's worth playing - What am I doing here for Oscar and cinematography? Is this I for a salary? How much did this movie do? Well, this stupid fool hired a copy. He said enough
