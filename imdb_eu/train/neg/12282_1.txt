This was one of the most boring movies of "horror" ever seen. A university boy has nightmares about Alcatraz's spirit. "Nightmare on Elm Street" and the standard vampire to make a standard blend of a bad music video of the 80's, this movie has a bad performance and a slow and slow story. Although a bad and often horny movie (rumors and horrible conversation), it would be a good material to deceive Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes. Do not be fooled by the great mention of the movie. Sicence Fiction, Fanatasy and Horror won Silver Scroll in 1987, or Devo helped the soundtrack, or Tony Basil played in the film. It is a huge disaster, even if it continues with the lowest worship (see other comments on the IMDb film).
