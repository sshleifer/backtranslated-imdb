I saw this movie because I only read Robert Hough's little but interesting account of Mabel Stark's life's life story. Beaty appears as a character in the book, less than in blurry light. <br /> <br /> I did not realize until the film about the IMDb was looked at, it was originally a series. Everyone who edited the original 233-minute DVD on DVD did a good job in downloading the 68-available DVD. Is the abbreviated version as good as any B movie in that period, though it's something "duh"? moments For example, do we expect our hero to think that he had dug up thirty deep bridges in the morning, even if his jodhpurs were dirty? By examining chapter headings, I see the number five under "Gorilla Warfare" and the number is called "The Gorilla". There was no gorilla in the movie. I think that cuts have been made. <br /> <br /> Historically interesting.
