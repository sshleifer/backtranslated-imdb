And when I see Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky, cheeky humor. BUT this woman is so brave B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying and buzzing. It also does not have any mood. It's dead when he tries to deliver his lines, it's just not fun. I've seen two segments of its program and I'm ready to do Novokaina. <br /> <br /> Bye, my baby (19 years old) saw the promotions at Comedy Central and said that it was "a mute chick". I thought it was wonderful. It's really compelling to say, "Just watch my show or kill my dog." I know he wants to be a comedy. She finds it as a case of claw. I never wanted to see my dog ​​around.
