This movie is not good. The first one is almost sucked, but it is worth the effort to see this unfinished imagination. That's nothing. Here is no fear, zero tension or suspense. This is not a horror movie. Do not show anything There is no word. It may not be almost TV, except a bit of nudity and violence. The operation was not very good, and did not start me. conversation Finally, for the end of the surprise, there is not one. I suppose it could be worse, though I do not know how. But again, it's time less than 80 minutes, so I think it's good. Although things were much longer. apparently the cut version of this movie. I've found a very cheap price but it's still not worth it. If you would like a graphics version, check the Anchor Bay edition. None, this Sleepaway Camp II version. : The unlucky camp does get 1/10 of great fat for me. If you watch this movie, you will surely be bored and unhappy with the truck. If you're a real fan, you'll meet with Anchor Bay's Sleepaway Camp (three survivor kits) with three albums. special features
