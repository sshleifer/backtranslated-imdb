I do not remember that "Barnaby Jones" was not a nice and standard show. There, according to Quinn Martin, the murder was Act I, II. The character that characterizes the law murders III On the plot (another person dies), IV The law resolution was followed by Epilogue Betty (Lee Meriwether), whose mother-in-law Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) asks her how to find crime and then says something fun. the end of the show <br /> <br /> I remember one thing later that Jerry Goldsmith was an excellent songwriter. Curiously enough, I wanted to see the start-up sequence of the credit, and in seven seasons the show was in the air. I will also admit that it was nice to have Ebsen Jed Clampett in a different role despite Ebsen's wrong miscast. I wanted to be more entertaining than when I first remembered the show. <br /> <br /> Update (11/01/2009): I watched a talk on the composer Jerry Goldsmith YouTube on YouTube's Archive TV channel. Let's say "Barnaby Jones" show was shorter than Goldsmith.
