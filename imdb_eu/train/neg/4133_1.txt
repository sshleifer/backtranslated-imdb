I watched a movie with friends for two months now, and I still laugh today by thinking of stupidity. The first scenes were hilarious. I do not want to see him, I would not want to laugh. I had to say that I had a movie to see when we were trying to figure out exactly where the characters in this movie are. In the end, we all got bored, like the initial darkness and excitement of this random movie. There is no plot and slight acting. The characters are reading the kindergarten in the book "reading book". Lesbian sex scene turned out to be inquisitive.
