There was a great movie about Steve Biko. Unfortunately it was not that. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible among actors - can not express the great cares of Biko. Attenborough's crowd is a brilliant scene. Soweto massacre was not the case, three clean lines for children (some who made wheels) happily joined the soldiers' tracks. In the dead of two, the movie fell farce. If anything in the fight against Apartheid, it was black to fight, in a way, to suppose that the white man and his family escaped. I am convinced that Donald Woods was a honest man and he would not have said that he was the most important. The accent of Penelope Wilton is Hampshire, and he does not seem to know it in South Africa. at all Wood's family has more lines than black maidens. When they flee to the family, I saw the movie, just like a dozen girls with no bigger blacks in a full-length movie, whispering, "This is like music's sound." He had a point. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a good-looking white and a somewhat inadequate film against a black liberal. And really, South Africa needs a good liberal spirit because it needs a hole in the head.
