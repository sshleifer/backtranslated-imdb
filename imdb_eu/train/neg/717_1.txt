It's a parody of LOTR-Trilogy. But it was one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. Bad operation, bad script, everything is bad. This is my personal opinion. I do not doubt in the second that "humor" would be sensible people, but they have been better parody of the best directors of Mel Brooks or Zucker Brothers. I'm working on the movie theater and the DVD store, and the success of this movie was similar in both areas: in film, it was not successful (but not great) in the first two weeks, but after that the reviews were not very good, the movies fell very quickly . DVD sales were a good time, but nobody asked for more. In the last ten years, the two worst films I've seen are Ring Thing and Torque. I can not decide which is worse, but I'm glad that so many good films do not have to think too much about this question.
