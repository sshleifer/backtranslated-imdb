All of Living Dead's and other movies look like these guys have shot together their talents when they get bored during the afternoon with their colleagues (lines are completely unrehearsed and convincing). 95% of movie buffs and 90% of home video are better than this movie (although they compare similarities between them). "Let's see if someone could swear to buy our movies!" Fortunately ELSE did not have anyone. As far as the apologies of those involved in Flic are harder, but I read your fake comments and bought the movie.
