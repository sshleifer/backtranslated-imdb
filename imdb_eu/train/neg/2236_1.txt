I do not know where to start. The movie was very impressive, I can not remember how many "actors" could not see in a movie. The play was awful and the characters were stupid too. <br /> <br /> Then it's the act. I think children also shoot when blood enters. But if someone scores (?) Times when Snitch'd shoots, there's no blood. Well, I think that's just that. <br /> <br /> To make a short story short (I believe, I can swear about this movie of that hour), this is definitely the worst movie ever I have ever seen. This film should be number 1 at the bottom 100, no doubt.
