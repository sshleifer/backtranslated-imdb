I had a homage to TV for 11 years. I liked the trilogy. So when I finally came to see a movie I did not pass it. I went into the movies to see if the movie release was not just for television. However, I could not cope with the fan. At midnight I saw this Omen film that did not bring smiles. Sustainable dialogue, for example, "is written when the baby cries in the baptism when they reject this god". Which nonsense is. Faye Grant is in vain in Good In V with this script. There is no surprise and fun. However, I laughed a lot of times it was our badness. Patently Pathetic.1 10
