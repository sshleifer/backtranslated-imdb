This film brought a friend to a joke and we could have the worst joke to play. The movie is invisible and the play is wrong. The worst child actress ever used and under evaluation of Hasslehoff. The land was embarrassing and we were wondering what was going on at the points we were asking. It tries to be awesome, but it's just horny. <br /> <br /> Just terrible
