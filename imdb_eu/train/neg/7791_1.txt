I've seen an original non-German version and the amazing movie was really bad. Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake, and thinking of how I saw parts of my bad films, I could not do anything for that! It really was a pain that was seated through this film, no plots, no performance or even special effects are convincing, especially so-called zombies, wearing white makeup and old clothes. Their good set was not destroyed by ketchup and jelly stains. <br /> <br /> If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, see what everyone else does, do not do it, because you'll regret it!
