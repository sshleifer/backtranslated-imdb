This movie does not have anything original. Each scene of the idea or (action) can be found in many pre-published films. Nick wonderful is very clear here. Will Patton is also a guy and a guy is not good. Mr Duvall is fine, but he has a small part. Angelina, how can we determine the newly acclaimed star? In general, there are too many characters, so no one is anything but specific. This forgets the movie. Bad, do not you think?
