"The Bubble" is an attempt by Romeo and Juliet to make a gay story with Israelis and Palestinians, even though they seem to come through "Friends" or "Beverly Hills 90210". Characters and covers are the charts and the dialog box. The film seems to be torn between depth and depth. On the one hand, there is a superficial effort (in an example of many), there is a superficial effort, small characters may also dispute conflicts in hand to confront conflicts, and as a response "Hey, we're here to make a poster against occupation. Do not get politic!" Line In addition to highlighting its nonsense, it can be said that, just like the title of the movie, it can be as simple and distinctive as the movies. On the other hand, the main feature of the film continues to be followed by a show on the part of the lovers of the Nazi camp at the "Bent". The scenes scene is wrong, which weakens its erotic power (considering film time limits, but this can still be much better editing). And the rest of the movie is in the movie. Bad. This play is much better. <br /> <br /> The characters are dimensionally similar, but some cartoons have their names (although they are considered the right word). The aggressive Brigadier of the Golani brigade is named "Golan". Palestinian militant is called "jihad". Faghag is a cute little "Lulu". Anybody, real or documentary known from Palestine control and control knows the control scene as completely unrealistic? Well, the rest of this fluffy fantasy. When a Palestinian woman makes the job faster, Israeli record troops are sharp and helpful. An ambulance appears in minutes. (The Palestinian outcome of the birth is not worth showing for the well-being of the Israelis and even the paranoid). In total, the control point is shown as a mere imbalance, not a series of barriers to bone attenuation, crushing and worrying souls. medical assistance or need, birth, death or serious illness. Ashraf, a Palestinian lover, seems to have no problems with Nablus from Tel Avivera, without problems, without any problems. He just wants to come. When Israel seeks to achieve it, Lucy Ricardo's challenge is much more challenging <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Beyond the wicked Israeli politicians and supporters and Palestinian homophobes. lack of motivation or purpose? A dramatic device that is boring to be sympathetic to forbidden fans. <br /> <br /> Religion in the gay-Israeli-Palestinian gay theater has been much more profoundly managed and managed by Saleemen in "Salaam / Shalom", which is why this film is not nearly as innovative. <br /> <br /> Glorious movies bad ?? Like Ed Wood's work, at least these separations are striking. This does not even have that. Among the soundtracks, most of them are Simon and Garfunkel, and yet, with gay sex scenes with extravagant touches, the general incompetence of filmmaking takes place as a weekend television movie.
