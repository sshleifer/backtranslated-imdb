Tonight I rented this movie, because it was a fun movie. I really thought that you did not go wrong with the ex Girlfriend concept with super powers. <br /> <br /> ... but the movie was mixed and absurd ... <br /> <br /> Apparently, the writer seemed to throw all the templates. Likewise, the writer also cast it in a way. a teenager who has loved a lot of teenage moods and sexual situations. <br /> <br /> It seems so easy that you could get a story out of Superheroes Fat Attravers ... but I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This is not a funny romantic comedy. You can not see a child, and you may be embarrassed to see the day. <br /> <br /> If the writer could do a basic story about the high-level concept, he could have the chance to fight the movie. <br /> <br /> Severe loss of time. <br /> <br /> B
