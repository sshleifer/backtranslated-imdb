ignore this It was one of the fewest films ever seen. It is difficult to even have Mormon movies like that. A sad vision of Mormon life. I can say that if you have not watched the movie, this one is not one-sided. I would not think that I should do this. It is very bad that most Mormon films do not have a better idea than a geek team. The performance was so bad that my wife and I practically did nothing. I think that there were all signs of a B movie. Is C Movie? However ... I thought that I had to suck the movie and that cheese was full. Some Mormons started making some quality films.
