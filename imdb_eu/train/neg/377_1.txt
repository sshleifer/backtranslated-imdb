Do not ask why I saw that! I have no excuse for being a Bronchitis and an excessive illness. :) The word is very terrifying, that is, not bronchitis. This play is deplorable, Richard Grieco is bored with a happy zipper and a powerful gun with a tendency to attack the police. Nick Mancuso interpreted as a policeman in his film and Nancy Allen puts only one simple position in the whole movie. The script is a slogan covered with topical lines, "Are you ready, Pardner?" Richard Grieco turns between his victims. Dire. Avoid.
