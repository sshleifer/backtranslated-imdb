I'm a fan of Lucio Fulci, and in 1988 he made two more directors, Bruno Mattei and Claudi Fragasso, called "Zombi 3" ("Zombie Flesh Eaters 2"). . Especially in front of the front, the Fulci's Gore of 1979's "Zombi 2" ("Zombie Felsh Eaters" / "Zombie") is very unique. This is a disappointment. Probably, a low 4.5 score already suggests that it is not a good movie, but small grades do not look like Italian zombie films or Italian horror movies and a low budget exploitation movie. Numerous films rewarded with much smaller numbers. In addition, my horror Italian enthusiasts also seem to think they think they hate this film, and unfortunately I agree. The movie was not a complete disaster. It has some recovery features, especially Fulci's most adverse effects. This is always nice to watch Italian Horror / Gore buff. The basic idea of ​​the film is not bad either (although it is originally far away) and I like the military portrait. Unfortunately, that's about it. The previous episode "Zombi 2" was very gory, but beyond that terribly awful, this is not a horrifying or scary minute, and it's rough and often grotesque gore "Zombi 3". The video is sometimes fun to watch, but only for rumors and unwanted comedies. I think that Fulci was a murmur, and it was a disappointing break with Mattei and Fragasso, the first one was introduced into the evil slogans of the conflict (such as D'Amato's "Porno Holocaust"). and the second one is one of the most bad films ever made, the "Troll 2" goddess. Overall, this is undoubtedly a gore, but I've seen Fulci all the time I've watched, which is undoubtedly the worst, and I've seen most of this great filmmaker's repertoire. Fulci is a fan and I will always be there, but that's not her magic moment. It may be fun for the upstairs, but I recommend you watch any of Fulci's movie before!
