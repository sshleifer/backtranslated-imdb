Ram Gopal Verma has been a very innovative and competent director. Sarkan made a restoration of Godfather and he was incredibly successful. She made it as Nishaabd the same Lolita. <br /> <br /> Sholay has most inspired the movie several times. Unfortunately, the restock failed and eventually it's boring. <br /> <br /> The theater was very good, but Amitabh Bachchan is threatening as Babban is evil. <br /> <br /> <br /> The songs were awesome and have been forgotten. The song Mehbooba Mehbooba started a secondary videoclip. <br /> <br /> The worst steps and conversations were unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie in the theater, I was waiting for a temporary wait, and then the end. Some viewers did not have to wait, and saw it all over the film's duration. In the end, one of the worst movies by Ram Gopal Verma.
