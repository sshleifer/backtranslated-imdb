I have not finished the movie You can say in this case I do not have the right to review, especially negatively. But, nevertheless, I just stopped, because I could not see it ... I came to the middle of half and I got there because it was good about the corner. The film is so arduous because it was so innocent. I have read many other reviews, so I do not know if other homosexual teenagers have suffered from others, but I'm homosexual and I went through "similar" revelations, day dreams, topics, etc. At some point when I felt that this film could go somewhere, I felt that it could have some ideas of meaning or relativity, but these hopes were eliminated when the next set of stories came to light. I mean, check out the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately, you can not play the listening, and there are echoes if you are reading the quotes, because they will be painful / ridiculous / stupid. The film has given me three stars, and these three stars, trying to become something tired of the "concepts" of Archer, went to the movie-maker. Please note, I pray that it did not take all the shots of the long television windows ... Unnecessary clicks made in movies like Korine's Gummo ... This is why it's a great success. In Sundance (because Archer's only volunteer relationship with the festival ...) Sundance seems to be just like a "arthouse" like this. No, art is not a house, I'm afraid of the house. Do not see
