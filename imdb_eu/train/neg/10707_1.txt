Where do i start This is probably one of the worst movie ever I have ever seen. The worst edition is, the sound effect was awful and the sound editing was bent. Most of the movie effects can be mixed with those that are in the background. I had to insert my volume into the whole rumor, what happened ... and what did I hear? Perhaps one of the worst script ever made. I can not believe people make similar to this movie. I can take a box in a box, send it to the producers, and then think about financing a movie for me. Dolph, it was customary, Dolph. You have to say something else. The bad ones were bad, the protagonists were bad, and the movie was the dirtiest. If you really want to know what to do to write, edit or edit a movie, watch this!
