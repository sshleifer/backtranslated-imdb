I agree with other users' comments, because the two main roles worked well, which played Gary Gillmore and Giovanni's role. The bad story was so boring. I did not know how to listen to the story before Gary Gillmore's movie, so I did not know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Dead Man or the Chamber, but what was wrong. He talked about the whole movie, talked and talked about his mother and father. It was a beautiful scene that my father would lose his sensation. This was the only interest I got that interest.
