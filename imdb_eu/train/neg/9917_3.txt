When Stanwyck's husband and wife are dying on the eve of his wedding, he drives him to a mountain house where he manages to go against a cliff and Morgan attorney lawyers. Morgan falls in love with her, who moves her to a definitive party marriage, after appearing in a large Chicago home (which is surrounded by mountains). Stanwyck is tempted by Cortez, but at last he returns to Morgan, a very strenuous and unconventional resolution of the story. <br /> <br /> This film has a great job (Morgan is one of my favorites) and a great director. But it's a meandric handwriting and sometimes it seems valiant. I was willing to enjoy this movie, but I was finally disappointed. Although it's worth watching cast, it's good for those who like movies in the 1930s.
