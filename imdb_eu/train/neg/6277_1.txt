This movie tries hard. If you want to make a horror movie, it will give you a reason to connect at least to the audience. <br /> <br /> Waiting wait and wait to get a great deal of the movie, but not. Instead, it wants to be faster and nothing is shown. <br /> <br /> What was the movie? where is it really And what's more important is what happened. . . <br /> <br /> Why were they there and how does it link anything? Another fancy of science fiction. I love fake reviews of the film by linking the press releases (that is, people, small horizons) that are closely related to films. It's not worth your 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that it's better than a brittle movie, but at least it gave you reason and why it happened and it's the end result. This is not the only thing that's good for the waffles to feel. this movie is as small as it's called a stranger. God was hands. <br /> <br /> The great tip, if you want to make a horror, it will be compelling to explain the reasoning and what is happening to the viewer so that they can connect your story. If there is no reasoning or credibility, then nothing is being grasped and it can not be scary. No respect for the cast or crew did a good job. It's just a bad writing.
