I can not believe any more I hope I see that. Ok okay This movie removes the boundaries of reality! The first one, at least, was realistic. The first movie is interrupted and also referred to as Joshua Project. Everyone who knows anything about computers hates this movie. However, it has a good message, DIRECTLY! The movie really seems to be much bigger than your older brother. That was very serious. The cast makeup was also a bad thing. Some of the plays are pretty good. Some of the plays are very bad. The script was well on some points and was mixed in other places. This movie is convenient for five minutes. As I said, I can not believe I saw he expected more. I think the original will appear to return to the ground ... Q
