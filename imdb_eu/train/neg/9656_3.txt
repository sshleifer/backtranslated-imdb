This movie has a smell of TV. However, he began to start with great intentions, with wonderful looks and true props and cloths. The movie was very quick in a cheeky nose, and the melodramatic television was overwhelmed. The characters were so sappy, when I thought it was mere thought, and the soldiers I thought were so bright and misguided that it seemed to be standing and turning around one after another. . The Germans saw it so unrealistic. The only thing American speakers talked about was that the Americans were wonderful. Please take this my word. I am a fan of the warlike genre, and this movie is pure. However, this DVD has a separate function, which covers the lyrics of the WWI lines, so that the rent was not ruined by my time.
