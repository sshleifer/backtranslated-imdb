It's wonderful. However, another American movie here is a dozen times a day, a piece on a day, and thinks it's "a country expert". Sheesh I would have to travel a week in Germany and then go back and make the German movie "Nazi" or some of them. Wim IL boy, you have to meet Lars von Trier and make an ULTIMATE movie about Americans. Of course we all know that European "true" film in Europe is "apparent in the real world" and "we know" <br /> <br /> Yes. World war did not start for a single continent, Europe probably has many opinions about "foreign policy" in America. <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not worry, Wim IL boy, UC-Berkeley, a lot of Americans who love your movie. Of course, George W. Bush is the same person who thinks worse than Hitler, and to paint a soup tin is "a mere genius!"
