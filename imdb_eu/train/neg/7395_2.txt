As I understand, TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director. I do not doubt that this is the work of a regular man who loves movies or is a film student work, since the reference to the School of Oporto is a definitive reference. <br /> <br /> However, the director Ricardo Pinho shows this film with no conscious awareness of the cinema's notions. What is a movie? How to tell a story It does not matter to the novice director. The first thing you learn when you are studying film is how to tell a story. You know, like in the novels, you need to build your story in three of the films: introduction, development and conclusion. Your story should be the protagonist and antagonist, and it should be the highest point. It works for a three-hour epic for the usual movie, for a short film, and even if it's true, for 30-second commercials. Also, you learn to be a slow learning approach to the academic structure of learning and, after all, to undo it. <br /> <br /> In short, TIM WATCHER presents his main character, and then the movie ends - the whole movie is like the introduction of Jeunet's AMÃ‰LIE characters. There is no second or third act in TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or an art movie; Therefore, you can not justify respect for academic structure. You expect to tell a story and it will not happen. Worse than that, TIM WATCHER is defined as a warning; and one with the true purpose. It has no point or at least it does not work. She is a child and she is a vengeance. The situations found are very simple and its focus is Manikea. <br /> <br /> I expected much more from this short. The movie opens the look of credit quite sequentially, and you realize that you are watching something better than Portuguese with a traditional short film. I do not know about the budget of this movie, but thanks to the recent credits, the merits should reach the production team so that young filmmakers of this country can get access to the good connections they can open. > <br /> It seems TIM WATCHER's style, color, and carefully chosen plans combined with good scoring. That's all. There is nothing else. There are no plots. And shame is because it feels like a waste of production values. It is almost impossible to see many places and riches in the Portuguese locations to enrich a story. <br /> <br /> The sense of the comparison is just as wise as the BMW's losers have to mention a great example. A very short film can tell you a good story based on the location of the product and the elegant cinematography.
