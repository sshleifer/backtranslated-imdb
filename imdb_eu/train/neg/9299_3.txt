While I saw this movie, I tried to explore why they took it. While the main argument of the movie is potentially good, there are no related / unnecessary infrastructures. Hollywood's marketing people have had a lot of boys, double-ended and durable cuts, and men who have been ordered by sex. It is curious that we see more sex with the president and her mistress. Many plots and subsections expand the movie and do not develop a character properly. I really did not know any nature, but everyone is damaged and bad. The endless one is completely incomplete; For, what could be that he left me more than wanted, but what was to be. In the end, in truth, no-one explains why they do it, except those with broken characters that make a double cross. I am impressed by the fact that so many successful (and good) actors have agreed to make a short film. This is a film made by universities working in the second or third project. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, if you are not in a cinema class and want an example that you do not need. make a movie
