Hello This is my first movie I've watched in any movie. I had trouble doing it for everyone, that is, literally, the toughest movies I've ever seen. I feel like a movie movie, and I'm going to understand it for budget constraints. I was sorry for seeing something bad in the movie. What I agree to, but also a very graphic look, but I liked the movie I liked. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing scene I have ever seen is a scene that is victim to a victim sitting on the hammock. The scene lasted almost exactly, but it really was probably about 5 minutes but still. I want to realize I like some horror movies and I give good credit. This director is Uwe Boll, and he should think about the people who used to make this movie before doing so. one final note haha ​​!! USE OF ANIMALS BEFORE YOU HAVE BEEN ADVANCED BEEN ADVANCED BEFORE YOU HAVE BEEN ADVANCED, BEFORE YOU HAVE ROT, WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT. , go to a larger budget with a movie, like for example. I do not think people really do such films. However, I feel like anyone who loves uwe boll and loves anyone, this is my opinion on the movie.
