The murder and insolvency of the fraudulent couples take the "end of the line" ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < eyes It is not possible to compare it with the classic 1944 Billy Wilder Film Noir, except for anyone who should be aware of it, but this does not mean that this update should be seen as another entity. Based on the original Paramount script, more than half an hour is cut off and the indifference of the director's indifference is forgotten. With a strange exception, the younger generation was not interested in seeing black and black films in 1973 (today it is still true, ai), so that the story was fascinated and compelling for a large audience; then, as soon as possible, it was just the valuation rules and the introduction of money. Gus Van Zandt renewed PSYCHO's Alfred Hitchcock for similar reasons, and if it reduced their originality or novelty, much better. The source of James M. Cain was enough for me, and this time I enjoyed the second capsule of the capsule, long hair, needles, turban, ugly decoration and the "guest star" Samantha Fifth locks. who did not try hard. In addition to knowing the cast of boyhood in front of the boob tube, Lee J. Cobb was interested in Keyes, who was tired and worried in the whole world, but Richard Crenna's Walter Neff was only kind and inoffensive. In a bad day Bill Bixby reminded me. Improving the original was never thought to be boring, but in a non-recovered way, the novel adaptation of the novel would be an innovative idea. Cain's book differs from celluloid fluctuations and the waves of horrible sharks at the end of the moon are killer. I fully appreciate the full update of the "Me Decade" DOUBLE INDEMNITY DVD extras, but I saw a long time of original experience, nostalgic in any of the COLUMBO's better-made episodes. TV shows Also, I returned to the ABC TV movie Movie Of The Week, 1973, after seeing what I did not see in the air: John D. MacDonald's LINDA Stella Stevens starred as a stinking mad woman who dwells his wife (sexy John Saxon). His wife and her husband are considered gentle because of the crime and, if I remember it, it is open at the end. AS DOUBT OF INDEMNITY, Virginia Madsen was redesigned like a queen of television, as the magazine owner and husband Richard Thomas.
