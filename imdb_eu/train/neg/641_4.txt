In my opinion, Largo Winch tells the adventures of a playboy, the famous adventures of Belgian (unread), James Bond without the life of the spy! So when I needed to select a 5-year-old movie for children, I thought the child was a fan of James Bond! <br /> <br /> But, after the initial credits, I was very sorry: when the American movies offer an amazing start, here's an amazing scene of action and sex? Then the story is very difficult with financial movements? I thought I lost the baby. <br /> <br /> But surprisingly, Largo caught him and James Bond! <br /> <br /> Was Tomer Sisley a great performance? Is Largo's relationship difficult with her father? Is the multi-box story bad friends and bad friends? Honk-Kong, the exotic locations of Yugoslavia? <br /> <br /> No, but Largo really looks after it ("got up?" and we enjoyed it for a moment.
