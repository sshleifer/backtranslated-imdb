Unfortunately, Marry Harron decided to make a fictional account of Bettie Page's life with men about their issues. In all its work, it is typical that each male character is weak, twisted or twisted. To add to his fiction, according to Bettie Page himself, he projects ideas and non-truths. Bettie did not leave her alive, because she thought she was morally wrong or had religious issues (although she was born again, later in life, her third husband, the minister). He left him, at the age of thirty, his theater career was not there anymore and he felt his appearance lost. The touches of molestation and rape are not annulled and Bettie refuses to speak and the director is attempting to claim that men from Bettie should be victims of men. Harron has not emphasized that Bettie has designed her outfits with almost all her shoots (some "fetish sick" did not). Harron did not even realize that Bunny Yeager had a lot of Bettie's photography footage, including "Bettie" with "naughty" movies and that he was not a professional portrait maker portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Otherwise, there are other more accurate and honest films and documentaries for their lives and the people that live there.
