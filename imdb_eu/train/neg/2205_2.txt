This plot has a great potential, but here it's dead. Actually, I noticed the initial cheese item, but I thought it was a better grotesque improvement. Whoa, I was wrong! So, a mad scientist makes a monster, he wants his old creations to be proud before he dies, but, of course, they run away. Then it's very bad. I would count the rubber shark on the back of some trees, but I would probably lose it. <br /> <br /> You need to leave blood drops until you pour out the leg and find out how to find the shark man. I hate all aspects of the spoon-fed horror film. <br /> <br /> Oh, and when a man of mutilated men almost died and walked around a jungle island, there is nothing more than cheerful. Shakespeare recites a man ... <br /> <br /> You will find this when you're promoting it for the monster ... if you're going to see a bad excuse to get money.
