Scary Movie 2 slams down Scary Movie franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good, but this was boring and not very fun. Fortunately, after receiving their work, they made two more excellent Scary Movies. <br /> <br /> This film is about a group of young people who have deceived their teachers to go to a house in one of a night's house, amazed by their teachers. The wrong things start and they realize that they need to run away. <br /> <br /> This movie is not horrible, but it has improved some things. If you like other movie franchises in Scary Movie, give it a funny watch - but I do not think you would like it a lot.
