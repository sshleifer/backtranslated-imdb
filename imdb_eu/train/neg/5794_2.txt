All Germans stand out in the open and are machine-coated with a gun. Good guys never die, except for its dramatic purpose. "Plots" is so enthusiastic. (Where did the soldiers go when they sold German for fuel tank for the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) And the whole idea, a seizure of a train? What's that! Germany You know where you are going, do not leave as a track and drive away! What waste? I would prefer to immerse myself in the head, 10 times with a ball, and I need to sit down again. I mean, seriously, FELT was made in the 60's, but it was created in the year 88! 1988 !! A-Team is more believable than a great excuse for a movie. See only if you need a good laugh. This movie is called Tele Vervalas by Green Beret to John Wayne.
