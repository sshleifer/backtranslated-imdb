Tony Scott directs a well-known film, as well as a fan of non-sports. Some people say baseball sports is dead ... boring ... very slow. Well perk up! Outside, it seems to be untiring (Robert De Niro). Inside is a psychotic fan of San Francisco Giants. A new slugger inside (Wesley Snipes) and named savior doldrums come. Our salesperson has a murderous obsession when all the stars hit the hardest, the worst of their career and the Giants will frighten him. De Niro is a fright. Snipes seems to be a very natural ball. Amongst others are Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville still attractive. You are free agent ... so enjoy yourself. Violence and strong language are expected and you deserve your money.
