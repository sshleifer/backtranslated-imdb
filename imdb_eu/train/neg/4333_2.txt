Quotation: theologian: anyone with I.Q. For more than 50 years, this film was seen as an intelligent predictor of today's classic. Yes, there's not much success or a lot of budget, but it's still very well done and I've been back on track. . <br /> <br /> An IQ says more than 50. Most of it means I.Q. Less than 50 This name is CARLITOS WAY: it's up to power ... it should be something that should make sense first. <br /> <br /> If all and all of its an OK movie ... THE TITLE has changed and there are no characters called CARLITO BRIGANTE !!! <br /> <br /> Ps does not know anything about film reviews. but I.Q. Under 50, I do not know what the hell I am ... <br /> <br /> Quiet!
