Let's be honest. As a film school project, with no budget and "real" actors, this is an interesting film. As something that should be released as a released audience on the DVD, it's a very bad product. I would change the channels and if I accidentally hit this movie, I would probably arrest my eye and some attention. I bought this DVD as a person who would like to get the best cinematographic product, that is, a movie, I feel very disappointed. It is a video-recorded television play in the line of the old sixties sessions, but without a particular charm. Aside from Mr. Redfield's (conductor), other actors seem to be a campus hats (which is too old for this), or the director's home members, who are not in front of the camera. not only for talking but also for make-up or hairdressing (a long way back in the 1840s on top of perch durability or cap). It was shot in full with a mobile camera in a blank study, sometimes using a blue screen for external origin. The synthesizer does not inspire partly-inspired "puncture" inspired punctuations that overwhelm the audience's ears that inspire romantic karaoke. The film tries to be "nightmare", but it's just a conception of editing (and believe, standards that were not at the beginning very great). Conversations are interesting from time to time, but in general there is a fairly flexible and two-dimensional production in more than one way between the director or crew member. Thus, "artists" wanted to look at the 80's. Mr. Redfield is much better than the director.
