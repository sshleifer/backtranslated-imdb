They are the most famous comedian comedians in Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, and that's why I'm glad to see any of his films. Basically a man in a brick factory is the fourth and soon he breaks all of Alexa's horns. Stan rests at home to stay calm and says that Doctor (James Finlayson) will come to see Ollie. After mixing plumbing and electricity by a cross repair, the doctor checks, and after a few tests, it recommends drinking goat's milk and getting the air of the sea. When Stan plays a few trumpets, he will hang on the window with a telephone cord and a car accident, and rent a boat on a Facebook boat. The boat is trying to be on the pier, Stan brought a trumpet! Meanwhile, the first page of the newspaper, Killer Nick Grainger - Escaped Convict (Richard Cramer) has escaped reading and a boy's boat goes in while sleeping and chewing the goat from the boat through the rope to the ocean. In the morning, see the location, and the killer asks for something to eat, and Stan and Ollie make fake food, for example. Spaghetti string, cheese soap, bacon belt, sponge meatballs, and eats them. When Ollie begins to drown, Stan helps his trumpet hit, and Ollie's rage attacks the murderer and continues until the police arrive, until Ollie's anger is pushed into prison. They were the smallest moments in the comedy, but there was no big black and white film. "Well, here's another beautiful mess here!" Sixty-five years in 100 years, 100 quotes, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy 7 were in The Comedians' comedy. Okay
