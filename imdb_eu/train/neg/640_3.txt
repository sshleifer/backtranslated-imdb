Chicken, an alienating adaptation of the book Rebecca West's captain of the army, returning from the obligation of World War II with his modest memory (now there is an original idea!). It seems Glenda Jackson's claw, but not now, Julie Christie's wife, should be enough to spark some sparkles. This very well-groomed co-producer, along with Alan Bridges, Alan Bates, brings together Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret and Ian Holm, but the burners are very low. There are good scenes (roughly on display with Jackson); But Bridges' staging is slower and the color of the film is wonderful. On the shelf, this "Soldier" is forgotten. * 1/2 ****
