Actually, you can create a lot of screen blood, gore and repulsiveness, but really watching this terrifying and uncomfortable movie is the role of the doctor who has violated the character of women's physical harm done. John Cassavetes's "Rosemary's Baby", broken utterances, dry interviews and reddish sperm (?) Speaks about medical experiments, the most commonly used illness in the world of medicine. That said, "Incubus" is a horrible effort. Is not it necessarily horrible? Not very good, but not? But it's strange. It initially mixes the inconsistent script to get rid of flesh and blood (although the title indicates the participation of a supernatural creature) and does not seem to stop entering new characters. None of these characters, especially those who are not predominant, seem to remain secretive. The aforementioned doctor has a strange interpretation of her daughter's love and acts constantly as she suspects, the town's sheriff (John Ireland) seems to be constantly drunk and does not care and die. The women in her district, the reporter is a strange woman, and Galens (an old witch and her grandson) are voids. All together, they are trying desperately to destroy the mystery that destroys the reproduction of the organs of the people. The sequels that arise during rape and murder are very beneficial in the atmosphere, and bad acts are bloody and disturbing. Basically, horror films are a very positive factor, but the narrative structure is excessive and the characters are not very sympathetic to be an excellent "Incubus" movie. Also, it's not so boring to face you (like Bruce Dickinson's footage) and usually John Hough's direction is hardly noticeable. The final shot, however, is a nightmare. Personally, "Incubus" was disappointed, but there are still many reasons for opening the horror pieces of the early 80's.
