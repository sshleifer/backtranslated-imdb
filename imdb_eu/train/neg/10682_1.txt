So I want to rent a DVD and I will find this movie called 'End Game'. James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR stars and has a synopsis for political thriller. Then, it's worth a look. Otherwise, I thought. I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> The last game has only the most rugged plot that lasted forever. Now, besides being something of wood, I would not want to break it myself, however, as I do not want, I still do not live this monster. But "Why did that /?" And "Where did I get the resources to get this out?" They are very different from the unwanted ridiculous conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> As far as the activity is concerned, you know films that think of an acterous mistake. movie, and then show its performance? This is one of them. Have an awesome script and an unbelievable and addictive direction and have a recipe for movie poison. <br /> <br /> Of course, this has not been reached by the cinema, and for the same reason you should not. allow in your living room; it's horrible
