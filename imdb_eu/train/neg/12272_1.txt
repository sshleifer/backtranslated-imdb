Simply, the movie "Police Academy: Moscow Mission" is the worst (if you liked the movie you would probably like this one). <br /> <br /> What did they think? There are just a few ideas, an idea. The shooting of this idea should be the crime that could be the same. <br /> <br /> I feel so badly. A single word ... ALL <br /> <br /> Cost of rent: $ 4,50 Observe Time: 89 Minutes <br /> <br /> I want to get two refunds!
