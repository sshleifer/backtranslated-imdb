Here's a good movie, but that's not it. It is a good basic idea: to analyze the moral issues to face in a group of young survivors of apocalypse. But logic is so confusing that it is impossible to get involved. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes (surely) are paranoid, almost eliminated by humans who infected airborne mysteries. However, there are several times masks that are surgical, not others. In some cases fanatics are a field that touches a person infected with bleach. At other times, it seems completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> And worse, after living for a few weeks or a month in a new world that has died or died, these people are constantly evolving. They do not have adequate equipment or accumulate food. They are completely depleted in the midst of fuel. They do not have basic measures to meet strangers. After passing through the corruption of the whole race of mankind, they are as bright as a foreclosed extortion. You should constantly ask how long this would last ... and even if that was done, why someone wanted to make a movie about them. <br /> <br /> So, when these debates paralyze the morals of morality, the dimensions of their actions, it is impossible to take their souls seriously. Their actions should first have a minimum sense. <br /> <br /> More than all, we have to fight with the doubtful capabilities of Chris Pine. James T Kirk seemed to be a plain portrait of the young beguine, when he was isolated. But he plays in the same note of Carriers: arrogant and bones. It's impossible to think that all is a dramatic bundle. <br /> <br /> In a positive sense, the movie * looks great. It has a sharp and saturated look that fits the Southwestern United States region. But this is not really poorly written, nor a slim (and annoying) paper. Even if you're a fan of the end-of-the-century genre, you'd save yourself for carriers.
