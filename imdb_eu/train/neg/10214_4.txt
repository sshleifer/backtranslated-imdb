Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good at THE MUMMY'S HAND, will return to this very little Universal Horror offer. But this time, aside as Wallace Ford's comedian "Babe", Fuzzy Knight will replace the stupid friend Stuff. But the results are not as charming as anybody, and the fears are almost zero. <br /> <br /> It's a businessman who wants to slip into a treasure trove of an old daddy's old daddy castle. Peggy is a gang that walks. But John Carradine is tall and skinny in a black coat and in a big hood called "The Phantom", where the fortune that is buried with the party bursts with it. <br /> <br /> "This ghost" is not very mysterious, and it's not effortless He tries to try and, above all, to try to keep his face of the average guy in shadows to create any tension or horror. It's always nice to watch Perky Moran, but otherwise you can use Universal as the giant misfires you can forget right away.
