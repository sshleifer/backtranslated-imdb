I do not understand why remakes have become a trend. Everything that I've ever seen is horrible, and it's no exception. If anyone has seen Ben Jones's quote, it's a "sharp" part of the trash bin, it's pretty good. Why would I take wonderful television shows, I loved it, I never missed one episode, and I've gotten up and ruined in the seasons in the 4th and 4th, I never know. The TV series was a family show, and although Daisy has a body, it has been exhibited or, moreover, has kept the show out of the show. A family show has become a dirty garbage and I do not recommend anyone to see it. I did not like something else, John Schneider and Tom Wopat were great actors (along with their original work), and they are very nice. Good news and Luke are not a bit nice. This was an exhibition drawer. The casting is awful. In Daisy, they could get a brunette. I do not think Burt Reynolds is the title of Boss Hogg. Any other roll that plays is quite the opposite. The only role played in the middle of the game is Willie Nelson, Uncle Jesse, but there is still no comparison. Denver Pyle is one of his actors, and that was the perfect role. I think the quiz is horrible, the story is horrible, and they all ruined the wonderful show and turned it into a dirty and dreadful movie. I would not recommend anyone to see. I only saw it strangely, and I watched a free 4-year card on DVD. I would never pay to watch this movie, but it was free. DO NOT pay for being paid.
