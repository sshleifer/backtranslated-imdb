I was really disappointed with this movie. I watched the first Waters movie Serial Mom and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved it. Then I saw Polyester and I really hate it. The only thing I liked about this movie was DIVINE. She / He was very talented. I was really surprised. In general, I would not recommend the movie ...
