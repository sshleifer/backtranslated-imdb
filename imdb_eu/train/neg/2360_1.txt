This would never be a comment, but still, I would like to make an incredible warning against Freddy's Dead. Not only is the worst episode of the Nightmare series, but it's the worst horror episode of all time! It's boring, useless and almost free. 3- D is a tremendous ending and CORNY's superb overlap is enough to bring this "movie" to the ground, but it does not stop there, it's a bad action, a great script and a lot of cameo, and you've got this huge Guano stack! It's not surprising why Freddy, As Robert Englund has always done, he has made two appearances, or I would have done it if that was the case. Honestly this is the only movie for fans, do not look at our embarrassment.
