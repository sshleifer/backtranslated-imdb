For the fans who have never heard the book (Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House") and the production of Robert Wise in 1963 with Julie Harris, this remake seems pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Among those, it's incredibly wonderful. <br /> <br /> A bad operation (what was Neeson thinking about?), a goofy computer improvement, and a step away from the new version of Jackson's story. > <br /> Please, do one side and rent the original. It also scares effectively without any special effect. The performance is professional and compelling. <br /> <br /> For book readers, it's approaching 1963.
