Ludicrous. Annakin, a 9-year-old Angelic, Annakin, becomes a 19-year-old boy, is somewhat appealing to Amidala, who is 5 years old. Annakin, a 22-year-old Jedi warrior hero, has bad dreams and thus kills her children, because her friends and her entire existence will convince the old man's nonsense. and b) it can only be avoided. Square ludicrousness <br /> <br /> People like this movie does not pay attention. The story is ridiculous. The character is incredible (literally, not "fantastic", "wonderful", etc. Perverted sense. <br /> <br /> Obi-wan Kenobi is an anchor for the whole series, wise and pleasant, but the highest point, it removes Annakin's legs, lava It smacks and suffers. Nobody thinks a bit of a character? It's just a pretty foolish way of living. <br /> <br /> I expected at least a story with credible motivations that showed consistent characters. There's nothing. The story could be 10 years old. <br /> <br /> Oh well, CGI is pretty nice.
