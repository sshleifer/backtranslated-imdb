It is so sad that Romanian audiences are still inexpensive and demonstrative people who enjoy attractive and attractive shows like the "Garcea" series or "Vacanta mare" children's theater. Mugur Mihäescu, Doru Octavian Dumitru and other sub-artisans do not claim alleged "art" shows. The painter, 40 years ago, made a very good film ("Duminicä la ora sase") and another, quite agreeable ("Reconstitution"), tries to declare "works of art", but unfortunately dominates it. Specific expressions of a very limited degree. So, "Niki Ardelean" offers a sample of "HOW NOT", that is, her only merits.
