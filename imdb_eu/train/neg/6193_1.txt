I can not believe that I have seen a weak movie for an hour and a half. If there's only one lost movie, that's it. <br /> <br /> The father of his father, Robert, died recently, to use some local anti-social teens and medications. All of them become consciously more violent, and eventually the inconsideration explodes ... <br /> <br /> First of all, I do not think they can find any sense or trace in that movie. any character If the director seems to see what one has seen in the last two minutes, I should say that there is no such thing. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is not even mature. Most of the time I could not see the actors and I did not have enough body language. Perhaps the crew was so tired to put everything in the camera into the settings. Everyone is happy except the viewer. The plot is very weak. They are not related to a lot of scenes and they talk, maybe they might be related, but they are really random, you can never get together, maybe you did not write. In half and a half hours, you will find real performance in less than 5 minutes and the other, just people walk, talk or move. So I can not comment here. <br /> <br /> Music is a great opportunity in the last two minutes. Maybe this is a good thing. <br /> <br /> I have never given a movie, but definitely this movie is worth it (at least laughing when you watch Scary Movies you laugh). This is a movie about the failed attempts to portray troubled teens. Wait for a single group.
