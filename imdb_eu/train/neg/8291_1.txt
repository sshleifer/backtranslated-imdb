A foolish dentist realizes that he is convinced of his wife. So there's no new story line here. However, the authors created a stupid and nasty movie. If you like to see a child's vom, or watch a woman who imagines you're having a dentist who imagines you're having a dental horror, go (or rent) the movie. Otherwise, go something else (MY FAIR LADY, anyone?)
