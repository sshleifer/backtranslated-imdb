Writing and director Tony Piccirillo has adapted a play on himself, recently widowed, who studied HIV positive in the last three weeks; He will analyze the homosexual couple that he has in any way, he will take him to an apartment and bind him to a blood test if the guy is forced to do it, and if the revenge is bloody and the positive results come back. Interesting ideas are better on paper. James Marsden's captive is really cynical and swirling, but the artificial forms of the actors are confusing; It's like seeing a version of Tom Cruise's roadshow. Scott Speedman has to work harder with the most challenging challenge, but does not convince himself to be as a bauder by shaky nature, and not both men in conversations. The gay party of Marsden is not an apothetic, of course, he is in favor of Speedman's serious situation, but he does not react or act like homosexual men. The movie is not exactly, but it's a scam, a bad edition, unbalanced flashbacks, low budget production, and sharp endings and soothing melodramas. * 1/2 ****
