I will not waste much time writing all the aspects of this film are terribly bad. This has been done with great detail, many times. The "Land" cockney (gangster-by-number) was terribly boring and very rapidly declining. In this terrible mix, anyone who can see hidden masterpieces are joking. It's been seven or 8 years since I watched the movie before I watched this weekend, but I think it's my head to make the movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I only make these comments and, indeed, the only reason to watch the movie, Eddie my brother appeared as a pub scene because it's fun as a second "heavy" . His hands were splashed on Rhys Ifan's face in a bar in 'Russia' (actually filmed in the ancient camps of Butryins in Barry Island). My brother did not have any interpretation experience - he recently joined a 'agency' and this was his first part. After watching the movie, there was no need for any play. <br /> <br /> I remember that there were about 8 people in the whole movie - and that was only published after a few days. . I have never heard and heard a movie that disappeared so quickly. If you want to rent this DVD movie, I suggest you carry two-pound coins on the red stove until it's warmed up and then plug in the eye plugs. This will be more painful than watching the movie.
