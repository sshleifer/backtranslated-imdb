Currently, this movie is listed on IMDb, the worst 42 ever ever made, which is why I bought NetFlix. However, I'm sorry to say that the movie, while in bad shape, is saying that it's enough to be in 100 movies of less than half. Personally, I've seen at least 100 movies. Approximately a shining affirmation, but it is only planned the level of hope included in this nasty list. <br /> <br /> The movies will start with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their honeymoon (by the way). They are also married in real life). The bat is obsessed with a doctor and emphasizes that they go to a nearby cave. In it, they are played very, very, very stupidly (the badge of a bad film) and soon a bat takes a bunch of bunch. According to this movie, bats like to attack people, and there are vampire bats in the U.S. - both of them are not true. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, man does not bother. to go to the hospital! Anyone at the head (especially the doctor) needs medical help, but not this. Shortly thereafter, there is a crisis - but he has not yet sought help! You'll keep thinking again and again that filmmaking must be the stupid couple! <br /> <br /> Shortly thereafter you go to visit a doctor and send it to the hospital. But, at the moment, it's too late and its attacks become more violent and it kills people to bleed blood. As people are obvious, this man is a riotous machine, his wife (like her husband, has a grapefruit to get rid of her brain) does not think it dangerous - even if he was attacked, an ambulance robs the police car on the road! <br /> <br /> Now Moss passes through most of the episodes, looks back and looks like a normal person. Curiously enough, a couple of times the bats develop their hands and eventually used some beautiful prostheses on it to suddenly look. If he's really cursed, movie 1. 1. <br /> <br /> In the end, he had almost no sense in a twist, his wife had not explicitly become a lady of innocent basket and bats swim to the evil sheriff. With Moss and how McAndrew's belief in helping some of the movies in their careers in some way, they both had relatively long career in TV shows since 1974. <br /> <br /> The general is very mute. Plots are absurd and it does not make sense and it's pretty stupid to have a real person. It's not a good movie, but it's not the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> NOTE: For some reasons, the IMDb shows the graphic of three DVD's IT'S ALIVE and is a follow-up. THE BAT PEOPLE web page. While THE BAT PEOPLE is seen under the title "It's Alive", the two films are not linked. It's easy to understand the mistake; especially since they left in 1974, but the movie I reviewed featured Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew, and the other feature films were John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
