As Cary Grant's enthusiast, I watched this movie and I was laughing, AMC billed as a comedy. I have never been disappointed with a short film! Cary's usual charm and effort are AWOL for the entire comedy movie; He finds himself bored, and he's just himself. Mississip's nature is one of the worst stereotypical ones I have ever seen: its accent is enormously excessive (and it's wrong, as Mississippi's creativity has been said), and whenever there is a line, there is more than one decibels. another member Mississipin tried to stand out in the film, like a good player at the table, but eventually the plot was already weak. Mansfield seems to be a darker blur than a Hollywood kitten, and Hollywood was not acting out for its theater's ability, but this film has never had this initial ability. Ray Walston's character was invented and invented at the time. Four men from the sea, I've never been to the rest of my life. I saw this nightmare come to an end, and I do not give anyone what I can do, I'll tell you it's the absurd thing you'll ever see. The film feels patriotism and sharpness with the men of war, but the film fails because of its weaker line and weakness. Sorry, Cary!
