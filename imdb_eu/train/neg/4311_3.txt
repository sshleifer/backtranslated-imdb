I watched this movie when I was a young boy with an annoying hormone and was as sexy as I ever watched or ever watched. It may not be a great movie. My intention was not. Actually, I do not remember much about that. I only remember sex chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. Any movie woman is not for me ever fashionable for this Cathy film. Since I have not seen it since I was caught in television since the 70s I have not seen it, and I do not think I'd like to see it again, because I am sure that my hormones are not nervous. and I've been crawling over the years. However, I still think the shower scene back I still remember how great it felt when it came back. <br /> <br /> Later added: After seeing the movie again, I found it dangerous to go home again. Once erotic, now it's pretty tender. The elderly woman, younger men, still works for me, but she was not as old as I am, because I'm not exactly 12 years old. My older age is younger than now. At the same time, the love of all things was not my twelve-year intelligence. <br /> <br /> Moral: sometimes it's better not to see it again in the past.
