Some years ago, when I was a weak teenager, they had a policy that they had at the same time paid for my best friend and my brother's movie. And I never had to pay for it, I never paid, but I was not able to make a trip to the movies! So I saw Conan as a second and I never said it again! Now, in spite of being a shameful movie, it's happening in places we see - in a brain dead way. And, technically, stunts and camera work are good, so this is a way to lift all my valuation in 2 ways! So why is that movie so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo movie, this is hardly any plot, Rambo only speaks about 3 words (except grunts and yells), "without Romantics" and totally irrelevant and a huge movie (and stupid) special effect. And what special effects are amazing. 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are filmed on Rambo, no one is affected and bullet or ball, almost Rambo films will reach their mark! And while the bad boys are using the AK-47, while helicopters and rockets are being used, Rambo has some scenes with arrows and arrows that look like nuclear tips! When the wicked guy fights gently and smoothly, the scene that casts one of these arrow arrows is made especially with mute audiences! In the UHF, Weird Al, he parodied. Also, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX also makes a funny parody of the genre - not just stupid scenes. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is so muted and useless as it is self-parody. !
