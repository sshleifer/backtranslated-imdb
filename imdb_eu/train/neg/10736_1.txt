The film begins with an intriguing scene, drinking three people and making a small talk in a bar. Everyone is doing a little story. As the film opens, the most boring story is true. However, beyond the movie is not very interesting except for the scene on the bar and the main scene of the secret. This revelation is not nearly half the movie and, in fact, it's not much to see. Time is left in a godly town full of other godly and devout gods. Surely, they are fascinating and shocking images, but admire it is longer if the plot or character refuses to develop. I found this movie an example of a short or lazy short film, where instead of attempting to make an interesting story, filmmakers concentrate on extravagant and fascinated images in almost unrelated stories (in this case, the story of meat traders). to stop the spectator and to get all the goals. The surface has an artistic look, but in this particular case there is no talent.
