Well, I must say that this year I've seen the movie is the worst! The jokes were very raw (they were not expected by the PG film) (Canadian Title PG) and they were not fun! With this brilliant performance, I expected at least a good performance, but I did not get that too. I'm a great fan of Rainn Wilson and I was very disappointed with his performance at first. Luke Wilosn or Uma Thurman's characters are not very pleasing and I could not care. I did not expect so much that I liked the other films of this director (Six Days, Seven Nights, for example). It's NOT worth $ 10. It cost me and I encourage you not to see this movie. I'm sure I'm going to finish this movie as I'm asking.
