I have 2 home entertainment stores and I've seen bad movies in my time, but this was very bad and I had to register and comment on them. What was bad Let's say Sofia Coppola is worthy of Oscar in the movie Godfather III, compared to Giada Colagrande's movie. <br /> <br /> Robotic and inspired. His lover was just dying for a month before he got "Rubber House". He realizes that he has deceived him in his relationship but does not seem to register with him any way. One day he begins a relationship with Leslie (Dafoe). Although married to Dafe, his scenes were cold and sensitive. <br /> <br /> If there was a plot, I lost it. Not even Willem Dafoe could not save the movie from this amorous film of the railroad.
