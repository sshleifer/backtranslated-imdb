This movie had a loss of time ... Why do I still continue to rent such garbage? ... Someone please tell me ... * sigh * yes. Back to the previous movie: Cube Zero probably deserves to enjoy the first movie that has been worth it (as I have done) and, lastly (fortunately), I'd like to get the latest movie to keep the poor. They're used as actors and screenwriters, then, of course, this is a movie for you. If you are looking for a wonderful activity and a wonderful plot ... * This bad movie will definitely be for you: -D .... I agree lying ... This movie is sued on the best. . Okay, I must admit that some elements were better ... well ... cool ... and I laughed several times, when they did not work, but I was still fun. :-) But in the "ok" category, it's not enough to make this movie just fine if you do not count "Manos - Hand of Fate" EVER!
