It is wasted on a charismatic mercury that is absurdly boring. On a Thursday afternoon, maybe I missed myself and myself with four other people in a local cinema and the entire Sydney population. BACK OF BEYOND is a producer who is looking for a fee. Local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (well, Polson has become the director of numerous SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK movies) and Terry Serio seems to never be a rogue that plays a Guernsey. But Paul Mercurio would become one of Australia's largest export screens. The roles like this are disassociates, and such films are just a loss of talent and time.
