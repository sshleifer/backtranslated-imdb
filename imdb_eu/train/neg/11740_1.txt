George Sanders is a terribly scary vehicle, robbery and cunning. <br /> <br /> While Sanders was a great character, he definitely did not see the main man and this film proves. <br /> <br /> It goes completely stupid. Gene Lockhart waved his fury a moment for his pistol to fire. <br /> <br /> Sadly, George Sanders and Carol Landis were suicide a suicide. After making such a nice movie, it's not surprising. <br /> <br /> The usual custom Signe Hasso is not really here.
