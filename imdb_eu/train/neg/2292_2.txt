First of all, I have to admit Batman: it's the best series of animated series batman. We watched on TV. I did not realize that it was a season four. Actually, there was not. BTAS ends with 3 and you should stay there. <br /> <br /> Why should they mix with a good thing? Catwoman and Poison Ivy now have a terrible gray face. It looks beyond the horrible Joker, it seems that every time it looks, it is becoming more and more visible. It seems that the student is no longer there, and now he does not see a man from the distance (even though this is). Now looks like superman. There's nothing different, because both are the same, now Bruce Wayne has blue eyes. <br /> <br /> The night wings should really cut off! Alfred only has eyes on students, looks like a 80s character. <br /> <br /> I have seen three episodes of the Series 1 Record and I find this version more violent and graphic (there is a blood in every section. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Batman: the animated series, there is not one season. 4. This series has been included as a marketing for the 4th season. If you have published it as an adventurous song, I do not think many people would buy it. <br /> <br /> Keep up for it and continue for 1-3 seasons.
