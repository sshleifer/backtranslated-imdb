I must say that seeing this movie and discovering a new life, to differentiate the dull and hand-made Mexican film. I do not know why, but I am confident that Sexo, Pudor and Lagrimas are confident in the freshness and confidence to set ourselves up in our industry. Maybe the soundtrack (I heard it before I watched the movie) was different from others, maybe I dared to enter newer faces (except Demian Bichir's favorite director of the Mexican film directors) and supposedly performed in the script of modern social behavior, maybe the pictures I watched the trailers and They were realists instead of the theater. The film was a more enjoyable crowd and a great deal of agitation. What Serrano describes here is "very strong sex", "all the same men" and "why all women are ..." blah, blah, blah. There is nothing new, or even so, that it uses so many common lands and clues, which ultimately makes sense, without leaving a valuable reflection on the situation of women and men. The audience is full of traditional lies about gag safe on television, I talked earlier (always working, always) and theater shows (in a context that works well ...) and I scream literally. The more solid characters interpreted by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir are pathetic by Serrano. I absolutely agree with Serrano, they should not be treated so as to be the marionettes of teachings ... they assured us their message and completely disintegrated their role. It could be a story. However, after all, it's a very entertaining movie and, surely, you can have fun (that's why you want to manipulate it).
