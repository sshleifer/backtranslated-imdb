This movie is the Alexander Nevsky Schwarzenegger-clone vehicle. His charisma, however, is not enough to raise this movie to his bad books. He has little to add his Arnie action. <br /> <br /> Michael York is quite pathetic in the form of a diplomat. His review of D'Artagnan-act since being a better actor, I felt uneasy. Go ahead, you can do better than that! <br /> <br /> The story is full of incessant holes and relationships; Vlad at the top of this bill is like an American woman, but in the context she is working for a Russian government department. <br /> <br /> Although the story is complete well, the Communist regime, all Russian characters remain very communist. Against this, Vlad allows him to drive all vehicles used as a police car. The scenes of the action are poorly shot and therefore not dynamic. <br /> <br /> No movie was seen ...
