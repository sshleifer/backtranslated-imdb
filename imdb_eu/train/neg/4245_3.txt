Was this movie based on real? I really hope that! <br /> <br /> A large number of armed police seem to have the same two arms that only get the trunk of arms. The idea is excellent; Look at the armor! ... forgive me, but what kind of fake indispensable heads or legs can weep for crying. Or were loads invisible to protect them? They came from Crypton? Have you missed something here? <br /> <br /> This movie is decent enough, but after 20 minutes, it slowly turns to Boringlane. <br /> <br /> And this documentary style does not work for me, but that's just something you like or not. <br /> <br /> It's a very unbelievable thing, until it's hard to see it until the end. <br /> Fine editing 3/10
