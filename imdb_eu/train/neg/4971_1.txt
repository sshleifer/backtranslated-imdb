I work in a blockbuster store and we have films that have few copies a week, that is, the type of film that shows the Sci-Fi channel. Nobody ever wants the type of film, and they only rent these idiots, when they come back, I ask "Was it okay?" They say, "We do not turn them off after 15 minutes!" Films made with computers, super-monsters and, for example, very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> That's the kind of movie in Grendel, and you want to lose time completely, reasonably (and only reasonably). ) Beowulfen based on a good movie based on Beowulf and Grendel, the star of Gerard Butler, as the star of the 300th eleventh theater of King Leon of Sparta. <br /> <br /> Plus, this year we will also have another Beowulf film. In Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson, featuring a star between Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. <br /> <br /> But let's not let this hope be with all of us as we do with Eragon, or we all are in for another great despair. <br /> <br /> And about renting, here is my main rule: if there is only one copy or two, do not rent it, it is a waste load (that is 99.9 true.% of time, usually if it is not a foreign or documentary title. )
