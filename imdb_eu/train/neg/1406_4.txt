This "movie" is like a music video. Kusturica said in a 2004 interview that she liked making music while she was doing movies, and when she's making music, she likes making movies. The best thing about "Promise me this" is music written by Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Kusturica said in the same conversation that the interviews are noise. "Promete me this" has a lot of "noise". <br /> <br /> I like the "life is a miracle". In the first 30 minutes and later it was also like music video, but it had a beautiful plot. "Promete me this" has no plot. I waited for this great hope, as I read, because Ranko Bozic wrote his screenplay - one of my favorite screenwriters, "Life is a miracle". Ranko Bozic writes excellent conversations, but they're "noise" for Kusturica, and I'm so sorry I've seen two conversations to identify what's written by Ranko Bozic. The director's other part was used by the director to make his chaotic stun music for Stribor music. <br /> <br /> Gordan Mihic ("The Gypsies Time Scripts", the man wrote and "Black Cat Black cat") said in a conversation that Kusturik never had the script. "Black cats white cats" was the only text by Kusturica, that would not touch. According to Gordan Mihic, after returning to the script, Kusturika does not do a good movie. And I think that this is the case of "Promite me this". It should follow the script of Ranko Bozic. "Promise me" is billed as "comedy", but there are very few moments, which made me laugh. The moments of the comedy have the same style as "Black Kitten Cats", but they are not so funny. I think the difference comes from the fact, Gordan Mihic wrote "White Cat with white cats." movie
