When I saw this movie, in 1979, I became the first movie I ever made in the middle. There's nothing worse than just a funny comedy, and all of this is wasted (although I have not spoken in the last 25 minutes). There was no original at all. When I got there while I liked humor, these scenes did not seem ordinary. It was more exciting that this movie was released as "Robin William's first movie" confirming the reputation of "Mork and Mindy". However, his role was so small and you can not notice it on the screen.
