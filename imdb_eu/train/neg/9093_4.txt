I watched this movie for the first time and I have never heard it, probably due to bad post. <br /> <br /> First of all, the direction itself is pretty good, the actors act well and the CGI (not the CGI fan) is excellent. But that's just not the movie. It's not a story, a message behind beautiful exploited talent. <br /> <br /> Or I remind people, the director's art is not just your point of view but how to tell a story. And this is missing 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> There's a simple 4 score.
