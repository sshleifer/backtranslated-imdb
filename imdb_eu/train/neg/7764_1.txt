What is this ? Low Budget Sex Comedy? In any case, he describes the Spanish people perfectly. It might be a better idea, I mean that they're doing in the 60's movies ... and people like it! This is not a teenage comedy or a family (you can not leave your 12-year custody 2 guys in bed, never wanted to go to Spain). This should rate "R", because 35+ people only see themselves laughing at each other: S I'm really disappointed, I do not like gay (that's a great part of the movie). <br /> <br /> Foreign humor is awful in movies (except Kusturica), do the drama! If you want a new comedy try Talladega Nights
