** NOTE: POSSIBLE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It is surprising that this movie has been copied and extracted on several occasions, although it is difficult to be any filmmaker with an inspirational source of this play. One of Hemingway's women does not act here (even though Mariel has improved over the years), Anne Bancroft offers a classical touch only as a forensic lawyer, and Chris Sarandon is a pathetic and somewhat ridiculous joke. piece The old director Lamont Johnson can not make a silk bag in the ear of a script, with a bad conversation and a joyful excitement. For example, Margaux has caught the shotgun and the final sequence detected by Sarandon, after his most recent action, is still exciting, but instead takes a noisy soul. Add Michel Polnareff will have a hard and hard music score and a true guilty pleasure, even if you feel bad and have a hot shower. Do not say you were not alerted.
