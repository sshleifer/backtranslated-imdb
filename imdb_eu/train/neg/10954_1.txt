If it was a 0-star rating, I would gladly give this giant stack of waste. If the actual summary is well done and can be different, it can be wonderful. The main task of blocking a group of people in a chamber experiment is fine, but is this experience? I know a lot of inexplicable surfers and blonde girls that I do not know about music or culture or who do not want to know about them ... Challenges are pathetic and stupid. Reality TV show is a REALITY. If you set the "Challenge", do not play with excessive food props and stereotypical culture in "Friday night games." to make a real challenge. And in terms of making money, it's okay if they really listen! These people are nuts. If the show were only better, it would be a real idea. But that does not happen!
