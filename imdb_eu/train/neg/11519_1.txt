This is the stupid movie I have ever seen. What a waste is wonderful. James Cromwell is the deputy of knowledge. I could go on and on, but, of course, I would spend more time on the review on this script. The only things about this movie are to enjoy the secretive profane over us and their fair human tolerance. This is the worst film ever I've ever seen: and James Garner LOVE LOVE.
