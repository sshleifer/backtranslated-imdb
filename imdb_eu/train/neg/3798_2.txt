That's why I have this DVD. Now I have not seen the first Nemesis movie, but I saw information and I say here: What? Why? In the first film Alex was a male. But again, the first one was set in the future, so maybe this Alex is new and the scientist has made Alex a woman this time. Who knows, at least he was not corrected in the film. <br /> <br /> Here is a quick summary of the plot: Alex, still a baby (or whatever you want, in the future, escapes with his mother with a special time-lapse and ends in Africa in 80. There he dies. and Alex (Sue Price) grows up in an African tribe, then kills a cyborg from the future of the tribe, and then runs and hides Alex and eventually kills the cyborg, so he's known, is it not? <br /> <br /> Terminator is not the only movie that is being filmed here, Predator also obtains a fair share and I think the first Fly Movie, Vincent Price, the first one, is unique to build your cyborg heads A strong name for the foundation. <br /> <br /> Let's see what? Well, the small budget movie was pretty standard, but the special effects of a mid-90s movie were bad, it would be a good look at the 80's. The biggest problem is just things They do not happen and the viewer is hardly interested. Nemesis 2 is not the best part of the movie I wanted to see, but it is very close. <br /> <br /> I do not say a play, because here's a good thing. : Anybody expected the good performances of Osca here? Well ... I've found Sue Price Hot at least in this amazonian warrior. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of the "real" movie: 2/10 There are not many pros on the whole quality. . And despite the basic drawing of the film, it is very wise. <br /> <br /> Channel movie rating: 4/10. Sometimes I laughed at the wrongness of the movies, so it's so small. merits there.
