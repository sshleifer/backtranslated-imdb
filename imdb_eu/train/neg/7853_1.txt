Without any plot, with pure performance and nonsense gore .... <br /> <br /> Is this a horror movie? There is no fear, no suspense, just BOOM BANG GORE, then do it. Some of the maritime soldiers are in the wilderness for some strange and wonderful reason, and they capture the very first good-natured filthy beasts that they should leave. <br /> <br /> This is it. Another excuse and no use of money to get money, like "Saw" movies. They do not know about any unimportant plot, and the more they add, the people will see it. I'm missing out on horror movies. Come Hollywood, you can do much better.
