Young and attractive Japanese people are getting back in the wrong side of the curse, which is now mobile phones. Many people die from the shaky spirit that was dying, so if you've seen basically the horror movie of 2 horror movies, you can make this movie a bit dark with your hands. <br /> <br /> The main attraction is behind the Takashi Miike camera. Until now, I've been surprised by the keys to his lower-end work, such as Lost of Souls City. However, I liked the Missed Call One, a famous envelope with Dead or Alive or Audition style pseudo-Cronenberg. Although many of his movies are basically empty, they have at least one merit, or at least something to keep your attention like Tadanobu Asano wearing dancing with bright Johnny Depp. Not one of them missed the call; There is little credit: the acting is medium and medium; There is very little (there is nothing, honestly) afraid or scoundrel, and in places it's just boring. <br /> <br /> However, Miike's nature is the moment that glaciers emit through soft commercialization; The most prominent in the television show shows the disappearance of a curse of the subject and televisions programmed more than girls over their assessments. But, apart from that, it is not behind Miike's camera; It is noteworthy that his usual vision has disappeared without any traces (including its famous gore), although it may not have been for any illusion project, and I understand why. A missed call is not bad. It's frustratingly average. <br /> <br /> Miike, of course, loves to correct it. With a tremendous annual production it is clear that not all 100% of its projects will be concerned. But given that, One Missed Call felt like it paid for bills.
