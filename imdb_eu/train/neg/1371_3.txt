I do not know how anyone got a quote for a bad movie. It's disappointed like Telebistar, for everything. They are buried beneath the bush, the electricity is constantly lit and shut off, but the magic keeps the backlight constant. Where does the light come from? That, and all this stupid challenge between characters. It seems that others are worried about trying to get rid of alive. It tries to create an emergency feeling and helps the public. But because it is a bad conduct and performance, you will not be able to fix your Florence Nightingale with correctness. I'm joining a negative comment, and I agree that this is the worst movie ever.
