Although I enjoyed Bing Crosby in other films, I would like to see this movie especially. Maybe I'm from a different era and in another country, but Crosby found references to Good Good USA for the first time, a bit enjoyable and eventually annoying. I'm not wrong to write - I'm not anti-American, but English people did not have any right and / or need to have a daring, so American visitor, to show so light Americans the way. "Fish is out of the water" is a story, but unlike most films, this time they are "fishes". For myself and for direct movies, I have distributed them over a period of several years and I get the same impression every time. <br /> <br /> (I saw a Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - And that also created the same reaction with me. And I was shocked by my wife - Americans deserve - "on your face" American Crosby's "irritant" attitude He has found it. Roosevelt, as he says. <br /> <br /> As regards the film's premises, his day is quite unique and the assistant is very good. Landscape and music are also good as well as clothing; However, I agree with the previous reviewer that William Bendix's dog looks terribly (Moe of the Three Stooges). <br /> <br /> All of this for me would be much more enjoyable without Bing Crosby's attitude, but it's pretty hard to sit through this movie because it's almost every shot.
