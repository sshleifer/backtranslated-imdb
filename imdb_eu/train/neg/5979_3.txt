There are more than three or four episodes of Pokémon 3 series, aligned with traditional ads. The story is typical of Pokémon (conflicts, fights and all happy endings) and nothing original or unusual in the animation. Some holes in the plot are filled out (more than in final credits!) Unexplained, and everything is pretty sweet. <br /> <br /> Why watch on the big screen? The only reason is to be part of your child's world. Both children enjoy Pokémon, and if they are interested in what they like, we are closer. Watching the movie in the theater is just about seeing the tube, and my son enjoys the whole movie experience. I gave 4 films, mostly from my children's point of view. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
