I was very excited to see this movie, given an opinion on the relation between artistic beauty and nature, I gather types of wisdom like "Rivers and tides". However, I did not receive that. Instead, I get a movie for a pretty industry that is bad for the human industry. It is obvious that there is some kind of orthodox demand. <br /> <br /> The aesthetic characteristics of the photographer and the alleged "ethical" duties seem to be conflicting, sometimes looking after the image of the workers who care about the periphery. In fact, the images were not generally spectacular. And according to this "artist", the scale is the basis of what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> In all parties, stupid movies. For people who want to feel better about environmental awareness ... but not for those who want to think about the complexity of the problems around them.
