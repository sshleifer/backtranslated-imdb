I had to watch this movie because they were so demanding in the plot and they lived with movie hope. In fact, sometimes it is very uncomfortable. Unlike other Meyer's films, sex plays are minimal. Some scenes of violence are required free of charge and offensive. The plot is chaotic and some plays and lines are horrible. <br /> <br /> The sadomaso-masochist fantasy movie is a curious combination with a slogan morality and immorality window and in all its numbers. . Mela means trying to fix sexup / cover for having a higher moral message. Meyer knows that we were a bit guilty of the connotations of the first seats that show former Lady Konan's main scene with a provocative outfit. He then tries to recover the right path, making it a movie about the victory over the good of evil. However, because they're one after the other, nothing will end. <br /> <br /> So much so bad way, it really is worth watching a bad movie if you appreciate the worst art. Possible taste. Maybe it's so bad that Meyer leaves us unacceptable.
