Sky Captain is probably a great movie that I've seen for a long time. With a stunning CG and special effects, with the A-list cast (Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Giovanni Ribisi infinitely enjoyable) and an overlay but excessive Indiana Jones-skiing race, this should be a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 'It should be here, of course, a fundamental term. <br /> <br /> Jude Law plays Joe the Sky Captain with great accents and more. -You can not melt in your heart, but you can not do anything, and its delightful deliveries and youngsters can not keep the stone's conversation. (He played Giovanni Ribisi in the back and said, "Good boy, Dex," it's just a little more time, maybe I'd be barfed for all the boys I've been facing.) Gwyneth Paltrow, like Polly Perkins, is nothing short of nothing. nerve mesh His nose and nose are not quite sarcastic in the first ten minutes of the film. Perhaps he did a lot of effort to play the heroine of the stereotypical 30s ... Who knows? I expected more from him. How to play a similar character (and play well) at the end of the 90s is an example of "The Phantom", featuring Kristy Swanson and Billy Zane. Rent the movie and know what you mean. <br /> <br /> Passion for saving films by Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie. (Angelina Jolie was very warm in that eyepatch. I will confess.) Only a few short scenes, two actors managed to raise some kind of overly tired material and give more performance than their dry, dimensional castmates. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The progress of the story and the permanent story are old and boring, and basically it's just a monotonous combination of all the good scenes in the last thirty years of an action movie. The rhythm is rapidly shot in the first half of the film, and the rhythm of a secondary snail, not only gives enough time to listen to the audience, but also the ultimate consequence of the film, but also who is the most malignant. Paring is quite dangerous, too, because Polly Perkins and Sky Captain seem to be confused for some years at the end of their annoying distinction, and their story is not so charming and eclectic. At the end of the film, when they reach mutual feelings, no one is surprised and no one is in any way responsible for it. Full color film and sepia-intense shades of color. But Sky Captain, despite all the key elements to be a great movie, falls on his face. It's $ 2.75 paid for access to the theater.
