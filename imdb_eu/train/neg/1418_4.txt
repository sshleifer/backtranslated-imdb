I do not know why this behavior was ever tolerated in business! This movie (short) is gross (at least)! It is a series of children of 5-7 years old, dressed in a large balloon, like adults (and too much!). However, it is interesting that it is a good example because "good times" may not have been so good! (Thank God we have laws against these materials now!) <br /> <br /> {Shirley Temple Festival is a summary}}
