"Welcome to Collinwood" is a disaster. Considering the people involved, it should have several times better. <br /> <br /> If you think that, if at least one of your faiths is at stake, this will improve, you will most likely cry. It is one of the great films of choice, but this potential was removed from the horrible script and bad performance, without taking into account the nonsensical, unpleasant and unnecessary character of George Clooney, and Richard Dreyfuss. so little, I do not want to know his name. <br /> <br /> The only grace of the film is a quaint budget. I thought of myself when I saw more of the crime once more. The only reason I gave the movie 3. The drawing is boring, neurotic characters, unnecessary offensive and very unlikely. Stress is constant and I face these obstacles so crazy. They cite each other and swore swear. We have the most suggestive conversations and stupid humiliation at small points. <br /> <br /> I think that Steven "Traffic" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are guilty of it. War crimes should be tried, if anyone remembers enough to take care of themselves.
