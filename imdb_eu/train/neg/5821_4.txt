As others have pointed out, it would have been a great Hammer-style movie, and it seems as if actors were playing ... but the script is so green, with bad timing and full. The sad soliloquy (Timothy Dalton's poor saddle for most of them) is overblown and self-important. Dalton does not have a low performance, but Dr. Rock Rock realizes that he ends up quietly. The only actor that comes out very well, Patrick Stewart who is welcome. Freddie Francis could have been an excellent picture filmmaker, but he was a bad director.
