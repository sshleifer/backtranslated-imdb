So, both of us and my wife finished them, although we had changed them with many threats. In most cases, boredom was the worst part of this movie, there was little excitement. The play was atrocious; in fact, we often woke up in a few times worse scenes (for example, the mistress of the church). Sister Murray was using a paranormal mediator to communicate his life with the twin, but instead of sending valuable information, he tried to avoid the fear of a cyclist, which is why he was similar to the Ring. Then the police involved, I'm sure he would find that saving your ears from DNA; That's why the man who covered the unexpected death of his sister creates a horrible plan. I call a horrible plan, in the end, it also lets you kill it, which disappears from the black movie. Bad conversation, play, bad ending.
