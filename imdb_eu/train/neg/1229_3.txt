I apologize, but with Kim Basinger, when he was terribly good at work, it was one of the biggest thriller I have ever seen. Logic 4 young women frighten this woman out of a crowded environment and shoot a security guard. However, nobody realizes it. Then, instead of shouting they could take them to help or races, he runs away and ends up in the middle of the woods with the jailer. I can not even describe how this stupid woman escapes from four delayed thugs, making a red box of tools, shouting to God, and then losing one of those sex with others. Please trust me, that's a bad thing and a taste too.
