Typical Italian 70s movie, original and good music, but some photography, interesting but not fantastic photography, a bad and sometimes mischievous story (for example, the role of wolves, and where do the boys come from?), A pleasant atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Still (well-known) and looking for this reason is probably a nude scene (typical 70-year-old pseudotype) with a girl of 11 and 13. With an older teenager (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel) - it's interesting in the sociopolitical point of view that teenagers are very acceptative and normal in Europe (and the United States), 30 years ago. But now it's more than taboo. <br /> <br /> The stories about a girlfriend (Laura) are about two other characters and sexual discovery, a pretty detailed appearance of teenage life. Eva's character (Silvia) does not change to the end of the film and is very versed in erotic art: "it's not too old" for him: he is already a very cheerful young girl. Sexual charm, but in the end it is just used and the movie is ending. The girl is really crying as it is. The boy is completely despicable, while Laura becomes a victim.
