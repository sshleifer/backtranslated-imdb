I had a great hope for "My Beautiful Laundrette", "Beckham like it Bend" and "East-East". The great screen shots of the British Asian asians that took part in the house, as well as the great television and radio series (Goodness gracious me, etc.), took place. This drops. Despite the good start, the hill fell quickly. <br /> <br /> In the end, the BBC's enormous efforts were made to try to make the region's strong accents and dramatic characters a bit like "sound days" and "themes". <br /> <br /> I bent down a lot of points in this movie. Writing is predictable. They pulled out Klixera and made it into the air. Actually, I have no problems with thinking about the culture / intergenerational devices I could not use. The characters were thin and hidden: unconforming consensus minister; the meaning of the old woman but racist; weight and aunt; Indian acute parents; employee classmate; "wise" grandmother deep; motorcycle riding The script was a weak one, and in every chance the audience could be welcomed by a clear racist dialogue with two racist racist rites. And why should it be for the 70's why (except for the pretext for the 70's soundtrack) it is a mystery. Unbelievable characters may be credible to those born after 1974. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Apart from these things, good behavior would make it a respectable darkness. Instead, the usual "BBC comedy" rowers were removed. "Bend it like Beckham" would play a much better role than comic (and indeed a serious act), almost uncharted. <br /> <br /> In short, with ordinary, lazy scripts, dull. Predicted story Ask. <br /> <br />
