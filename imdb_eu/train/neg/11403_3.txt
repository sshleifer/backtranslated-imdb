I love horror films, low budgets, in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 80s ... but how can you imagine that this horror movie is very good? let's compare titles with similar old-fashioned movies. Haunting, changeling, shining. or similar-based horror film FAAAR was better (though still great) Demon Seed. Okay, I'll be right. Let's do it with movie horror movies! do not go to sleep ... waaay creepier and do better. Many salem, night stalker, night gallery, even if they did not go to the basement or crowhaven farm were much better. * SPOILERS * First of all, for a good scene like bloody shower scene, you have a scene to open a scene ... oh boy! The garden sleeve tries to take some pretty teenagers! Terrible Similarly, it's just what we understand about the home. It seems that video cameras need to be used to see what happens, and the house is very emotional. Not a spirit, not a demon or an entity, that is, the "possessed" house, but what? We think we have learned an inanimate object with our hero, marzipan, sailor? Now, I'm talking about a suzie theme ... a lot of other things that he was very worried about me comes from this ill-fated lady, he tells you he has a nurse, he throws his heart, he's boiling in the pool, he's struggling for 45 seconds. , and what does margaret do? Is it safe to save this weak woman who will face his hands? no, he stands up and sees it! The biggest participation was better than the average horror film, but it ends with positive. A horror movie about an inanimate object that watches the bedstand is more interesting and fun: the bed that eats. I feel that people who value it very well did not see it when they originally thought about it, or they remembered it as a child. This film was merit less.
