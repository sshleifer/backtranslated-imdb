There's no spoiler here, but I've been a fan of Wake-up, but the latest series, so far, have been 3 so far, it's horrible. Stories do not look like the original idea of ​​the series. I found the last 3 series in the final. As a BBC non-licensed, after the show, I called BBC Complaints to overcome my disappointment. I'm surprised that the actors of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone do not work on the story. These actors have been in these seasons with 8 characters, they see that they lost all directions. It's a good job to start the final series or the next series that is part of Father Christmas's death! <br /> <br /> Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
