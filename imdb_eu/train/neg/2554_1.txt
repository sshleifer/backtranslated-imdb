I honestly do not joke, when I say that it is one of the worst movie ever I have ever seen! This movie does not have a single original dish in its melancholic conversation or in a horrified story. I can not count the number of the pieces in this movie that "The Omen" and other films rip them. For example, "Lucy" is the umbrella of the nanny for protecting and protecting one's demon from Satan's birth. Actually, that is, Mrs. Baylock for everybody else. Another thing is when the orphanage was first when the child was burned to the ground, when they took a few months, like "Omen". However, fortunately, a priest blew up the blaze and removed his burns from his whole body ... another by chance ?????? And the priest burned down in the hospital room on the walls of the walls of Jesus, as the "Omen" priest is like covering the walls on the pages of Jesus' Bible. Please do not start the end of this movie and draw comparisons with "Omen", because, as I said before, there's much to be mentioned here.
