This is a good reason. The story is very proud, Nick Cag joins Johnny as coarse sex in churches, and other scenes have no taste (like laundry scenes) they paint this movie. Judge Reinhold's portfolio is fine, but the film itself does not do well with its degradation and revenge. But it's a short film, trivia in the competition ... because they saw little people.
