What is it like when we live when someone like Joe Swan, anyone who plays a good filmmaker, or even a filmmaker! Where are the new filmmakers and talent? We need bad guys and mumbles with hell! <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing, because the characters in the movie are not worth it. The so-called Gen Y is stupid, idiotic, and some of them declare themselves filmed by filmmakers until they learn anything. Orson Welles was filmmaker. John Huston was the filmmaker. Fellini was filmmaker. Dreyer was a filmmaker, etc. Movies from that period show how stupid young people, called "filmmakers", can be guided by scripts, without directions, without thinking, "cameraman". DV), from artisan editing, nothing, "rebellion" or "advanced" cinematography. No, it's called ignorance and laziness or it's called a mere masturbation movie (and that's actually a "jack-off shot" that's on your face so be ready). <br /> <br /> Take a look at the early films of the "indie" filmmaker: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee or Herzog ... nobody has been tedious and boring. That is, however, Swan, because of all, still goes to SXSW each year and calls it a new and daring tale. It's wrong! I can not imagine anyone who likes it, and everything else they call filmmaker (what I see) is not so bad (for one of the main publications, clearly called the viewer). Correctly make clear if you are not a member of your friends or family ... think second, if you're a family member or a friend, you're likely to be ashamed to see family members or friends in these dangerous situations ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Completely rubbish. This is not art. This is the opposite of the latter.
