After delighting in "The Devil and Miss Jones" by Jean Arthur, my interest was over, so I tried to find out about a second study about the death of a jockey, but I did not finish it to the end. . Arthur, a trendy movie magazine, takes pictures, William Powell, a former husband or another filmed wedding, wants food, but I have never felt that his personality is merely a box of food (a trendy type of heroine, a comical curious comic, but Once in a morgue, like all comedies in the 30 comedies, it eliminates it). William Powell worked for a long time with Miss Arthur, but you would never know the final result; They look up at each other, they have doubts about their rumors. The actor who plays Powell's ballet is very upset and the stops at the audience laugh are embarrassed.
