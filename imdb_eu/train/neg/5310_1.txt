I'm not talking about another review. This is definitely not a bimbo movie, in fact, I do not think it was a decent decent girl. Not just cheesy, misunderstood, Ed Wood is a science-fiction schloice. And it's bad. I can not start saying what's wrong. At night I saw the cable late, and I was in a hurry. This is a film that has never been published. The actors were the producers' friends or the delay of the mind, the special effects were a joke and the rhythm was very slow. For me, however, it's music. A monkey wrote a better topic with a xylophone toy. Do not rent this thing, but if you see the cable, see. You'll be amazed at how bad a movie can be.
