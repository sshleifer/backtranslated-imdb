People who are praying for this movie are really disappointed. I expect at least that Leonard is well versed with $$, because two years ago a manager had saved his money and has been with it for more than 70 years now. But this movie is horrible. Initially, Leonard tells him that he had no sentimental past, and then the next hour and a half later emphasizes the worst sentimental elements of Leonard's songs. So the bloody PRECIOSA is the endless fan of his singer. Cohen's interview is made in the first shots of the lo-fi video, so I wanted to see half or a whole length of his body! I can not take much less attention to the comments of the performers, especially Edge and Bono, my dear ego. Nobody in this movie can play as much as one of the songs of Leonardon and see it and have doubts about it. This could be a special PBS, perhaps, temporarily. But I will also question that DVD. The film is finally shown by Leonard as part of the "Song of Tower" in the middle of a play by Bono. Also, occasional performances (Antony, Rufus's first number, Martha's treacherous) have been spoiled in the context of this blabla root. Forget this and go buy the latest Leonard album if you want to pay homage.
