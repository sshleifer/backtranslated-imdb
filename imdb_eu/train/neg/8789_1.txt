I watched this DVD in exchange for the dollar, so I easily smiled as I was spreading this awesome movie. Every time you think it's worse, it's inevitable. The play is totally horrible. The plot does not make any sense. The title "cold revenge" in the US DVD version has nothing to do with the script. The action scenes, first of all, have been taken. There are a lot of mistakes in trying to make mistakes in conversations trying to try to make this movie a sustainable one. I can not remember the movie I've seen worse and it seems bad from time to time - well, except with restless Wesley Snipes. No, who I am in jest, while bad, Unstoppable Oscar Prize is Best in the Oscars, but it's not like that.
