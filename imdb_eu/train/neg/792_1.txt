Thank you for the BBC for this show. I suffered a temporary complex, I hate to leave home, talk to new people and I had a huge sense of people hating me. However, after seeing a section of 4 Blondes, my fortunes changed. After section 2 I started applying for new jobs, I was dressed in fashion clothes and I felt the talent. When the series was over, I was working on the sale, many women got tired and I often won the karaoke contest. If you have a trusted crisis and you do not know where to turn it on, then take the Poundland and take the DVD 99 p.
