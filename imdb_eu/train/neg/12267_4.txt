I just did not like talking as a movie. Because there was no single FX movie or a single cab like a single movie, the truth is that when it was kept up to me. <br /> <br /> I do not like acting because it was dark, his "friends" are happy and then mad, but you do not know why; Then they take on different roles, one believer, another one is antagonist, but never make any point! Also, the light was awful and I am referring to technical issues. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the movie "I'm here!" from some characters. like a lady who does not want to hear the version of her Bible. <br /> <br /> About the story, everyone wants to write for free, and the story is a proof of writing and good imagination. . I have been credited for this book by my 4/10. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, listen to the story of the man or not, you just do not spend as much as you believe in all the time. He who says he will be amazed and at the same time move and joke as you do not think. <br /> <br /> Consistency. <br /> <br /> thank you for reading;)
