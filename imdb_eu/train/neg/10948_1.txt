What did they think of Cannes? One of the toughest movies of all time. All the details of this film, regardless of its significance. If I looked at it, I think I'd think I'd take the boots. The point at which this film was shown was how Rosetta had lived, after covering the first fifteen minutes of the film and then executing credits. But no, we've had to watch numerous redundant scenes repeatedly. The whole thing was full of non-complacent and sympathetic characters. Rosetta was worth the misery. And I thought I had overcome "Tumbleweeds" to see this boring movie. It was exciting to see herbs.
