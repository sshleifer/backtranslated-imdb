I think some of the films that I've seen with Combs are an accident. He had more holes in the land than I ever saw in a movie to be something more than "B" movie. The play was so laughable, there was no recollection of the past victories in Combs, they were not enough. Based on the script, I have to think that there is not enough money in the buddy like continuity and original ideas. I'm shaking the blockbuster prices for the bin. It was something that was atrocity that was made for television, and in fact, something that should be warned by the poor movies. Avoid any movie.
