Well, my friends, movie enthusiasts are expected to see all types of serious, bad and good, and this movie has been tested. I do not say words mining. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The performance was bad. Sissy Space was always wonderful to not make a better movie. In fact, I asked him why I went to see this rotten rough movie? Why did I lose some time and money for something I suspected? The answer, of course, is a movie fan, so I can not avoid it otherwise. I did not waste any explanation of what happened with your love film, except to say that the quality of the interpretation was kindly placed underneath. It's a good movie to be in charge of watching this movie. Otherwise. stay home, do not waste your time, read a book, take the birds or take a good sandwich.
