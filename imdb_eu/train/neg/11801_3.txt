Since it is a fan of the original movie, it is difficult to see this show. Bright and brightly lit versions of this set steal any style. That mood is never there. Instead, it looks like it looks and looks like a lot of television in the 70's. Crenna is not a bad choice as Walter Neff, but her wardrobe and swank apartments do not adapt to the mood of the original, or become an interesting character. He makes his efforts, but Samantha Egger is a bad choice. With English accent and Californian appearance Barbara Stanwicken can not be a velvet voice and sexual appeals candle. Lee J. Cobb tries to make flowers with Barton Keyes, but his performance is also rude, without style. <br /> <br /> It looked like television and once again reminds me that the original film is still original.
