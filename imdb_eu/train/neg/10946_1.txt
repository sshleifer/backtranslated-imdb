"Malcom's FOX show is dying ... can not we make our version?" I speculate and paraphrase, of course, but in our heart we know that the only thing that NBC added to the "Malcom" metric was sex. And, boys, they added sex ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Tucker accidentally connects his aunt to the shower and accuses him of watching and playing. She is spying on the girlfriend of her home-room window, and she knows she wants to see her topless, but she is keen to close her smile and window. And all this is in the pilot. <br /> <br /> Take it from the grown man. Teenage boy is a sexual guilt and it's not possible to be fun for the main audiences to focus on the testicles. Everyone has been in the cinema at close proximity and you can count them on one side. So it is not surprising that "Tucker" has a warm and appealing strip club bathroom. Did the network think they wanted kids to play puberty? Is not it people going to jail? If you question the depravity of the show, 13 episodes have been filmed, but NBC has only suspended 4 episodes. Then, the rest of the episodes made unexpected movements of "burning" at noon to avoid seeing these children. Irony children were originally receptors. <br /> <br /> In addition to his rumor, Tucker has the initial voices of the main character who writes scripts. In 2000, though it was dated, ska music and super sarcasm. I can not like to laugh at jokes and the jokes did not seem like a minute or so ... It's better than this misfortune for NBC ... it's better than this. . <br /> <br /> GRADE: C-
