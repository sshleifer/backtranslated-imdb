This weekend I caught this movie, and when I was sitting there, it might have been the worst movie I ever had. Bad operation, bad filmmaking, bad sound, incredible fighting sequences, stupid characters. It was the strangest movie I liked most of all. It was so bad that it fascinated me that I was missing out on any semi-competent ... I had to watch ... and they made a sequel!
