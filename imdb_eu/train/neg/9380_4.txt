In the last two weeks of a woman with a vagabond dead she is told flashbacks. As a film, the film does not make sense and useless. Mona, a title, a lazy, hairy and drug-adder, is not pleasant and Bonnaire does little to be of interest. However, there is a dialogue that explains why Mona has chosen this wonderful lifestyle, but his motivations have never been very clear. The episodic nature of the movie, involving some random characters, becomes a great deal of time, much longer than long. It is also difficult for an attractive young homeless woman to avoid paying more attention to men.
