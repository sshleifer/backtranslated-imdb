The film is likely to be tempted by Peter Sellers. That would be a mistake. It's one of those films never made without films. I expected something fun, but there's nothing funny in this movie. Although the film industry was a very weak film and did not try to promote it. It's amazing to ever put the video. <br /> <br /> What kind of contract Sellers caused in this film. I'm sorry that the makers of this film allowed them to do other bad movies. Surely, the money created to create this film is lost, and anyone loses lost time. It is surely possible that high school students would be able to write and produce in a plot mode.
