I'm afraid this movie did not like me. Apart from some save saver, nothing is written. <br /> <br /> J-horror has risen over the past five and six years, but the films have more than one account of repetitions and copies of previous success. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a supernatural slasher movie. At first the cold scene with a morgue is a good start, where a dead man grabs his eyes graphically, but soon opens them. However, after that, this movie is coming down quickly. <br /> <br /> I'll start with things that I like about "Gawi". In a positive sense, the images are gaudy and the movie looks great for its kind. For those who like their horror movies, some slaughter scenes are well executed. We also get some suspense sequences / good set pieces. <br /> <br /> However, there are also some disadvantages ... <br /> <br /> First and foremost, my main complaint is this movie, it's time for the plot and it jumps and jumps with a disturbing intensity. It's not usually a problem for me, but here, with how much time the students look the same, I was confused more than once. <br /> <br /> I have good performances (a) I do not know how hard it is when you do not know the language), but it seems a little tough. And for a horror film, I do not think it was terrifying. I was really bored a bit. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of Giallo films I expected a lot of "nightmares", but unfortunately I was very disappointed.
