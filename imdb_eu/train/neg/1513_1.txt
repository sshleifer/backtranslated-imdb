The flock is not really a movie. It's a short film with good actors. Including Richard Gere, he performed a brilliant performance, but one of the actors just played his character and the rest of the game ... it's a pathetic outcome, like this movie. You see, it's hiding what you're doing with acting ideas. What did Claire Dains do with this? This character is the most inappropriate actress. 99.9% of the film looked at a very empty place, everything! The only thing he did was to make stupid questions, such as "Do you really think it?" And make fools. I seriously felt the play, seriously and I liked it ... It's a kind of romantic movie, I do not know who has received it from all actors ... Do you see LOL and Avril Lavigne? That really laughed me ... Anyway ... If you want to, the movie will work for you !!! I can vote -5
