The first half hour of the film was stable and he entered the characters. But, suddenly, everything was happening fast, because Akshey Kumar was a reason for girls for girls, that Akshey and John Abraham were very influential. Neha Dupia was a great movie, Paresh Rawal did well, but not as good as Hera Pheri's performance. Generally this movie was the most despairing film because it did not direct its trailer. Save your money and watch the movie, watch Hera Pheri and Hungama again! <br /> <br />: a cheap theater show and the appearance of the movie without a story or substance, the plot was not terribly heavy. Preetam's good music means that Dhoom bought us! keep it! Filmed all in one room; New friendships (wives) were good, they were the first films, but disappointed with the director of the film that featured Akshey and John like the worst film Priyadarshan was totally disappointed.
