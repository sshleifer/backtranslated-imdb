I would not think one of Leonard Cohen's greatest fans. However, music / music heritage is an important poet / musician. The most valuable element of this documentary is to listen to Leonard's thoughts on life and its routes. Heat and shelf. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the musicians in the concert do not speak of Leonard's musical / literary subtleties. Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker and Beth Orton were exceptions, although Leonard appreciated Rufus Wainrights's songs. <br /> <br /> This documentary especially failed the ability of the filmmaker to see the viewer. What Leonard Cohen is and how she joins these musicians. In that sense a lot is said, but the viewer is not included in Leonard Cohen. Failure is especially noticeable in conversations with Bono and Edge. Leonard is seen as a special icon, but he can not return the exact value of Leonard Cohen. U2 is a collaboration fart. The entire live record has been released. And like the whole movie, Leonard Cohen is left alone and can talk about his section. <br /> <br /> The entire assembly and script is similar to the strategic high school project. Evil, slow or photo gestures are poorly placed. Some camera works are sad. Part of the score was hardly an expectation of all the associations. Sometimes the filmmaker seemed to be adding to the psychotic film elements. Perhaps LSD has been a reference for every use. <br /> <br /> An unwanted mood ... Sometimes Leonard tells how he influenced music genres. At first, he can not remember the name of the genre, until he is finally punk, because the drums met in his music. The next scene "I can not forget" is the direct cover of the movie ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And I can not forget, I can not forget, I can not forget, but I can not forget do not remember who "
