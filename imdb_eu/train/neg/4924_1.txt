This movie is very bad. Maybe it's tough, but that's it. It really is. The script is inadequate, each book vampire is used and the creation of the main character is not given ... that is, ole Dracula. They have been brilliantly featured in the past Dracula / vampire, but this does not "tragic" become a slot. <br /> <br /> Choosing the people you receive. teen slasher move, add Dracula Flower dribble and religious / surrealist confuse a tonic heady dream of the day ... and you get a confusing mix of a movie - Dracula 2000. <br /> <br /> I really can not really do anything good about this movie Say, as if it were not wrong in the first place, Johnny Lee Miller seems to have caused an English accent. You cry ... Well, it's English, but it seems that an American is trying to make an English accent. <br /> <br /> You can say with all the money (if you want to buy it), or rent, watch, and get acquainted yourself with why it's terrifying like Tellytubbies. <br /> <br /> PS La La is terrifying!
