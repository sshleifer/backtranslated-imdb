There were some horrible scenes, I always liked gore, but otherwise the movie was pretty weak. They did not answer too many questions, and when they tried to explain anything in the movie, it became clear. After seeing this movie, he seemed lost in many ways. Silent Hill reminded me a few years ago. This movie was not too satisfying, but it was better to work and the story was sensible. This, not so much. <br /> <br /> Acting mostly Abandoned was honest, but the movie crashed and never gave any satisfaction. As I said above, there were some stunning scenes, but otherwise the movie was wrong. Sorry, I can not recommend it.
