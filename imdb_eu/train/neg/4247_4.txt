The difficult and long theater is foreseen, my twenty-fifth Sidney Lumet, Garbo Talks, is presented at the end of my search term. <br /> <br /> It is named after a young profession called Gilbert. (Ron Silver), Estelle Rolle's son (Anne Bancroft), eccentric, brave and, above all, a fan of Greta Garbo. When Estelle condemns her with a brain tumor, she decides to make an obsessive search for her own son: follow Greta Garbo and bring her to her mother. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anne Bancroft is full of Chew-the-scenery-auntie-mame here, a kind of "feisty ol" gal that loves the movie, where He speaks to the public and defends his ideals and ends up jailing all the time. It is excluded from the film, as an artificial construction is clear, and every scene with it joins yuk-yuki; All notes are fake. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional, but less interesting. Ron Silver is flat as flat, and his essay, the love triangle, telegraphs everything in the film: Lisa Rolfe is rich (Carrie Fisher), but Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks) is in an oddball companion. Every scene I called three scenes before it happened. <br /> <br /> That's another problem. If one-dimensional characters are in a fascinating and fascinating story to survive, there's nothing here. The rhythm of the film is glacier, a bright external material that totally reinforces everything, and when the film starts to line up, it is not at all interesting at the same time. Several stars have been invited, as it were, to Harvey Fierstein as a New Yorker gay (imagine it) in a different scene. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, he tries to make half. the idolatrous character and a dignified expression of the role of our lives, but there are no real characters at all, and the film has bored me in the presentation, so it is very far. far-too-late The film is directed by Twenty-fifth film directed by Lumet, the director I have easily watched, but a few missing faults outside (unknown to us, anyone), has no interest in the depths of Garbo Speeches. . <br /> <br /> {Grade: 4.5 / 10 (C / C-) / # 21 (24 of 24) 1984 / # 23 25 in Lumet films}
