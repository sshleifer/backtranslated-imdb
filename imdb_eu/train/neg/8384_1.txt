When the IMDb users rated the movie below 250 movies, I thought it was very hard, but I do not know how little the low rating was absolutely correct. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of the Wayans brothers. . I love their Scary Movie 2 and also enjoy the White Chicks. Little Man, however, had very little laughs and jokes were out of date. <br /> <br /> Of course, this joke will be Marlon Wayans, who eventually plays a childhood cancer outgrowth. He and his pair, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond for gangsters. Things go wrong and the midget's lead by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington does not have to make an unexpected pair. To get back the diamond, it's a little left by a baby left to face a baby left by unexpected couples. Of course, he takes it and the drama starts looking for the diamond. <br /> <br /> In Live Color also lives on Saturday with actors and actresses, Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider. However, all the talents can not have a poor book and have fun. <br /> <br /> The special effects of converting Marlon Wayans are fine. I mean, it was not 100% believable but good ... nothing is great. Wayans brothers will strive to make good jokes instead of trying to develop scripts, try to get scripts with famous actors and actors from their famous comedies. <br /> <br /> Wait for the cable or TV. It really is not worth any money.
