This movie is similar to "White Zombie", the same man (Halperin) and zombies. Halperin, George A. Romero of his time, did not deliver this. <br /> <br /> We have a man who manages the Cambodian intelligence man to destroy his fountain. His power to release the zombies. Likewise, the interest of love for evil men. <br /> <br /> The movie is really a movie. Cambodia temples and dancers are very nice and the area is very strong in their large numbers. Unfortunately, we are not really the zombies we are seeing most and the love story seems to be too big for a horror film (though later on it has a plot of reason). <br /> <br /> I would like to attack the city people attacking some zombies in the 1930s, but this film did not deliver. And he's not listening anywhere else (Bela Lugosi) waiting for us to fight our heroes. And use Lugosi eyes? The effect is nice, but it's never misleading in the movie, why not create it with the eyes of the new actor? In general, working with a small script would have been perfect for the movie and could be a great remake for a few days (especially if they keep them in the same period of post-war period). Fish, if they can repair "The Hills Have Eyes", this film is hopeful.
