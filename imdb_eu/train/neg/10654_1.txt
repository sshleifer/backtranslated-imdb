Big hair, big boobs, bad music and a huge security ... These are the words that best describe this terrific movie. I love the horror movies and I've seen hundreds ... but I had to do this the worst. The cartoon is thin and ridiculous paper, the play is innocent, the script is absolutely horny (it is best to commit the end of the police and how the murderer is who is so badly written), it's clothes. Equal and amusing measures are the same size, hair is great, many boobs are bounced, men have cut shirts with stomach cuts (which men have really dressed them!) and just the trash for the music synthesizer. again ... almost the most rude music in every scene, the boobs and paramedical limbs take away the bodies ... and the gym is not yet closed! Aside from this, this is a really bad movie and its only charm is to go back to the 80's disaster and it was an old laugh, then everything was bad.
