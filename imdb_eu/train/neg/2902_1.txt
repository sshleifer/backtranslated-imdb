Spoiler: aggressive and passive people with family reunions. The scripts tell people what they would never say and do, at least a little bit like it. The hero falls into a woman who sees her soul pair in a bookstore on the day of the meeting, as her younger brother at that meeting. He tries to delay his brother's claim, but, besides knowing that our hero, with her, clearly cleans her, she puts her clothes in a sexy outfit and clothes, because she suffers her brother. stretch At one moment, he actually throws himself and enters the shower with him. He tries to cover his eyes. He is breaking his heart. He thinks it's funny, he suddenly decides that his brother does not want and decides on the meeting. <br /> <br /> The movie is really a stroke. The viewer exploded and walked for a long time. The writing is incomprehensible and compelling. We walked harder, but we thought it would be safe if something happened, but nooooo. All the beautiful reviews had to be written with paid shills, to see the crap like these, like bad guys. Comparing with Miss Sunshine Little? Jeez. Shameless, writers, actors, producers and theaters may be bad on the screen!
