Having read the novel before seeing this movie, I was disappointed with the stroke of woodwork and the arrogance of producers. This film does not reflect the brightness of Bronte's work, but the impression of a superficial love story. The short film, in a short two-hour period, has lost a lot of essential elements that make the book understandable and progressive, with a low plot of land that is low in size. There is no love between Rochester and Jane Eyre; So this is indeed rape and meaningless, because the two characters are similar to each other, you can not help, but imagine that their "love" is superficial. Brontek is an injustice in the novel; The misfortune and courage that Rochester himself attracts him has no impression, and the arrogance that Jane is attracted to. <br /> <br /> Although bad guys, I think that a few characters were very stupid, they represented Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Poole, but overall, production was bad. Making a better script, maybe the movie would be more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) with excellent Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton.
