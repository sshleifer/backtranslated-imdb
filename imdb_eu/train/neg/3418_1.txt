*** SPOILER (S) FOR USE USED *** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Chuck Norris as an actor, but I worship him in a different way. The fan site of Chuck Norris is also very entertaining. But this movie seems like someone was joking that the audience "reports" in a single movie. I really can not remember that I was losing more time with this "action". I do not know what's wrong with the movie: US terrorist smuggling, or maybe nuclear "terrorists" talking about "talkable conversations" and "stupid talk" about life's wisdom. and everything else. It is likely that someone in everyday life finds the worst kind of English-speaking terrorists. There is no endless list. The enormous footage of the files used in the film is worth mentioning. The main terrorist will send messages of his friends through the media when he was captured and is the only person who can not see the treatment: Chuck Norris, of course. Nobody in America is not smart enough to watch! The whole act of pulling out is ridiculous. A man has been sent to walk around the UNARMED terrorist camp (I'm lying, he had a KUTXA), his stalkers flee JET PACK and then several hundred gliders, perhaps a thousand miles from the nearest edge (the Afghan border is 450 miles from the nearest coast), saved on the shore yours. At least I expected to be good fighting scenes, but it's more fun than plots. If you did not know, 85% of the terrorists are masters of martial arts, but Chuck and CO overcome them. They can not just die easily, move and throw them with a single movement and bad guys just fly a few meters like dolls. Maybe you asked me to see the movie at the end? I did it Why? Why do I want to see these two super heroes, the size of a hundred megaton and a small-sized nuclear bomb MICROWAVE. And then I realized what I fooled. Of course, after all, it's Chucken's movie. And I would not only remove the blinking, but it does - twice! I had to write a book about all things stupid in this movie, but I would spend my life rich. <br /> <br /> So, the authors of this film made another one on Chuck Norris's website: Can Chuck Norris undoes the nuclear bomb? Yes and twice!
