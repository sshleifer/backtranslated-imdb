This story was not an original idea. The issues came from different sources; others The Ninth Gate, In the Mouth of Madness (another Carpenter movie), and The Ring. What's more, the ring struck the same brightness and used it in the same name as the movie. Cody Carpenter's soundtrack has been in Sigh. Fortunately, no one is confronted with the word HOMAGE. Yes, I saw that the theater was playing Deep Red in Argentina. A tribute to claiming it would be a bullshit cop-out. This was at the bottom of the barrel. Gore throwing and "worrying" in the picture does not create a good horror movie. He knew Carpenter. It would be necessary to access the darkness or get a machine of time.
