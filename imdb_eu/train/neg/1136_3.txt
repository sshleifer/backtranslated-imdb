Every thirty-something movie is dated, but if you only watch John Ford movies, it seems more dated than you see others. That is, the Grand Hotel melodrama is comparatively modern. With Ford, there is always somebody's nobility seller (Abe, The Joads). Always overweight the excessive accent of evil. Always scripts are poorly worked, erroneous, and obvious. This is no exception. It's just a device to give a feeling. And the feeling is to do all this. <br /> <br /> What Ford does here does not feel like Lincoln, but he asks me how ever they were, according to the population of jokes represented here. . Ford made decent films. This is dated, but it's not bad. It is totally false. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda is very curious with a false nose. And no one from Illinois would end the "S", nor "Shonuff!" Say it too.
