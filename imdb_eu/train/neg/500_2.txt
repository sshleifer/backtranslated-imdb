Bloodsucker danced - a brilliant title, so misleading. It is not surprising that filmmakers try to be a great evil, even if it's a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This story, in a distant island castle, involves the murder mystery. <br /> <br /> This movie is very little. And when something awakens the stupid viewer, it's always a messy comedy, a terrifying conversation by a gruesome group of voice artists. These guys are very bad and the actors who hear the voices appear like a group of grunts. It's really hard to decide how much bad you've done when you've made this huge duplication. Voice artists are not guilty of scriptwriting. It's alive The most unhappy fun in the worst pathetic. In general, the story is different at least. Women's characters are particularly idiotic; Men are awful or boring. <br /> <br /> The whole company listens to the exploitation of the audience. It does not commit to remotely, and when the killings (at last) begin, they appear on the screen. Everything that we get will be broken down. <br /> <br /> Some people have said that this movie is "gialloa". I do not agree less with this opinion. Those who enjoy Italian emotions should prohibit this movie from being remotely exciting. Basically, pornography is a smooth and soft movie. But it's not very erotic. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this to anyone.
