What did they think seriously? Columbo has tried new things over the years and has been diverted from the usual formula, but this movie is too much. This movie is very different from any movie in Columbo, but there are no differences in the film's favor. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is different from any other Columbo film. The murder is not committed. The premise of this film is completely different and Columbo character sets it in a completely different environment and situation. Likewise, it is generally completely different and "more modernized". <br /> <br /> The director Alan J. Levi made other Columbo films in the past, all of which came together with the usual formulas. It's a strange option to direct this movie. <br /> <br /> The same Columbo character is different, perhaps because of the reason that it was in a completely different environment and situation. She helps her nephew after marrying his bride. Columbo is a good mood and good brand that does not make it look good or enjoyable. and the story makes the story more hilarious. A fake thriller is written and begins with a story that begins to grow more difficult. The movie is becoming more and more unforgettable. This is a very interesting entry from Columbo, he does not even know how to have his viewers in some way. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is not much help to the greatest talents surrounding the non-supporting actors. . His character is completely different, but if the movie is shot in a completely different style, Peter Falk maintains well and still maintains his presence in this movie. Can not you imagine how this film could do without it? I would say cheap and very hilarious movie. <br /> <br /> Columbo entry jewelery can be described as a mere experiment to divert from the usual formula. <br /> <br> /> 4/10
