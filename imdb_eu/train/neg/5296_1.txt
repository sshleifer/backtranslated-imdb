As a genre Slasher Flicks is not a great hobby, but even in low-budget operating standards, this is really a lama. Although naked and dirty, it is very boring (there are some of them, but all ... meh). Before the domestic video revolution, it may not have been released dramatically (although, perhaps, * Plan 9 From Outer Space * plays. A good (and competent) line in the whole movie is fine; I think they've stolen somewhere. <br /> <br /> The worst thing I've seen is activity. I mean, even Ed Wood has been a couple of competent actors, and the rest of the trend has been ludicly hammy, and that can be fun to watch. In any case, most of his actors could be very read. Here, they seem to have learned phonetically that Indian people like cigarettes do not read their lines. And this film has a distinction: it gets a lot of emphasis on most of the movies, and then squeezes too much danger to the end. <br /> <br /> (Update: I should name the actress as a receptionist. Exceptionally, it is not wood, it is not good, but there is definitely no wood.) <br /> <br /> <br /> Although slasher, the worst lightning is generally good for a few pure meditations on their grotesquity, but it seems that there is not any moral attack. <br /> <br /> And you know the fun thing? It's clear they are hoping to make a sequel! <br /> <br /> So bad and boring really strangely becomes fascinated. I asked when I sat down through a large portion of the video, asking why he could make the problem somebody.
