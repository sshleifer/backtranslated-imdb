I'm a fan of Tony Scott. When this movie came out, I expected that it would be like "Man On Fire". To find out the farthest thing about this movie! The story was about stepping up water, and choosing Mickey Rourke was not such a good idea. And 'arm'scene' was very free! <br /> <br /> The film is located around Kiera Kinghtly, and this film reveals that it has never become a movie star. The film has brought some of the worst performances. <br /> <br /> I like Tony Scott's direction, but all this takes on a wonderful cake! Sorry ton from 10!
