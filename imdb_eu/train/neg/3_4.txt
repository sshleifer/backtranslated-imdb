If I had not read 'Union Street' by Pat Barker, I'd like to see it before I saw this movie. Unfortunately, this does not happen. It's really my movie, it's fine and I do not mean it, but it's just like it's adaptation, it's all wrong. <br /> <br /> A wonderful novel about reality. I was left in a rural area in the Northern England area where I was caught by my heart and I stopped leaving it for a few weeks. I was reading about Union Street women about tears, revelation, blows, anger, sympathy and misery. Excellent. Sometimes I had a novel I thought I could not read, but the novel just could not be deleted. Yes, but it's wonderful. <br /> <br /> Movies. Oh dear. Hollywood took Barker's truth and reality and threw a layer of delicious ice cream on top. Beautiful film, inspirational soundtrack, great performances, hope and a love story ... yes. Union Street Adaptation ... no. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < They condense the feminine character. I admit that Barker's stories are sensitive to being terrifying and that a movie about 7 protagonists is not practical, but content is not my main topic. The essence of the novel and the real fats are lost: darkness and rain, broken cardboard broken windows, and poverty, graphically described poverty, beautiful houses, and William's scores. <br /> <br /> If you are expecting a film on the basis of positivity and "reality", I suggest reading the book as readily as possible, without the preparation of a "Schindler's List", but without being happy.
