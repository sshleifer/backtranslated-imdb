"National Lampoon Goes to Movies" (1981) is the worst-ever movie ever, although the "Plan 9 Outer Space" goes far beyond. Lampoon makes a different film in three distinctive and unlinked banners, each with different interpreter. The only common thread is the lack of any treatment abilities. <br /> <br /> Well maybe there is one. Another reviewer on this site has said that fleeing naked plans are good and reason. Miss Ganzel and Dusenberry reflect their assets slowly, first and second, respectively. However, his screen is glamorous, alas, wasted. Managers were forgotten that T & A requires a compelling story surrounding it, and there is no view. <br /> <br /> The third segment, featuring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is three of them disgusting. and this unfortunate selection is a movie. Benson plays a sharp and ruthless policeman who is accused of the first day of duty, ready to get rid of the bad streets. It is matched by an old cynical police officer from Widmark, and when these petroleum and water partners start their first patrol, we restore the first mistakes in the movie. Perhaps just the cynical old timer will be a strong sense of duty and loyalty of its new partners. Maybe all of them will end with happiness in the end. But, oh, this movie is directed straight to the toilet, without repayment, without a happy ending, without any coherent story. <br /> <br /> I saw "The National Lampoon Before Going To The Movie." The worst appearance that Hollywood can be. Unfortunately, I have not seen it in the middle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
