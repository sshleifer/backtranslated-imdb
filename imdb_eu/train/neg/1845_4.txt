Loss of control is another of the genre of erotic thriller that is considered as a fictional genre of the film world. Normally, it involves the path of a roundabout with the intention of not doing so, with disadvantages. This is not a complaint, especially when women are beautifully represented by this wonderful woman. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Kira Reed) is in front of a block of writers. Does he know (or is not he) a man with a man (Doug Jeffery), with a man who makes sex meetings more and more dangerous. The man does not want to give himself information, but Kim is constantly reluctant to stop the affair. Alexa's agent (Anneliza Scott) thinks he will do wonders for the sale of his book. As with most movies of this type, the same ending has been reached, but some things are not added. I think it's enough to think of that kind of movie, then there's no change, but I like it. There are no demands. <br /> <br /> Exact performances vary. Doug Jeffery does not want to take movies as a psycho / societal you do not want. Kira Reed looks good, but she will convince the woman in danger. Clay Greenbush PI did not convince either. <br /> <br /> Finally, notice a note about DVD. The record and record status of the record and the 93-minute duration, but the run time is less than 86 minutes. This surely explains why sex scenes appear and why cut out Jennifer Ludlow's performance. 4 stars.
