It's not fun - how can anyone bind Monty Python? That's totally ridiculous: there's no laugh. This is not fun. Above, but ugly, it's only rare for jewelry and it seems that people were something of the time. Sadly it was something fun. <br /> <br /> The effort should be given in some points, etc. Does it really seem like a laugh or is it one? Hummm ... There is hardly a doubt that there is a doubt. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm doing an injustice, maybe it's an exercise. To say art in any way, that's right, nothing matters. <br /> <br /> But these guys are playing with women with sharp, nose-activated voices. Come !!! It's not fun <br /> <br /> Monty Python's only heir to the intellectual is Stephen Colbert and maybe Jon Stewart.
