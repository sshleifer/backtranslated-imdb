Hellborn, a young psychiatric physician named James Bishop (Matt Stasi). Andrews is taking up asylum or "mental illness facility" at the headquarters. Almost 600 patients are intended to meet and work with Dr. Bishop McCort (Bruce Payne). Some dangerous and dangerous diseases are stored. That was not bad enough for a dead man who had visited during his first round and considered graffiti messages in his room. Bishop begins to listen to the stories of patients in the evil asylum, and soon finds himself more than just a real hint of stories about them ... <br /> <br /> Famous asylum in the U.S. supernatural horror movie Philip J. Jones It was directed and I liked it but, in the end, there were too many items that were very happy for me. Matt McCombs takes the script very seriously and I really like some basic ideas and ideas behind it, but there are some things that work against him. To start with, the movie is too slow, the story is pretty good and it's not too early, but it takes age enough to get started and I'm getting very interested in each minute. Also, I thought that the final forecast of the tour was very transient and the end was also bland and unforgettable. It's a bit like the story, character, setting, and some ideas, but it's just too slow and, of course, it's sad to keep it entertaining for a 90-minute drive. It is one of those films that I wanted to recommend, but honestly I can not. <br /> <br /> The director of Jones does a good job, that is, really well shot and quite atmospheric. I would not say helpless here. I do not know if Hellborn was shot in a mad madness, but they did not work in groups, and the film is pretty good in general. Unfortunately, gore or real action is missing. There are two hand-printed wounds and the tongue is jammed, that is, it should not be vaccinated between blood or gums. Depending on what you believe, and which revisions you have read, the special effects are always the worst or the best, as well as a low budget horror watchdog. I was very surprised especially with the effect that looks like the devil's astonishment and a man. A suit-type effect, CGI is a great computer graphics, and it's a spectacular suit. I think it depends on your expectation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Technically, it's a good movie, it seems pretty enjoyable and CGI is off to computer effects. The play was not very good, but it could definitely be better. <br /> <br /> Hellborn is a movie that disappointed me, because they were good things about it but, at the same time, some terrible things are unfortunately exceeding. good I really liked the fragments I like, but I would recommend the 90-minute full-experience experience to anyone.
