Directors, chains and skirts, on Friday at the SF Frameline Film Festival, warned the audience about a "experimental" movie. Experimental? Leave the video camera in the back seat of your car, let the tape be slipped and not be edited. A meander of the Pastiche road does not create anywhere and the viewer takes a place. The free violence that opens the film led to more than one Castro watchmaker. I would also leave, but my film-maker needed to go home, and all this was even worse for the finish line. When the lights were lit, the viewers were significantly weakened. Applause The product looked like the director-like questions. Avoid this movie!
