The title of this movie is "Waqt: Race Against Time". This race can never win, but definitely you can reduce your margin loss to your precious "delete" in this bakvaas. It was a clumsy and manipulative movie that K3G looks like. He moved my credibility away. He was in a foolish stupidity, and he deserved to be mocked. <br /> <br /> It's not so horrible as Baghba or Black, but this movie does not recommend anything. Stupid, pointless, with an impeccable OTT performance by Amitji. "Plot" is a serious propaganda that has caused so many "family" films as the main "plot". My father, who lifted me and loved my beloved, treated me like Big Bk Akshay, I would shoot myself. To say nothing about the condemnation of terminal illnesses.
