This movie would be stupidly foolish. As the other comment says, the movie overwhelms any person over 7 years of age (especially, who is very gay). It's wonderful, and not "so bad it's funny" in a way it's just that it's just awesome. No, I have to say: BEFORE! (Sorry for scales). <br /> <br /> Initial titles from initial credits, it's not worth a bit more than 10 seconds to open the movie. "The Earthquake" is not consistent, the characterization that does not exist, the end of the theater is "look at me I'm having fun!" school and therefore continues. The pieces set are poorly configured (if there are any) and they are badly executed, it's awful at all fronts - apart from music, I can not remember that they put music in their music (songs apart). <br /> <br /> To make it easy for the writers, they place the cards on the table quite quickly: initial credits "The title of Ertyha Kitt is also the title of the Betty meteor." never even say anything, they can make mistakes from time to time, maybe Mrs. Kitt has lifted the contribution of one of her records) and the second part of the movie runs like this: "... and scientists have found new Uranus events." Uranus - Your Anus "geddit? gedit? eh? eh ?? Your Anus? This mood is really cheap. <br /> <br /> He tells the extravagant things about the "comedies" of that period, saying that the heroes allowed the dead to "sh *" not intentionally shoot the dead. t "aloud. <br /> <br /> I paid fifty pensions for this movie (about $ 1.00) for a sale. I feel exhausted.
