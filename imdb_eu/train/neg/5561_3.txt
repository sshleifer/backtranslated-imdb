I watched this movie under "Linked". Overall, I enjoyed Dolphen movies, so I tried. It was not worth it. I read some previous comments about the box that attracts the audience. Do not be fooled. The cinema is inadequate. The play does not exist. Land, which is scarce, is very predictable. The places seem to have been cut together. Only the place is clear. The price for a cheap night rental is not worth it. As a bit of a hobby of Dolph, I continued to wait for him to see him. When the movie is finished, you will still be waiting. This is the best movie to avoid, and your time spent watching almost anything else.
