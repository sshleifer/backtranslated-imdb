I essentially received this movie, I saw the great remake of Kitano Takashi's Zatoichi and another updated samurai from Asano Tadanobu. These two films are apart from the worlds. He has added humor and depth to his characters and has ruined traditional topical samurai. Gojoe ends up deep in the other direction. <br /> <br /> First of all, I hate movies with other characters that the viewer is similar to the main character, rather than developing the character in the movie. . "You can not decide whether you are a monk or a warrior," says Benkei, almost all the characters, but this inner turmoil is not transmitted inside the character itself. Instead of developing the character, we get bored and boring with the battle scene. Asano's character is undeveloped and even bored and does not know what he does. I know he's a bit distant and looks, and that's part of Asano's appeal, but that's not true. <br /> <br /> The movement of the camera is a lot confusing. There's an everlasting scene, and the camera turns around the main characters until my wife and I get into the vomit. It's ending and ridiculous, but rather climatic. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that samurai really good films are not made today in Japan with this kind of budget. Colors, landscapes and costumes were superb, but the rest went a long time. I would prefer to see one of the versions of this myth properly.
