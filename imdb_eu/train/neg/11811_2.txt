Do you know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell the story of his life, and you're sitting on your face with a pathetic smile, what you really want to do when you're out of the way and fool around? Well, I had a similar feeling in watching this movie. Well, I really chose to see Aprile, and I knew Nanni Moretti Caro Diario as the only star, but after half an hour of his memorabilia, I'd like to give Moretti the mother of all the slaps. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and other characters got at least one word for Edgeways. In April, however, Moretti has the exclusive right of dialogue, and everything that is heard in one and a half hours makes the best of his politics or the fantasy that likes popular culture. now She also likes slices of movies that she does not like, something reserved for me as losers. Without a doubt, he intended to understand more about film that could swear at a position like him. Maybe it's a good movie, with some ideas and a decent structure, or perhaps not fully mastered by its annoying voice. And when I began to reflect on the baby's newborn, I wanted to meet somebody normally, I did not prefer the self-obsessed director with a curious stroke of strangest music. The next time you do not know, she tries to tell the story of her life, give me a hat. Every blow will be a little victory in the fight against Morettiism.
