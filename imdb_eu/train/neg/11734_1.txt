Tasteless I can not write to the film in the mind. I laughed at the whole movie. It was not fun. Matt Farnsworth does not think what he does. His story is written, it seems, without knowledge of the culture and methodology of Iowa. I know that Farnsworth is Iowa, that is, his movie makes me even more difficult for me. Why do the two protagonists have accents? It does not make sense. The play was helpless and it was sometimes difficult to see. Violent and sexually active film. I think that violence and sex are supposed to change the movie, but it was unbelievable and offensive. The end of the film is so wonderful, I was able to laugh at everything I could do and look at the unbelievable credits. When I got out of the theater, all the others who went away laughed at me. The end of the film was intended to remind tears, but it was the opposite. Do not waste your time on this awesome movie, unless you, of course, want to be upset, overwhelmed and most common.
