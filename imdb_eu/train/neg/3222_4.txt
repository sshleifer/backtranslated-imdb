I was very disappointed in this 1970 movie based on the story of Bernard Malamud. This is basically a story of salvation, racial bias and mistrust-based life. <br /> <br /> A black Jew's angel will be sent to help the sick cleric and his wife to be ill. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) believes in the angel (Belafonte), his wife will recover Fanny (Ida Kaminska). The problem is that Morris basically refuses to live and refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel. <br /> <br /> When he thinks, Fanny improves, but eventually has doubts and Fanny suffers from this. It would be very nice when he said that in the last scene an English translation was spoken by Mori Morris. <br /> <br /> Jan Kadar, also directed by the Oscar nominated by Miss Kaminska in 1966, also directs this great "Street Store". In the Kaminska film, most of the bed has been reduced to the scene and, in his kindness, he is not in a state of affairs in his speech. Ruthie, who calls her daughter, disobeyed Jewish religion. Most movies do not realize Angel's appearance in his apartment. <br /> <br /> The scene of the pharmacy is mixed and the angel's maid Belafonte is a memorable scene in his apartment, but all too short. <br /> <br /> We do not know why Belafonte is in danger and why he died. <br /> <br /> Those who watch this movie have left the theater and must be in a state of depression. despair
