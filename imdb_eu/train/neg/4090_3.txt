Leo Fulci Shlock-merchant makes a rhythm shift that makes the fantasy movie of a sword and fantasy dumb, consistent, instead of consistent horrors of horror. <br /> <br /> The slow type of Orlando Bloom, called Ilias, travels across the sea from some of the ancient Greece-like societies looking for a particular way to fight the wicked. vampiric topless wicked sorceress wolves and mutants minions. Bad ones are generated. The witch shakes the local man and wants himself a magical arch. He sends them generosity, quicker than the end, after finally gaining our heroes, they face a blow to all the oppressed men. Does this movie have a steady stream of WTF? items and moments. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the entire movie is filmed with a soft spotlight and the image is constantly fading on the screen. It is possible to hide the atmosphere or create a false look at everything. In any case, it failed. There is no atmosphere, if there is a slight confusion and accident, and it does not hide everything that looks like it. The wolf-men look like a sick man's wookie. For some reason, the director fell in love with the six million dollar men in the air, when they attacked our heroes. Surely there are probably about a dozen of these films. Other addicts of the witch, other mutton that are not originally born from humans, are white mutants that are covered in white. Needless to say, there's a slow and pain-free saying, when they call Hispanic gay, Daleks say. Fights are awesome and convicts, and special effects are shameful. Yes, it's cheap music synthesizer, because it's because they're ashamed by Doctor Who's makers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ilias, our nominal hero is fuzzy and unforgettable. It also has a full look, especially with a large skin and a large hair. Of course, his magic arc is a dynamite, but only takes three or four arrows to fight him with his whole continent of evil. It should be said that after a few minutes it runs out of the arrows and needs to keep Mace, the most traditional hero of the sword and witchcraft. When he comes to Ilias, he sets it as a kind of solitary solitaire, who says he does not have any friends, but you can say that they are friends with a homoerotic latent subset, they blur the clouds. Mace commits herself to take with Ilias herself to pay for the benefits of the bow. Ilias asks where he will go. "Where my legs carry me" replied. Good enough for Ilias. Maza is also an infectious and hypocrite animal lover. He proclaims his love and association for animals, referring to the common things that humans like, because they can be said by humans. He will never hunt and kill an animal to feed himself, but other people who hunt with animals will steal prey. For good reason, he will not die for pedestrians. After collecting a lot, Ilias's arch is being tested and the movie will cut some random hunts, while it is in charge of his business, and shooting Mace dead. There is no point in the poor soul that deserves this, and Ilias also comes from a civilized and moral society that does not raise a eyebrow. <br /> <br /> Movie movies are unusual. For the whole movie there is absolutely naked g-string and a gold mask that takes its full head. Fulci is like trying to film the compulsory T & A cutoff, but he decided that the last few minutes were too small. She spends a lot of time as she feels sucking her masks snobbishly and fucks herself in front of a man dressed as Ilias. Wow, such symbolism! Later in the film Ilias and Mace can not beat and commit to become a sex slave of an old warrior, if he dies. It's hardly an awful scary world, and it's not really a step for feminine rights. I think they are creatures of our heroic infrastructure and Mace suggests that there is no one around, but Mace fool. Congratulations to yourself, Ocron? <br /> <br /> Are there other WTFs? moments Most come to the end of the movie. Ilias goes out, why I forgot to possibly get her permed hairstyle mussed, but realize her way to defects and returns to help Mace fight the forces of evil. Suddenly, without reason, his bows can suddenly create a firearm for the energy screws. Screws can also be fired by strong rocks. It must be said that he does a short job of the evil hordes captured by Mace. <br /> <br /> Climates are also quite absurd. Mace divides the other forces of Ocron, using laser-targeted arc arrows. After that, Ocron can shoot from one kilometer to the other, using his own ability to shoot. It starts to die. Her mask shows a terrific head Muppet. He screams and becomes a dog and walks with another dog. Mace smiles. Roll credits <br /> <br /> It's amazing how little budget lips and sorcery films are. Anyone who watches Wizards of the Lost Kingdom can say that nonsense and filmmaking can really be.
