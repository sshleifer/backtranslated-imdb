If you want to see a good movie like a fight against sexual assault, the movie is not the movie you want to watch. He was a social commentary against a victimized woman and she is fighting back. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns tables on his attacker. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim must be vigilant. Basically, it abolishes the judicial system. The "accused" film has a better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins it. What do victims of aggression "descent" call violence? Is the accuser better victim? There is not !!!
