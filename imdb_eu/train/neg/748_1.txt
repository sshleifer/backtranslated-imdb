I love movies, and I'll see any movie, to give it a chance. In the end, I can not find the video I can not see. The play is obsolete and monotonous, the CGI looks like a computer geek with the smallest software in his mother's basement, and ... just ... walking !!!!! And this movie is a THIRD PERIOD !!! I did not even make a 15 minute delay until I started the DVD. Foreigner scenes are very short. Ummm, instead of naming this "World War", it is named "Long Distance War." This cost 5 million dollars! What is the money they spend, the dramatic song to open? <br /> <br /> Oh, but in a positive note, a scene to be seen begins when aliens die. It's horny, it's not because people are dying, but when they play skeletons they're still 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> So ... as I said, if it's boring, sharp, action-less movies, here's a DVD collection for you. But I did not write this for you, I wrote thousands of millions of thousands of people who hate this film. It's not worth your time or money <br /> <br /> I know that's the book, but the book is not so long, and I'm the whole book worm / nerd / geek / everything, but why? You just got the best Steven Spielberg version, but it's 10 times better than that! <br /> <br /> This I give BIG, FAT ZERO 10.
