Another American Pie has dropped our throats down and one of them is the worst. It does not deserve the name of the American Pie. They should stop at "The Wedding" room. <br /> <br /> This movie is just like the stupid spark in the porn pie named American Pie. When I was seeing this, I felt I was seeing another series. It will not fall like American Pie. The humor is different and much sweeter and the sex scene has much more on other American Pie movies. <br /> <br /> I never recommend it. Actually, I do not recommend one of the "American Pie Presents" movies. Only stick with the original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
