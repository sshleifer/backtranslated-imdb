They laugh, they laugh at the bad times ... and it is still not a comedy. I especially liked the ambulance gag planted with "dirty dirty", and shouting angry at "dirty wrath". Unfortunately, someone graduates in literature is online! The worst script without imagery in a hilarious slogan of the story, ZERO character development (even though they meet the characters ... all in the years of mutual recognition and confusion), which exceeds the excessive voice. effects, and plot sketches ... oh, God is not a hollow! To honestly, I write all without seeing it, but I definitely expect the last 30 minutes to improve the pathetic attempts already in the cinema ... thank God, because we have a good look. We forgot the movie load ... well ... use imagination for the purposes of this exact phrase!
