I wanted to pee a TV. Watching Torture I hate. Do not watch the movie. Terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. I do not usually like it, but not this. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the world's most overwhelming film. It's a hideous comedian comedian. The remote part of the fun is with girls with black dancing. I wanted to pee a television that was so excited. NOT USED BY FAMILY USE. If Adam Sandler likes you a little bit, do not buy it. You'll just hate him. Make yourself one side, if you see it in the store, to hide what's hidden for purchase. It is a waste of $ 1.99.
