Rajchan is a unique chemistry with Bachchan. He laughs at you without excess and he dies his presence and his mood and humor . Boman is good at some comics but too much place is the Priyanka hero, so nothing has been done, this is his latest movie Akki so far Shefali is awesome, even if the young man seems to be Bachchan.
