It is a classic example of a growing problem for cinema. Why is rumor and sound the broadest band than the conversation? What is that meaning? This movie is not alone. It seems that most movies do now. For 2 years, I asked my TV with something wrong, but then I got a new TV and it's there again. BUDGET A noise behind a conversation behind a cast behind the actors. <br /> <br /> He still paid even more attention to this movie, however, in the English version, women are always mumble. I would say Jean Reno "I apologize, have you talked or I hoped to get out of your mouth with marble?" If you watch DVD and have French secondary education, I recommend subtitles in French version. <br /> <br /> I give 4 that Reno Leon was so good. People like the landscape, but I saw it on TV and I lived in Rockies for years, so "Enh."
