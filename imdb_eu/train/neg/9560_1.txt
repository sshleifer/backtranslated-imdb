Thank God I saw that in a friend's place and I did not pay. The plot is incredibly transparent and the whole movie feels like a TV show. If you know computer or electronics, be careful. It feels like a movie that suggests your mind. <br /> <br /> In addition, the actress Much Music VJ activated. Amanda Walsh shows the worst performance ever seen, aside from porn. Fortunately Matt Lanter is really decent. It's what the movie is wearing. <br /> <br /> I like to see this movie of life that I have spent two years. Pity is called a sequel, because it was a fan of the original, it was really good.
