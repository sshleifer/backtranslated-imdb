If there are no bad guesses. I mean, that the direction was really linked to the subject. Actors were doing well to live the characters. But in the end, there was really a thing that was a good script to collect all the pieces. I would highly recommend not to see this. If you are a fan of Al Pacino like me, and although it does not see everything that is being played, lately the result is pretty weak. That is, after S1m0ne, the second job was very bad for the actors to choose the roles.
