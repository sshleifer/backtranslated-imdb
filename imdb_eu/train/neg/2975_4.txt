I saw that immediately when I saw the HILLSIDE CANNIBALS, it could be an improvement. On top of that, I AM LOVE ZOMBI 3 and 28, and compares it to the next. Unfortunately the more I saw the more I realized how original the Danny Boyle was and how many films he had made 28 WEEKS LATER <br /> <br />. Italian horror movie. I was completely convinced that ZOMBI 3 should be completed in 1980 or 1981. In that case, I would call my summary for 28 YEARS Later (Geddit?), But until I found it until I came to this page. Published in 1988 All production values ​​creep because of the low budget split in the decade. This 1982 book might be enjoyed in a fifteen-year-old class, but it may be my classmates but not now <br /> <br /> A large part of the problem is still incomplete. For example, some zombies blend the snail's rhythm so that others can run faster and have their own conscience, leading the ridiculous scene to the DJ's end. Some also throw their faces while others are still alive, even though their heads are closed, wait until they see the refrigerator scene, you might laugh. Serious characters also suffer from this kind of non-written writing, where the character suddenly shows that he was a helicopter pilot, and he asks me why he used the army to drive a route to drive the jeep <br /> <br /> Of course you know about 'THE CRAZIES They reminded me, later they reminded me of the 28 later films. Terrorist bunch strikes on a scientific basis that leads to many types of disasters, who are trying to kill the military and kill them alive and kill them all before they are over. This problem will soon be reminded of how much the franchise franchise has been much better in a larger budget. Not only, but 28 franchisees will come to the public thinker who may have little interest in the horror movie. ZOMBI 3 will not like it among the spectators
