Do not expect much from this movie. In many ways, Doris Day resembles a movie that featured the title of Julie in 1956. In this film, Doris was a winged assistant at the time, when Louis Jordan landed the aircraft ship when he shot the captain, his horrible sailor, led by Louis Jordan. Kim Ojah, since he had controlled 747 and had managed to get out of control at a high-level tower, has done much better work, convincing. I know little about 747 aircraft, I have been an airline helper. As I said, I do not expect much from this movie, it was made cheaply. The producers were cheap to use a plane with the name of an airplane. Oceanic is a name used for several films. On the plane he wrote the only plane with the name of the company.
