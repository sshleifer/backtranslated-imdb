I thought it was good before I started with these movies, but I started to say that it was very horrible. They said that the movie was being made in Afghanistan, but I think that about 95% of the film is filmed in India. You can see Indian cars. You can see Lars Bisleri drink (Indian watermark), on the way to Hindi written, you can see Afghan temples * hahah * fun and much more that proves what was not filmed in Africa. I think no one should miss the time to watch this movie ... It's a waste of time ... I would recommend doing something else, or having a better heart idea, but do not miss out on time.
