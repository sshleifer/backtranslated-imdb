An avant-garde nightmare, with a very low budget "movie". It's hard to sit down. I get the message that I get the wrong child abuse. Wow great revelation I saw this was wrong. This is sarcasm. Do not watch this movie if you feel stupid for men or women. Do not see it if you're a bit annoying. Ignore if you like to play it. In the second thought, do not ignore it temporarily. <br /> <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> Extra DVD: movie, premiere, interview with Kristie Bowersock, deleted scenes. photos of the film, director's comments, 2 teaser trailer versions, The Azoic music video, and video experiment in the classroom
