When I watched Richard Burton's movie list, I remember when I saw the cable in 1982. When I came to this title. I remember Tatum O'Neal's conversation was surprisingly bad. I remember Richard Burton losing his character so lost, and then I recall how they did not motivate me. In short, I remembered the "Circle of Two" because it was so scary. <br /> <br /> This film was created at a time when it was a time when fascinated with healthy or disgusted American teenagers. sexuality Remember "The Blue Lagoon" (and other Brooke Shields), other movies that seemed like "Lipstick", "Little Darlings", "Beau Pere" and sex, especially adults. At that time, I found the obsession with teenage girls that I found combined with excessive sex in the 70's and 80's to create an unnaturally disturbing environment, in other words. <br /> <br /> The "Two Circle" is not executed or unnecessary, like "Blue Lagoon". In fact, it deals with affairs of love between the elderly and the elderly, if it is courageous, if it is completely mistaken. But to tell the truth, you will never see one of these films, if you do not listen to it for the first time, it was really horrible. Nobody would want litter to ever distribute the surface again publicly.
