Thinking, ignorant, mischievous, murderous career (where talented Angela Jones is now?), Deep trash. It is not surprising that Reb Braddock does not run anywhere else - he has the opportunity to make his first movie on his own rules, based on his screenplay, creating something like Quentin Tarantino and HORI. We feel that this is a story worthy of telling the world, it does not deserve a second break. In these circumstances, the performances are good - the actors do what they do and they do it well. First of all, they should not do it. <br /> <br /> From 0 to 0.
