I've only seen this movie, I've lost almost twice in my life's hours, but I think it's OK: <br /> <br /> If I need to rate it in any other movie, it can only only receive 1 or 2 tops but If I rate it as a small budget. The movie could be 3 or 4. This is due to the fact that the film is "full" and that it has long or unexpected episodes of boredom. This movie is not. But a lot of independent films are about to show film skills, given that this film has some important events. If you have to make comments on what to do with your next project, I think that some distorted sound effects are of some quality. They also get some characters to build, but it's what leads me to the next project, because the character's construction is too long, especially because it's not important for the movies. Also, should not the long stretches of time to follow in the next race? I think that this movie tries to get everything a bit (building characters, suspense and a plot), and in the end it is nothing (not much) <br /> <br /> This movie is too much and too hard and I think film it would have to be cut short. I could easily find out for an hour to walk or to cut off the movies. <br /> <br /> There are not too many things that happen in this movie. The story had to be faster. I know they are supposed to be a mystery of the movie, but the small murderer who is a murderer is not the mystery. The story behind the "Mystery" is hardly a matter of attention during the film, which allows it to satisfy the fastest "point". <br /> <br /> That's why I'd like to say that this movie was a nice attempt, but I can not say it. I hope the director learns from mistakes and produces the product better the next time. even less so, why everyone thinks they're bad. <br /> <br /> Others say that I'm very sure about 10 films that are part of this movie. This movie could not be judged from a "10" remote viewpoint.
