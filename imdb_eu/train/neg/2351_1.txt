I do not know how people wake up at this show. The performance was ham-fisted and amateur, the story was old news, and plot development (or lack of it) I always had my eyelids less than halfway through episodes in each episode. This is all about it, because there was really no substance. <br /> <br /> How can you make such a shit? The fool is horrible, it's an insult to your mind. I do not know how to explain it further ... Some of you should wait for such a litter because they just look like the actors, or because for a crazy reason, you've "seen thousands of times before. <br /> <br /> I forgot it, the show sucks and happily disappears forever. I want to get to work on the demolition of OC forever and forever.
