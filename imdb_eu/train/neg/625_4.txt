It could be NC-17 with excessive violence in this film. But it could have been a gore-13 and it was very bad when her mother had bad toys and hair-adorned toys. There was plenty of development to see the character that was being developed to see the movie, and then when the baby was returning to life as an appetizer, it was already hurt and killed by ten minutes. Violence was overwhelming and I think the number is greater than twelve and the number of large numbers like this. All the characters in the movie are squeezed or depressed, but the "white trash" and "hoodlum" (although the character is just a lester hoodlum, or even closed, I know the bells and I'm part of it). hoods, they do not draw in class, sit there and throw things to the teacher). The teacher deserves a more serious death than a character, but only in the back has a barn. There were two suspensions in the film, but they did not have enough time to be scary. As I said, murders were excessive and sometimes people who had nothing to do with the story cut their heads off. If Gore was fun, it would be nc-17. Both children describe a body that finds them in the cornea lines; They really describe it a lot, really, they explained that the police were browsing around the extremities of the extremities. The stomach was not opened, because they did not even eat in blue, but wanted to see it. The plays were pathetic, the characters were losers and the txorimaloak could do a lot of gymnastix stunts. The death scenes I recommend renting this movie, I'll soon see, I will not see it again, but I liked excessive violence. Also, do not worry about the sequel, I saw them five minutes and I was dead, bored, well, but not. The original whistle made me really interested.
