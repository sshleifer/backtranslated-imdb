A great Slasher movie - it was a bad producer and not a part of the script. Basic Summary of the Territory - A man with redhead fetish invites women in their apartment only to admit one of the most admirable comings and to achieve many successes. Only the back of the sequential team was to think that the film was like an advertisement and as I split the movie. He did not flush anything, he was lost in the white red of that time (did he not have it before?), And for a long time the camera's man came out and shot again when he woke up. I can not blame, I had to overcome it 2-3 times and delayed it and recovered it to recover the existing small plot. Warning when you see the end NOT attempt to connect with any of the previous ones - you will get an aneurysm. It's not time, effort or forgiveness of God. 2 just one reason to replace it - instead of the hacking movie, and I saw the small chance that happened between the awesome version.
