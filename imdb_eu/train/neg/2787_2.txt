He was nominated singer by the story of the singer Kid (Prince). Then Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero) falls in love. But his wife-dad (Clarence Williams III!) Has to face his self-destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> I watched this in a 1984 movie. Prince was not a fan but I liked the three great songs of this movie: "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy" and "When Doves Cry." This movie is a great concert scene - full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately the part of the movie is SHORT. <br /> <br /> The story is screaming out and before it has been done several times - and much better. Subplots are well-managed and well-managed. The triangle of love between The Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predisposed and tired that I was really upset. His wife has to win the father to get the story, but the scenes are so badly handled (in play and direction) I can not believe. The script is horrible - some of the "comedy" commercial mournings and intense conversations. And there's tons of misogyny here - Kid's mother getting beaten; Kid knocks Appolonia and (without any reason) Appolonia splits it and goes topless in a dirty river. Also, the characters of Williams and Princess are constantly treating women. <br /> <br /> Reality is a movie that fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful, but it's not an actress. And the Prince is (easily) the actor I have ever seen. I do not believe so much for his empty face and for your wooden conversation. This movie lives in concert scenes, but there are not so many. The "dramatic" scene is so badly played and correct as they make a scene to work on this movie. They should do a concert movie. I give it 2 only to music.
