Since Columbo's story is different from the well-known plot (a colorful murderer makes a crime, Columbo eliminates the murderer, becomes a plague in Columbo), writers can never afford the quality of the traditional episodes and their interest. This episode is an extreme deviation, and the result is the main flop. <br /> <br /> Have you believed: Columbo never faces the finish line? !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was tempted to deactivate around two-thirds. <br /> <br /> Oh, sacrifices made by self-appointed reviewers !!!
