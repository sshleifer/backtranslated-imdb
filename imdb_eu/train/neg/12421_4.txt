Mark Pirro's 1987 "Deathrow Gameshow" is a black comedy, it's a cursory in many parts, but occasionally it's really fun. This movie has definitely been much better, the performance is awful, and some very curious cycles are sometimes difficult to see, but the concept is fun and has hilarious moments. <br /> <br /> Here in the near future (1991), game shows have changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) has organized a show called "Live Or Die", in which condemned prisoners of death can play their life and get money. Failing candidates are running in the air using various methods, such as electric guitars, electric chairs and other extra-rusting devices, and applause for animated audiences. The show is only controversial, and Chuck has made many enemies ... <br /> <br /> "Deathrow Gameshow" is very cheesy and wicked in many respects, and the play is awesome, but it's definitely fun in many parts, especially if you are a fan of dark humor. You have not lost anything, if you have not seen it, but it's fun, and a good time waster. 4/10
