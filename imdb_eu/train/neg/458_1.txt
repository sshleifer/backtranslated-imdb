What's that shit? My cousin, of course, received this DVD for the title and title ... I was glad to not get bored with him, and I am sure I was impressed by the horrible quality. <br /> <br /> First of all, the theater was horrible. It seems that the reading of signboards seems to be well-known actors. Delivery is sub-pared and very formulaic. Scene cuts were awful. They seem to have taken them directly from the table in the story, if any. <br /> <br /> Secondly, jokes and stereotypes were not original or well-played again ... very formulaic. I can not count the time it was able to predict the next joke. I made some efforts from different "subtle" religious sexes. Cat, Beaver Patch, Hung Wong? Just ... continue this movie away. It's not nice, it's not fun, it's not even stupid-funny. It's just stupid-stupid. PG is like a children's movie with unnecessary sex suggestions, vulgarity and violence, to revive the MPAA rating. DO NOT USE <br /> <br /> "Do you want to ride on my yacht?" <br /> <br /> "Is this what they called it now?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> Badly played, sir.
