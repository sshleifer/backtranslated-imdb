There are currently many talented filmmakers / actors in Germany. There is not one of them linked to this "movie." <br /> <br /> Why do producers really invest money in such things? 10 films made on the budget of this garbage! It's not fun to run the dwarves that appear on seven-year-old men to be fun. It's all fun that the film's producer (the oldest guy that looks like it) is playing the youngest dwarf. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of moments that you call "You're Still" Now you have to laughter! "It's hard to think that this comedy is infected. <br /> <br /> Many people really got up and left the movie in 30 minutes. I should do the same instead of losing my time ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
