Normally, any movie with Sylvester Stallone is often absorbing the ass. Rambo: First Blood II. The group was no exception. The good works were Sylvester Stallone, Rocky and First Blood. This movie is not very realistic and boring. It has an action, but it's not a very good thing. I do not like to see it, and I would never see it again. It's not surprising why the worst hit Image Razzie was won. I would give this 3/10 why it's been a good thing to do, but it's not enough.
