He really had to stop. Do not go wrong, love monster movies. But this was boring, regardless of any music that you did not bring anywhere. The actor had too many toothpicks and was in contact with the beast, the clich√© was very obvious. This movie shows the cover of the DVD absolutely interesting. On the surface a huge monster is expected, but you're not as terribly huge as this. The other movie called The Killer Rats, but another review. Deep Shock was really rough, considering that it was a lot of shame for a great budget.
