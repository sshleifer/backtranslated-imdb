Well It was not surprising. Many people will tell you this is gory. But they all speak "shiztz", this movie is very slow. <br /> <br /> He begins with the roles he does not call "my son", called "my son", but the penetrating scenes I found but weak types. It's possible to skip the 40-minute movie and it was surprisingly disgusting to the eye-popping scene. That's the stupid scene. and they slapping hits and slaps they slap the slapping fake sound that makes me laugh! I would not recommend it. keep what you keep looking for. <br /> <br /> Check this if you want a scene that looks like a 20-10 minute, it's still not surprising, and the man who wants to rape has a random scene ... curious.
