I really tried this movie. In any society it deals with an important problem: sexual dependence. <br /> <br /> In this story, we can lose everything you lose when you're sexually addicted. In this case, our main character and hero, with all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, neurotic), can stop sex with her marriage, her job and even her life. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are awful; especially acting. Oh, you will not enjoy any sex scene; Most of them are made with little taste and you might think you're watching a home movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the plot is just meaning. How did this smart and beautiful wife achieve the wrong nature of her husband? How did you believe him? The trio is not priceless and will make you a little whistle. <br /> <br /> In addition, the scene with the white theater assistants is no sense and "wtf?" He'll let you think. <br /> <br /> You will find plenty of scenes like these. <br /> <br /> Avoid the movie. Please avoid it; It's not a soft core, it's not a documentary, it's not dramatic. It is a pretentious effort whatever the documentary's director or whatever. <br /> <br /> Only Kinsky's leg is worth watching. HBO caught and I'm glad I did not spend money. But 90 minutes of my life will not be refunded.
