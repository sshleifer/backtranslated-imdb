Look, it's not a spectacular attack on this film, it's just boring. It is a typical romer, ending with the arrival of the trailer. It is essential to classically class rom-roms with stories and imperfections. This movie has no horror, but it really does not make sense of movement, you have been feeling upset and getting away at any time. The production of the film also has the feeling of a first film about fifteen years ago. When I'd recommend watching Harry's classic Met like Harry Sally instead of this imitation cover. Oh, another big problem ... it's not chemistry. If you use Alias ​​to see Michael as pretty as Vaughn, you will be extremely disappointed as you look at here.
