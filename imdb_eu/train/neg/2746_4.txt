I was afraid my nephew would take me on this movie, I did not think he would be fine. The children between 6 and 10 could see it. I must admit that it was not as bad as I thought, but it was far from that book. The film seemed like 10 years of age and humor. When I was 6, I realized what was happening and found solutions to the problems that were happening. In the end I had to explain that sometimes movies do not show the best solutions to problems, so it's fun to see what happens when they make "stupid" or "stupid" options.
