Blank Check in the nineties is the worst film easily. The plot does not have any problems. They are pathetic tones of loneliness. You really think that being a personal assistant with twelve-year-olds can get everything taken in that movie, like buying a home for $ 300,000. The idea, much less the price of the basement basement, is that the viewers believe most lenjons. Please respect your mind and do not see this horrible and horrible movie.
