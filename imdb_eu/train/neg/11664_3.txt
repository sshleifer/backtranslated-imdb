I liked it so much to enjoy this movie. He moved slowly and was boring. If it was on TV, it might take 15 to 20 minutes. What happened to the story? A great job and a photographer were working on a faulty foundation. If there is no basis in the life of the director, why it was not for someone to write that he was "loose". He then directed it according to the rhythm of the bite and perhaps it was a fountain that poured out publicly in the short film. Music rises, but for another movie, not this ... for a TV series. Sometimes the conversation was not understood when Armin Meuller Stahl spoke. I was not alone, I heard some rumors that told me. Why can not Hollywood make better movies? He had inflatables of a great story, but it was poorly executed.
