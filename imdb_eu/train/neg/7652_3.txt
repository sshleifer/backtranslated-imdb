In 1967, mine workers found the remains of an old ancient civilization called Abkani, who believe in the world of light and darkness. When the door opened between these ten thousand years ago, something wicked slipped before the door closed. Twenty-two years ago, lawmaker Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker) headed 713 Office of Government Research Bureau. He experimented with orphaned children. Today, one of these children is a paranormal researcher, Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has achieved a reference to Abkani in South America, and has a man with a capability. When an old friend of the house disappears in the middle of the night, the devil shows that they are returning to the Earth. Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) with the help of the anthropologist and the Head of the 713 Head, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff) and his team fight against evil creatures. <br /> <br /> Although it's a "good charismatic" directed by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, "Alone in the Dark" never works, and it's a whole mess, unpowered or plain character. The reason for the "brilliant" interview with Uwe Boll's DVD director, "video games for younger generations, is not motivated by the book". Moreover, their recipients will be between twelve and twenty-five. Sorry, but I find two confirmations with young generations. I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends and they are not stupid stereotypes, as the director says. In addition, the IMDb offers excellent statistics to prove that Mr. Uwe Boll is wrong. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sólo en la oscuridad O O despertar del mal" ("Sólo en la oscuridad? El malestar del mal")
