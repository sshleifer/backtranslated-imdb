First of all, there was nothing that really caught me in this movie. It was not a bad movie, I said a movie, "Well, that's not something special." It was probably drama and things, but it just did not surprise me, but it was half-sad. As stated in the title, the seam was very cheap. The quality of the film was drawn up (images) as low quality, and cheaper for television, much more than a famous English filmmaker. The camera angles and shots were very friendly to me. Creating scenes did not create any plane or similar effect. I do not see many English films and I have not seen them, and they do something similar to camera work, colors, and so on. "Playing" tried to be harder to be intelligent and intelligent (see "Lola Rennt" about my review), but not for me to succeed. In general, it was just a little indifferent movie (I'm mostly afraid of it) and, above all, unfortunately I missed two hours.
