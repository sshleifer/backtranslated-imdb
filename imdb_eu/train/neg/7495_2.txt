Fox's "The True Story of Jesse James" (1957), a classic remix of the famous name "Jesse James" from the classic Tyrone Power / Henry Fonda in 1939. I do not know where the fault is, but the question of this version of the two main characters, something that Nicholas Ray's unfavorable direction and gold script really needs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < and began studying head. That's because Zanuck was less than substitute for Wagner. "Broken Lance" (1954) and "Heaven and Hell" (1956), it's hard to think about Wagner's self-separation! Additionally, Jeffrey Hunter was just a Fox contract player before assigning Frank Wagner's "Jesse James's real story" to Jesse. Borrowing the studio over the previous year, the actor was a distinguishing feature of John Ford's "The Searchers" classic performance. But playing here, like in the second half of Wagner James Brothers, is boring. Players do not carry any roles associated with any personality or color. They have lost their mark, without the charisma and image that exhibits the original Power and Fonda. The movie flashbacks worsens too much and Wagner, like Robin Hood in American western, will find a hilarious heartfelt, feeling no enthusiasm. Assistance is hardly ever relevant, but it is shameful that Agnes Moorhead's seeing a good actress is hardly ever to look like Ma James. <br /> <br /> The best part of this Western image is the West. The great Cinemascope / Color filmmaker Joe McDonald and the excellent music and well-known composer Leigh Harline.
