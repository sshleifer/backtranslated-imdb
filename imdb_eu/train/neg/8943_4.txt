John Wayne and Albert Dekker will participate in the national oil competition competition in India, and has focused on Martha Scott's Republican Pictures film shot in Utah from the U.S. <br /> <br /> An interesting western type for its characters and its more modern environment, which plays old and new Western Wayne & Dekker. Thomson Burtis, scriptwriter, writes along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs his career as an employee. A pretty good story is stored in the third place, and the action is chosen happily and treated like a pulse. The slight approach to the romantic section is not well enough, and Rogell fights his fist with the two protagonists. But, stunt men always deserve their glory. George 'Gabby' solid supporters Hayes and Wayne have a lot of charisma on the screen, especially when pulling out of the gun. Although it's better than the usual Republic quote, Wayne fans are still an interesting 1940 movie. 4/10
