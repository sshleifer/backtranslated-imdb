80 minutes, and felt long twice! Short crossing is not enough short. In fact, in the first 50 minutes or so, it is almost entirely a conversation (actually, more than one monologue), a woman of middle ages, "men", despair, sex, aging and a woman who recently broke up in French. The teenager who met at a cafe in the boat. <br /> <br /> Monologue is tedious when they go to the tax office and at the end of a bar it promotes a different kind of self-involvement. "The story" can not end there, of course, so he convinced his drone to listen to his cabin. <br /> <br /> What is the low level of love, sex, or whatever? In any case, this film has little to justify the price of renting, for those who love drama that is not interesting at all. Yes, the end is very well done, but it is not a commitment to offer your living room the amount of what you need to enter a virtual therapy virtual session, but it's not like it. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people liked it. I would be wrong.
