"Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat" is a garbage. The play is awful, the atmosphere does not exist and the characters are not interesting. Only one frightening thing about this solution has been given by most 10 users of the IMDb. This is terribly terrifying. There's no gore, there's no suspense, no violence, nothing. Bukarek Cambell ("Evil Dead", "Intruder") is totally wasting, young supporters are awful too. In the main society, but hard-core horror fans or gore-hounds have not enjoyed this crap piece. Personally, I hate a horror comedy, I prefer to see horror serious "Cannibal Holocaust" or "The Last House on the Left". The opinion is that the real horror movie is thought to be terrifying, bloody and disturbing, a stupid humor that usually breaks the whole concept. This is not terrifying, it's not boring, it's not as funny as a comedy, so do not waste your time precious.
