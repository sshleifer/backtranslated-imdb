Perhaps the worst teenager I've ever seen. I'll start with the worst part of the movie, which covers the entire film quite tightly. First and foremost, no one can avoid it: THE AREA OF HALF. I swear that they had been picked up by some randomized children out of the street, as they seemed. Secondly, CHARACTERISTICS / CHARACTERISTICS OF ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES / DEVELOPMENT. You hardly know about half of the children who have died. Everything you imagine is worth it in one way or another. Scarecrow's character was forgotten, and cheap fantasy killer casualties, such as Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOG: The txorimaloa was full of huge carts, the only one that could have laughed because it was so horrible. Lines like "find some small animals to torture!" It really leaves you with a eyebrow. Last but not least: Next: BAD CASTING. How old was Lester played? Like 30? The back of the head was for God's sake. I can say much more about this movie, as the special effects are cheap, it's an "high school movie class", but the point is understood. Making the wrong movie is the worst. They seemed to be "good" in the film: -It would be good for the people of Lower, Lower, and Lower-standard people to sleep. -It's cheap, or even curly.
