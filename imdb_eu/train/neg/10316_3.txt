It was honest at the time I heard about this show, although it might be a bad idea for Muslims to perform a raffle joke, but the opposite is true. I realized that people understand how people can understand that a Muslim who uses real life in such words does not mean that he is a terrorist. He also shows that people play a bad name on Muslims because they play stereotypes, according to the show, ordinary people realize that although they are bad Muslims, it does not mean we live badly. At the same time, Amaire was so hard on the plane and used the words "Blow up" or Yaser, as we have said, and we are expanding the competition and the people are wrong. Being a Muslim does not know things like that, but they do so and many people think bad things in Muslims or in Afghanistan or Iraq, but it does not do that. People will see how we treat them badly when they see this show and how they can think of the action. I'm glad that such a show came in the air. There are a lot of people who are terrorist Piotr Muslims, many people find it very funny, I think doing it right now and then, because everything is fun and it can tell us that it does not make fun for us so you can not have fun. It's unfair, but it's often done and really muslin is a bad name.
