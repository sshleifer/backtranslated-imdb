I've seen the first work of Jason Scott Lee first. I'm saying a lot, because they've watched Soldier, he's playing the bad guy ... but as I've heard, it's not a Jason Scott Lee movie. However, this is it. And if it shows the quality of such films, I will not see any of the other ones. Lee is basically a martial artist as an artist ... as a leader, it's horrible. The film has fought for a few minutes with unknown random characters, probably because writers could not extend the length of the feature as long as possible. The evil is the only character that has a personality trace, and probably because it is absurd, it seems like a nasty. The majority of the movie is essentially looking bad for Lee over time ... or maybe it's the other way round. I can not tell you surely ... and I definitely would not be sure to watch it again. The effects are not entirely horrible ... but it's close. The title comes with a popular idea of ​​going to the Hitler to kill and kill a time machine. In some ways, the movie also creates an interesting idea. The land is very good for its sake. The rhythm is low. I can not think of a positive thing to say about this movie ... I really can not. It's a pure idea. If it was a mere machine of time, I would have to go back and avoid this movie, never mind ... no matter. I hope that they can withstand a few fragile minds as much as possible. Listen to negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this for Lee's lovers, and no one else. If you're looking for a quality movie ... well, that's not it. That's for sure. 1/10
