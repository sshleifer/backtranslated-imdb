What you have never heard (or A & En see) is a great show on Cracker television with excessive weight, chain burning and psychological abuse. criminals He is one of the best shows in England (and that is what he says) and he was very successful in England and throughout the world in 1993. <br /> <br /> Now, they have the original stars to crash into a 2-hour episode with their original writer. I love over a decade since I first watched this show. The DVD box has an honorable place in my collection, and I can mention almost the word Fintz galdeketa-eszena. Robbie Coltrane Fitz filled me with an idea he thought he had a movie with Jimmy McGovern. <br /> <br /> I just started. One of the many things that surprised me about the original Cracker series was quickly determined as Fitz character. In the first five minutes section? In his speech (he threw books in the air), he drank his own drink and murmured in the queue of the game machine? and he knew, he just knew who this character was. You can feel "clicking" in your head when a good actor gets a great deal of great writing by a great writer. <br /> <br /> Koltrane, of course, kept a good show in the whole show. But I always felt some of the future episodes? What McGovern did not write? he has been abused by character. <br /> <br /> So, this is a good news: Fitz is back. As soon as you see this show? Do you make inaccurate comments in your daughter's wedding? You'll feel "clicked again". The following is a strange moment and really feels the next, always thoughtful, untrustworthy point of touch, but in an extremely funny process. If you love this character as I love it, the movie will be portrayed. And this is extended by Judith and Mark: precisely everything that Fitzs relates is perfectly handled. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is based on the crime that Fitz is trying to solve. In standard Cracker fashion, we know exactly who is criminal in the first five minutes? The lie lies in seeing Fitz's opinion. In this case, there is a serial killer to get American blood. And why, unfortunately, is it not due to credible psychological trauma? But it seems that killing here allows the writer to display his personal political beliefs. <br /> <br /> It's difficult for me to write, I truly believe that Jimmy McGovern is one of the greatest writers. in the world I do not even have a problem with movies related to current issues or movies related to political stand. But in the Cracker universe, we expect the characters to behave like humans, not like cartoons. Instead, all Americans in this movie are depicted in a completely stereotypical style. They do not know anything, everything they complain about, locals treats them like shit and make them trap their wives. One of them, above all, can do it within 5 minutes. I honestly considered the channels or something I changed. <br /> <br /> But there's no stop there. We constantly remember what the war in Iraq is wrong? Reminders that are unrelated to the story and reminders of almost nothing. The murderer is so busy as it is worse than Hitler, almost forgotten he is dying; but, of course, is the oral voice of the political opinion of the writer, who forgets to act as a credible man, and that's the way? as an audience? Do not buy a tortured soul of a sudden happy family. <br /> <br /> I can not say that for me it ruined the show ?? It was still a good television, it's better than any other genre (especially the Coltrane). But its incessant politicization was not as good as the classic Cracker class, "To Be A Somebody"? It was as clear as a "grain" section, but it was managed much more clearly and with more psychological depth. <br /> <br /> Two other small points: the Panhandle is not in the middle, but the substitute is its representative. . Full police department So full of great characters, now full of vanilla. Any fully interchanged police officers without any identity (it's only mine to clear Richard Coyle's identity coupling, but he's missing it here). <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a couple of moments missing in the show. to me For example, Fitz has had to limit the total population of Manchester to 50% and millions of millions of dollars, depending on some curious criteria (French windows, how does your computer work on French windows?) it gets it but it gets less than an hour. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> So I was totally disappointed. It is recommended to watch, but remember at least what you want to leave your expectations at the door. However, if the new series came up, everything would be good: I'm sure McGovern can write good things, and maybe he can now get his politics out of his politics. About people.
