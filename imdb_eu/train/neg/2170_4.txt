This film picks fine line between satire and silliness. Although the bridging system does not have the potential to promote marriages, it certainly can not boost the bridge, so the satire does not work for me. However, I found some nice things, especially Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk for a great bridge game. The tournament is very similar to boxing. The competition field has been tightened in a field that has been squared as a boxing ring, there is an arbitrator among the competitors and Roscoe Karns broadcasts on a constant basis. At some point, he counts "One ... Two ... Three ... four ..." even though four diamond offers have an knockdown event. And everyone was stuck in the radio, a regular event for boxing tournaments. This suggestion worked very well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a few of the actors have a comedy to help keep the satira. Paul Lukas does not like the comedy and he does not like it; Loretta Young beautiful and Frank McHugh's usual comic were not enough lines; Glenda Farrelle has a nice comic as the blond is unforgettable at the beginning of the film, but then she disappears. What talent loss!
