The wives are dying on the altar and their bodies disappear. Nobody knows why or who, but a new researcher (Luana Walters) notices that each bride was strange to the orchestra and her creator, Dr. Interview with Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now, Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with peculiar customs, sleeping in coffins and injecting his old wife (Elizabeth Russell) to young women fluids, to support his youngsters. <br /> <br /> The body disappears. a short time that should not be interesting and boring in the premise. Unfortunately, when it starts quite well, it begins to drag halfway and begin to get bored with its topical and predicted plot. <br /> <br /> There are good things about it -Bela Lugosi is charming and bad and brilliant; Countess Elizabeth Russell is beautiful, gentle and distant; And I'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is as compelling as the reporter. <br /> <br /> It keeps a little Gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent. <br /> <br /> But overall, I did not manage to keep my interest in the whole picture, for which I have to misjudge myself.
