Remembering the details of this malicious "movie" is to punch your breast cavity with a rusty and sour spoon. Perhaps the somewhat anticipated "Home Alone 2: Loss of New York" (1992) was a little, but the pathetic excuse of a movie is just one of the most shameless offers to market. A boy who is fighting a spy / terrorist only finds himself in the house with the neighborhood of Chicago. Ridiculous! Why should this film be done? I think that horrible movies are not too time-consuming but rather learning experiences. However, this is really a waste of time. It must be avoided at all costs.
