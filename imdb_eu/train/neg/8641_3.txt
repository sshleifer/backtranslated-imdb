Grand Central Murder (1942) Dir: S. Sylvan Simon <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> This mysterious "B" cashiro was one of five soundtracks directed by Simon in 1942. . Without a doubt, it could be one or two times the Red Skelton movie! However, Grand Central's dead is the shameless shame of Thin Man, which removes roots, charm and chemistry. It treats us with a thin layer of paper, which only supports 73 minutes, a bad performance and tired. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin and Virginia Gray Nick and Nora Charta, Rocky and Butch Custer. It's an IP and it's his wife and twins. They make a mute "humorous" mutual. See? It is already completely different. Heflin is one of the only and most beneficial things here, though it's so much a blame. He was in Another Thin Man of Virginia Gray, but once again stressed, CINEMA IS NOT SUCH, he is not Mr.. And yet, when we begin to think of this movie as a movie, (THE THIN MAN), when we really like Sam Levene, the main detective is like a fog, and Van Heflin had to make it subtle. all important importance. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Patricia Dane, who plays Hedy Lamarr's version C, opens his mouth and becomes F. There are a lot of suspicious melancholy, with the desire of the dead Mida. There is a kind of society, ladies and gentlemen, a thug, a former lover and a great theater accessory (Tom Conway, who is stuck with the unknown character "Frankie Ciro"). Roman Bohnen makes nervous fever, I think I might have done it before. Millard Mitchell is a cop who plays badly with his pockets, thinks he is waiting for this case after collecting this case (Millard Mitchell, swordman). Finally, in a completely deceptive method of story telling, something we have never seen, all suspects find themselves in a place where their stories (flashbacks) tell a detective, since Rocky has mental remarks until the end. The need for the guilty party is forced to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> Over the image that overcomes the real image, I thought that there could be a couple of locations in the Great 1942 era. Central, but ai, no. At first, it's just a short film. Thank you for anything, Grand Central Murder. So, summarizing, a short formula, but Heflin is fine. <br /> <br /> * 4Â½
