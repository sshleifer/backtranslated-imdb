This movie is a waste of time and money. Over the course of one and a half hours, I continued to wait until it was improved and it never happened. It was a slow move, it jumped on the plot, it was not terrifying or interesting, and it really was not worth anything. The credits in the presentation were long and long, like the rest of the film (long and drawn). Many parts of the earth did not make sense. I thought several times that the film was "fragmented" by the imbalance of the plot, but my friend had the same problem and made sure I did not "get away" from boredom, but the movie really was. . I have never really been to a movie before publishing it and I'm actively looking for Films for several years. So, as I'm taking time to write something, this movie should be wrong, and you do not have to waste your time or money.
