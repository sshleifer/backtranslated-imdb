I just rented this movie for four dollars! Alliance Atlantis why a movie would boost a bad excuse for me. However, it was more surprising that a few Canadian critics in the newspaper's magazine gave him good reviews. I'm tired of the farmers because they justify the movie because it's a Canadian and a small budget. Canadian films are expected to be bad, so they give a good review, regardless. <br /> <br /> Now, about the movie: the performance was below the average (except for the main lead character). quite well). The quality of the films was bad, and I think it could be expected before the small budget. The script was totally horrible. An example is the story of a woman who is colliding with one of her clients around the main protagonist, hiring her team and stealing her bikes, whose goal is to destroy only random SUVs. In these activities, a lot of bikes in their gang members have been destroyed (I do not know how those new ones can buy themselves, because Vancouver and Toronto have to be a great deal of drug trafficking). </ B> <br /> In any case, the point of the story (which is not revealed until midway through the film) is a drug trafficker who plans to build bulb buildings in the Toronto region's buildings to make affordable homes. It will be about one life style. <br /> <br /> - I have to say more. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to accept this film at the Toronto Film Festival, because it supports Telefilm, and Globe and Mail and Georgia Direct newspapers, for example, provide social opinions. <br /> <br /> A movie should not get special treatment because it is Canadian!
