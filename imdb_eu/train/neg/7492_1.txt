Apparently, most people do not know anything about European history, such as Germany, Hungary and Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Hitler and Stalin. Nuremberg (and many inattentive trials in Europe) was the revenge and injustice of the winners. What do you think of why they were not American, British, French, or Soviet advocates after the Second World War? There were no American war crimes, Britons, etc. There was no Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, no Hamburg, Berlin, Katyn and so on? The Germans had war crimes, but Nuremberg's justice was not real. The main point was: Vae victis! Must die Germany! (Also a title book in the United States, 1941.) And first of all: full of hypocrisy. But it's not surprising ... Why was not the Nuremberg process enough? This movie is a nightmare. After 60 years of darkness! This darkness (and hatred and narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq, etc. And there are no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very light Stalin would also become envious ...
