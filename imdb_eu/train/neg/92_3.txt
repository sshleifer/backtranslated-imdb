Actually, I can not believe that I spent $ 5 on this movie. I am a big fan of the area and thought that the movie could not be bad. Were there zombies? I was wrong! Honestly, the movie has moments ... I thought the boy thought he would rip himself, but that's it. In general, I think it would be nice to slip down the vases down my naked ax with a vinaigrette and watch the movie again. If we could see some boobs that could have been better at the movie, but I got to watch the movie trailers created by the company. Buyer be careful ... Unless you enter the masochinery.
