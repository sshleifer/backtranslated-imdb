Some people near the fascist or fascist future confine their personal lives, it is a recurring theme for modern literature and filmmakers. These works publish warnings about trends that are unrealistic in our society; But to be effective, they must be entertaining. Unfortunately, most books are probably more effective in publishing warnings than just making them readily enough to be a toy; With movies, the problem is often the opposite. The first most well known work is probably "1984" by George Orwell (first published in 1948), which is still available in a book and film. <br /> <br /> See or read: and then when you feel a man with human beings in disgust, get to Cinderella 2000. This is a low-budget eye-catcher movie comedy. and like in 1984, the calendar has gone beyond its era. The biggest part of the comedy is put on a cloth, but they are just a few fun moments. In order to get a longer interval between them, will this movie get a new life extension, whether or not the DVD will be released, otherwise it will disappear from oblivion, as old tape prints deteriorate their past repayments. Nowadays, there are a lot of movies that appear to be worse on DVD, and in a clear way, I do not like it too much. <br /> <br /> Until now, the best movies of this genre have been "The Handmaiden's Tale". but I would be very happy to exchange Jack London's great feature film "The Iron Heel". An ambition like this, it is still incredible that a modern filmmaker still does not dare (IMD writes a silent version of Silent B / W in 1919 in Russia).
