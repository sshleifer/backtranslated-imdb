Kris Kristofferson, in the mid-70s, when he left her drug store, could hardly narrow her with the ego status of La Streisand and the feminist discount stores. <br /> <br /> No one really is a character. likable; I was glad to hear Kristofferson's Ferrari going over this hill and when he was screwed up. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie about the star of the rock and roll, try _The Buddy Holly Story_ (only about a year and a half after this dreck).
