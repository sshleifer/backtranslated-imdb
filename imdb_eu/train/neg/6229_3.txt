First of all, let's take some things here: a) I am an anime fan - it has always been the same (Speed ​​Racer I saw all the time in preschool). b) I like some B-Movies because they are hilarious. c) Godzilla films like me ... a lot. <br /> <br /> It goes on when the movie is first released, your B-movie seems to be commonplace, below FX, but all of a sudden, BOOM! anime comes! This is when the movie goes down WWWAAAAAYYYYY. <br /> <br /> The animation is very bad and cheap, because it's worse than what I remember with SPEED RACER! Indeed, it's so cheap, a little scene from the movie I remember when some children finish school ... and the same children are again and again! FX are also awesome; Dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the direct action of the animation is not organized, the conversation and the voices (especially I saw the English dub) was horrible and my father asked me to remove the tape from the DVD / VHS player; The only things that kept me alive were to break down the jokes and comments like Robots, and Joel / Mike MST3K (you select the season). Honestly, this is the only way to enjoy this movie only and at the same time to survive. <br /> <br /> My dear, I plan to show my friend in another otaku on Halloween. Movie night It's stupid, quite spectacular, and at the same time fun, it's a bit ridiculous, I'm giving it a 3/10 movie, I gave it an 0.5 / 10 improvement I'd originally had. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not find it, then it will be as fun as it will be until 15.)
