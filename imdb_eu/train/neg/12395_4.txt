When I released this movie from my work, along with three similar films, I saw very little expectations. This movie is not by itself a bad thing. You get paid. Love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want is in a story. It's definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but it's not so bad. Surely I would not see the movie again. In a nutshell, that is, a movie that looks too late at night, you want to spend some time on a local TV, or you would watch it on a Sunday afternoon testing. take some time. Though bad, crisp lines and camera work behind. I did not want to turn the movie off and I did not pretend to play my DVD player. The story has been performed on several occasions in many films. This is not different, not better, not worse. <br /> <br /> Just your average movie.
