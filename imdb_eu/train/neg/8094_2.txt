It's like someone who has read and watched the novel, why I think why this flop movie was. First and foremost, comparisons between the novel and the film are only superficial. Both animals are different. <br /> <br /> The novel is aimed at Satire, but it is a cross between tragedy and controversy. If you combine the stylistic base of the Festival version, all the elements of the comedy will respond to the impulse of the author evenly. And think of the white dress of the author, if you think that this is another, Mark Twain. Later, it would be a precedent for literature in Ambrosio Biercer's ghost hat and queue. The part of Tom Wolfe is clown and author, most famous, always looking for a new gram to make his auto-absorbed mill. <br /> <br /> So it is not surprising that the great production capabilities produced during the production of the film were condemned from the beginning. Unlike the real satire, which translates into film, it is not controversy based on observations based on a certain form of human behavior or other universal accessibility, but on the one hand of single people (real or fictional). In any case, he won the writer's anger. The effort to create a successful story or storytelling shot from that beginning must be clear, without the influence or interference of the writer. <br /> <br /> In spite of this, I will also find the challenge with the questionnaire. Not only are the skills like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith moving away, but real talents such as Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman are completely wasted or are roles that are pure characters. <br /> There is not enough current material for the great satirical cinema, but it does not come close.
