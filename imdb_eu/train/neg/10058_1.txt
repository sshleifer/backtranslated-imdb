It really was a movie that really liked me. Did the audience think about something or think about here? What was pumpkin? Were I am impressed with the mood plans? Are there some garbage bags in a roof on the street across the street? Why the narrator carries out unsuccessful people with no conversation (it is so evident that he has published a really informative interview in his jokes). The best part of the film was a conversation with the teacher of the film, the bad thing that should be before the end of this film. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised. I believe that the creator is trying to become an intellectual or fascinate the intellectual community.
