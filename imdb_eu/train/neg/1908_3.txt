An insult and applause for gay men for all. This lame essay of comedy does not recommend anything. Once again, the "direct" hero is attractive and believes he can not be interested in any woman. Yes, no! In addition, we introduce a pleasing and attractive gay friend, since the elderly man is bitter, ugly and ugly, the lead is appealing. Although I did not find it attractive and gay, I'm an old and ugly blind man (but fortunately I'm not balanced)! There may be any talented interpreter here, it casts a bad script and horrible direction. Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from movies, but it's not just another hack that works in Hollyweed.
