Watch this on TV I'm glad that money is not spent watching or renting movies. The film is completely predictable - a damaged and planner owner, immersed in electric cables. The plot is really weak and unbelievable - the expert mountaineer breaks the waves of 20 meters (using real footage) and all this has to do to get up and shake. The hiker stays a million million trunks per hour and stops at the side of the road. <br /> <br /> Some of the real snowmobiles are spectacular and show a destructive power. However, the real mountaineering and contract between the actors is a very lenient film. <br /> <br /> Please do not worry so much, even if not T.V.
