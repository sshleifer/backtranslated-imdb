First I feel that I'm getting 1 score for this movie (less than what's available). Film fails in every series, script, direction, characterization or performance. <br /> <br /> 1) To begin with, the name of the movie is really C class (even if the movie matches its name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan tries to live his best with the character, but with the pathetic direction, the weak hand becomes a humorous character. 3) Sholay's Gabbar Singh received 50,000 awards (he was convinced). Here, in Aag, 100 Crores of Babban (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor man was called our hero and only had male bicycles (with all automatic pistols), does not persuade 4) Nisha Kothari, when someone said he must not know how to act. Why is Ram Gopal Verma throwing herself up again? 5) Mohanlal was good, but almost nothing was done. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav are excellent actors wasting their movie. 7) Lila Misra (Basanti Mausi) played in Sholay is represented by some films by Gangu Mummy in this cheap movie. Ramu, please, grows up and you must understand that your film must be intelligent. You have enough stupid characters in the movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) There is a great deal to say about the modern JÃºpiter and Veeru. <br /> <br /> In short, I was surprised to see this movie as it seems cheap and comical translation of the original classic. Please do not miss out on money and time in this movie. I think seeing Aap Ka Surror (I thought it might be the worst movie) would be a better idea than seeing stupid characters, bad songs and a wonderful one. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Saurabh
