I'm afraid! Wow, prepare the ninja out the stunning way to throw it. Check them up while they crawl across the ground (on your back or stomach) like the caterpillar, flying through the sky, climbing buildings, hiding and leaving trees, ninja stars, throwing blue welcome gowns, disappearing smoke bombs. Swoosh make a lot of noises in their pallets, and quickly run or trotting their toes. What you see! I would really like to continue with many traditional actions, but I will be there all day long. Do not overdo it, we have a similarity to the legendary Chuck Connors and you'll see it again and again with some ninja with a shotgun. What class! What a bad thing! However, Sakura Killers is an ultra-cheap ninja, a fun action, but younger, this shocy debacle bunch would only get the genre's fans. <br /> <br /> A video game stolen from a pair of ninjas by a genetic American laboratory is very important. Colonel (Chuck Connors) will be sent to two Americans to retrieve to Japan. <br /> <br /> The start of this feature is well organized. Get ready to laugh! Then it slows down, but soon the protagonists learn about the ninja and steal after the workout breaks into the costumes, and they fled the beta tape with a very important formula. That is, when violent action and aerobic civil arts play. It's not too bad (such as drama and similar performances). The discovery of the last climate is very well made. <br /> <br /> In a long time, two Americans (Mike Kelly and George Nicholas) look at the case by sharing headless conversations and finding small problems. It laughed at me when the ninjas were throwing off how these two were brave and fast. These were the supposed professional killer? Director Dusty Nelson ('Effects (1989)') worked hard and played what he was. On the screen, it organizes around the striking locations in Taiwan. Score is a chintzy arrangement.
