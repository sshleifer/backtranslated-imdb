ORCA is not very bad, but it's not really the best time of Richard Harris. Ahab, a fisherman-like fisherman, will face Harris's death, a horrifying assassin, after the "wife" of the whale and his mother's mother. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale who participates in Harris. It is very important that leaving nature alone is important. He does not listen, and so to speak, he ends up with his whimsical revenge. There is no special effect except for what seems to be the mirror-like mirror of a whale mentioned. Harris's endless eyes are reflected in the eyes and the viewer understands who someone knows whale. Bo Derek, one of the Harris crews, is very unpleasant with Orca, and most of the supporters, such as Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn, are not very well.
