This weekend I watched the movie following a good review of many sources. I'd like to draw attention to who he is and what he is trying to do if you want to work on it continuously. <br /> <br /> I'm still struggling to understand actors' roles. In this movie, the movie jumps out of different stories and does not give any kind of empathy with these roles. <br /> <br /> This movie is for a film that is probably quite good, but watching the average movie is a confusing mix, a very boring place and a fiery and annoying movie that you pay for the price of the ticket. You are interested in all 100% details or policies. Do not miss it, if you really like watching movies.
