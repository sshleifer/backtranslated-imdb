The blame of film waste! Nothing happens. No ghosts, almost train, mystery, no interest. The comedy essays are constantly and BRUTAL are painful. Everything else is pathetic. The premise is stupid: many people do not have a place in the middle, because the train is under 3 minutes. What And does the train stop at a heavy storm? I do not think so. Oh, they can make 4 kilometers through the black fields. umm, yes. Sure Or they can be affected by the railroad's hospitality and stop at the train station. A station that did not have a horrible character, which was fully demonstrated by ghosts, interests or plot. <br /> <br /> So very sad, this seems impossible. <br /> <br /> This must be added. LOST FILMS list! aargh !!
