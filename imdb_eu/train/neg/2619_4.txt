It's a good movie for kids who love dogs. It's a bit slow at the beginning, but it will end De Vil. The basic argument is like the first movie. The bright side of the adult movie is a bird-like bird that thinks of a dog. He speaks like a bird man (Monty Python Eric Idle) and barks like a dog. The movie needed more comedy. Check out Matiney to avoid paying the full price or appearing on Disney.
