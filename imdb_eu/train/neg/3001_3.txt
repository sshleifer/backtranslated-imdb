Slaughter High's story was the worst and coldest in film history when the victims were attacked. Unfortunately, after the open hope, the film went live to hell. Mixed very confused and redundant with mid-cochineal and absorbed a new suckling half an hour. The guy who played Nerd immediately died after releasing himself. If you want to flick you stop flick after prank and remember, choose life.
