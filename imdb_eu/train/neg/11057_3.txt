What is Dahmer's childhood? - A double hernia operation that prevents the operation of the human body? What is "infinite land"? - He invented the game that he invented as a child of seafaring men, when they were approaching each other, suggesting that privacy was the ultimate danger. What happens with the relationship between parents and the emotional problems of the mother, much more important than her relationship with her father? His brother's feeling of being born brother? What is the fascination with insects and animals? How did it destroy the roadkill and its house hanging in the woods behind? What could focus more on cannibalism? And about divorce from parents? These are all things that should be included in the film. Instead, the film director gave us a "picture" of her two nights of night, combining this with Dahmer to combine it with events that are not particularly important for understanding. . <br /> <br /> Why did not filmmakers show how Dahmer was interested in people as objects? This point could be done several times, especially when the victims were drugged in some scenes, during sexual intercourse with them (not really in a club, not in a night club). Instead, he shows his finger behind. <br /> <br /> While I'm grateful, there's so much information going for about 90 minutes (or anyway), but why did you spend so much? A film that explores the relationship with Luis Pinta? (This is known as Rodney in this film). I think the director wanted to build the character of Pinet, that he intended to try his fears or empathy with him, but this movie is about Jeffrey Dahmer, so why could not he spend forty-five minutes? Something else? If the scene and their relationship were sufficiently important, such as justification for time, but it was not. The death row scene, Jeff Hicks, his first victim, is the key part of Jeffrey Dahmer's story because he is the first to kill him and kill him for the rest of his life. Unfortunately, the film did not explain that it was his first murder, or nine years later he did not die again. We think, because her hair style is different, and wearing glasses is a flashback, but when? And why? <br /> <br /> What has made the sanctuary in the final trajectory of his living room? One of the most important keys to understanding Dahmer and its motivations is: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < After studying it thoroughly, it is clear that the film was very little with the person and the commitments he made. What could have been the reason why Jeffrey Dahmer's film was to be passed, instead of taking up the real issues of madness and later slaughter? <br /> <br /> Finally, this is a film that is repulsive. We should bring 18 certificates, not 15, we should see them deeper, so that the rest was far from us. This does not mean, for example, that Konera showed the drill that penetrates the head of the Sinthasomphone, but at least killed the number of people killed and how his Modus Operandi died. Any movie that does not know the story of Dahm can see anyone who has thought of it. He killed seventeen men. <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to the lack of facts and depth, the movie is not bad. Cinematography is nice and there are good performances by two main characters. I would like to see again that a filmmaker has more knowledge, more energy and a better reason for making the movie.
