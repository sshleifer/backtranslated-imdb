The bad plot, the bad conversation, the bad performance, the idiot directors, the annoying soundtrack that was constantly repeated on the constant screenplay, and the wonderful copy of VHS is not consumed by liquors. Trust me, because I finished this turkey. It was so pathetically bad that it was my mistake to point out that Hitler's fourth-year Springtime was a scam. <br /> <br /> The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only interesting interest and that was only. who sung better than the original. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something similar, but if you want to see it a thousand times better, watch Beyond The Valley of the Dolls.
