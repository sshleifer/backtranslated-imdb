I had a long time to see Dreamgirls a bit ... with all the criticisms, designations and media attention. And I must say that the first quarter of the film was good! He painted the black music of that time. However, since the movie was dressed, I and my family were bored with our spirit. The songs came in constant, one after another. Seriously, I mean, it would raise a number of music and even more with RENT. <br /> <br /> In addition, I have not had any characters in the development of any characters; I do not like what happened to them! Eddie Murphy's character, too, when he died as a result of an overdose medication, I knew I was sad, but I did not feel any sensation for that character. The characters gave their backs on childhood and other songs, but they did not reveal the personalities. <br /> <br /> Finally, the conflict did not have enough significance for the viewer's care. because of the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a movie-based copy based on Ray, Chicago, and Rent (a great movie by Ray and Chicago, in my opinion). Generally speaking, this movie is very important to not be liked about a general story, but two songs will be fun and entertaining.
