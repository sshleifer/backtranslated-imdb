Despite being a nice plot and expensive production, he asks a director to make so much bad cultural mistake. Where were Japanese cabinets and cultural consultants? Apparently no payroll. <br /> <br /> My Japanese friend laughed aloud before the cultural nonsense that appeared to her. In the final interview he said: "Imagine a Finnish director making a movie about Fnnishri in the American Civil War, using the soft actors of Sweden as a supporting actress, and like French Confederates, before thinking about Scarlet O'Hara wearing a lead skirt. Some people in Finland would realize that hoop skirts "hoop the missing" or Jane Mansfield's hair is strange, but they did not believe in Atlanta's eyes or ears ... and they were afraid of the corridors ... great story. and photography is damned. <br /> <br /> So ... Geisha's reminder was a painful sight for anyone who knows Japanese cultural hues, a real geisha or Japanese dress, a Hollywood theme that is amazing in shooting, often earning money by refining movies leaving the details that worsen when they go wrong. The last Samurai is crowned I thought I was. A good Japanese movie could be a bad achievement. Geisha souvenirs are both better and worse.
