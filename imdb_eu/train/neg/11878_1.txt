Actually, in that regard, the movie is not fun. Josh Kornbluth is a funny antithesis and, albeit, he thinks it's ridiculous. The plot of 17 letters to send was initially happy, when Joshen started "looking at me, the evil one", began to infest the scenes. Judas Priest's joke has been the funniest thing I've ever had, and that's a bit like that, because it has a tough fight with the rest of the movie. And in regard to the excessive excess of "Debaser" of Pixies, I only have to say: what did Pixies do to deserve such a fate? What has anyone done with Kornbluth Josh in the writing / editing / production / horror movie?
