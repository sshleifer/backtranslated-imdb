At the London Sci-Fi Festival, I saw the bad piece of "anime". If you need to look at this thing, do it with a great audience, preferably after a few beer, you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I thought it was fun to talk, it seems to me it's the entrance to the creator. Animation is awful. Badly designed and poorly executed. It is likely that producers have contracted a blind-colored person with a good idea. <br /> <br /> Not having to say really, the movie is a failure in every level.
