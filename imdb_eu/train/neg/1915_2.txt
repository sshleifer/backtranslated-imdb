Thing is pretty good, but the film is close to the original Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street". Anyway, looking for a fun movie must visit originals. William Macy may be one of our greatest actors of our lives, but it is rarely used. And his original role was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I feel like I can meet these shoes. Likewise, he could try to imitate young Bogart or De Niro. Art directing is rich and textured, but it does not bring anything in the story. The extra bundles that are added to the story are useless and the things that are removed do not work. Although the path that goes through seems incredibly free and the surprise of the original is removed. Sam Rockwell has a curious and curious charm, and Luis Guzman has a strange charisma, but the movie's love story seems to be plain and flat. It's a very bad thing to know how to make this film, as it did the first time, but it's not bad enough that we need innovative ways of life rather than studying their originals.
