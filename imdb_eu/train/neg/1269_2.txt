This series gets 2 stars because it puts Dickens on Bleak House and maybe someone will read the book. Regarding this opinion, Diana Rigg was as bad as Lady Dedlock. It was wood Lady D. is a character reserved but not a hammer. Denholm Elliot is wrong, wrong, for Mr Jarndyce. So I will interrupt myself and answer to the people who are saying: "I do not read the book, so I do not need to take the opinion of that person because it is based on book evaluations." True and not true For example, Diana Rigg is very bad considering whether you read in her book. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot Jarndyce is good (although it's old). The series fails because we do not want to compare it to the book, but because different plots and characters do not coexist, for a consistent, dramatic, mysterious, and rich entertainment. It's sad and flat. If you want to make Bleak House, we will give you 20 hours in two episodes of 10 hours. However, I suggest that producers only let Dickens (even Christmas Carol). Television diminishes the genius of Dickens as his ingenious plots and unforgettable characters.
