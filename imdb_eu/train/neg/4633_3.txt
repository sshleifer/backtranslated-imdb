As is often the case, the films about self-destructive creatures do not create drama. 'Download Nancy' is no exception. Probably, someone who knows about the Internet is a story about a woman who has been asked by herself. <br /> <br /> Albert (Maria Bello), Albert (Rufus Sewell), is married. Albert is a successful software and has developed a golf game that has been marketed by its company to several bars and restaurants. Unlike most people, Albert has almost no positive attributes (except for the ability to succeed in the business world). Throughout the film, Albert has a compelling and sharp face. The wife does not embrace her emotion with all her emotional problems and prostitutes. When the wife demands sex, she punishes her presence instead of masturbating. <br /> <br /> Nancy is identical as a character. He was in love with his fifteen-year-old marriage, but grew up when he was sexually assaulted by his uncles (fortunately there is no flashback in his film story). The rejection of self is a self-cutting and a result, it has had to enter therapy. However, his therapist is contemptible, there is no progress. <br /> <br /> In the end, Nancy is so sad she relates to Louis through the internet. Gigolo is a sadomasochist who causes a lot of pain with sex to get money from women. Louis has two children but does not see them (the mother of the child no longer wants to be related to her). Nancy plans to be sexually ill to Louis and then promised to kill him. . There is an unpleasant scene where Louis plays Nancy with her sex while her vagina area breaks into a broken glass piece. These scenes are shown as a flashback when Louis and Albert hit the golf club. Louis seems to make Albert a plan: 1) talk to him about Nancy's treatment and 2) enjoyment. It will take some time for Louis to show Nancy's fate first and foremost that he is forced to take away his dog Albert, so that someone will look after him in the future. Nancy, of course, fate succeeded in finally stolen Louis (but showed some hesitations in the first place when he was "feeling"). Louis will soon be waiting for life for Nancy's assassination. <br /> <br /> What do we need to get out, for example, from a movie that downloads Nancy? Are we supposed to feel victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence? Is the main point of the movie? Is Nancy really a sympathy? I do not think so. The writers of the film create Albert's character, a man of straw, who is out of emotion, is responsible for the decline of Nancy. But do people live in one dimension? I do not think so. Louis has a pioneering man who causes pain. Alberti has come forward to relinquish Nancy. Also, Nancy's statement of her love (before she dies) is her "sensitive" side. <br /> <br /> In the end, it matters to the filmmakers who have determined their sympathies. Different characters from the movie The screening of their audiences is what they are wearing with a scene without violence, Downloading Nancy is just a bad taste and a smooth pornography.
