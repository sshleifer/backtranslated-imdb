Some films are so bad they are good. It is obvious that this is not one of them. Based on a real story, this movie was just as true as the story of becoming a real boy in Pinocchio. The performance was awful, the direction was inadequate, and he quickly traveled. He just did not want to make the director and go home. <br /> <br /> Not even Melissa Joan Hart never considered acting as a talented actress, but all the films he made later were quite low. budget anyway Like most of his other films, he has cut down on the characters by crossing him too much, as he speaks faster, as if his words came out faster. It really shows that there is a sense that there is a crew in front of him and he speaks with a camera when he needs to capture the character of the audience. It is enough to remove the entire film, and any leg that will remain will be damaged. <br /> <br /> Probably the best thing about the movie is when it is over. However, this was not enough to satisfy me, because he was bored by the harshness of that film. <br /> <br /> Look at your taste in a film that is more rigid than a dry tooth.
