Tourists go to Ireland to travel to school to learn about Druids. Those who find themselves are a terrifying story of killer whales. <br /> <br /> If I should summarize the Evil Race, it would be a low gore party. The movie mixes Dead Alive, Evil Dead, Wrong Turn. It is wrong that the film has so many inconsistencies that it loses its "fun" tracking. The film has a bold "horror" bareness ... although the movie also has four pornographic stars, for those four, so it could be much more. Breeds also show a large amount of gore. <br /> <br /> Evil Breed has a great start with giant dialogue and a great performance. The video is given in a horror movie, but it is made from cake. I can not tell who the main character is, so the woman "living" is not so much in the film. Completion of the end, which must be one of the most random and faulty end of film history. The rest of the film does not change the view of the film. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie if you want to believe it, because the death scenes are very beautiful. Two death scenes fall into my head, a naked breast that kills a killer kills murderers on his chest ... on his chest, do not ask. Another identification when the tip reaches the intestines, once again, has strained it through its sock. Is that dead? No, the murderer continues to squeeze his intestines. These scenes have reminded me of Dead-Alive so much with their respective humor. I also got a sense of Evil Dead, horror films and trivial quotes from Sam Raimi. With Halloween, when the female character is in the wardrobe, the killer will constantly try to keep the killer constantly trying; and enter. <br /> <br /> Although rumors and nudity are not enough for audio and visual mischief. film quality When the teacher wakes up from his bed and stays down the stairs, it seems that his footsteps are so loud and hard boots. Really moved away Also, a movie tracking with a single print killer? In addition, what character dies. I could not notice that the breast implant was Chick Jenny or Gary's sister or cousin ... I do not remember. A random chick, which hides a baby hanging out of the body, is still attached to the umbilical cord. <br /> <br /> The horrible edition is also paying attention, since the initial credits are quickly and unbalanced. It's been a bad start and it has improved, but eventually the movie drops its level. Perhaps if the production values ​​were better and more faith would be given to the movie, then it would not die death dying. Keep out of this movie unless you're happy with the quote for a terribly bad movie.
