I liked Magnolia. The earthquake reminded me of the Grand Canyon (I liked it). At the end, 4 lives / stories come together, but the Magnolia movie was worn out and half lost. I almost turned it off, there, but I felt that it was hanging there, I know I know it would be another 1/2 hour torture. I thank God thanks for watching. After 2 hours, I was terribly frustrated. One of the biggest roads was the frog's scene. My DVD player still has not forgiven me and I'm not blamed. It was a unique movie, but it was bad, boring, and absurd.
