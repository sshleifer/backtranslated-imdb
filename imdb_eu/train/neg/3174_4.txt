Jeff Lowell wrote and directed 'Over Her Dead Body' badly. The idea is, first of all, as stubborn as my jokes and the execution is just a cake cherry. <br /> <br /> At least Eva Longoria Parker has nothing to do with this film. Eva always looks great and gives a similar performance. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd looks bad and least interested. Lake Bell is completely wrong. It looks like a man and gives an average performance. Jason Biggs is losing out, but Lindsay Sloane is. <br /> <br /> I expected more entertainment for this movie. Unfortunately, I was not entertained.
