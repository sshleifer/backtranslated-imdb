When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) starts looking for his brother's death, something more evil than "natural causes" begins. When he gets closer, the more likely his sister will be, Fiona (Helga Line) and the rest of local satanists. They will do all the necessary things to stop their hairy ways. <br /> <br /> If you think that you're in the subject of thin satan films, it offers a lot of Black Candles. The movie has a lot of naked and ritualized soft sex. Think of a scene involving a young woman and a goat. Unfortunately, all sleaze in the world can not save black candles. Most of the movie is boring. As opposed to the one I have mentioned, the many sex scenes are not surprising and they are certainly not sexy. It's similar to the best play. Even Helga Line's favorite is a bad performance. The plot really does not matter. It seems that the main function is to have the sad sex scenes together. I know another film directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. When compared to Daughter of Darkness, which mastery of eroticism and fear, Black Candles come out like a wife. It's 3/10 I can do it best.
