I've seen and enjoyed most of the French films I have had more than just talk, but it's okay. Interesting, I found pictures and interesting actors. (However, I was surprised if Gerald Depardieu had been in all the films ever made!) It seemed like this way. <br /> <br /> This film has the same interesting images and it has a good opening. But then there were more discussions, discussions and discussions ... drama is good, but not for murder mystery. For a while, I was almost asleep when I saw this. <br /> <br /> Actually, the movie was like a play that had the scenes that he played in almost any room. So if you love theater, I would like this ... but I want a little more for a murder story.
