This film has a weak argument, weaker characterization, and special effects are very weak, I wonder why I've lost a lot of life with that observation. He has random characters that do not add anything to the story, and the director seems to be excuses for the girlfriend's movie. The robots are sad and the "hero" button changes the knife. If this movie was not so bad, it's not fun anymore. The main antagonist is the only liberating character who has died. The sad thing is bad for the boy, because he is the best to be encouraged. When everything is said and done, cut the movie on the floor of the room or never was financed.
