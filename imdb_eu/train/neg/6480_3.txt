I was glad to see the familiar characters again, but it made me worry about the story. Ariel loved the first movie - why is the second daughter around? The new characters were annoying and I did not like that argument. Worst, Christopher Daniel Barnes was not back to Eric's voice! Disney, please, restore classic movies with these imitations.
