This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life when I surpassed the "10th anniversary divine movie", in Spawn of Slithis, when I was in the 10th year. <br /> <br /> The bad performance, the violent and horny conversation, the incomprehensible plot, the cut-out scenes that were cut, even the music was annoying. I did not leave anything Well, special effects were not bad, but CGI does not make decent movies. <br /> <br /> I can not believe I've spent money watching this movie. If Hyung-rae Shim (director) has the contact information, please forward my username "gmail at" and I will contact you to request a recovery.
