Because it is the only word that describes the intentions of 'filmmakers' as filmmakers. Where do you start In a channel of B * tchiness, I will start with almost everybody's performance in this movie. Scratch that. Almost not included in this sentence. I can not think of a person who imagines well. Even if not enough, it would be almost impossible to portray these zero-dimensional characters in a successful way. However, Katherine played a little girl (I do not even name her name intentionally), I'm still one of the worst acters I have ever seen, only the characters that played Sebastian. The story was horrible of God. He tried to reflect first brightness, but failed in many ways. Not all parts of it were meaningless. Although (grudgingly) I would like to remind you that the plot event was pretty good. And the end was at least humorous. But I saw this movie the worst. Ignore Nothing else. There is no value in observation. None. Removes only the first enjoyment.
