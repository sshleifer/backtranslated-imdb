Seasons the first two times, I think that the Apprentice was a very attractive and exciting show. A combination of reality television and 16-week week-long work was innovative, and the show's producers kept their show important and not "there". <br /> <br /> The new 6 season is nothing more. It's a big joke and has nothing to do with business. In the previous periods, the tasks related to the business were more prominent. Now, above all, the focus is on the meeting room, where participants will NOT be able to keep the show (ie, lie, talk to the trash). backstabbing, etc.). Watching the meeting room can be very fun, but entertainment is at a low point. Sometimes you ask if you're repeating an old Jerry Springer session. Show tasks, mostly boring and, above all, a showcase for companies that pay extreme advertising to pay NBC. And what about last half of the tent competitors? That's just stupid and has nothing to do with business in real business. <br /> <br /> I totally DO NOT respect any competitors this season, they look like mine. In the last seasons, at least some competitors had a bit of a degree. Now it seems that competitors will kill their mother to keep the show. It seems that the massive character of Donald Trumpen becomes bigger and bigger each season, and to be honest, I can not understand why a reasonable person wanted to work for him. The rationality in the boardroom room seems to be a bit like that, and sometimes people like to throw it in the trash. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Student. Please NBC, in God's name, take out the show as soon as possible. It's a shame to see. The student was once a great television show, but now it's just a big joke.
