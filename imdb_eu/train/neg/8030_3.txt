It's not really about that. The story is quite horrible and convincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, the bill is good. Then he was quite horrible. Tim does not adapt to the task, he plays himself as an exaggerated self-inflicted self and convinces him as a Trumpet Vince trumpet player. The film is an idealist and musician, I feel a bit ashamed after watching. In the 1900s, there is no experience in playing or playing together with the band members, but it's very polite. It's hard to build any relationship with the characters of this type, maybe I'm seeing the wrong movie. If you do not have a real passion for life, all the musicians make you feel happy by interrupting unbelief and see this.
