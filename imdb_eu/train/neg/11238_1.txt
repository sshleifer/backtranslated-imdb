When reading the video shop box, this movie is pretty funny. You know what it's like ... it's fun, but you're terrified ... that's not funny or scary. It was a clever handwriting ... the jokes failed me to laugh as well, in their extreme condition ... they expected it. the actors do not do much with the best script ... at least I hope that's not the best ... watch your movie at your own risk ...... I give it a negative 3 star 10
