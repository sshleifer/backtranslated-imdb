Take the <br /> <br /> the famous play 1 <br /> <br /> the director 2 now with the idea of ​​themselves <br /> <br /> A copy of playback of the play 1. A copy of popular theater production. <br /> <br /> 4. Whoever directs the actor, who does not have the part that he plays and you will get: "Hamlet, Prinz von Dänemark" <br /> <br /> I heard radio stations "Hamlet" with Maximilian Schell Hamlet and I were so disappointed. I expected that the shot version would be better, nothing that says Schell's saying that he had at least one body language. Next, the set ... minimalist design is not at ease, but I usually like it on stage, just enough to set up and explain anything else. Oh, on stage, in the theater. It will not work in a movie based on a play that is truly credible. The set idea that Schell had copied from plays produced in Hamlet ... Let's just say the one complained ... I asked him how Schell could take his place for the first time in Hamlet as soon as possible and how anyone allowed him to play Hamlet for the second time If you do not see seventy films based on "Hamlet", do not see this, if you are a masochist, or really like a hardcore, or if you want to plunge yourself into the actress's delight.
