I bought this movie in a CD store of $ 5, and I'll regret it. Soon I'm saying that I am a horrible movie horror. Entertainment is entertaining. This movie was entertained half an hour ago, because it was so bad that it was easily dispersed in the MST3K style. Then, it was boring. <br /> <br /> Impact is the most dangerous part of the movie. Although a great performance was not expected, this was laughably bad and, in fact, all entertainment must have been given. This is a positive side of the film. Where writing is entertaining, lighting and editing vibrate. <br /> <br /> This movie has too many "What's up for $% @ $"? moments There are many moments, such as mothers who are rare at dinner, and then the movie has no effect. Following the dinner line, a manager has decided that it was fun to see people live refined food that was eaten by refined food for five minutes. While lunches and other good times, the scene is out of the darkness. Then he goes back. And talking about darkness, one of the most fun external parts is the climate, as it does not seem to rain at night. And talking about the darkness, the big problem in the movie is that it is so bad that you can not see what happens in the middle of time, that is, more frustrations than anything. In one of the scenes, you can not see so much moving. <br /> <br /> And with respect to the climatic scenes, Unhinged has the worst. I've seen people say "Wow, it shocked me, and that's good." I can say that the big suggestion was surprised to me, because I did not see it. The reason I did not come up with absolutely no sense. I will not ruin you, but I will tell you my friends and I have spent twenty minutes reloading the parts of the movie, finding something that would validate everything, and finding out more things that could not be said. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is best seen when watching the remarks of the fun comments. I love movies that are horrifying, but it was too much.
