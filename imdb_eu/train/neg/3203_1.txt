Gudgeon, a cute cowboy dressed in a gunship, listening to country music and listening to donuts, Joe Don Baker (MITCHELL) is a roommate as a deputy chairman. In the meantime, a crime-punishment called by George (who played Joe in Fulci's HELL HORR drilling) falls on Joe Don's territory and shoots a sheriff in a badly-edited scene. Joe Donek slowly leaves Palermo's brother behind and behind his legendary phrase: "It's your movement. I think you can take it? Well, come on, for some reason, Joe Don, Texas legislator, must move to Palermo to Italy ("Mr. Palermo has been an important source of embarrassment for the Italian government," says Mr. Wilson, a defective character of Bill McKinney, who was MASTER NINJA. 1, SHE FREAK, and Clint Eastwood's great films.) <Br / > <br /> Anyhoo, Joe Don's plane must be on the island of Malta, where he has to flee with a man from a Palermo wizard and a man who looks like Jon Lovitz, where he stops the movie, and in the rest of the movie he's searching for Joe Don Palerme, Palermo's socks end in a jail stamp, the head of the police in Malta cries out and then warns him not to look for Palermo, and then he is searching for Joe Don Palermo, loses Palermo, a jail stamp At the end of the month, the police chief of Malta has released and then warns him not to seek Palermo. He then looks for Joe Don Palerminus, Palermo socks ends at a jail stamp, has been released by the police chief of Malta and later warned not to seek Palermo. This is a serious movie. <br /> <br /> At one point, Joe Don is supposed to be dead in the sea. All other people ask whether they are dead or not, because of that. But then it is revealed (a poor family saved) and no one mentioned in the sea for a few days. The good friend of Julia Louise-Dreyfuss was not welcomed. However, he has helped to find the Palermo villages, so Joe Don is looking for Palermo, Palermo socks ends in a jail stamp, and the police chief of Malta has called for more Palermina not to look for. <br /> <br /> Points include gemstones of colorful carnival jewelry, some sexy strippers, a baby dressed like Napoleon and a tomato cart, a dressed-up scene. a monk and any scene without Joe Don. Among the small points threatens Joe Don stripper, with the suspension. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that Greydon Clark, director of ANGEL'S REVENGE, appears as a sheriff. Ick! <br /> <br />
