It seems to be the latest graduate of film school, when New Zealand's film times came to new heights, people generally think that all New Zealand movies are great. Sione's marriage proves that she is dead. <br /> <br /> It's totally unknown and it's not fun; In addition, other IMDb users have commented. The only fun thing I found in this movie was Derek was a pretty black girl, but that was only a joke that he had recycled before everything we heard. <br /> <br /> Regarding Middle Sami, he wants me to see how he wants to face the Polynesian representation. It was a complete pilot - I know it's an supposed comedy, but I did not feel that the characters were not about something new to the Polynesian personality, even though they were masks. The most endearing was the end of the film and the resolution of the relationship of the character. Mikaele was the only player with white women, when he arrives at the "Dusky Maiden", he has an epiphany. Maybe he should start looking for a stable relationship and eventually dismiss it and accept it as a Playboy Polynesian for women's palms. I did not understand why they did. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was very disappointing. My entire family hoped to have a good laugh, but it was finally paid for seeing it. They're joking, lying, actors, especially Sefa's girlfriends, APPALLING, and honestly I'd be happy to keep myself in the hands of one of those copies of the right film. /> <br /> The good thing that comes out of the movie is the second step (behind course 2, of course, a film from this movie) when Polynesian film was born. I hope future filmmakers can learn Sione's Wedding, NOW, Polynesia and here something meaningful and more meaningful. Even if it is comedy.
