This is the worst show. There are no moods like children of little children. Even though Sesame Street has a better mood and more than friends, "Friends" may have been the worst thing I have seen on TV and I've been sitting in front of my friends' tube. "The series," Seinfeld ", and the lack of self-pace of" Frasier " They seem like the characters of "Friends" seem to be undesired. <br /> <br /> The unintelligible exhibition is not displayed in any way. The character is caricatured and is a sophomoric script (deliberately). (Interesting It might be possible to observe a writing session since writers should be slaves less than their faculties, so that "friends" can be confused with their faithful friends.)
