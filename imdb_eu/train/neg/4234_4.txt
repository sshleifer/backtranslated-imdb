It's not one of the best slasher movies of all time, but what it's like is quite fun. The earth is mud, but the killings are not bad. I must be honest, if you do not follow the band that appears in this movie, you will not find it as funny as this movie. I met someone who saw this movie and I was disappointed that the movie was bad quality, but it has to be understood in free time through two, backstage for kids games and friends. ... it's not serious. Ugber Cheese is his best punk and over 100, most of it with ultra gory, it's a fun movie to watch friends, drink and be happy!
