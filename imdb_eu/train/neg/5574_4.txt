"Godzilla vs King Ghidorah" is an excellent example because a wonderful idea can ruin pathetic issues such as pseudo-patriotism. Here, future travelers try to destroy Japan, representing the local heroine Godzilla with her puppy monster, King Ghidorah with three-headed gold dragon. They fail, but Godzilla finally fights Ghidorah. The fights between two behemoths are very cool, but the plot of the movie has holes and "Japan is great" is a stupid thing. The creators of this movie did not threaten to respect all Japan's enemies, because they were stupid giant giants that make Japanese light easier to understand. It's a good thing, in the end, that Godzilla and King Ghidorah were almost Japanese and almost ridiculous they actually destroyed (really) two battles. But this battle was really sad and pathetic.
