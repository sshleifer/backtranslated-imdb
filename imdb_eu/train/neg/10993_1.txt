Of course, we all like bad films at one time or another, and we enjoy ourselves. This, however, was not the culprit of pleasure, it was nothing else. The guy, when Vince's offerings, could be big enough to boost being the main character, probably drank, but they probably both thought it was a great idea to film. Then he showed his script to equally tall and drunken individuals. In general, the movie was so bad, it was predictable and I could not spend about 20 minutes. You Get Served looks like Citizen Kane. One man WTF ... A guy who walks around, a real original. Fat Man is just as good as calling, and he was smart to go on a superhero outfit.
