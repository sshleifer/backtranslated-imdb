Western stereotyped, derivative, common and boring. The two famous stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) have two very good performances, and therefore reasonably; Both have superficial roles and character characteristics especially through dialogue. Heston is a sheriff, "was better off to the world," and Coburn is illegal, "owes him to the blockade and owes him some debt." In addition, Heston is so old that he has no hiccups and Coburn is hard and harsh, but he is not a cold killer like some small killer. It seems that filmmakers could not distinguish this movie a bit from the original idea. (* 1/2)
