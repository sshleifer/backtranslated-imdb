They have their own satellites (what?), using satellite frequencies, someone's code to kill someone (why?) and much more stupid moments in this movie. <br /> <br /> People who are not programmers will see something horrible in that movie, because this is not a professional. But people will not see real things. <br /> <br /> The programmers will find a curious and horrible movie - because many moments of the movie are not RELATED's real life (why not write the movie in this case?).
