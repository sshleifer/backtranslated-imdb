Maybe this movie would give me a higher score than Peter Jackson's trilogy, but seeing them both is not the opposite. The rhythm of this movie is accelerated, out of the many important scenes in the book, and there is little development in the character. The animation was painted with traditional cartoon cartoons and live action scenes, they are a strange mix. And the most depressing thing in this movie breaks in the middle of the story and it is not over. There are good points: watching the battle scenes is exciting and the letter of conversation continues. Check this if you're in a hurry and can not see a new 10-hour trilogy. But if you have not read the book, you will probably be confused, many of this version is missing. 10 to 4
