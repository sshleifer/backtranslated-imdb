Three writers attempted to adapt the novel for a Jane Stanton Hitchcock tube, but the TV movie eventually injected too much melody and I do not know when to go. The artist Meg Tilly finds himself suddenly in the midst of the enriched and enigmatic Ellen Burstyn, a mural painted on the walls of his not-used room. After hearing about her latest meeting, when Ellen's daughter's daughter's party came to an end, Tilly decides on her subject of art, that she never dreamed that her daughters would die mysteriously before the start of the function, and that he and the deceased did not resemble another. ! Both excellent actors offer closed investigation services and do not take any control. This does not coincide with the woman's emotional intensity. Burstyn's role begins in the camp, because Tilly makes a habit of dreaming. The only sequence at the end of the film (after the wall is over in the morning) will be charged with a sincere feeling, anger and betrayal. The rest is piffle.
