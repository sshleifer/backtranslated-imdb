This movie is just another movie of an average action, but it can be much better. When chasing guns they needed choreography support. Someone like Andy McNabb - This great sequence called Heat was robbed from his head - he transformed one's action sequences into imbalances. Because the rest of the movie is well-anticipated but visible-it was better than expected in this type of movie. Then the last scene, show-down, was awaiting, but A-Team saw something in the 80s. They shoot incredibly, nothing happens, and they walk in a house to kill each other, old, old.
