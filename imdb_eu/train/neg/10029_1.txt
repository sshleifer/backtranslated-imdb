I did not know when I saw the movie, I pushed it with only Tashan browsers. So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it, and Vijay Krishna Acharya's first feature, Dhoom's 1 and 2 scripts, and debut in the movie, Saif Ali Khan's son Ibrahim. child, his retreat. "<br /> <br /> After seeing this, I understood why they were not their proper trailer, because they were nothing in the movie, the story was very disturbed and a 10-year-old child can also get along with a better story. There was no action and the camera shook at every possible angle, and it was difficult to know who is dying. There was no realistic action either. A man with a gun managed to kill 100 men with machine guns. <br /> <br /> < > When I saw Tashan, he reminded me of three films: <br /> <br /> Sin City: initial credits. <br /> <br /> Koyla: Anil Kapoor, an incredible English like Koyelan Puri Amrish. <Br /> <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The jokes that are not fun in the joke surprisingly. <br /> <br /> The budget is the same as the Doroom 2 and I do not know where the money went all over 40. If you do not like Dhoom 2 , it's not Tasou, it's a great race And it's a million times better. <br /> <br /> Only 2 good songs are Dil Haara and Challiya, and both songs are located in Greece in good location, but what are the rubbish films used for? The terrible Englishman of Anil Kapoor could not save that accident either.
