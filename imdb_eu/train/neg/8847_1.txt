This US soap, Knots Landing, has the value of being trapped in an elevator. In all sections, such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug smuggling, similar to those of other times. As regards Cast, I saw a better actor in a cereal box. In the mid-90s, U.K-Gold repeats "Knots" like slowdowns. I'm sorry I'm going to announce that my mother would have a great show of entertainment and I would see her religious. Since then, there have been fewer (so we hope to keep that way). The only positive thing to say about 'Knots' is the melody of the renowned saxophonist signature, later used as a music title for "The Upper Hand" called I.T.V sitcom. Great heritage, right?
