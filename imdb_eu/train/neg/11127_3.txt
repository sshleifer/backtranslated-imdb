I do not know what Diane Silver was thinking about when he was making this movie, but of course he has nothing to do with the novel by Richard Wright. <br /> <br /> We have read this past novel, AP English, Summer 12, and just watch the movie. After checking the watch and checking the clock, I watched the chances of attacking lightning. Of course, the sky was completely clear, and I had to see the rest of the movie ... and then I wrote a 5-paragraph essay. The killer and psychology behind it. Silver filmmaker turned the murderer into a victim, which is what Wright did not want (see: "The bigger it was born" 454). <br /> <br /> I will do this briefly and sweetly: if you want Let your conscience, the words of Raphael Lambert silently, jump in the movie and read the book. The adaptation of 1986 is not a material thought. <br /> <br /> ... :: sigh: I have to write an essay now.
