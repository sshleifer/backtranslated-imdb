This movie is a stupid version of Hollywood's mother-and-daughter relationship in terms of her "independent" situation. At first, it was not bad, but when it comes to the movie, when it comes to the guy with his daughter, I think that it will become a movie for young children. I'm sorry, but I do not know any mother with kind of relationship with her daughter ... probably better then that way.
