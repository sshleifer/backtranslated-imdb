A model called Laura works in South America, kidnapping a notebook in her room in the hotel and taking it to the jungle. They ask for a great deal of liberation. Peter is hired to enter home and earns money if he or she rewards the money and the girl. Peter jungle with a helicopter Jack with a friend. The plagiarist tries to make fake money by paying Laura, but the plan is mistakenly mistaken and helicopter has to bail. They need to shoot the helicopter and avoid it (they have not done so far). The jungle is also a devil. In fact, black is just a black naked man. Some kidnappers started dying and Laura fled to catch some primitive ones. The rest of the movie is really blurred. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not a fan of Jess Franco, it's just the second movie that I've seen so far. I can say that this is not really the best effort. The film makes a slow pace without a trace. The whole thing was quite easy in a 25-minute show. The people passing through the jungle are very long for people to walk long. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter is illuminated (I do not think it's on). dubbed, misunderstood and slow but for some reason I was not bored. I think that the main reason is the bad scenes that appear in it. For example, the scene of Laura Street is, of course, shot in a real street, so many people stopped watching the camera straight. Another gang of a fun scene kills a blood drip on a tree, because one of his companions has the same number of minutes. After all, without reason, the man in the head of the trees only falls under him and knocked the guy under him. It must be thought Then, of course, there is a real devil. Although it has massive eyes, it has only a bare black type with a full blurred vision. <br /> <br /> The film was linked to part of the 80's of video horror here in the UK and here. was forbidden Now why did not I have any ideas? It's very little and it's not a touching movie. At least I would say that I could almost run away from naked PG. The only thing I think is never seen and added to the original list in the mouth, <br /> <br /> There is no reason to see this movie unless it's really massive. Jess Franco's enthusiast. There are plenty of things to keep sleepy and you can laugh at some of the bad scenes in front of them, but I would say cautious about paying a South American card and losing it in the jungle. It might be more fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3/10
