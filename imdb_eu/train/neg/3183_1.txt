Sergio Leon turns his grave ... If there is a movie that is going to crush the works of a man's life, that is. The "solitary wolf" of the main character is not boring and tidy, and the script was apparently written by a monkey from eight studies. Anyone who has not been doubtful has had a horse attack. The only reason I am expanding is the 10 line minimum. He has been forced to sue Sergio Leon's family, because he is not his crap, but now he is immortalized as a terrorist MPR 3000. Shame Nazka. I'm making Hollywood guilty ... At least Gary Busey shams no one coughs users and weapons experts ... This movie is pure blasphemy.
