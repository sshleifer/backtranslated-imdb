Oh, come to the people to give a break to this movie. The only thing that I really liked was ......... sorry, still thinking. Oh yes! John Wayne came and got caught. Oh, sorry, the wrong movie, I was thinking of a high quality movie. See now, I still try to defend myself. Yes, it was Clueless's rumor. Do not put Stacy Dash. I mean, we all make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, you made a dooooosie. <br /> <br /> Hey, a thing that has never been done west, although in every woman there was really a woman hanging from the canopy. That may be the western one. Although the neck had to be broken and the suffering survived, however, the director must give his first attempt at the West to the director. Also, I have never seen a woman riding lynching any west, even though this has not happened in this film, I thought I would give the director another idea of ​​Gang Of Roses # 2, and this should be done just after Ed Wood The Monster of The Monster # 2. Maybe they were looking for such movies. Orginality, especially with African women and an oriental cowgirl. <br /> <br /> Heeey, the head of the Gang Of Roses, wants to keep up with this mess, such as slogans, "Hey, do not get around my home trips" and "talk your hand, baby, talk your hand." Likewise, you can have a surfer-like deputy deputy saying "totally totally totally totally totally shot". You know such things.
