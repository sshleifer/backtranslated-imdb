This movie starts to slow down and then it's hiding. An hour after watching and seeing everything happening, I came out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero Zip. Nothing There's no story. The characters are faint representations of the most boring people we know. If the producers of this film try to sell them as a "motion" image that they could sue for a court trial. There is no movement. A story with a couple with a caption could tell "the same story". The script is a joke. It's wonderful. I doubt I can keep a medical writer from the world. My biggest regret was not to lose 60 minutes of my life when I saw "Money In the Time of the Time," but I missed a unique opportunity to become a leader. I could come out first, but I waited too long. Instead, I saw about 20 people.
