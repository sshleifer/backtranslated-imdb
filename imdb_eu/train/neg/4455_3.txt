Where do i start Okay, do not compare this movie to the fight against the club - ridiculous. If there is a patch in the fight club, violence, blood, gore, etc. would be much more obvious and realistic. Secondly, this movie is not a soccer factory, which is much more real (and Danny Dyer is shocked by Nicholas Nickelby). Reasonably, the story is quite decent and the battle scenes are well-choreographed and I can add it to the end. But in general, the movie is poor, seriously poor. As people mentioned, accents do not have to ruin a movie. I do not agree - a simple mistake of the questionnaire or lack of effort encouraged the voices of the film to be totally annoyed. / Geordie was playing the role. Do not get mad, look good, look pretty, but not a football hooligan. The most horny scene in football was that I could continue forever - the "false steward" situation. Additionally, when the GSE team plays in the north, the trains start waiting for only 3 of them - it does not make sense - this is the real gangster and thugs, which is portrayed in the film. mouse worship about 5 people. In terms of precision, West Ham and Milwalle did not play for the last two years in the Championship. Hmm, ten years well. And I'm sure that 'Bother' would enter Milwall's pub. Basically, if people really like the real football knowledge they have, and the huliganism movie is very bad. If you really love football and you're getting under the huliganism, you'll just feel like this movie has bled your mind. Ross George
