This movie is a bad attempt to make money using a classic theme. I loved Superman movies, but I wanted to shoot myself. High efficiency, special effects shameful and zero value. In summary: Superman leaves the earth, because scientists found parts of his home planet, some were in space (duh), they did not say anything to his girlfriend (again!), In a space station (?!?). I think back 5 years later, and I hope to bind myself to the maid (who now mocked her son, whose son, at my humble opinion, at least 7 years old). And with Lex Luthor? To try to grow a new continent in order to sell land? Please! <br /> <br /> I cast a vote from 1 on this film, because I do not have permission to vote 0, if you have something else to do with your time, do not go to see the movie and do not even want to do something, stay home and Watch TV!
