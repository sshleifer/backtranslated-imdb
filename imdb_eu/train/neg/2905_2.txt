Hopefully, when I went to see this movie I was somewhat lucky, I thought Steve Carell would not come from Anchorman, The 40 Year-Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine. The boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I will start with this movie straight: Steve Carell will be Steve Carell at certain points. They've been laughing at me for a few moments in the movie, and they're almost entirely threatening. Certainly, it is an individual talent, and it's a shame that he has signed up on what he has been doing. <br /> <br /> I will debate the way out there. What happened wrong <br /> <br /> The film begins with Dan Burns, widows that are currently playing in the columns of three widows and national unions councils. She prepares her for a family reunion where her extended relatives gather together for some time. <br /> <br /> The things that make the movie a great family are on the list. This family has no such behavior. It is almost as if driven from Pleasantville or to Beaver. A caricature of what a family thinks about at 7 years old. They point to the unexpected and simply frustration. Touch football, crossword competitions, family bowling, and talent shows NOT REAL BEHAVIOR. Almost sick. <br /> <br /> Another great gap is the woman who carries Carell's fall. With Steve Carell, seeing his first scene, it's like watching a stroke trying to rehabilitate. What I think seems to be the only and original one that women, as far back as faithful. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is being done on another planet. I left the theater asking what I saw. After thinking more, I do not think much.
