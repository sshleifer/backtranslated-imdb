After finishing this book I directly watched the movie and maybe the idea was neutral or very stupid. I think this second. First and foremost, the small and important details were often inaccurate. In Winston's daily life, conversations, eating at the cafeteria, etc., I realized the first thing that feels an unfortunate look and makes an inspiring look at people without fear. It was one of the most important parts of the book, although in a small activity it was almost impossible to safely, even though its true emotions showed a suggestion on her face at any MOMENT. This also appears in the streets of the proletariat. In the book, Winston found out that there was a great risk to travel there, and it was skeptical and horrifying when traveling. During the movie, he does so often and without fear, if you lose heavy vigilance and high risk, <br /> <br /> Winston hid his log on the wall. It's a very small change, but the question is what is it? The director has also been an annoying thing he can do with a book, which is the morphing character. <br /> <br /> The big details were very disturbing. First of all, one of the most important aspects of the book is that it is based on a Big Brother philosophy based on intelligent and gross thinking. They jump on this movie and Hitler directs Hitler with technology. What is true, when it comes to saying that it is directed to its pheasism, but if all this comes from Big Brother, you have lost the point of the lost book. The frightening thing about Big Brother is somehow behind his philosophy. When O'Brien gathers Winstons with Love's Love in Love, Winston is listening to everything he's saying about Brother Brother to Big Brother. What hears and advances in his philosophy is precisely the most surprising and interesting. In the end, (careful before SPOILER) Winston says, "He loves the Great Brother," it is horrible that you are not sure about the inconveniences and torture, or the power behind philosophy. I do not say in any way that the philosophy of Big Brother has the points that I like, but his mind and depth is very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Also, how can I feel the connection between Julia and Julia in Winston? It was disgusting, no connection. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And where was O'Brien Winston before his address? One of the things that brought us to the book was a reflection on Winstons O'Brien before contacting him. In the film, the gun jumps. <br /> <br /> But it is summarized below why this film was a tremendous adaptation: it is impossible NOT to shoot guns and morphs in less than two hours. How can someone think that this movie could be in less than two hours? The movie requires at least 3 hours to get some mood and connections. It's at least nothing. <br /> <br /> If you love the book and TRULY, I mean, you will not accept this movie, and you can choose it, you know it would not be. This book is not easy, and this movie proves that something is impossible to blur in small cinemas. <br /> <br /> Ten stars with ten
