Summary: Legend has it that the Brunkyly Valkyrie Odin was challenged and an eternal fire was chained to a rock enclosure. Only a warrior cleansed by heart is crossed by flames, released in Brunhild and released from Odin's claims and for him. Now, the birsing war is on the Norse land, and the King needs the alliance Berserkers. Berserker claims that Odin's valkyries are warriors, war, blood and flesh are enthusiastic and, as a result, they are excluded, but they are more battles. The chief of Berserker is the king's son, despised, the boar, and the price of his alliance is his brother, Barek's future king. But when the king gets victorious, he refuses to give up his refusal to refuse to give up his resignation to the rest of his son. Boar Barek only called Odin. But this is just the beginning of a fight between brothers, and the last battle will start now, later a thousand years ... <br /> <br /> Comments: I hope that it would be a movie based on that. Some Viking lands, a quality short film about Viking. It has begun well, they were long and armor, good landscapes, and good fighting. <br /> <br /> The base of the Aesir myth is very thin and seems to me to be very damaged. I remind the school of much more vengeful, spiteful, and absent Odin, and valkyries have become a vampire devil. I'm not an expert, but that seems completely wrong. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But this is a serious mistake given by this movie, it's time to move from original to current. If both brothers fight at the right time, if the battle was decent, it would be much better for this movie. Now the setting has suddenly changed to Stockholm today. However, Odin is present and is sending Bosserkers and his berserkers to Brunhilda and Barek's stupid story when it comes to armor-coated and berserkers struggling with the fighting industry between Barek. The cement and the beautiful forests have been exchanged with cement. And when it is allowed to put on rare battles, instead of massive initial battles, I quickly see that the battle and skills of the actors are slow and awkward. <br /> <br /> The final result is a thin story, sometimes it's hard to follow and others are stupid, and only one can save them, action, slimy and clumsy swords. Aesir mythical or Viking tradition draws little. So stories and actions fail, and the movie is bad. <br /> <br /> Finally, as a Swedish, the movie is confusing. Shot shot in South Africa, supposedly a Swedish car, plates and a police car. However, the effort is bad and it is only now so that it can really be implemented in Sweden. The name is not Swedish (perhaps with the exception of Any), the well-known landscapes are Swedish, allegedly (formerly?) Spoken in Norwegian, not in Swedish. And uniforms, policemen and doctors are clearly not in Swedish. If they did not try to do it correctly - and they really are excited about what is set in Sweden, why should you worry? <br /> <br /> 4/10
