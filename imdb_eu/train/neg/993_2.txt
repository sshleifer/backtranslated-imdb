I will write about this movie and the famous "Irreversible" (there) scene. So you have still warned, if you have not seen the movie. This is my thinking, why do I think the movie fails (in the end - it makes sense). <br /> <br /> By wise, Rosario Dawson is very good and portrays almost a little ten years (a teenager, other words). It is a damn thing, but it loses its "bad touch" before it ends. If it's never changed really, why did she let her a tie? He would not have had the period. Then we also have a bartender / 2nd rape Dude. Actually, I do not think it's necessary. Except at least second rape, later on, more about it. <br /> <br /> Let's repeat the story. Rosario's character is unsafe, it also has lesbian tendencies (see his scene with a friend). This is not mandatory, as Rosario himself says, but there is a sexual tension between them. Rosario's character is found in all mischievous senses in all senses, a predator sex. But he makes his impression. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It's different Because he plays, as if he were his first boyfriend, he also emphasized his phone with his mother. Talking about his mother, here's another problem. After the first rape, the character of Rosario did not tell anyone what happened. His relationship with his mother is very close, after which nothing is analyzed. The character of Rosario did not call her mother anymore or wonderfully, as her mother would be stupid. There was so much potential. Similarly, his friend's wife: we see the party, something obvious happens and the "boom" disappears. <br /> <br /> The first rape is almost unbearable. But it's a little bit like when you compare it to the end (rape), as you go with sledge hammer! After rape. We get 1 very long scenes. The wires are opened (it's an example of construction work that is lesbian, as one guy tried to beat him), but he has left it open. The real relationship is not established, the second and the second rape and you are taking part in the rape. It is evident that it is not a "nice" type and that it gets its character a bit. When Rosares is confronted with the rage of the character class, the fact of being a movie does not make sense. The fact that Rosario's character is no longer the same as the "bad" went and made people hurt. (Too much) Many scenes show exactly this, they are doing drugs without their emotions and doing other things. Back to # 1 rapist, who cheats on a test, has captured the character of Rosarios and they decide again (really?). It seems like absurd that the guy finds himself with him, without seeing him, with another girl (he was very likely to have raped us, even though we never saw anything, fortunately) and his soccer career. Good career is a stretch and bullied. This is an attempt to deepen his character and it almost works, but once again it is toxic to be with you. So, he presents the # 1 Rapist Rosary character ... why exactly? He promised me that it was his day? Again? Such a guy never loses control, especially with a woman who has previously raped her ... I suppose this is a nonsense. The man Bartender could have helped someone like a head or something like someone else, but that way, he feels sorry. Another option would have a drug cup. <br /> <br /> So, # 1 rapists tighten and hide themselves in their clothes and tie Rosario's character to bed ... seriously, that's mad! But what happens next is more wonderful. First, talk to him and then "close" and reinforce an object. This is difficult to see as a rape scene number. This is not what this guy deserves or not, it's life. And, of course, that was the goal. Now "after the end" the rage raped and raped ... # 1 rape. Really, this should work like a revenge movie, it would be better if the same character of Rosario "revenge". Having a work-force worker is devoid of construction. <br /> <br /> This should not be fun or enjoyable, it's a tough time and it's an Art-house. But at the end of the 10-minute rape (I did not) scene, everything breaks it. Only about the Rosario character is the only one that happens. That brings me to the utmost despair. <br /> <br /> An irreversible comparison: "Irreversible" had a rape scene but continued the movie (although it was time to go back). Rosario finally looks at the camera and says something to overcome. First, it is too late, this should be seen after the initial rape. And second and most important, here's what Art-house should include. It is more interesting to see Rosario's character go through the second rape scene and see how he had to deal with it. Once again, he did not physically do it (see above) ... the broken character cut in the movie ... <br /> <br /> Good intentions (formerly Talia and Rosario worked), but most things are not delivered, do it They want (even if they can see what they mean, they must convince it, otherwise it does not work) ... without mentioning the large rape scenes ...
