Watching, staging, and editing sets is easy to find that this project does not have a proper budget. Bela Lugosi might want to get things that way. Young wives killed at the altar when they say "I do". The corpse was stolen by a renowned gardener Lorenz (Lugosi), and his eldest wife (Elizabeth Russell) had two young women's virgin gland injections forever-young ... forever beautiful. An exaggerated Cuban reporter (Luana Walters) realizes that the missing bride has a tall orchard with a rare orchid; Dr. Lorenz is a well-known orchestra. A horror movie is a typical storm that makes Lorenz the real estate visit a bit scary; above all, with a dwarf and no runner. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
