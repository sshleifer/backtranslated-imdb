Yes, talk about mischief. Rick Moranis "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" is the star of a terrific third in a fun and entertaining game. The concept is fundamentally the same as the first movie, but rather the adults instead of the small children and the indoor house must be explored instead of the garden. If you think that, think about it. The best movie is boring, with a shame that is worse. <br /> <br /> First of all, the continuity of the series has been completely cleaned. The only actor in the first movie is Rick Moranis. His wife has changed the actress, the actors that play the children have changed, those who live their lives have changed. They try to think they are the same, but the results are at least one of us. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it's the first story of the first, with some originality. Some of the jokers (hardly anyone) and the dangerous situations presented in the film are copied directly from the "Little Kids Break". <br /> <br /> The third problem, special effects. I am sure that this has been done in a smaller budget, but they are pathetic, than in the rest of the series. Certainly, we admire these small images that explore the huge area of ​​the home, but you will probably plunge into more time. <br /> <br /> The fourth problem, putting the action inside the house is just boring. Only a few things happen, and when they happen they are not exciting. The first movie was fun because the kids were in harmony with nature, herbs and their lives. In this case, adults (children who are quite bored) are dust, cockroaches and a cockroach trap. Disgusting <br /> <br /> I do not know why the idea of ​​releasing this infamous sequel of the infamous contest has already been conveyed to Disney directors, except for five minutes of something new. I warn you: let this waste litter left on the store shelves.
