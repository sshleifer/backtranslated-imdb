In theory, 'Director comments' should work. With talented Rob Bryden, Peter DeLane plays a former television director who tells the experiences of this camera. Among the alleged programs he has worked, "Bonanza", "Flambards", "The Duchess Of Duke Street" and "The Bounder." His comments are not very informative, because he has the habit of leaving the spot. <br /> <br /> But in practice, it sadly failed. It's a joke and the joke is not particularly fun. The scripts are completely missing, and Bryden does not convince him as an older man. Every time she sticks to the fun, she does it like a five-second, the most crazy laugh. DeLane instead of having fun, you want to shoot him. If old gentlemen make fun of you, then this is for you. <br /> <br /> It was not helpful for the shows to be suspended, with the exception of "Mr & Mrs" and "Crossroads", which were quite good. . To work the whistle, they must be horrible, such as 'Charlie's Angels', 'OTT', 'Telly Addicts', 'Neighbors' and 'New Faces'. <br /> <br /> The show was a great time, so fortunately, it protects us from the fears of future publications. Were it not ironic that the 'Comments of the Director' was somewhat the subject of their fraud?
