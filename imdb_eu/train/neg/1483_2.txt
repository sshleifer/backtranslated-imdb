This horror movie with comic horror gave me two great titles, since the famous porn star stars are here. A group of tourists traveling on vacation in Ireland in Ireland is fighting against a boyfriend of cannibalism, something about the other, and on the plot, approximately, EYES ANDS WRG TURN RENTAL ABUSE. The only problem is that if there is not a single mutant, it's not all that impressive. About five years ago, like the bad mom mom of this movie. They help make boring, but stupid deaths, but the dream of the film is a very sharp night and it's a boring belief. The end is predictable and death is done. It's no coincidence.
