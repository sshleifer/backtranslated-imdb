Did I watch this on the TV the other night ?? or, in other words, I approached the commercial shows repeatedly to another channel, I could not see it anymore. It was bad Really, very bad. It's not "so bad it's good" just flat out bad. How was it financed? Who thought he was a good idea? They told me that a friend of mine could hear it and it was not bad enough for a boy, but I think what they meant was "save yourself and run away from @ # $%." I bet what the other party gave it. Reasoning, it was difficult to act out of overly American judges. Shooting was dullllllllll. The actions were bad and sharp. The conversation was overdue. The worst thing left was the ship. Interislander ferries is a real-life boat that is not good at the movie. Just as I try not to succeed as a newly-beloved Tinsel-inspired body-wrap around the portraits, I do not like them, they can change the script to explain or even celebrate the dizziness. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Do not watch the movie, or even joke.
