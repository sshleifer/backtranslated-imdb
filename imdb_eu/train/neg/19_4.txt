I am a fan of Arnold Vosloo. Eventually, being the protagonist of a recent movie, I was not only happy but also happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I took a film appreciation at the university and I did not like being told that the only thing that told me was that the movie was in an abandoned town and there was no back traffic or appearance. <br /> <br /> I have to remember that something is desirable, but Arnold is an excellent actor. You need to draw it instead of correcting it and cast the assistant to let something you like. <br /> <br /> I love Arnold Vosloo and made the movie visible. Otherwise, I wrote it as another wrong movie. <br /> <br /> The rapes were not necessary, but eventually the actors were quite good. But the effects of the shooter were pretty bad. There are some errors in the movie (continuity), but they can not be seen given the low quality of the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I enjoyed the movie because Arnold Vosloo was there. <br /> <br /> Jackie
