I just rented this one today ... I heard good reviews before. WOW !! This film is a steamy stack! Does anyone know the address of the director, can I return my five dollars ???? In the end, someone hit "Stop-loss" the worst "worst ever in the Iraqi War". To be fair, I do not think, however, that there are good Iraq war films, but it was really bad. <br /> <br /> I will not include any technical accuracy, a hundred reviews of all GWOT details. Although the director wanted to consult the smallest E-nothing about technical work, the movie could be realistic ... maybe. I believe the writer must give credit to the waste of a film. Of course, the plot on this movie emptied the vivid imaginations that bounded reality. I asked myself, what was the point of that movie? Was there a message? Really, even ..... WTF ????? <br /> <br /> Really happy comments all really. This movie is difficult to see with the veterinarian, due to the exact precision, but also, if it plunges the plot, the characters are superficial (at least) and at least in practice they are inadequate. It is ironic, I assume, that this movie is supposed to be about anti-explosion management, because it is the main bomb this year.
