Very dull, obvious and bored exorcist rip-off Doberman with a red eye - that's the size of special effects made-for-tv cheapie. Richard Crenna is cheered up as chewing gum. Only 70's dresses and music are added to torture. You should stay as fast as "The Body Abandoned" or "Blue Hand". It's almost useless. MooCow says, what a stinky dog! : = 8p
