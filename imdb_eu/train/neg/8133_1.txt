The movie is as funny as the sun looks. Sheriff Pataki is totally delayed, so she does not love anything better, she puts on her fat background, making a ring of her noisy cigarette ring and while her lollipop plays like a zombie version. Nicholas Cage absorbs "Blood". It really looked like Fruit Fruit Punch. <br /> <br /> I thought that all the graphics were terrifying. This movie is a waste of time, it was a horrific end, schematic schemes, and scenes were awful. What else will I tell the audience? My advice will get you to shoot rage if you've already watched the movie. This movie will give you a foam to keep your hands up to date.
