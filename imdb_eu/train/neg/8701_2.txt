Probably this is "the worst-case movie movie you want" to be the worst thing to accept the dinosaur genre. The film is predictable, you can prepare dinner, go to the phone, or whatever and when you come back, you will know exactly what happened. The special effects were so bad that we thought Lego bricks were used and that "super fast" dinosaurs were so beloved that the pet dog looked like a super predator. The performance is boiled. They try so hard, but not enough characters behind them to enter into characters and scientists ... Yes, we know well what will happen to the glasses blouse. This stereotyped film was created for this type of film. If you want to see this movie, I suggest that you are not a cast and a crew that has a great mood. And if you really are aware of the dinosaurs and everything you know about them, do not watch them, you can break the screen - the events are far away.
