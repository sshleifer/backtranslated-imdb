I bought this movie on Blu-Ray because it offered music and music. I've been a fan of a similar movie ... Baraka. The film is the style of Baraka afterwards, with wide angles, very similar shots with camera, for a long time to go through. Some scenes were also the same (traffic traffic). While Barak told a great story, nature, mankind's environments, spirituality and horror of the world, in a fascinating fashion and music, shot this movie from one shot to the movie, after that, a mid-score score. ... POOF, it's over! I think there was a mistake! World history The film is half Egypt and the landscape (it looks like Arizona, but I did not see it bothered). Seriously people, this is horrible, if you need to rent it, but do not buy it. Filmmakers should have their embarrassment when doing so.
