Here is where I read all the reviews of this piece of cinematic garbage, and I needed at least 2 pages to make it unlikely that this unexpected unknown monster was not another humor of the 70's or any other mood! This is not the least comedy comic * that I will ever do when I've ever seen it. Half of the sketches were already done by Monty Python and Woody Allen (and much better) ... Even if a nice 90-second animated piece would have been a highlight of this film, Do not get near that 75-minute wastes without head and guided. The main comedy? Only the seminal world means truly semen. Scatological humor Scat ES feces really only in one world. Pioneers joke? If we mean that, it's a comedy-making manual. Tits and bums and odd castor. Nice ... at least you're a handsome boy at least free and do not know that Playboy is there. Give a break in the early 70's? In no case. At least ten years ago he returned a comedy sketch. It's just a way of forgiving silent film that you can do. Retro Barely Sketches of poorly perverted clowns of children may be at the forefront in some circles (and it can be really fun), but it is very sad. What was it for all 75 minutes? Fast belief, maybe, they kept the final tournament fun. I gave it to the movie 1 because there was no lower score ... and I can not recommend insomnia or coma to patients ... or blockers ... perhaps their jaws will be open credibly.
