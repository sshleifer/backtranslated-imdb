This is one of those films that was seated only once more. Charlotte Henry is well, indeed, the actors were right. The problem was script, dialogue, direction, editing, sets and special effects. Yes, it was in 1933, but really crisp. Part of the problem is the actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant were not known (regretted that their faces were not admitted). The movie was bound together without cohesion. The spirit, humor and continuity of Lewis Carrols are greatly lacking. What a pity! It's a great book. I'd recommend Disney's 1951 version.
