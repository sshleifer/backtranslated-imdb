A few months ago I saw the movie in the town that appeared in Greendal, that is, I saw the only reason. Another citizen there was sending me an email, because the announcement that he had repeated was the first time the deal was sold out and the people turned away. His editorial summary in his commentary is good: <br /> <br /> "Yuk." <br /> <br /> You're either Neil Young or you're next to "Greendale". You know this one real name), skip this movie. Especially the journey of the ego filmmaker. There is no spectacular plot, music is only in agreement, and too many lyrics are incomprehensible, since it is not possible to follow the small plots. <br /> <br /> I do not have to enter a spoiler warning because there are no strangers. <br /> <br /> This would give 1.5 / 10 but the recreation area for the movie that has become a movie. It was not worth $ 6. I rented a video camera and guided myself around "Greendale" and made myself a better movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to see good * unsafe environments, rent Koyaanisqatsi.
