I will not spend time or energy on this comment. I want to add that all the comments were very positive, because people did not know that I felt that no one was so exciting, indeed, intellectually, trying to create a fascinating philosophy of film science. Some scenes seemed promising, they played spectacular aspects, but they could not keep the rest. I was sorry for the first time I was surprised, with semi-philosophical conversations with teens. <br /> <br /> What a mere hope to raise the Dutch cinema to new heights. I would rather see Jesus being Palestijn, with the thoughts and the humor, questioning the realities of life and of ourselves. <br /> <br /> Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard. or Tarkovsky and he will never appear.
