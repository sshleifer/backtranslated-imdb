Being an independent filmmaker and being an enthusiast of Edward D. Wood Jr., I bought this documentary, believing that Ed Wood was truly fashionable and fashionable. <br /> <br /> I got something intrinsic, conflicting and contradictory that includes bogus has-beens with no autocouple. <br /> <br /> Does Ed Wood Jr remember people, do they really remember the second cousin of the boy, with a tape band that knew someone who was in the nine space of the Plan? <br /> <br /> It seems that the Ed Ed interest in the same minute is renewed, people from "Wood" work! When someone else really does not want someone, he'll give him some great whirlwinds for someone. After 50 years, I would suggest that many of these people would not have been forced to get $ 75. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ed Wood was an enterprising creative creator. In fact, that was all that lived. You can laugh at Ed movies, but somehow you say that you're laughing and not with her. <br /> <br /> But I digress ... Return to the right film. If you expect a movie about Edward D. Wood Jr., you will not get it here. If you want a movie about old and bitter actors, this is a movie for you!
