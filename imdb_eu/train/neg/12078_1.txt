I saw this movie three times literally. What is given is Shakespeare, which makes some thoughts interested or not. But this movie goes far beyond the length of soliloquies and what is not, limiting much negligence on a Shakespeare-based story. <br /> <br /> With regard to this production, the character is completely flat. While the character interacts, it is difficult to distinguish who is the line. As I give it, I think that this movie has doubled in English. Certainly, they could get voice actors to add a little more to the classical and literary plays. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult for this film to be larger than 1, but perhaps based on prejudices. Maybe it seemed like age and budget. However, it is completely painful and boring. If you emphasize in Hamlet, do it for yourself and read the book again. 1/10
