Ok, so I got bored and I saw it all the way. <br /> <br /> This film is gentle, harmless and few. The story is so awkward in the opening titles of the teeth. Two 'traumatized' children learned the fairy tale that left the "fairy tale of God" in a traumatized manner. He uses Irish "liar", such as the hope that he has never seen in real stereotypical truth. One day, it's aimed at children that turn off after the essay "OIRISH" accent. Finally why they pump them.
