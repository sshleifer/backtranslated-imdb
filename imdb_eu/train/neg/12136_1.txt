I watched this movie on t.v. This afternoon, and I can not see how anyone can sit by the trash. It's not fun and it takes your IQ. down a few I know this movie is for kids, but that does not mean that writers should get their minds. I'm betting on a writer sitting around a large wooden table and figured out a) The word "Pedriza" is a great laugh. b) A four-foot-high child can immobilize ten feet of basketball. c) Children will always fight their kidnapped gunfire, because the bomber will not fall for anything and d) In 3 months of training, you must defeat the so-called "ninjas" with the sword. The good thing you can say about this movie is the "gang" that has the most feared crowd in the world. Maybe MST3K men can use this movie for a laugh. Do not worry about making a movie with this excuse for excuse.
