This movie is very ridiculous. I love horror movies, but I have never seen the worst. I'm a Gore fan, but most of the death of this movie is not shown. They show us dead bodies, and the death scenes that really show this movie are awful. Graphics are seemingly fake. The actors are awful too. There is no real emotion. I did not lose time looking at this movie, but I had to add the real footage that was beaten to all animals at the beginning. I can verify this -10, I would. F * ck this film. It's wrong. <br /> <br /> Do not ignore it.
