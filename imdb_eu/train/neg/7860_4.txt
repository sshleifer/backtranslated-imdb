When Martin Weisz directed the solid "Rohtenburg", he will take another relief with "The Hills Have Eyes 2" with Wes Craven. The legendary legend of the original, an incredible tale and a dog with hat, will be permanently deleted by means of this refined technique (only by name). A series of National Guards (and women) are sent in the field of desert investigation, surrounded by mutant hills. Weekend soldiers are picked up one by one. That's it. There are some hardcore violence and a violent scene of violence, but much less excited. The "heroes" of the movie are a series of topical and mutant. Craven's "family" is an original, especially Brian Thompson's "Cobra", similar to Stan Winston's creatures with "Wrong Turn" stars. Most of the action is done in caves, "Descent" and Sam McCurdy is shooting well. The awesome party is Wes and Jonathan Craven, a nice mutant, Hooper's cave, like Hooper's "Chainsaw" original. Weisz will condemn him to this dreadful debacle, but he does not blame him for doing so, to keep his suspense and get him out of a refreshing situation. Unfortunately, it's not a fan.
