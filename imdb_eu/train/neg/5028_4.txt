Nowadays, with the great success of the Godzilla series, along with the success of any movie event, it would inevitably be a huge crowd to win money to win the great lizard. Together with Godzilla, the constant popularity of the kaiju (giant monster) genre appeared. After a lot of success; they got a few. One of the few who did not win was Gamera, who was able to breathe and flee fire and flee from the carpets. But unlike Godzilla, all the children of Gamera were marketed to all children, later in danger of their children fighting with monster, so that Gamera became very popular among kiddy. Unfortunately, it is the only leading audience in the Gamera series. The new Gamera film directed by Shusuke Kaneko is a revolutionary and wonderful monster movie. The original series, including the original, is nothing special. <br /> <br /> The first Gamera movie, called "The Giant Monster Gamera". "It was clear that Godzilla wanted it, although it was produced during a film-colored movie, it was shot in black and white. Why? Godzilla's first movie was imitating the 1950s, and the gamers attack Tokyo too, because Godzilla attacked Tokyo for the first time. I am familiar with the version version of the American version, where the scenes were cut and the American actors added the footage (by chance, did it happen with the first Godzilla movie?), now I can add or remove the movie, but "Gamma Invincible" is not just like a tufa boring just like the turtle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> "Gammera Invincible" is a very routine movie, the characters come from links to science fiction standards, the story is inane, the monster has no real reason to attack civilization, it is a hopeful act, etc. Godzilla seriously separates The only thing he has to do is to finish the movie, but this is also a detractor, in the end the Gamera rampage is a totally fake and ridiculous plan. Now, the rest of the films and other entries in this genre match this description, but this is a bustling monster movie. <br /> <br /> And Shusuke Kan later turned Gamera into an interesting monster with his trilogy. In the 1990s, Gamera was not an attractive screen appeal. It was not terrifying or sympathetic. It's like a small one, it shakes it at every step and hits the miniature sets. As usual, everyone wants to destroy the Gamera (although Yoshio Uchida's credit is excluded, despite being a "central role", Gamera is considered a turtle. <br /> <br /> Most of the genres of "Gammera the Invincible" are a simple criticism and this is an extra pressure. In the company of many Godzilla imitators, this Gamera movie is not a particularly suitable entry. And according to the experience of my cinema, the rest of the series is boring or worse. Like Godzilla, Gamera will be colored and will continue to fight monsters. And like Godzilla, every movie would get cheaper and cheaper until the series revives and worsens. <br /> <br /> It's funny. Normally, I suggest sticking to the originals and I recommend sending remakes. In the case of Gamera, my judgment is the opposite. I noticed Shusuke Kan's 1990 1990 Gamera trilogy, but I did not encourage anyone to overcome the original series. The new films are inspiring, good, exciting and, above all, fun. The original series is a long spout stream.
