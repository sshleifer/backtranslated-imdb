"I only saw this video last night and I do not think that it will happen to me about the actors involved, because this movie stuck at the back of my head." The statement is thought to be a good thing or a bad thing. Every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore, I think it's called "A Good Good Men." Now, whenever I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson, I will think of "Tinseltown", which is a very bad thing. <br /> <br /> I received this from thinking that I could think of something smart or at least for me. I cried out and with Arye Gross and the aforementioned Swanson and Perlman, I thought at least it was not going to be bad. It could be said that what was happening in Wheeling (in detail) was a movie budget, but maybe each dollar was used to make a good movie. USEFUL. <br /> <br /> This movie does not make any sense of funny or funny words. It is there, and it has a slow 84 minutes. <br /> <br /> Characters are thin paper. You are in charge of the ENCOURAGES of the characters, and since two lead writers are struggling, it is a dream that they are fighting for two writers, you need to know the dream they wrote. Well, both REAL writers know all their screen versions, and so the viewers represent it. They do not even think about the development of the characters, unless they try to re-link the story "Gilligan's Island". Plot does not have original They live in a boy's storage center, one of them saves a bed and lives another twenty people. The rest of the story is huge and stupid. Have you seen the "National Lampoon's Deadly Sins"? A second story is about a TV writer who can not find a good story for a TV movie. Now it will replace the writer of television with a screenwriter, half-way to the abusive actors Mantanza Mantegna, and take this comedy and film. <br /> <br /> The actors try. Kristy Swanson is a movie about 10 minutes and still gives the best performance of the movie. He's still hot, but he'll help make a movie STAR really steadily for CAMEOS instead. For the rest, I have not guessed that the actor was guilty of BAD material <br /> <br /> Seeing Joan Lampoon's national movie, but do not get away from this movie.
