Comedy with a stunning entertainment, with music sessions, creates a fast pace that performs procedures at rough pace, through a maze of humorous and chiller complications. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosie and Peter Lorre are wicked. The script has panels with mysterious film standards, secret passages, thunder and lightning and poison darts. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre feature high-speed dance and melodramas. Kay Kyser and his team offered great entertainment to the people who lived in the 1940s, trying to forget the fears of World War II.
