The last time I reacted to Justin Timberlake's "Edison", I do not remember it as a final emotion. I wanted to scream the severity I had so emotional, to destroy the screen, to accept promising cry of nihilism. Timberlake is terribly confusing; In fact, losing it with Andy Dick is the role of "Patton" or Nathan Lane. But this is hardly that. <br /> <br /> Timberlake is just a bad actor and it would be equally horrible for any role. I had trouble with Ben Affleck's active talent, but Timberlake gives Affleck a look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench. His emblematic metrosexual (read bite), the look and feel of the boy and the screen that causes the compassion of the screen without any mercy on the screen, poems and emotions of the "25 clicks of 25 actors for actors" does not matter and does not play to buy a role as amateur-crucifix-justice journalist. Simply it will not fly. <br /> <br /> However, Timberlake alone is not the fault of his failure. David J. Burke is not only basically (basically) placed in the lead, but Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes, and (I'm surprising) ignores LL Cool J's images, which are almost physically suffering It seems to me that a part of this cast is seen in interaction with Timberlake. <br /> <br /> Of course it is in front of them: when one of these actors interacts with Justin, it feels like a double relief. . Kindly, if you like. Freeman and Spacey can have a 10-minute screen time together, but this ten minute episode is amazing in the face of our so-called "heroes". Dylan McDermott also has fresh air. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> But just enough with Timberlake's bashing, the words are not enough in this case to make a trick. "Edison" corruption is a very telling story. Plots are just nonsense from one to the other. But, nevertheless, I admire the motivation, that is, I like movies like "Serpico" or "Donnie Brasco" or "Chinatown". Do not misunderstand: "Edison" is not even in these films, but I do not think it is unbelievable to admire the reason for the existence that I extend, perhaps just to sit inside. <br /> <br /> Writing itself and in itself has a bad and amazing writing. Yes, it has good changes, but it seems that Piper Peraboren (here is a lost) and Timberlake dialogue seems to have risen directly from Dawson's Creek. With your usual remote conversational reality, let's not let your impression-audience get well-articulated (and fail). This interview, mindful, the great music has bad points in the wrong moment - sometimes "Edison" feels that it wants to become a music video, where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through the play, but, indeed, by the wrongly selected music. and the variant speed of the film (slow reading). <br /> <br /> Thinking about "Edison" is a curiosity. Surely he has managed to kill a cast, but Timberlake's performances just do not work. As in most of the movie art, if one thing is turned off, it feels the whole thing. Managers have to make hard choices. David J. Burke Missing Mark Some scenes perform well among themselves, but in general, it does not seem that the puzzles are included as part of puzzle pieces of different images. To start, it's not an exciting puzzle in particular.
