In poor Bobby "pineapple sauce" Flay and Mario Batali brought down. <br /> <br /> Flay is the worst. There was no doubt that there was a trick, I think that other American chefs would have come to the table. This kind of dish that comes with this couple ... does not reflect on the original Iron Chef Series. I do not think Batali is going to go to cooking, really. There are many chefs in America, but I do not know why they do not appear in Food Network. <br /> <br /> Additionally, having more regional components would also be helpful, and may be managed by colleagues. pressure I like Alton Brown, but it's a bad and curious role.
