Really, damned, MooCow admits the truth is wrong: the 70's parody is like cheap and bad. The vast horde of murderers is a very good idea of ​​the US destroyers, and yet, clearly, Moovie makes some decent doubles, especially when they are scared to escape from fake big tomatoes. This movie, along with The Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the first attempts to become so popular in the 80s and 90s, especially Airplane! This, like moost spoofs, is pretty bad. Many mock trials fail and there will be a lot of pain. However, thanks to the bad tomato hordes, the song "Pubertad Love Love" and a massive accident on the helicopter, Attack of the Tomatoes offers some good things, even if it's wrong. There are many things with this film ... and, therefore, reasonably, it is difficult to explain it. Even enough people would also like Tomato to come up with a two-way movie moore and cartoon series! The parts of time that are far from tomatoes are quite dull. In the 70s, I wear clothes! ; = 8) This tomato is sharp and cursive, but it's worth it twice or twice; MooCow can take a pizza and take Tomato. : ??
