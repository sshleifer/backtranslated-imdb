Pam Grier is like Coffy. He is a nurse seeking revenge, about drug traffickers trapped in his worst sister sister. As a Blaxploitation film in the 70s, racist boys can only see desserts. <br /> <br /> The scores of those films made in the 70's were really scary in the black and white audience. This is mainly due to the hostility of the race of these films and the degrading stereotypes. Especially the female characters. <br /> <br /> There are common threads among coffy and other types of movies, such as violence, corrupt police, auto-escapes, barefoot, and gorgeous women. Not to mention the ghettos of the drug dealers, the neighbors, mafias and other criminals. <br /> <br /> <br /> Pam Grier, the undisputed heroine of the 70s Blaxploitation heroes. It was excellent, just as hard and beautiful as nails. Like other films, the other characters in Coffy are out. In fact, Pam's screen is so charismatic that these types of films are not visible, as the main character. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, it is better to watch other movies, such as Foxy Brown, or perhaps Friday Foster. These films are much less than Coffy. The same character of Coffy's Pam is also degraded to catch bad. Pam's characters from other Blaxploitation films, as Coffy did, did not go down to get revenge. <br /> <br /> I would say, see only Coffy, if you can not see one of Pam Grier's other movies. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. She only makes Coffy visible as the actor of Pam.
