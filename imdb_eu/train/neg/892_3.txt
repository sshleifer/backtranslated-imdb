(In this review I will explain the point where the spoil starts). My dissatisfaction breaks down: 30% tone deafness, writing 70%. <br /> <br /> 30%: I agree with the first synopsis of the comment on the sphere of stories and the lack of character diversity. I was surprised at how this film would unhinder the real NYC and the Gossip Girl (only someone who likes somebody likes Gossip) who presents so tight relationships. Girl). Some minor characters are written in stories, but they are set according to obligations, while under the film we can see so clear a gear so it can be "varied", but while trying to fall short. <br /> <br /> 70% why everything is missing. All characters, whites and some tokens of minority, are dimensional and are cardboard cuts for people's concepts. Worse, there is a mutual interaction on the cartoon that appears in the movie, "gag", as I would say something that I say: we get the basic thoughts, then we want to be nonsensical. twist But we also said that we have interrupted the cynicism at one point "Ok, that was a surprise" ... stories are still not interesting because they are superficial. When you draw stories, if you only exclude their existence from the non-expectation of the end, you are writing jokes. <br /> <br /> The bottom mirrors ... <br /> <br /> The story tries to tell you, above all, romantic stories. Okay But the love is amazing, deep, sometimes complex. These "romantic" stories share a single girl and a boy's position and look at each other. Words are exchanged, thoughts are made through voicemail, but only audiences need to be attracted to one another only to communicate. <br /> <br /> It does not mean that there is no seduction (in the broad sense). There is no tension, neither confrontation nor communion, the will of two different people, in order to reconcile their existence with one another. The only story that depicts a "seduction" on the surface is shocked by the surprising (Ethan Hawke) girl who overcomes the girl that hits her unexpectedly. Of course, the words that they receive are heard as interesting, and we're very happy as if we were next to them, but there is nothing behind the story "A B" for this substance. So it spreads, even if a postcard is spreading something similar, with all the other stories: A B - This is what happens in Manhattan's "set on". By the way, the only thing we see is Brooklyn's draft in Coney Island; Only Queens is the route of a train that has been taken by a character who travels to the West Village. <br /> <br /> It's easy to choose movies that are easy to play, race, sex, sexual orientation and common stereotypes. that way. _New York, I Love You_, however, is worthy of a more rigorous study of its qualifications. We expect real New York and real New Yorkers, but instead we present the selected parts of a demographic, OC characters, and others seem to be paying attention. diversity If you look at these characters, the falsification is very different from the notion of diversity and films that are not insolent. <br /> <br /> For example, the story is that the Latin man with the white girl in the park, which is mistaken as a male manny (male nanny), is a father. The last scene of this part was useless from the point of view of construction (it would be much more interesting if the mother and boyfriend / father-in-law when the little girl goes away when she is away). We will learn the scene where the girl's father is Latin, and we must also inform her that she is a sex-dancer. What, father can not a guy from South America? Now, obviously, do you expect that the viewer is prepared to accept having a middle and upper class girl with a white girl? Do not we have any such kind of naive? Unlike a Mexican building worker, it would appear as if it were not obvious. <br /> <br /> It's not a place where my movie should disappear. However, in all the unmanageable configuration and draft rotations, the direction taken is screaming at the status quo, security calls. All these stories could be more interesting, although the characters have to maintain the one-dimensional nature of the characters, at least from standard and obvious stereotypes. The Asian girl who lives in the Chinese Chinatown is a good old man? How would she look for white college children in Asia? Again, I do not say that the whole conviction should change. That's just it. damned. story premise It's so bad, so New York would like to know why they do not know why. Reading a real way to improve the movie should be a script that deserves. <br /> <br /> I accept a nice soundtrack, a good movie career (although it was a rhythm, well, dredge), and the scene often feels overall. The movie was seated well, and I would not be able to avoid it. However, the oldest singer-songwriter says (paraphrasing) the most significant tributes that are not superficial "This is what I love in New York: everybody from another place." Well, you should not know that.
