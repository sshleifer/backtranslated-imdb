This movie was very bad, but I could not sit through it without doing something else. There were no plots and no points. I was very bored and a stand to make a movie about a comedian, I can not remember a joke or a fun line that deserves a description. Politicians who have no technical charm without a technical charisma have not been so entertaining. <br /> <br /> So how was that done? Is there no film quality control? Watching girls in bikinis was the only distraction between the great experience. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine Adam Sandler appeared in good comedy and could survive as he appeared. It was not so funny in this movie, so the script proves to be essential in the comedy.
