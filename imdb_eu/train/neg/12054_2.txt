"What happens when a man with a homeless gives you 100,000 dollars?" If that was a question, it would, of course, be morally lost, what would happen. "Fortune reversal creators" try to get the roots of their voyeurists while hiding their own plays, dressed as a responsible social experiment. <br /> <br /> Pasadena take Ted homeless and give her 100,000 dollars to see if she would have her life seen. Then, with only a few guidance and counsels, he leaves the way to being happy. <br /> <br /> What do they mean? "Can you not buy money happily?" "Do not have homeless homeless, are they worth it?" Or, in what way, "Lift up - it's fun to watch it fall from a higher altitude." He took a man who was not lost, saw something he was losing, and then he saw that he had drained everything.
