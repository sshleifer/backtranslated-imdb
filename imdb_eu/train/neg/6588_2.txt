The most serious problems with this movie are: 1) The clusters are abundant. Seriously, the awful "twists" are everywhere. 2) The narrative jumps over time, if it were good, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3) This lips does not develop so much as statically, or if they change completely without good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Great: HORRIBLE. Nearly every person. <br /> <br /> Some of the best points in the movie are: 1) The director is very good. <br /> <br /> As I can see, this movie would be two types of people: a) It attracts people who can be seated in a 90 minute trip. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I like Hollywood dreck, clich√©s and excessive use, but I only saw Korean ... "Many good Korean films There, there, why waste time with your garbage?
