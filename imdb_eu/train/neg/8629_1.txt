My dear Richard, I know we've loved you with Tim Allen at Hobekuntza Etxea. But, seriously, do you not have the bad following sessions in Air Bud? It is possible that Tim can do a little bit of work or become a personal assistant. I know that's ironic, but the salary benefits are much more enriching. <br /> <br /> Everyone will see you around Tim and immediately think about "Tool Time". You would also often reward with Bob Vila. Instead, you'll appear for 10 minutes with a Golden Retriever and smiling. I know there was not a lot of script, but you could add it. I mean it. Tim is due. <br /> <br /> But, seriously, this movie does nothing to Air Bud. On the contrary, false false dogs are easier than watching dogs sporting. The original was better. And you, Mr. Richard Karn, know more than anyone. <br /> <br /> This is the "F" movie.
