I sat down through this turkey, because I did not see it, and thought it was a possible premise. Hurricane was shining until sequences. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to get windows out of the house, but the back trees are quite straight and they do not move the leaf! In fact, when the characters move outside the house, bright sunlight can be seen illuminating on the trees. At that time, the importance of filmmakers flourished faster in the film. Very badly Hurricanes do not like this, it would surely help our homeowners insurance rates in Sunshine State.
