I should know the main character I had with Casper Van Diem. The words could not be described, nor was it a film that made them equally correct. Please let him describe you: horrible acting, horrible conversation, crisp situations, and through which you feel the beliefs and propensity of the Trinity Broadcasting Network. A Hollywood movie is trying to be entertaining and having a deep religious message. Empty message failed. It's been clear that the worst movie I have ever seen.
