The worst comedy Bob Hope ever (including some heavy competition). Hope, on a sailor's island, cries out to have her grandmother in the bathroom, with her geisha "with a girl who runs the boat." Undoubtedly, this Hope-hackery was guided by the cliff, with Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida, and still lacks fun and excitement. Where is Bing Crosby, when do you really need it?
