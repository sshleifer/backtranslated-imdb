I do not like Sean Penn's lead, and this first work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The film does not have the basis, the color is restrictive, the authoritarian tweeness, honestly penning Penn Penn's work, his latest work more than before. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn. It seems that many products, basically insignificant, are generated, which are somehow called sincerity, but eventually, wrestling games, and moralists, almost as if the Hallmark card has developed a Hell Angels greetings line, and Deliverance, a beautiful movie, makes me stretch. The acting of Viggo Mortensen is much more credible than the Eastern Promises with Cronenberg, rather than a ridiculous thing, and that's why. The films are absurd, and it seems to be an exercise, different techniques, more than one story. The charge for Charles Brons, however, proves who can do it. I wanted more character from Sandy Dennis. It's powerful from 10 to 10 for this Indian Runner crap.
