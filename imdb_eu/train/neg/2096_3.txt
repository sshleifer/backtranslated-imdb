In the first six seasons of BSG and I was expecting that BSG Razor only appeared to be a fan, he would return the franchise on his original days. I usually do not have a problem in science fiction, especially the dialogue box, in the face of a visual bonanza of special effects. If the script is closely related to the original idea of ​​good actors, CGI can create a profound film that has spent money. This precaution does not cover those requirements. The world of virtual reality created by teenagers was ridiculous and disbelief. This scene has only been put to release the grade. They are not afraid of teenage girls full of sexual reality and violence and heavy music. They are part of the intellectual depth of their teenagers and their part or the political or religious passion or reason, such as the creation of futuristic software or the suicidal bombardment. These children are not on this planet. The film plays as opera soap in just 10 minutes. The scene of Eric Stolz, giving his cyborg a careful awareness of the students' firmware version, was fun if it was not entertaining. But the old concept was much better portrayed and much more believable with the original classic "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprice unveils the only interesting idea of ​​an Hollywood horror movie. No wonder there! In general, this film was bland and non-original and cheap, using Caprica's recycled CGI using BSG. I see that this soap silk will be released on the Sci-Fi channel. Of course, unless I'm suffering from bad insomnia, this show would be cured. Zzzzzzzz
