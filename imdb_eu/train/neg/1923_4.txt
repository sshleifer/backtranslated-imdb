The fact that Dr. Seox does not market the Christmas factory should be one of the most successful holiday season. The general meaning of adaptation of Ron Howard Grinch is the result of accidents born to childhoodhood in Gabon and Whos are trapped in seasonal materialism by Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen plays very well). This movie brings Seussen's passionate and aseptic essay, but the end result is a movie that ends up with the emotional stroke of Chuck Jones's animated version. Jim Carrey stands out for his performance as a Grinch devil, but if dialogue, group membership or strange story are included in the initial plot, there is no conviction that a bitter sensation is a beneficial heart. There are wonderful images and make-up is amazing, but here are some or more elements beyond technical triumphs. <br /> <br /> The successor? <br /> <br /> Soul? <br> /> <br /> Or maybe Jones made the initial adaptation of Howard's film that is missing a 25-minute cartoon that lasts for three hours. Howard, Carey and the crew are all very capable and talented, but it seems like a winning combination, the final product is very weak. If you need to see a feature-length version, rent a video with the animated version of Jones, and you'll see how much brighter and brighter is always better. I give five-cans of Who-Hash to this film.
