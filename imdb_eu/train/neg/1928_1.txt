How to make Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy, I've never seen the reason for a remake. Instead of mentioning a remake of human beings, the cartoon was perfect enough, what is the purpose of this film? But it seemed strange to be also Jim Carrey Grinch. I mean an excellent comedy actor, but as a Grinch? It did not make sense to me. His screening was a bit higher and there was a longing for a moment. Add some interviews to the baby and it was not pleasant. The story of Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who ended and it was not necessary. Actually, they just destroy the story and the time. <br /> <br /> Everyone in Whoville is preparing for their best Christmas season. Everything goes perfectly. But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about Grinch who lives above them, and does not get as good as Christmas among others. That same year he throws and decides that Christmas does not want to be this year and, in fact, he should steal all Christmas, to explain who the Christmas version is. But he soon realizes that Christmas may know that it is a little bit more than the version of the recovered version. It was not necessary for the Grinch thief to be in need of Christmas, and he was a little up. I really recommend that you stick with the cartoon, at least in my opinion that it is alarming version. The whole film has been made and presented a bit, how to stir Grinch Christmas! Jim Carry was a cartoon that was more than the hero of the show. But at least this version offers you the version of Boris Karloff Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
