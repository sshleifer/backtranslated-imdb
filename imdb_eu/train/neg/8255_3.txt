At least it does not comply with violent or fluff. It's not a very good idea or a good story. This story has some potential but the director seems to have lost the green space. The story is imbalanced and <br /> <br /> it starts with curious guidelines, without concluding. I also do not think the director has spent a lot of time in a golf club. Some images are absurd. It's not very attractive.
