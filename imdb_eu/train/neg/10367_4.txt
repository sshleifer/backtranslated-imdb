This film was poorly written, poorly interpreted and very predictable. It was a small budget and I understand why it has never been released and it was going straight to the video. It was not the funniest one, it was just a disaster and I could get 1-1 / 2 hours! The colors were horrible, and as a result, with the plots so large they would drive the truck through them. <br /> <br /> The plot itself concealed doing things that the young woman could not physically do ... what a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. Any movie is almost everything better than this. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
