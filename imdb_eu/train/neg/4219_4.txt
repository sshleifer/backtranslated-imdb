It's an amateur movie filmed on the video, it's not an "electrifying drama," because the DVD liner notes are proud of it. I have seen much better things for college students. Most of the story goes to every taxi in Jakarta. This movie can be done through a single video camera, but there are several sections where two cameras were used and later bounced the content. The edition is very rough. The last edition has probably been done with two cameras, translated by the content and editor that goes back and forth. Maybe they were edited in a taxi? The English subtitles wrote someone who did not know English, for example, "Where are you going now?" The quality of production is generous to say that Blair is close to Witch. If you're still not afraid, this movie was an ambitious and creative effort, with lots of cool and entertaining images throughout Jakarta.
