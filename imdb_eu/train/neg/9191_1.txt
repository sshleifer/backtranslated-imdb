Well, I had to sit in the computer and I wrote a review immediately after seeing that well. Why? I have to let everyone know that movie. It's terribly bad. To make me feel very wrong, I will offer this little piece of the movie. People who cross scenes in Mayhem usually shoot or oppress zombies interchang the scenes of the video game. Yes, you have heard me well. This movie is horrible. In fact, I think that at this time theaters will cost ten dollars. And how old is my corn full of corn? There is no talk, and the movie basically has nothing to offer, an occasional shot and really dying. I'm really disappointed, I've seen that. I agree. It's so bad, I can not find words. RATE: ZERO away.
