That's the only thing that can be said about this movie. Cleveland is a star, I've been there and I've never seen the city look good. Beautiful river and urban landscapes. <br /> <br /> This movie progresses at such a pace, because it does not overlook the world's real importance. People surround and shoot the gun without any consequences. For example, Rob Lower's shot at the character's home. Both cars have been stolen and yet the police will not appear much later in the film. The murder on rent is never so impossible. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has written this movie must receive the final bullet for the movies. Many of the actors in this movie are much better than that. I checked the date of the film to ensure that what was not written in the writers' strikes, but that was not the case. This movie is currently turning to the universal HD channel - If you want to download more than Lowe, there is no reason to see it.
