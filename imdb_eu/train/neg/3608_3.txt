I have a nice collection of movies, and this has been added to it. Number 274 exactly <br /> <br /> I hit the beginning of the title. Splatter University. I thought it would be a great horror movie. I never went wrong. Do not be miserable, I have never seen the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could be a lot better. I love all the movies, but this was a laugh, then it was scary. <br /> <br /> Poor quality audio, bad performance and some of the poorly-planned areas are some of the areas that can be improved. 3 out of 10 stars <br /> <br /> It's easy to make fun of laughing. If you are looking for one of these films you want to make, this is it!
