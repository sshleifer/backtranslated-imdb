I saw this because my whim was available and I heard the Thumb movies fun. This was not. Most jokes were based on "Geranium" and Kate Winslet. I think that "Thumbtanic" is very skilful so that it is so low to play a respected actress (forbidding the sky) because he does not starve himself in an ideal modern beauty. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is a line that indicates something like this: "Hey, I have a wonderful idea! I swim we do not swim by this no other investment." Thirty seconds from the 26-minute movie is not recovering.
