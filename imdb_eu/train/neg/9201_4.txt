It's a movie that has even seen the fear of D & D (and nowadays) of the 80's. People that play D & D (or such role-playing games) will lose other people's "spoiled" characters, and they will lose their reality from fantasy and fantasy (and killing, children, suicide ...). An excellent movie for everyone who likes to be guilty of pernicious objects of inanimate objects, but anyone who has played a role in a video game or a play will see this in their minds. Wargames is a computer that belongs to D & D. More like the movie, it's just a bit.
