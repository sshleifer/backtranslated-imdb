The picture "To Die" brought me to the girlfriend - a shirt without a shirt, and the promise of laughter and sex. Thomas Arklie (Simon) was there, easy to see, but laughter and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Bikotek, Mark and Simon, have been together for many years, but the character is not interesting. It's enough to take care of it, so it's hard to imagine that they care each other. The guilt seems to be in the script and not in the acting. Both actors do everything they can with the one provided. <br /> <br /> The endless one did not have any effect (well, it was not totally tangible, I felt that relief was over). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for happy relationships and a fun AIDS movie, "Parting Glances" is much better.
