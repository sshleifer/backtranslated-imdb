This is the death-death video of the Tremors series, inspired by sixty seconds (sawblade: you know when you know it) and has heavier and filler than a stick. Tricks 4 was shot in the worst case scenario. This means that only special effects have been mojo for precious human violence, at the tops, for three or four minutes. Undoubtedly, cliff spouting and ridiculous gestures assure that they feel at least fifteen thousand years of Tremor's experience of half an hour. Hardcore Tremors fans will only have to hang out and enjoy this movie a lot less. If you are not among them, do not worry.
