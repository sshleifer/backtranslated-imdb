It's as tall and boring as a Texas forest. Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper can not beat this boat. Taylor looks really bad - wrong wardrobe, wrong hair, and wrong makeup - the only achievement of his outstanding career. Hopper gives him an incredible performance, and shows Dean's tale on the climate scene as something we usually do not remember - a comic actor. Rock Hudson is the prototype of his Barbie prototype, Ken's prototype, and asks what Redford can do with the male lead. There is no spectacular plot, which gives up to twenty minutes of tension, is just a few milestones with no relation to each other. Apart from Hopper, there is no character development, only a collection of cardboard scrapbooks, and they will appear periodically as random targets in a shooting gallery. In his opinion, the film deals with racism and sexism at a time when taboos were taught, and the size of SIZE, is a great opportunity to free the house from uninvited people. Those with DVD version can save the latter from the second drive. You will not lose interest.
