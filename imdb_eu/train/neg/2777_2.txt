Unfortunately, this is what Star Movies shows here in Thailand last week or. The garbage is to act completely. As another member has said, this movie is a good example of "how to play". I have not seen film in the film for some time now. Actors (can you call "actors"?) They are completely flat and their lines seem like a passion for a dead dog. Actually, I would like to understand how to interpret the play, you should watch the movie ... but that would be a torture. <br /> <br /> The main female lines would be delivered. and the rest of the cast with its accents (false or intelligent) is equally disturbed. He was a beautiful British actor with a false accent, but Mr., his accent was horrible. You have to confuse it (for its lack of) and disaster. He could only say anything and could admit it as a beautiful girl. Oh my, we just got the major lady's lover saying the scene "Really for me?" after a crashing scene. Laughable No, actually, I laughed aloud. <br /> <br /> Sets and directors save on works of art. Some sets are colorful and some scenes are quite enjoyable (actors minus). <br /> <br /> Old magic potion lady? What ?! Another member mentioned the "modern" love song. It was totally inadequate for a temporary piece of about 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand that the movie was considered 'Great Budget' in Thailand during production. I would definitely feel the production of this movie. Money is not necessarily a good movie (or even a fabulous) movie. <br /> <br /> I'd give it to King Maker from the 10th, but the costumes and sets can save that movie. rating 10 to 10
