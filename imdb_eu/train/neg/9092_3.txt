Friz Frelengen, "Speedy Gonzalez", was the second drawing by Robert McKimson's "Cat-tails for Two". According to this drawing, Speedy has had a horrible gold creature, but in his second appearance the famous design has already been taken. Though she looks more beautifully, Speedy has never produced a great deal of character. A big hat, horrible speeds and a bad Mexican accent are not a classic character, and that's almost all Speedy playing. However, the penetrating little mouse was very popular and continued to be short films including a few really recent films from the studio's last days. While early speedy short films were quicker than Daffy Duck (quite curiously), they still want much, according to the planned gag, based on a similar bullying formula. In this self-titled section, they hire other mice to steal Cheedy from the local factory that is taking care of Sylvester cat. Despite the addition of extra weight to the cartoon character, Sylvester can easily play the role of this game with any general cartoon cat. He is forced to face his identity confront. the role of the aggressor Tweety's cartoons have always been a problem, but Speedy also makes the opponents more sad, due to their incredible wealth and the impossibility of hunt. Old Sylvester would come along with Speedy for many years. Although the basic formula and the least laughter, 'Speedy Gonzalez' won an Oscar and won a very bad star.
