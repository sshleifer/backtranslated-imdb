While I recently gave OPERATION PETTICOAT a positive review, I really liked the movie, although it had so much resemblance to it. Both were just a few years ago, both starred Cary Grant and both were WWII comedies. However, the tone and style of the film is very different. I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK, in general, it seemed cheaper - a bad writing, with a lot of energy and lots of performances - compared to OPERATION PETTICO. I think the biggest part of this guilt is Jayne Mansfield. His broad talents and the combination of limited play really came from a budget movie that came from a 3rd level studio. Also, there was not much chemistry or energy to connect with Cary Grant - in general, she loved her grace and class. It's like joining Sir Lawrence Olivier and Marjorie Main.
