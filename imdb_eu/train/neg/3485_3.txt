This movie was pretty absurd. There were some practices. In my memory, it goes into film factories, where I think that "Hmm ..... was a piece of fun, but in general quite horny (or missing)." <br /> <br /> He seemed to be trying to make me really hard. And I did not understand how he was a million animals and still an idiot. Anyway, I like Ben Affleck. He does some things, but I can pardon him. I mean, I liked Jersey Girl, I did not think that Giglie was his fault, I like it in general. I think that they do not understand how they feel the baby, who likes it. <br /> <br /> I'd like to avoid this color. It was not really well developed in a suitable plot, and Catherine O'hara and Jimmy G. did not use them correctly. They deserve better. In general, the film is NOT only at home, it is not the Christmas story, its Christmas holidays or other classics. Unforgettable
