Now, I do not have any movie critics, but I really hate "September 11th." This movie was generally bad. Apart from the segment of Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the most effective and correct aspect on the subject, the shorts were boring and the worst attack. The worst thing about me was Youssef Chahine's pretentious sector, because he compared the soldiers against the Palestinian suicides with American soldiers, even though he was fighting for a suicide bombing cause. The sector was totally disabled and Chahin did not give any sincerity, to lose my time and patience. A good idea to get a review of tragedy for a movie to get eleven directors in different countries, but in practice was not a taste.
