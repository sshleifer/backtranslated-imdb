It's hard to find positive results in this movie. It seems that the producer had to make the production without much effort and that is why we will deal with the entire Galaxies exhibition throughout the history of Galaxy. The police girls seemed very uniform. Two more police action plans and much less Galaxy would go the way. Of course, they would match the quote, so they decided to run the wrong space. Mrs. Albright looks great and her work is first class. Then I heard from Stabs, but I did not see it on the screen, it seemed to me very desirable, but it seemed to lack basic talent. Besides Albright, it's a real garbage.
