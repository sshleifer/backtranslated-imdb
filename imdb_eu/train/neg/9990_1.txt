After seeing this film on the SciFi channel, I can only conclude that this movie has never been seen by a group of hobbyists who have not seen the movie. The movie is a strange sequence of appearances that is endless or "nice" when my friend is reading the shoulder. Land is not worth commenting on commenting, but basically, the flying soccer player falls into Yeti territory. Before the end of the movie, we still run in our hearts, still silent, before they jump up to 50 meters and still break the legs of a man, and when they hit him, a woman kills a rabbit 30 meters away. The bullet survived and the apparent damage was not burning, while still hanging a cliff holding a man's shoe, but then jumps, and a collection of other weird things. Basically, if you spend on Saturday to watch the worst movies of the original SciFi channels, do not hurt this movie like plague. Or my friend is reading my shoulder, "I have never seen the best movie." The friend of my right says: "The battle can only improve techno music."
