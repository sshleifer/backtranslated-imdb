This movie picture comes from the dark dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment. The production company gained popularity and wealth in the first half of the 90s, creating horrible and bad films. The most famous catastrophes in their work are "Subspecies", "Seedpeople" and "Trancers". One of them is not recommended, nor Dr. Mordrid. Charles Band's Hyperactive Director came to the company for his film. Dr. Mordrid is surprisingly dumb and cursinous and almost entirely humorous. I only saw Jeffrey Combs out. I know the disadvantages I can have if you're a fan of him. For all of the best movies, it seems that he has made 5 covers. However, the story is a battle between ancient witches 2. For over 150 years, there has been an evil name for protecting humans (Jeffrey Dr. Mordrid) and Kabal. He wants to destroy all kinds of human life, for some reason I've forgotten. Combs receives tutorial information. There is only a couple of eyes in space. It's very cheesy, that's it! Every now and then, there will be a blind screen on the screen, but this is the only form of the special effects of this film. The whole thing is just rumors and agitation, and the two wizards end up in their faces before ending before ending ... I would expect the wicked wizard to fight at least a bit, but nooooooo ... In some scenes, you can truly detect originality and creativity (for example, a lecture on Jeffrey's lunar illness) and if you're really careful, you can find some pretty little parties (for example, Corumba. Edgar Allen), but overall, the loss of time and energy is horrible. I am a fan of Jeffrey and maybe it's a superhero of my eyes ... but surely it will not be necessary.
