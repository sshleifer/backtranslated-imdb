The best part of this version I saw best (and I think that all the versions of Jane Eyre ever made). Jane's childhood and personality were developed. Then someone said "Uh oh, this is too long running", and the story is hacked to shrink. The main scenes, when they enter, shine, combine and disappear, thus changing the story altogether. It was not such a transition or scene that it would be too difficult for anyone who does not know the story. It was a disappointing start that he had opened so much hope and then it was over.
