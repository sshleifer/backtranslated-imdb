In the beginning, there is a scene after the horses race. If a red eye catches something, the white vans are parked behind a bush, depending on the route. I thought I was bad, but that's it. White van in the west. Did they not get caught? Well, I rented the paid dollar. You take your friends and have 10 grandchildren and you want to make a better movie. The conversation was so slow, the performance was very good, but it was not possible to take it seriously because of the poor nature of filming. There is a door with a sheriff's door, with a private cut that looks like a modern door. I watched this movie and I move Cabin boy # 2 to the worst of all time.
