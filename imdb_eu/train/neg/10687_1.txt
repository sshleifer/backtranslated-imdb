The final game started well, at least for the end it said it was better. It seemed to me that we were just going on the plot, for example, the reporter, who initially is an intelligent and intelligent person, who does something completely stupid and absolutely immense, for which reason we do not give any reason. Besides, the next scene would not make sense. The entire story could take about 30 minutes, it would give an average television drama. Excellent Cuba Gooding Jr. is a very good watch and James Woods works brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The end game was one of the worst movie I've ever seen ... and that's what I've seen, I've seen Gigli.
