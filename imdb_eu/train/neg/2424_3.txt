If the famous French director Louis Malle did not do this documentary, I would think it would be a very sad look since 1979 in a very ordinary Midwestern American town. The idea of ​​a fun and movie recording is like a home movie collection. Noticing one of these people, it was even less interesting. <br /> <br /> Because the documentary style of life was pretty dull, I wondered what the message they were trying to convey. ? The values ​​may not have been as conservative as you think; That is, a message below has been that of some landscapes (such as Republicans whose son was a sketch, and even a man and a woman who thought of marriage as a sex). it was ok). Or maybe it was a sense that a lot of bigotry was, under the nice home of the city - a number of ugly ideas, such as blame the Jews for financial conspiracy, anti-Black bigotry and homophobia were all briefly explored. <br /> <br /> The small town of 1979 was thoroughly studied and imagined an idyllic world, but six years later, filmmakers returned, thanking President Reagan. It was very inconvenient for several reasons. First, the parts of 1979 were almost 90% of the film and only 10% were interviewed by people who accused the president about acne. Other people in this town? Everyone who saw in Reagan became evil or their lives became more negative? With a few updates, it seemed suspicious. Secondly, it is true that national debt doubled over the years, therefore, national raw products. And Malle shows the 1979 period as a very positive one, but it is not so far from the 1974-1980 period that there were many shortages (gases, sugar, etc.), strikes, great inflations and general maladies. I'm not a great fan of Reagan, because government growth slowed down in the administration, the country as a whole, much better than Ford and Carter. Although many of the media demonized Reagan (popular sport in the 80s), the economy was significantly improved and the documentary seemed to be very favorable and the agenda boosted. The documentary considered a deeper coverage of 1985 and believed it was not very negative (after all, not all of them had their lives worse - deficit in this sense), then I thought otherwise. <Br> /> <br /> In general, some do not claim this wonderful document, the dark movies of 1979 and a very bad look in 1985. <br /> <br /> By the way, is it just that I just did, or does the movie DROP DEAD GORGEOUS seem to have inspired at least the movies? Both are set in similar communities, but the last one is a hilarious mockumentary in all serious lines.
