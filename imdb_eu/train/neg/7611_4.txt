View 1/2/2/2 - 10 of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - I saw the DVD version "3 Days of the Condor" - So the CIA theater show is full of performances that are very pleasing. movie The story premise with the character of 7 Robert Redford's 8 members of a CIA research group, with the surname = Condor, dies. Who killed and why? That's what Redford tries to find 8 victims at the same time. On the way, the character of Faye Dunaway is involved, because he needs a place to hide and then eventually help him after a little love time. This is a handful of innocent stories that run, but this is not a great suspense. Flat shows do not help and the finish is not enough for the public. Although they have a good director of Sydney Pollack and a classical classical theater, the story and the performances must not be, and therefore the movie is not what it should be.
