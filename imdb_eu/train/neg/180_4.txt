The strong session squeezes great credibility as a devilish sociopath, Stanley Kaldwell will return to this moment in the production of the novels that he has written for garden drowned in the garden. Understanding the identity of the second unit director. <br /> <br /> The movie makes fun in Hollywood, taking on the plans of the tyranny of directors who sleep their actors. Brian Krause, what I thought was horrible, satirical at the point where he felt compelled, but he did not like his second unit director and screenplay, Alison (director and screenplayer of Dahlia Salem's second unit). ) seems to be taking production. Andrew Moxham is Paul Parsons, the first movie is a victim's brother. The dark mood of the movie, this time, takes the idea of ​​a serial killer as a director of a movie and exploits everything he deserves. Nelson has once again entered into his psychological abilities, he has always been passionate as Stanley, he uses his brain to produce a film production, control his work and control someone to work, let no one go. Alison realizes that Stanley is really art Alison is the most ambitious writer to capture the essence of his subject. This caused Stanley to die, why did he do something like this, and what caused such men in this dark path? Alisor's humor, working with that man, is also a satire in the heart of this dark comedy thriller. Of course, you will find inevitable encounters between Alison and Stanley, the fascinating and incredible effect of a murderer (... a tough pill to be swallowed). The director of Po-Chih Leong does not use the first film that uses the necessary unnecessary techniques, the first films with sophisticated police (for example, filming gemstones, sepia slow colors and some instances, taken in video), but astonished instead of leaving it. This sequence, for me, was not as much as the original, a much more efficient and clear humor.
