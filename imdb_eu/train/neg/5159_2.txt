Watching this movie is like having a meal rather than meringue. At first it looks beautiful, but at last satisfies NO NO. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < So how can it be done with the plot and Robin Williams is still bad ?! Because the image looks full, without any substance - Popeye's image liked Williams at the beginning of his film career. In the film money must be fortunate, but it might not have been enough to hire a writer for graduate school money. <br /> <br /> The movie is a joke that can continue. I really do not know why it was first and definitely not to offer any entertainment.
