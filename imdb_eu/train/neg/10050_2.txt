Hamm writer and the great despair of the director Dante. During the first season, the previous co-operation of "Homecoming" twisted and ridiculed in ridiculous ways. I was shocked by the mistaken management of an urgent premise. The supposed "payoff" was not happy at all when extracting something from infected psychopaths, generic foreigners, and did not explain anything. If the point of the story is if the planet of human infestation is a "cleansing" of the extraterrestrial, why did they go so sadistic and misogynistic? Why is not a completely deadly virus released by Stephen King's male "The Stand" for a female butcher's shop instead? I continued to improve this passage as I followed the observation, but it was only gotten awkward and absurd. The underlining of religion seemed necessarily, but it was clear that Sam Hamm thought that he was deep in weight. I like Dante and Hamm, but it was not so nice.
