I can not figure out Al Pacino. I looked at the Fatherland, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and I think I see one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years. Then I see Two for the Money, Any Sunday and Revolution, and I wonder what a guy is thinking about. <br /> <br /> I'm back in the Revolution for a few nights, and I would like to invest in the next two. about that hour. Here's a news: Do you want to talk about prisoners? Force this to see again ... they will confess anything. <br /> <br /> I do not confirm in the plot that there is no coherent land but it is part of the American Revolution, and Pacino does not want to take part in a religious farmer who wants to take part, but it does. He has no money, no education, and full-dressed clothes, Natasha Kinski is very much in love with her, apparently without reason, because the interview is only two minutes away. <br /> <br /> Truthfully, instead of being "Al-Pacino", "Al Pacino", he would break his career. The script was horrible, but Pacino's decommissioning performance and false accent turned out to be worse. Donald Sutherland's role was not surprising. I can not really describe it. Natasha Kinski is the main character, but has 5 lines in the movie. In fact, nobody talks in this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most boring premisses of the film is how Al Pacino and Kinski have managed to get closer to the battlefield. Starbucks is like the Northeast. "Hey, fun to watch again here, another 100 miles from the battlefield ... watch this month" here to get a negative score.
