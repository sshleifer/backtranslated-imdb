Wow, what can I say about this movie? It's a bad piece of bad stuff. I was surprised how tall it was. What's up with this movie? Here's a better question: what's wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is shit and a topic. Here's how much is being done ... A child with no companions collects some girls and dies and returns to revenge as a scarecrow. "All" of which is packed with a 86-minute movie. If you have not seen this movie, do not miss out on time. Also, the second one is not much better, so do not worry ... I liked the costume of the movie I played three, because there was no good movie. I think that you get the picture.
