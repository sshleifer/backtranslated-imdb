A great book with wonderful features and suggestions on human nature, especially the nature of dependency, which is still strongly resonant today. <br /> <br /> As for the movie ... eh. Nothing special Kameraman clearly had the unhappy dependence surrounding and rounding around CIRCLING, the nauseous viewer quite. Why the director did not stop here, but maybe he was too busy and, in a way that failed, was the good performance of these actors that were usually excellent but wrong. In short, the adaptation is weak. You would read a three-hour book (or read it again).
