I thought it was a bad documentary film. No substance was discussed. The ideas were underestimated and nothing new. There was nothing missing from the movie that would encourage the wonder or the lack of love or science. Most scientists stereotyped and sometimes jewelry. One woman said that the pride was not a matter of concern, she only helped the children. After a scene of 10 minutes he explained all his prizes. Is it a "modest scientist"? "I equally dance in my mind," said another. I do not know how to explain to us. It does not cover the significant impacts of science in our culture. The science policy is hardly touched. <br /> <br /> Not bad for ages 10-14. Also, I thought it was boring and an unknown. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
