I was almost foolish when I wanted to start this review: "This movie reminded me of BILLY ELLIOT," but then I looked at the screenwriter Lee Hall's resume to find out how BILLY ELLIOT wrote. So Mr Hall is the one who does not fool himself <br /> <br /> I'm a bit cruel to him? It's not the majority of British scriptwriters, Lee has something to do with it - he has previously got his door, he has written a successful British film that won the prizes and won the box office and what does he do next? It gives the viewers the same <br /> <br /> Young Jimmy Spud lives in a kitchen sink. He shook the school and nobody loved him. The only thing to go is to be a ballet dancer. No, in truth, he has the intentions of an angel, but considering his house, he can also be a ballet dancer. His father has a trace of possession, "Ballet dancers have a pooch set, as his grandfather says". Dancing is as hard as a man you can meet. I remember that they saw the Bolshoi ballet ... "Yup Ballet is a major conference on the British Council's rejection of these days - DO NOT think that left-wing politics do not seem to be the basic policy of the bourgeoisie, so that the well-being that lives in beautiful large houses immediately creates Everything is so wonderful that it is fake <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most important criticism is that it is a movie that looks nonsensical, it criticized Channel 4 for shooting films in extremely inappropriate times (for example, LAND THAT TIME FORGOT 6), but they have appeared at 2:00 a.m., and once they get it, the story looks at ballet dances, I hate it), lung cancer and poverty. There's no way this is right for the family's public, but the main protagonist is a 11-year-old child Even angels and dancers (not challenging me if I'm obsessed with the subject - I did not need to mention them), there's not much for men with intelligent adults. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lee Hale told producers about scriptwriters' development phase, denied a story that he would write a story with school and an angel, and write about other issues. Stories, sorry, but you'll get a feel for the whole movie when it's over at the end of the movie to be released to specific audiences that love BILLY ELLIOT.
