In the standard view, the movie is totally horrible. However, it gives an excellent score on the obligatory comedy scale. I can imagine a few real comedies that make me laugh at how hard I see this movie. An ghost clad in Andy Griffith's American dancers dresses me hysterically. I would not waste the gas or power of the video, but rent it on the sofa, it will be on the morning of 3 o'clock in the morning and it comes on TV.
