It seems to be historical errors, but this was too much. Almost nothing was near the truth, and at that time he was seen as stupid. <br /> <br /> Ford defended himself in an old talk show, just like he did in the story. The real Wyatt Earp, who was the ancient senile, repeated the scene in his own way. Earp, the director talked about this authority, and how it happened in ordinary care, so other historians say, Wyat himself says, has premeditated. <br /> <br /> This film is Earp honest. men and their brothers too. History has not been said exactly or not. Most people place deception and legitimacy on the characters, but this is nothing new. The truth is that it's probably closer to GUNFIGHT's OK CORRAL laws. They saw men as a career, and believe me, in the ancient west, you did not have much time to think about. It really did not hang, all of them become a weaker film. Mature is mature, it really does not persuade Doc. It may be the best option for a doctor, but at the same time, we must remember that older movies were closer to the moment and closer to the feeling of truth. In the end, Ford got Wyatt Earp information. <br /> <br /> That Mexican girl's planned events also weaken. Hollywood was very tall at the time of the Nazi, and ready-to-kill girls to protect the idealism of Hitler. This occurs in most films until the 80s. Forgiveness is no excuse, but it adorns art. <br /> <br /> The actors that play Earps perform well and Brennan is always a thrill. Actually, the ridiculous thing is that the only drawback to this film is. However, OK Corral is one of the oldest films.
