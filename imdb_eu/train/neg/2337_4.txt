I do not know what's going on in the hype ... The movie is really bad ... for me it's nothing, the only fall they all meet at a party and it's playing a nice song, a rich and pleasant rhythm. the cinematographic shots that you move ... it was the best part of the film ... Otherwise, this film is missing everything that the viewer is missing. There is no story, no one thinks, as people say, there is no cohesion. different stories ... Anderson was more an attempt to try "Magnolia", but it fails empty ... Well, it's clear and easy to see, but that's the way they're moving. Perhaps for the first time I wrote a story before the movie ... I've seen the worst Belgian
