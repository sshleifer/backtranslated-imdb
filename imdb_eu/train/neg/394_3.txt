I encourage films that fill the theme of film in the world. So, after watching the trailer for the movie "Water Lilies", I would like the movie because I thought it was something incredible I expected: teen love a lesbian love movie "Beautiful Thing" as a female version. <br /> <br /> The main characters are young French people, 15 years old. Marie is thin, hard and beautiful in a tender way; Floriane's departure is sporty and beautiful; and Anne is loyal, pudgy and immature. The erotic relationship between Marie and Floriane in this movie is always simmering, if not on the cover, then just below. <br /> <br /> "Under water", however, there are not two teens about two lesbian love; She is working with frustration, suffering, intercourse, cross-purposes and, at least in both cases, mechanical and cheerful sex. It also proves that the scriptwriters and filmmakers generate their own manipulative manipulations. <br /> <br /> In Peter Brook's "Lord of the Flies" additional features, Peter Brook says, "French cynicism begins with" sex stimulation, "it means that French people consider their children angels, as teenagers and because the adults have real cynicism, some part of the decline in this movie is Celine Sciamma, a filmmaker who casts a great dose of cynicism. <br /> <br /> "Where is joy?" I asked him while watching this movie. love can be painful and frustrated, but cheerful and victorious can be erotic in a new way of confirming new life. These positive aspects are missing from this movie, there is no balance. <br /> <br /> Movies want to be a great celebration of first love Organically, Sciamma, however, is also surprised by his cynicism and ignorance and has ruined his film, first of all, what is it just to show the little girl's will? I know European cinema is a nasty youth for young people the "The Slingshot; The Rascals; The Devil, Probablly; The Little Thief; Murmur of the Heart; Friends; "Beau Pere" and "Europe" films. Europe "; But this instance is a small authority: "See, the viewers can make a short film to show just how attractive a person is naked." Either nude or banished nudity could not go on an honest way. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in a club that is dancing at Floriane and Marie. Next, it is not only the cynical manipulation of Floriane Marie; Sciamma filmmaker is cynically manipulated by audiences. <br /> <br /> The greatest betrayal of authenticity and organic sincerity occurs when Floriane Marie warns us that "it is not normal." Marie asks in an understandable way: "Who cares about being normal?" Afterwards, Sciamma has been considered a false one with the momentum of the audience and the film, because Floriane's request is a false question, a question and a substitute question - not the movie is a wonderful question, Marie's character and their time invested by the audience. <br /> <br /> Here are the two moments that make you face the nerves of the audience: 1) When did the French begin - to launch bathing suits and a turtle with all the people? 2) Which adolescent - on all nationalities, would it be extracted in a piece of apple that is thrown in the rubbish to taste in the mouth of the sweetheart? <br /> <br /> The three main actors wait and, if they find better vehicles to get their talents, they can be excellent actors. Louise Blachere (Anne) is the best actor in terms of technique and can have a successful career in assistant roles. Adele Haenel (Floriane) would become a major or a bomb, or both. Pauline Acquart (Marie) has intense and magnetism unmistakable. In the future, he was able to play from the emotionally weak librarian to play, mysteriously sensual seductive politics, he was applauded by the political upsurge. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Water lilies" were very disappointing. Will the filmmaker be honest a true movie about two young women who fall in love? No, it's not necessarily for the sake of this middle-aged child - but, therefore, young lesbians can have some quality to see and identify. Yes, to fill the gap in the world of cinema.
