Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a good and solid plot, but has stepped on the tasty details throughout the movie. I am a younger girl and I do not enjoy this movie. I thought the effect was horrible, but I think it's fun for little children. The Matrix movement has ruined the action, you know it was totally false. Then, Yen Lo, the evil spirit, the casual people and the house, Wendy was trying to win. All this ends like a good movie, Wendy and his buddhist monk will defeat Shen Yen Lo (and destroy him forever). Wendy learns the lesson ... blah, blah, blah. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
