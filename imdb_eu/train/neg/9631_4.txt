He has come to the public with Ben Stiller and J. Aniston's acquaintance. It seems that there is a recipe for a successful title, but it has not been a success in this film. <br /> <br /> Aniston plays polly very well. This is perfectly suited. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is a disturbing type of "Meet Parents", but this movie compares comic scenes with respect to the roughly mentioned title. <br /> <br /> The script is very poor, nothing special. With two well-paid actors, things could be much better - but what they can do with bad stories and scripts. 10 to 10.
