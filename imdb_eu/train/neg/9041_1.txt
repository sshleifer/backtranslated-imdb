I liked the movie for a while, despite a loud rhythm. BUT I did not thank Canada as it was referred to as Montana North. It's definitely northern Montana and it will never be. Americans are surprised at why they see it in other parts of the world, and that's why. Let the US children's education be the planet's owner. The focus of the mid-world does not become one of the greatest nations in the world. Even jokingly. I would never mention the United States 'Alberta South'. Walt would never go down, so why start now. On the other hand, the movie was pretty bad and the next would be a luck.
