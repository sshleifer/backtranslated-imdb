I had the chance to test out this movie as a member of a public, and the only thing that kept me in my seat was to complete a survey of the subsequent study. The main problem of the film I felt was missing the main plot. Instead, the screen consists of sub-plot competing competitions. As a result, there is not a single character that has been developed for the viewer to complete any attachment. The director and the producer failed to show us why we will take care of what happens to the characters. In fact, without prejudice to any film that could seriously damage the sub-plot and related characters. (The rest of the sub-plots and the time obtained by the necessary development of the characters). On the other hand, Hungry Bachelors Club's plate side dishes and meals are full, whenever you want.
