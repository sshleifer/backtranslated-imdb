I prefer to have 20 root channels once again going through this film. Myles Berkowitz, Prince of Annoying, is wasting two hours of my life with pseudo-cool cynic. Only one fun thing at this break Mr. Samah is a cameraman and cameraman cameraman. Berkowitz takes on a great concept and crushes dust. It is very confusing and misunderstood, apparently making efforts to be exciting or entertaining. It is not. I rarely feel that a movie was a movie (or tape) unnecessary, but this is a good idea for this distinction. If a date suggests watch this movie, run it.
