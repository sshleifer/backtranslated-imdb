Oh dear, my dear ... <br /> <br /> For lovers of JM, this was the nail of the coffin in the Hollywood A-list career. After Girl Can not Help It, Wayward Bus, The Burglar and Rock Hunter seemed to make Jayne well on the way to becoming one of the hottest stars in Tinsel Town. However, an obsession with live advertising and the appearance of this clunker were excluded from Mansfield, which evicted cheap euro loans, until Fox could drop his contract as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> This movie is diabolical. The waste of time, except Suzy Parker, is the only bad thing about this movie. Many people mislead Jayne's film and the returning performance of the back-to-back movie at the box office, and despite the pain in the movie, he can do the best with the material. In the end, Cary almost does not turn on the screen? After a lot of dramatic comedies, Jayne has made 10 steps to find serious actors. (It only appears with Grant) portrays this kind of threatening mood. Alice's character is a complete cartoon, and although boiler boards seem to be enough to wear, all the looks of the movie mix your nerves. We all know that Jayne can do much better than this slag and is still disappearing here as a reward's milk. Really embarrassed <br /> <br /> <br /> Cleanse the comedy. More fun than that.
