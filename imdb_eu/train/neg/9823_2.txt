There is an interesting debate in this movie. Is the moral person enough or something more? <br /> <br /> The preaching of a film without a God driver, it is not enough to have a good moral person. At the beginning of the film there is a line: "You and I can see a person who is morally good, but they both know that he will go to hell". <br /> <br /> I am not a Christian, the debates about the film were fascinated, but not as the film invented. I left the movie with more solid feelings to be morally good. The arguments and debates presented were very different, so they were so much in their ignorance. Fanatism can be a powerful thing, especially in the minds of ignorance and education. George Carlin's dogma's character said: "Unite young people while they are young." <br /> <br /> The basic premise is also very interesting. A Biblical student from the 1890s tries to publish a book, trying to publish a book that says no moral goodness is provided, as long as morality is significant. Do you only steal a child? Or do not you rob him if God does not tell you? (It does not steal the baby to steal it not to get bored, because how did he feel his mumbles steal?) <br /> <br /> The author, Carlisle, wants to sell his recommendation for his school (world wide). However, he uniquely needs permission and one of the learned ones is opposed. He presents, an interesting debate at the beginning of the film about the moral argument against God's good words. To prove his point, he creates a time machine (only when he works for a solo film), and he sends it to Carlisle in 2002 to see God's teaching where God will not go without God. </ B> <br /> </ b> <br /> </ b> <br /> </ b> <br /> </ b> <br /> </ b> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . <br /> <br /> Like the movie movie itself, it's pretty slow and misunderstood. This movie is something that is unnecessary, it's about creating two "bad" people who want to know Carlisle, even though no one has ever done anything. What happens when a movie showing Carlisle's opinion showing his vision of "world sinner" and returning with a new perspective? <br /> <br /> I also believe in some points in the movie, I'm glad I'm not a Christian, or at least someone who says "God or nothing." At the end of the movie I was annoyed three ... first, when the two "bad" Carlisle jumped into the corner, Carlisle just made his real ... fake like his time jump ... Jesus, and so it's "bad guys "(who are also Christians btw, surprising enough), they just think they have lost rapture. <br /> <br /> Secondly, when Carlisle returns, the movie initially scolded a boy to steal (but not to mention God, the boys kept marbles and escaped), and he tells him that stealing time is wrong because God promises . As for Contribution above Carlin, religion is a child's fear in my book faux-pas. <br /> <br /> And finally, the epilogue. Another horror tactic. Carlisle asks the inventor how far he arrives and he does not know ... The epilogue shows that trying to push the Bible in a distant future (it starts in 2100) and fails. He is 10 years old and is trying again, and as soon as he disappears, it will take place as early as 2030. Throughout the film, Carlise cries to feel that the end of the world was reached, because the world was sins and the loss of God's name ... horror tactics are used for thousands of years ... you would think that enlightened times would have been cleared by the church too. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw the movie. I was pretty sure I was good at being morally good, I know it before. If you are not a Christian, you should know whether or not you were happy as not as ignorant of the people in this movie.
