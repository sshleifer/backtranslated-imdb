It is a science fiction B formula, and the director does not have any bones about it. A scientist talks about a dragon that has rescued his life. It's all that you've seen before. Script is weak, with no real characters. In fact, it is full of stereotypes and characters. The director has only made a formula for this attack, he does not try to make any attempt, and this is an appeals to this film, but it's not something to remember. It's better to see cooking while cleaning. Unhappy fun It has a place for entertainment, but it's definitely not something to take care of sitting with your friends, if you just drink it and it does not matter. 3.2 massive points are reasonable. I do not think it's as bad as most people, but I'm surprised that some of the messages believe that this was spectacular. That really comes out, I do not see it as a memorable event.
