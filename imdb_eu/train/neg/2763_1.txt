I saw the D-War caprice and very little hope. The movie failed to meet them. <br /> <br /> I do not care about credible stories - recalls the King, Lord? - But I hope I have an internal consistency. This film flashed Howler's Howler without breathing, similar to LOTR or Godzilla, which were far removed from special effects. <br /> <br /> An apparently mystical Korean warrior, a whimsical metamorphosis. He appeared as the former distributor of the Caucasus and deus ex machina to make out the protagonists without their confusion. A special FBI agent seems to have been completely extinct in Korean folklore, because Fed's splendor of "paranormal" split. For now it has not been mentioned. The lovers were immersed in empty beaches where he excluded "I will never happen anymore." They killed a pair of "killer runners" killed as Crusaders. Mystical hangers, face-to-face robotic soldiers (much owed by Peter Jackson's orcs), and a snake shrinks so much time. It is noticeable that the predatory loot is distracted at every possible disposal. <br /> <br /> The conversation is awful so that the effect of wood and everything is honest. However, for me, the ending was over, after the end of the final music loan - Arirang! This is Akira Kurosawa, which closes with the name "Ran", with the interpretation of My Way's karaoke - and let me with Shim I do not compare Kurosawa's director. <br /> <br /> In short, it's an indulgent car. For the melodramatic so prevalent in popular culture in the town, it would not be worth the price for any film that deserves the price of the film, or even a not so serious film. I would like to avoid the movie theaters altogether and I will go directly to the video, but I am not surely worth much.
