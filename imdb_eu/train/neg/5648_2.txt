Boston law has turned its tail and created a beast! During the first four seasons, when this show was almost activated, all the actors were applauded about the legal system that is proud of portraying them. It was fun, diversified and somehow true. The portrayed characters were acceptable, and largely in their portraits. Sexual comments and activities were limited and humorous. Julie Bowen was beautiful and beautiful as other series, but now she moves to the smallest depths of sex and violence in the media. Julie is an excellent actor and needs a more stable platform than this "production". Rene Adjurdubois is a great actor in the "Benson" newspaper, a production that has made it into the field of entertainment, always showing humor and respectful production. Kirk's captain is "da". Funny and funny Candace is in Berne and she is admired for this production and is a good actress. James Spader definitely is in his acting capability. However, its origins seem to be a great talent and tendency like "Crash" that had to go back to XXX. We are demanding that this series be already corrupted, and it really starts to smell !!!
