I do not miss the average skills of Haneke's film. For example, I say that it surpasses the well-known light of day as a powerful way of promoting a strong sense of realism. However, in terms of content of this film, I feel sad XXI. The desire to pathologically postpone the relationship or feeling of sentiment in the age (and / or BDSM practices). The problem with my mother about character is a topical issue that means the alienation and understanding that Walter feels (I do not love love frustration in the same way, that is, understandable). he looks at him as if he were mad, or as a monk, come!). I mean, D / s is not something new in the world and I think it's a foolish thing to treat the subject as "terribly" or pathological; It is not. In general, movies on this subject are very far away. <br /> <br /> So, for me, I think this movie is a movie program and the psychoanalytical theory is very worried (isn ') worried. is not it almost embarrassing?), which has nothing to do with real life experiences and the experiences of D / s (personal experience, forums, irc chatrooms, and even recent research studies).
