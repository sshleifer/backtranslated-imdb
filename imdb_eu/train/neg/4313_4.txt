Like last year, I did not sit all the time. Well, Chris Rock was a good choice because it was a good choice. Or, apparently, all the bored totals in the theater, at least 10 Top Most Mosta was not. Many presenters, however, expected this Top 10. I do not know everything that autocue did (although I knew it was a screenplay), but it was incredibly amazing to see the good ones. The actors do not go into it, they look out of the simple look and find more than simple words (Natalie Portman, if not the director, has disappeared). The dress Fancy Night and the Boring Speeches night was long and boring. Beyonce Knowles won some good songs and admission talks and clips were acceptable. Adam Sandler wins the Worst Slammer Award. <br /> <br /> My opinion, my father, my lawyer and my pedicurist, have helped me to write this opinion for all those who believe me, and I'd like to. I have a great metabolism and, of course, I'm not hungry for a month. I will not cry ... thank you.
