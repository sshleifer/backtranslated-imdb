I did not know that Willem Dafoe was so hard that it would be shameful for him with this monstrosity. Hell: I'd give money to Ethiopia if I'm disappointed. In the long run, I have never seen this film exhausting and enjoyable ... who paid for it? They're either tax fraud or insanity. A 5-year-old young man would be ashamed of the plot, and I would rather go for cancer than the time I suffered. Everyone involved should block each year on the glory of a third-world prison inmate. Avoid at all costs. I could give it less to 10 ... unbelievable.
