I do not know if Andy Sidaris repeated the success of "Malibu Express". With Fit to Kill, Sidaris is a serious filmmaker and has not only proved a solo film director. In the plot written by Sidaris, the Academy did not unravel it, it is a complex script that includes countless screenplays and invisible turns. The main characters have performed a sex-radio station called KSXY. The soul is really KSXY is its secret residence. For a long time, "Fit to Kill", Kane is fighting against enemies, trying to steal one of the most precious diamonds in Russia. The script written is not everything, it helps to ensure the classic movie that casts them into a classic movie. According to critics and box office, this film will come. Now, the same fate, like Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, is undoubtedly recognized. I do not like Critical Circle on the criticism of the cinematographic brand of Andy Sidaris. Costumes, special effects, help to fill this beautiful piece of filmmaking. It's possible that 3 bad reviews of this movie are excluded and you can leave and rent yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. Drama is as bold as the blockbuster Runaway Bride, and the last action is a better or even better masterpiece of Action Last Hero. Andy, keep up the good work.
