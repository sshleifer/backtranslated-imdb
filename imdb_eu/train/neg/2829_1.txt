The worst, and the well-known people is a corner filled (cast will have six Oscars among them). It is in Africa 'contemporary' (made in 1979) and is about slave trade. It is annoying and writable (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden get a low career), and there is absolutely no moral point of view that enthuses it. It is completely playful. You do not think that in a few minutes he would play such characters as he would play. It is run by Richard Fleischer, but you thought about the phone. That's just as bad.
