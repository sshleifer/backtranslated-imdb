After the initial release of the good 4 titles in Eurotrasque, REDEMPTION got the bottom of the barrel THE BLOODSUCKER DANTZA. I found NO Bloodsuckers in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is easy. A mysterious number invites several castles of his castle on holiday. After a couple of short-sleeves, the girls are cut by one. Who is the killer? Who knows? Later on, the red corpse is more on Friday than in the local fish market. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is horrible. The story is absurd and the skin scenes are not very exquisite. <br /> <br /> Ask for this.
