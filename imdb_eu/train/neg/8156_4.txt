Prom Night 2 is a great horror movie, but it's better than nightly shows, and this movie is a movie about Mary Mary's queen back in 1957 and 30 years back. Michael Ironside's best actor, Micheal Ironside, and other actors and actors are Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage, and Richard Monette (I). And there are similar scenes that kill Mary Lou's girlfriend trying to hide her dressing rooms. combining cabinets together and translating one of the students into computer and Mary Lou to death. All of this is a good / good horror movie and my grade is out of 10.
