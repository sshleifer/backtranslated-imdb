I knew that watching this movie would not be very good. but what I saw, the words were terrifying. I do not mean to be hard, the movie was awesome. It was generally bad, AWFUL special effects meant, the performance was not bad, but it was not good, and the saschatch was like ... well, not sasquatch. I think the best sasquatch movie Harry and Hendersson are. It is not violent or horrible, but sasquatch has the best representation. At least one of its a suit and not a semi-ass CGI rip-off. See if you are disappointed with this movie or appreciate anybody in the movie. or see the holy Boondock, it's much better.
