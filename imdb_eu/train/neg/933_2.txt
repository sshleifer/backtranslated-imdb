Undocumented / unbelievable language, (then I thought I'd go where I was going, I was not looking anymore) a bad smelting. (Come on ... William Macy, a successful man?) Bad guess. Tracey Ullman never played badly?) (Why did John Ritter's unstoppable, unforgettable, unheard-of what happened to me?) A bad script ... (Actually, I'm not looking for a formula script, but it was really awful.) Things the only child was really good. Ten lines? Is not it ok if your comment is less than ten lines? Are my rules? Why can not I say what I have to say in less than 10 lines ??? Is not it arbitrary? Why not have a good 10 comment lines in line?
