Strummer's hippie was a revelation of the past, but in general it felt like awakening. Kanpfiren stories work best on the privacy of a camp. There were anecdotal half-bored friends and footage of excessive materials. I love The Clash and Joe because they do not even gather and sing so far (FU Mick Jones), but I do not want to stick to this document ... to link more. Using external story telling stories without an explanation of Anekdota is far from the viewer. They should only interview. He also did not stick the movie together with Strummer's 'DJ DJs'. And can anyone explain all the bots outside the camp? After a terrible "Filth And The Fury" I was expecting a Temple. A Joe Strummer document is better off.
