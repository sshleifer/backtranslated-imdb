This is not really the justice of blues. Is it wrong to tell the stories of life-watching and Blind Willie McTell's (or Blind Lemon Jefferson? Somebody blind though) apparently in space (?) And telling stories about some of the blues musicians. Right now, the documentary, which is a bit more spectacular, is the part of this documentary. The only thing to see is that the classic actors are tossing themselves into melodies, fake Black and White in the 20s, and Beck and Shemekia Copeland with the same songs. It's a good device for showing how old the old Blues really looked so good, but it does not look compelling. There is hardly anything to do here to film and not justify radio play. No one has been forced to see these bad reconstructions. Wenders, Scorsese and especially blues. Avoid at all costs.
