The main problem of documentary "Czech Dream" is not what he's saying. <br /> <br /> I forgot to use the word "inspired", street theater action. Vit Klusak and Filip Remunda, two filmmakers from the Czech Republic, filed a large corporation on their film as the basis for the "false hypermarket" (Costco or the equivalent of Eastern Walmart Super Store). , he built a whole banner advertisement around it - posters, radio and TV spots, official logos, hard themed songs and fake merchandise were published - and then they waited to see how many "dopes" would appear on their creation. on opening day. A facade facade was built to convince people that the stores really existed. <br /> <br /> You might ask: "Why do you like that?" Well, that question is very good, but the answer given by filmmakers is not at all. Basically, we have been told that the goal of the breakthrough is that people can easily be manipulated to believe something - even though it is not true, through publicity power. And the film makers run for moral coverage, that is, "the real goal of karak" (that is, it is higher) that the Czech people do not push into the European Union. Just enough reason - especially true advertisers who accept the ethical criteria they give to their customers, believe that they cooperate in claiming it as "research". whether it's advertising or not. In some ways, allowing these comments to be captured by the camera, the filmmakers who speak of these men and women are the unpredictable poor people who are the main goal of carelessness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But, in many ways, the satirical arrow does not achieve the sole purpose of this goal, ironically turning itself into filmmakers. In fact, they are NATIVITY, and are NOT heartfelt and naturally trustworthy, who ultimately do without etiquette and without class, make people who perfect perfection, some old and disabled and long travel. walk to the place of distance. And how do you prove this all the way? When people are "hungry", they open a new supermarket looking for merchandise? Or they are stupid and confidential, because they do not believe that one can be a real market, although advertised? This vigilance would require almost impossible cinematic operation in the real world. <br /> <br /> No, I'm afraid it only proves that this little and bad little "txupinazo". Film directors are looking forward to feeling like stupidity to make them really enjoyable. And, in fact, many of them, when they know the trick they end up reciting, they recite good spirits and good humor, I am not sure I would meet in their position. <br /> <br /> I do not say that there is no movie - it can detect massive traffic accidents in one act - but finally, when dust is fixed, all the disappointed customers return their red faces and empty hands. In their homes, we can safely say that they do not feel embarrassed.
