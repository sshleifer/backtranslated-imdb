His pleasant vision for all, the better it would be the Renaissance direct action. Animation is fantastic in a great way, but the characters are cold and empty, like the story and the style of this movie. With real actors, maybe the world of the movie would not be so alive. There is a lot of admiration for the past, but at last I admire everything I saw. I did not enjoy the movie so much, and he clarified something that I did not see before: visual elements can be a defining positive part of a movie, but it can not be without a good story and a strong character. I'm not going to say that movie is not, but sometimes it's approaching dangerous. I love dark sci-fi thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City were two films I thought were great. Blade Runner, on the other hand, had a tragic criminals, and Dark City had a story that encouraged her thinking. The Renaissance has shadows and lights, but few. I really liked this movie, but the weak story and the empty characters were just like that. Renaissance color and life exploded artistic and artistic. So it's ironic that one of the most shaky and most awesome movies I've ever seen this year has its own Renaissance title.
