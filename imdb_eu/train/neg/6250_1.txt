I really liked this show once. That is, until I realized all the mistakes. It's unrealistic. I know fiction, but it's not credible. That's why. ** Folks before Spoilers ... ** Do we really suppose a boy like Yugi was the descendant of ancient Egyptian Pharaoh? Pull it! It's the most milder face of Earth. And what about Pharaoh's (a.k.a. Atem and / or Yami) hair? At last I found out, Pharaoh shaved his beard (except for a small hair on his head) and wore fancy hats. When it's time to go to a bad little school like 'Domino High' while running legally for a successful business? Puh-leeze! First of all, legally, it should be an adult to run a business. And that would not really be the genius's geniuses, because he was the only adult in his room. In second place, why would he go to school in a school like "Domino High", when his business can be quite successful, to go to a wonderful snobbish academy? Moreover, the plots on the sides of his little brother are so confused. When they turn themselves, children have kidnapped the wicked. * effort * There is nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is a bad child, who lives with a good dad. Joey says that he earns all his money to go to school, because his father has alcohol, but you never saw anything that Joey does. He does not even mention work. And her sister Serenity is full of moron. Why did he choose a snob like Duke (his brother dressed in a costume and publicly humiliated dog on television) rather than a pretty guy like Tristan? Is it really empty? Throughout the spectacle, various characters, demonic forces, take possession of demonic forces, rob their souls, and cure their mental illnesses. (O, that is, a safe child, NO.) It is typical of a typical tea girl, and its sole purpose is to have a Yugi / Yami girlfriend. And while she has some cool points, she just does not have enough time to shine the main character. <br /> <br /> Animation is just awful. All characters look awkward and anorexia. Perspectives are awful (especially when someone comes in hand) and the colors look good, but not the stars. <br /> <br /> But the worst hole in the series was according to Yamie. Millennium Puzzle can return souls to their bodies. So, what happened first did not save your grandfather Yugi when he stole Pegasus's soul and saved him back to trouble? <br /> <br /> It really is everything, it's a commercial one. Little-Guriboh is the only party named "Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series". <br /> <br /> Please, please. Something worthwhile. Like, see the Abridged Version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
