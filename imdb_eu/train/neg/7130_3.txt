This movie should be Need for Speed: The Movie. Need For Speed ​​is for those who do not play especially for hot cars and beautiful women and almost no land. This is perfectly applied to Redline. A-Level was the only thing about this movie were cars. The play was compulsory and it seemed like writing, the premise was the least, and the plot did not exist. I saw the movie really, how bad it was to see it, and, if it was pretty bad, it could be worse. And at least it was entertaining. I would like Eddie Griffin to show me somewhere in the movie Enzo. In short, do not pay, do not see it, but it's Showtime or HBO and it's nothing else, it's a decent distraction.
