This clunker of a film sets a new bad news standard. Jared Rushton is performing a malfunctioned character in a badly billed movie, and thus creates a very bad movie. The main shot of the film is how to make a trip to a boyfriend after a solo crash airplane, to make the adventurous teenage girl face an embarrassment against motherhood. Unfortunately, the "survival event" becomes an extraordinary collage (including two special scenes that attack a bear) and it's a strange hallucination asking if this is something on earth. (And what a nightmare!). In spite of the fact that there are some advertisers for the film's visibility, the scene is not too suitable for some youngsters or family viewers, including an underwater pilot graphic scene, when an eye suddenly exploded. <Br /> <br /> No one is a horrible film that anyone should be innocent.
