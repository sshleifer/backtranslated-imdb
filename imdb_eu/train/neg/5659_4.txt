It was a bad start to a season ... <br /> <br /> Exodus Part 2 and other significant episodes were seen on television in the best of any series, which was quite bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm not sure if it was a disappointment, but with the closing sequence, this strange guitar music was drowned and the original series would be more at home. <br /> <br /> Almost the corporation authorities did not like the low key at the end of the note and they wanted to like jazz. Everything went wrong and it was ruined. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that there is no future trend. <br /> <br /> We still saw at least one return of a certain person, even though it was pretty fast. tritely done
