In the ancient times of the Catholic Church, the sinner was an individual who could have sired the sins of a person who died by ritual. Often, the church would not absolve the human being from being excommunicated or similar, so they refused to enter the sky. The scholars were seen as blasphemous, circling the chruch's recovery monopoly. You can make this sex look like supernatural silhouettes, leaving the concept to go smoothly and "The Order" combines the religious anti-authoritarian "Stigmata", paranormal research "X-Files". and "The Thorn Birds" has become a strange melody that works in sexual spirituality. <br /> <br /> Alex (Heath Ledger) is a priestly groom, one of the last members of the Order of the Carolingians, half - Ordered priests who are looking for knowledge. When Alex's guardian finds herself dead, Driscoll Bishop (Peter Weller) sends Alex to investigate. Labeling Thomas Thomas is a fellow (Mark Addy) and Mara (Shannyn Sossman), one year before, when Alex was an exorcist. They go to Rome to investigate and admit that they are a man who claims to be a Catholic religion, disturbing prophecy, immense intrusion, and the latest survivor Sin-Eater (Benno Furmann). Written and directed by Brian Helgeland ("A Knight's Tale") is a short film that is difficult to classify. He wants to be different at the same time - supernatural thrillers, religious intrigue, dramatic television dramatist - and sometimes he just gets any of them. This is not a slow pace or a lot of actors to savor through their performances, occasionally a great splendor. Ledger, in particular, has a particularly stunning scene of despair, otherwise, in a monochromatic performance. Sossman, however, has shown the same disconnection in all his films (most notably "The Rules of Attraction"). <br /> <br /> Plunge into the plot among different bows in different stories. It will take you to ask what is the main arch of each strange wonder. The great voices of narration sometimes seem to have been lost amongst the scenes, which often can be confusing for many, but this is also one of the most lucrative savings of the film. The movie structure - if it does not clearly match the movie to the end of the movie - explores and reasons the movie in a clear, evident, most time (that is, exception). This is the history of Karolingian history and the practice of eating sin, both of which are explained in the dry explanation. At the beginning of the film, they explain the relationship between characters and history, instead of explaining it. Combine this with the sensible use of location shooting and special effects, and you'll have a supernatural thriller of the very old world, with initial credits that remind you of the late 70s / 80s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < A very nice and suggestive score, with no bombs and a very deceptive simplicity. <br /> <br /> A troubled, unwanted, and sometimes lovered, plot would often curse the movie, but for some reason, the "Order" is seen. Many people will turn off movies for strangest sensibilities, and some may be angry that they are forced to understand the highest roles of their brain. However, the film's intangibility does not prevent a critical DVD from being a commercial success, I am convinced that it will supply a large number of canceled scenes. A movie that is recommended solely for people who want to think over it. 10 to 10
