I think lights and lights were very poor. When I first saw it, I thought it was an old version (1956). When I first met the movie, I was surprised. I did not know that it could be a bad movie. That's what I really meant. This movie has a good plot, but George Orwelll wrote that you would just miss the novel. What I really want to say is that I can not believe that this film has received so many awards and nominations. I gave this film (horrible), because I felt very bad. made Well, that's all. Long
