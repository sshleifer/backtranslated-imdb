I watched this night movie (about 102 minutes) and I do not know what he was sitting for. I think that if I was expecting a movie that would have a movie with Ger's, I never expected any screen value. The story is a bad excuse after being shot in the face of sculptures and torture. There is nothing in the film that makes a person like something like real life. The cuts "style" jump cuts, mini flashbacks and overpressures are the "victim" of the executed SUPERPRISE killer executed for a shaky configuration of a group of sadistic executives that are running for many years. I do not know how Gere, a Buddhist, took part in this brutal and sexist bins.
