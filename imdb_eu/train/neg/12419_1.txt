Kibutx's untidy life <br /> <br /> This movie is not a cultural story about the life of a Kibbutz boy, but demonizing the life of life in general. In the first two minutes of the film, the cows' milk is raped by their calves. And from there, it goes down according to the characters depicting the typical "kibbutznikim". In addition to the two main characters, the clinically depressed woman and her young son, all the kibbutz is a gross caricature of evil doing well. <br /> <br /> According to the story, kibuches, like worship, slowly drag the mother and son into despair and thus continue inevitably. No happiness, no joy, no laughing at this crib. Every character / situation represents a very different human being, such as misogynist, hypocrisy, violence, worship, repression, etc. For example, while the protagonist has a surprisingly beautiful 12-year-old European look? His main brother is a typical young Kibbutz, with his "Jewish" physical appearance and full of personality. Volunteers do not care about their mother being more than dying. These volunteers treat them as trash. Because his little brother was forced to visit his mother of death, he had not seen his military service for a long time, he quoted, Quote? "Linda, go take a shower and I've spent two minutes." <br /> <br /> Is this a "good" character in this movie? A foreigner who plays with her mother's friend. When animal rape tries to attack the mother's son, the boyfriend defends the rupture of the violent arm. In short, it comes out of Kibbutz to be the "violence" against one of the members of Kibbutz. More Hypocrisy: A terribly angry French teacher who professes a school predicts that sex is not possible at age 18, or without love, and tells the audience a real act to make, but really stupid. Of course, it bursts the head of the brain, and then it becomes the mother of the baby, makes mental health worse. <br /> <br /> The film cutters represent a kind of worship. The children go out in the middle of the night in bed and swear in the care of old kibuchs. My mother apparently can not "escape" from Kibbutz, although in truth, someone freed or went as they choose. A mystery is how the boy's father died, but you can be sure, Kibutz "guided him" and his survivors are other courageous and courageous characters, who weigh to his mother and his son. <br /> <br /> The main idea of ​​this movie. Do the characters of the dimension, the dramatic, the seedy performances and the most insidious message they try to entertain themselves? Kibutzian lifestyle was degrading, unhappy and even deadly "for those who did not enter". Sorry about this guy who made this film? Of course, he had a bad experience in Kibbutz. But I know that the truth has taken some kernels on the life of Cibutus and has become a huge atomic stereotyped bombardment.
