This movie has some of the worst actors I've ever seen! Some scenes are original, such as nails that penetrate the floor. This nail trap captures bad things. The rest of the movie is degraded when you degrade. I can not believe that this movie is not in every 100-minute movie. I can not believe any follow-up too! I want to see the next sworn movie R.O.T.O.R. Can this R.O.T.O.R be so much worse? <br /> <br />
