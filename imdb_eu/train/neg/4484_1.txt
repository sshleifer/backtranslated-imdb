When I began to talk and start talking about this poster, I was immediately excited. Matrix was unforgettable and I could not wait to see the second, especially after taking the trailers in other films. However, when I saw it, the theater was very disappointed, even with other filmmakers in the theater. The action scene of the film was as amazing as ever, but they were just a few of them. The first film seemed to be a constant struggle, but the latter took on a vision to preach much more (and much more unhappy). In the plot, there was not much to expect. The machines were punched by him to destroy him (this is not a spoiler, everyone sees in ads). The movie's conversation was absolutely awesome. If you are a major psychologist, you probably do not understand most of the movie, and that's why it does not matter. He became a romantic movie about Neo and Trinity's life and the events that took place in connection. Smith's agent, as the first movie, got himself a religious and preacher. Personally, I do not need to hear of any news or money. The movie was a waste of my time and I do not think I see the first one. The key to each and every conversation and character of a boring and landlord monologue made me lose the interest of the movie quickly, and the small number of good scenes on the edge near me and ended my movie. What film will end with "What is to end?" People are original I wonder Wachowski brothers need to burn midnight oil to get it. In the end, it was a bad movie and it's over.
