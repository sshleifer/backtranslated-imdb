This movie is not fun. It's not entertaining. It does not include a single second sequence of originality or intelligence, nor does it capture the least interest in the characters or the situation. This has been added to a new movie for young people recently. A group of secondary school children of 14 or 15 years old never had a relationship with a real girl or had a relationship with a real girl, and she was wrong with the fantasy of a mature man who wrote a film. . This movie is boring, stupid and sometimes offensive and annoying. In most cases, you have a moment or two that you laugh. It also looks like it lasts longer than 85 minutes.
