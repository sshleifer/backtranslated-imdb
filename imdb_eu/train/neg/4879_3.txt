Is something worse than a comedy worse? The answer is yes; One that does not create an interest in the whole picture. The premise is not too bad: it is na√Øve to an illegal business, but this is a script and script that is inadequate and does not work. <br /> <br /> Was this a "B"? In 1942? Think hard The only positive aspect of the image is cast, with 30 and 40 known faces, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always reject Richard Cromwell's weaknesses as Gary Cooper's death). The "life of a Bengal Lancer", so I did not tell. <br /> <br /> You can not recommend this and give it 3 points - if you have an option to get the root. .
