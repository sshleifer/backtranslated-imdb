I was very impressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but it's probably worse than the two titles. First of all, I do not like the animation, on the Saturday morning, cartoons, in some scenes worse. I liked some characters called Thunderbolt and Patch, but the other characters, like Cruella, were mediocre. The original Cruella was really bad, but he lost his quality in the sequel. He said there was nothing to write at home and his animation was ugly. Lars, your artist friend, was also a joke to be honest with you and Roger stopped smoking at night. The talents of the voice were very good, especially as Barry Bostwick Thunderbolt, Jodi Benson exceptionally, accentuated my accent. There were some great moments, but the whole plot was hard for me, and a great deal of extended television coverage. After all, in the 60's, a delightful sequel to the most memorable Disney movies, along with the Jungle Book. Sorry, I can only give a 3/10 one, it's just my tea cup. Bethany Cox
