Johnny and Jeremy are the sort of vampires. At least your legs, of course. The creatures are dark and bitter, to do nothing better than to spread their misery. Through their charm (that is, a sharp language and wallet, respectively) they destroy their souls and overcome their torments and their victims. This is roughly the basis of this black comedy, as I understand. <br /> <br /> It's not easy for me to mix black humor, I'm somewhat bored to imagine the creation of the audience. the main character However, I enjoyed the sound and sound of the sound and the suppositively sound notes. I was very pleased to hear the cast's starring performance, especially David Thelis; Jeremy's character seemed two-dimensional. Photography and music, dramatic and dark, work very well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In other words, in a world that is very bad, what a difference does it mean if girls get a little pain, right? Suggestions (like some of some of this web page) Johnny is not so horrible as a person, because the girl like Jeremy does not feel like it, she seems very absurd to me. Yes, people are horrible and evil. And especially like women, they like to hurt them. He argued that John eventually deserves to get it, as if suddenly a bad karm went straight back and looked at his ass. However, her and Jeremy sadic behavior are partly treated as a matter of laughing. And I would be wrong, but most of the people who love this movie really think that this movie is a dark comic.
