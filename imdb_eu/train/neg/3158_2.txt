This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is that woman? And it seems that the whole movie is totally horrible, so bad hair! They speak like monotonous voices and nooo chemistry. DVD cover is not really close to the movie. Really, really boring. I had to go ahead with some of them because seeing was so painful. Do I really want to know that someone may think that the earth is good? Hhaha literally speaks and they say "yeah" and there is no passion. I could not say in any way that he was in love. I'm sorry but the excuse for a movie I've ever seen was the worst.
