I'm afraid I do not agree with the majority. I found the latest Spike Lee's boring news! Although he was trying to do something different, that is, just documenting the rise and fall of the series killer, I do not think it worked very well. <br /> <br /> It really happens a bit - relations between Vinny (John) Leguizamo) and Dionna (Mira Sorvino), the lifestyle of Ritchie (Adrien Brody) and then local mafia. The story is good, but in the end you have 2 or 3 stories. How to be a provocative killer Mr Lee did not put more sides in that film? > <br /> <br /> There are some good points. 'Sam of Son', the murderer, with David Berkowitz, is very pleasing (color saturation, etc.) and the performance is very good. <br /> <br /> In general, I felt that the different stories would work well. on their own or without killing them. In the end he was not strong enough. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
