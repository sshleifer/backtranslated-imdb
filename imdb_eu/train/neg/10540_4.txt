Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is the Satan serial killer of "First Power". Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips), a detective and a gas chamber, can also carry the spirit. to keep the body and murder. An attractive psychic Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, half sister of Melanie G.) is trying to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> I think this concept had some options, but ultimately "First. Power" routine is suffering from scripts and movies. This is not before seeing anything, sometimes better. There is no super horror movie to distinguish thrillers from horror. The more point is not very exciting and definitely not terrifying. Phillips sold hard as hard as nails, cynical stereotypes, and it seems that Griffith does not try hard; The best member of the Castana is surely a remarkable feature of Kober, so that what he does best is terribly terrifying. <br /> <br /> The end is pretty stupid and the end is very weak. <br /> <br /> Not acceptable enough. Thus, it must be valued as an average movie: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
