I read the Celestine Prophecy book and I wanted to see the movie. Note that the book is not based on the book. Many interesting book points do not even get the movie. The best is a "B" movie. Many events, many characters, how to interact with the character and the way in the book are just changed or occur. The flow of events that are generated in the book is very gentle, sharp and vision fed like a child. The character development is very poor. Characters book does not match. The direction is similar to a horror film "B". I understand that I would like to present everything in the book that would be provided in the film for six hours, but the gaming base is lacking at many points. Casting was very good.
