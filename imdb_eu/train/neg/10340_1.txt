This is one of the worst movie I have ever seen. I was mainly looking for a certain curiosity through the love of the novel, and I would not like it. I turned it off for less than an hour, but I wanted to turn it off for five minutes later. I wanted it. Many novels reject it and change it to a number of factors. If I did not recover the movie for the last 50 minutes (this would be impossible), I would not recommend it. XX. One of the greatest writers of the century is insulted. I do not think, as many people say, "The Bell Jar" is mandatory, but this could not be done without this specific interpretation. One day I would like to see a director and screenwriter.
