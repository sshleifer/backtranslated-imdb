In my time, I was working on 4-plex "Private Lessons". The break was sold for several weeks on Mondays and Saturdays. I never saw, but I saw that it was a cable last weekend, so I decided to give it a shot. It was one of the worst films I ever saw in the next 90 minutes, and there was one very uncomfortable sight. <br /> <br /> The basic story is a teenager who likes a sexy maid (Sylvia). Kristel). He also seems to feel attractive to the boy, but for malicious reasons. So we get the scenes of the boy looking at his clothes and invite him to continue. And from there it goes. <br /> <br /> Eric Brown, as a teenager, has to be one of the worst actors I have ever seen. The reaction from "horrified" when Sylvia touches a piece of cloth is horrible. I did not laugh in a single time in this trash. <br /> <br /> And let's not start thinking about removing money before the maid and driver. Let's say death falsification, body burying ... I can follow it, but I become more hilarious. <br /> <br /> The worst scene of sex I've ever seen. Although Eric Brown was old, he looked. It's like a baby. Apparently, she does not know how to kiss a woman (maybe doing so, maybe I should think of my criticism again) and that she was just about to be close to child pornography. I have never deactivated it with a scene, though Miss Kristina has not been dressed and dressed beautifully. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER NOTE ** I have to mention the last scene. It's just a plain patient for me, but I can convince the viewer to encourage movies to unfold frozen frames and credits. Our heroine goes back to school and she flirts with a female teacher. He asks dinner and Tom Cruise only looks for it. He affirms his head and walks away, smiling with the camera. THE APPLICATION WILL BE NI! Yes, I am very sure that everyone is going to look for an ordinary teenager who would risk everything. <br /> <br /> I never understood what this movie was in 1982. Certainly it was more because there was much more than nakedness. sex toys were bombarded at the box office. And those teenagers who liked this movie, 22 years ago, think that now they are working on corporate stairs and perhaps they are helping to direct that country. That is a terrifying thought.
