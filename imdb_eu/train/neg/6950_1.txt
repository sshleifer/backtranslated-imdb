We all know, even before the start of the air, Ron Moore's kind of series is not Battlestar Galactica. Okay It only means that he must be alone. It can not be placed on Battlestar Galactica. If any one is good, it's good about his merits, and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If the report is true, Moor is what he wants. However, if his miniature is corrupted, he has shamelessly screened on the screen about the admirable employees on the screen. And he has done that. <br /> <br /> Yes, this mini series is not a restore. I would not call it again. It is a new production inspired by Battlestar Galactica. Galactic is not in the universe, with the same place and jargon and technology. He does not look for the thirteenth tribe of Galaktic. It is also based on the legends and mysteries of the Galactic base. Ron Moore's mini-series is a space-operative action featuring Battlestar Galactica ceremony. Like land, its origins are less or even more interesting. I'll send you the whole thing without a spoiler warning. But I will not think about you. I got the most important point. Are you ready now? Here it is: watch the trailer. It will tell you everything in the story. <br /> <br /> Yes, human creations seek to destroy man and man. (I think the rules of Azimov have been forgotten). They are like humans, so all the foreigners are among us. There is at least no time travel. O, and a lot of battle scenes and sexual actions and random acts. When the final result was drawn by Moore from Galaktica, this ceremonial spirit was brighter than respectful. I mean, can not he think of himself? <br /> <br /> I wanted to see something else from the first minutes. I did not care about Moore characters, I did not identify anyone. In fact, Cylons attacked my face. On the planet of Armageddon planet, and I did not bother. What depressing <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> Moore's heroes faced an insurmountable obstacle, instead of overcoming it, they gathered the tail and kept them at their ends. After all, it was the only way to save mankind, yadda yadda yadda. They took the road safely, instead of putting others at risk of life. At least deodorum is not apathy. <br /> <br /> But eventually, Ron Moore's cycles were nothing more than a non-profit activity, a movie made on a treadmill, running forever and without going through it. And I wanted to finish it. And when it was over, my life strength drove me to me. In front of my will I became a painless and soul-like area, probably like this mini-series seemed like it. I needed to scold myself. I ought to have said that this is true - I had to see a section of Babylon. 5. Both episodes, and I felt much better. And happier.
