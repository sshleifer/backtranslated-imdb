The fun scene of this movie is probably our savior when they get medals, badges and other things. So it's a basic idea, the police beat these gangsters more than one million, but they do not interfere, since the evil guns are bigger. I only think of police ammunition. This movie was fake and all serious and fierce filming in the style documentary, what about those bad guys? They are talking like army newspapers. I accept it, probably, it is still dangerous to be in line with the fire, although this situation has many benefits in your advantage, but do not get bad. And why did he do it for 44 minutes to fix everything? I would say it is surrounded by a long time and allowed to shoot. They are a mere ten meters away, they do not do anything. Then buy larger guns to increase comfort themselves. And then yes, you do not get there, a cop really hits someone. A bullet or something could be diverted. I think it was good to laugh.
