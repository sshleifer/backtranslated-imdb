It was just a matter of time ... the film is in a weak plot, the story is fragmented and it is very violently ending up with a lot of voids ... the animation is higher. <br /> <br /> When I started the movie, I tried to doubt it, it told me later that it was more interesting, but it was never the only one. This plot has been played over and over again, but it was worse that the main hole in the plot was a complete story to kill the evil ... Writers could do so much with the whole concept, but it seemed. He did not have his heart and when the film started to close. <br /> <br /> In general, excessive hype but could not be delivered.
