I'm a fan of Lyncher's work, so I was excited about finding this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very wrong. It is a series of cartoons, an effort to show a disturbing and penetrating sense of humor. The animation is very gross, definitely using Macromedia. Each cartoon plays a similar role to his family to nonsense and generally known. <br /> <br /> People who do not know this line of animation will surely be surprised. However, if you've spent a lot of time in Newgrounds.com, like me, then these cartoons are not anything you've seen before. Many popular Newgrounds fans make it much better than it's on this DVD. If Lynch sends the work to the website, it would connect perfectly with the best Newgrounds artists. On the other hand, since I watched the DVD, instead of Newgrounds, I give it 4/10, instead of 7/10, otherwise I would. The cartoons are adapted to the Internet, but I expected better quality in the story and animation than David Lynch.
