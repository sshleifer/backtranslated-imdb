First of all let's say I'm not a fan of Dukes, but after this movie, the series seemed like Law and Order. The worst thing was Roscoe and Boss Hogg casting. Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse M.C. As Gainey Roscoe, if they had ever seen the show, Roscoe was not a donkey policeman. Barney Fife was more than the role he played in this film. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of common mistakes, when nothing is happening, when the car is broken. The worst example of this is when the General agrees with Billy Prickett, and the General has gone into a dirt slope, of course, who stays near by, but continues to win the race.
