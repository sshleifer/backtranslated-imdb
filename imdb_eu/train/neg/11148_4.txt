It's a good example of a low budget to earn a good story line. Let's bring Samaire Armstrong (after watching OC's work I've seen it better), then find a better script and budget. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so bad and, above all, badly created computers. That he was almost lost in the first time he saw the wolf on the screen. And Samaire Armstrong (alert!) Began to change the man's age, the first time he started changing the bad GCIF before moving on to the image (the Final Fantasy man, as well as Pixar's silent, thought he was a nude Barbie-doll). <br /> <br /> It was an interesting story, but it is not a new idea under the rough man. The balance between the evil ones (maybe) has been introduced, not so bad, and the end of human nature must be aligned with the two lines. The underlying "male lobes" of other characters were effectively effective, but it could be more effective in explaining what was happening in the past. <br /> <br /> Bring better script and direction, and I would come back.
