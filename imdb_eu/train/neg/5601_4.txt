It was directed by Lucio Fulci, who liked Claudio Cassinelli as an actor. I was definitely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The overwhelming idea of ​​fighting prisoners for television ratings was Rollerball, Logan's Run, Blade Runner and Death Race. I'm here for Jason Statham in star. <br /> <br /> This was usually boring. The "Kill Bike" action was ridiculous. It was a repetition of "training". He never caught me and wanted me to care about anyone, about Jared Martin or Fred Williamson about the "Dallas" star. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
