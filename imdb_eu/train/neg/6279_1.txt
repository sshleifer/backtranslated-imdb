No, <br /> <br /> Essentially you see something unwise. If you do not want people to really want to spoil the movie, I will explain it. I'll take a look at the story. <br /> <br /> Every day, the normal woman walks down the street and then drives herself her own car. He continues his followers and there are many events that include him and his family during that period. <br /> <br /> In particular, I made an account to comment on this movie. The performance was very good, the events were very good, but the story did not bring any; It has grown tremendously and it will become an epidemic around the world. I do not know what the writer was trying to do, usually at the end of the film, most of your questions get answers, but this film asks you what happened and it's just 1 hour and 20 minutes. <Br> <br /> Spoiler Home__ <br /> <br /> We would enter our world and kill us in a two-dimensional space (our backspace). He did not practice during the film, and it never happened, nor did it happen or what happened. There's nothing to be said about the film. The main character should not be the main character either. At the end of the film, the boy who represents everything at the end (his sister's boyfriend) should be the main character but unfortunately the movie will end after 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for 10 dollars, then I pulled it ... do not waste your time. I really hope that something like this is not done again.
