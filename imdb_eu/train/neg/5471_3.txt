Typical Troma Trash, a 80-year-old movie called "The Toxic Avenger", is considered one of the "remarkable" renowned production companies of Lloyd Kaufman a year earlier. If you're asking "The Toxic Avenger" is much more, but this demented splatter-flick is, however, sustainable; make sure you have the full capacity of yourself at the door. The events take place in Tromaville, which is a small town that is proud to be among the world's most toxic chemicals and certainly not a lie. The nuclear safety measures of the local nuclear power station are not equivalent, at least (even if Homer Simpson was never there) and toxic waste reaches a near-secondary level. The first poisoning victim is a stereotyped nerd who starts to grow green from all his limbs, but his death is an accident, because he had less than two microwave oven in the home! Oh humanity! Shortly thereafter, nuclear leak also has an impact on school planting, and it starts with a really bad thing. After smoking together in a party, the most beautiful couple in school creates a giant worm that builds up in the basement and eats a teenage plague. "Nuke 'em High class" is the bottom of the horror film of the cannon, since conversations are so absurd that they damage their ears and create a new meaning that gives a meaning to the word completely new. If you let your faces melt, if you like to crush or split it, this is a must! Unlike the aforementioned "The Toxic Avenger", this movie is really at times very significant, something that really matters, such as Chrissy and Warren to find out what happens with their hormones. Raw humor is not as effective as "Toxic Avenger" and it's staged. Keep up if you're a fan of Troma fanatic.
