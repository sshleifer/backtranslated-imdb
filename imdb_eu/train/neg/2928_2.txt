I really wanted to see the movie I wanted and I waited a few months with our Blockbuster Total Access access. When it appeared in our mailbox, I directly played it on the DVD player. <br /> <br /> I was sadly disappointed, and that made me mad. I will give it to any movie, even if I want to get out of the theater or stop it. By the way I saw it, but I did not get anything but frustration. <br /> <br /> The effect was very, very good, but that was what it was about. Nothing explains; As Mathieu's understanding and a bit of psychosomics come into play, we never know her "disaster." While we understand that Cedric breaks down, we do not see it happen or why it happened. With an interview with Mathieu's physician, Cedric revealed that he once deceived, but it was not great. I wanted to see this flashback, but not - anything. He also warns Cedric that he was going to bring Mat to the hospital - but again, we do not see. <br /> <br /> I know some films are "taken as a basis". , but this film honors me honestly. Pierre, when the ex-team of Cedric reveals himself and starts trouble, does not hide or see his hair until he reaches the end, and I needed some time to think that Pierre was old. The club's identity and Mat's encounter is very different. Maybe I should be wrong saying this, it was confusing. <br /> <br /> Knowing all the films and what you expect from an unbalanced, false and confusing rhythm. I can continue with films such as 'Pi', 'Citizen Kane', and flashbacks / flash forward left-to-right, but CU does not support and hold the style. At the end of 'Citizen Kane', you know what's wrong and you know the main mystery response. CU just hangs on you. It has a great expectation, "we will tell you a damn thing, imagine yourself" in the presentation. It's like reading a book by changing chapters and missing pages. <br /> <br /> Impact, as I said. I liked the character, but the story was very disappointing.
