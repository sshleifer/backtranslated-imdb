When the first version of DeMille's 10 Commands was filmed, when the DeMille sets were found in the desert, the first version of DeMille's first command released to the US television movie about the curse of the ancient Egyptian. The movies I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Is the film director serious or joking when they made this movie? If this is serious, film laughably bad and a wonderful movie about his iniquity. If a comedy is less, but funny for all the wrong reasons. You will laugh long and hard in this movie, probably much more than the Hollywood "comedy".
