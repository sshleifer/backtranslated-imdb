... To be badly bad ... <br /> <br /> This gem has been shot directly by the MST3 to the big screen. It is clear that the film is not trying to take seriously (fortunately, their purpose, however ...), the movie is still bad. Hell, Leprechaun in Space looks great with a budget ... <br /> <br /> In short: paint my muscle car to clear the coloring!
