This kind of "inspiration" of Sakarina is sufficient to be sick. He telegraphs feelings like the greatest terrestrial traffic lights. The audience removes their interpretation and feeling, making their choices. The master finishes swims in the orchestration, as if it were to work like a jumper cable in a dead car; I think such questions require you to see just how stupid a bit a movie is as simple and spectacular as a movie. Streep shines and asks you if you really feel the depth or just that ... a screen, turned on and turned off like a light. I can not see life like me for such a frivolous movie. Even though it is based on a real story, and I am sure that this is an inspirational source, training, execution and performances as a third-party television movie or middle school secondary drama.
