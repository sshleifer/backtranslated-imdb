Hello, I'm a friend of the white men, and when I saw the titles of Darkwolf hitting the shelves, "I was the minimum name I was, simple and pleasing. Althou ... I wonder why I have not heard it before." <br /> <br /> First, the movie begins with tits. Tits Tads are the quote for almost all movies. Who cares for the male effect, just pay the actress to get enough topless plans! <br /> <br /> So, darkwolf is a mysterious character (before little spoilers, but they really care about it) .... It's your average daily. biker It's not a very strong look, but as the old woman said, the movie "is far stronger than ever before." It's just a description of a tattered biker. Fairly original I looked again at "red glittering eyes" EFFECTIVELY! I mean, my god, who uses "effect letters-red-dot-like-with-the-computer" from the 70's. Here's a pure look! And do not start with 3D-CGI wasps. As you say before, it's like old and bad video games. <br /> <br /> And, finally, as I said, like men's films. They will always create a slaughter legend on their own. Darkwolf also built a world of human beings around the stupid legend of Hybrid Red and Old Men. BUT Almost immediately creating rules of commitment and "the dying moment that kills the girl that touches it" begins with a random bar. That does not make any sense, why they complain about the rules of the murder, even if they did not play ... Aplus wings flat shots are made with a handycam or something. , mainly shooting the floor and walls. Add the moving noises, and you're a great male effect. Gore is partly well. But when the wolf oppresses all the open hands, it's just tricky for me on the victims, it's not a trick for me ... <br /> <br /> Really, the WHO makes money out. Do not make disused free video clips, they're not fun movies too bad, sad
