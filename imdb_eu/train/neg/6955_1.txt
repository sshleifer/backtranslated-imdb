I see the appeal of this series (it's science fiction). Really, "let's see what soap happens this week" and oh, Cylons participates in the flashback. <br /> <br /> Another type is Cylon's "babe", but it's quite obvious that the T & A show was added to it. Whenever I go ahead, I suppose I'm confused about WTF happening. And do not try to think of "story arches." <br /> <br /> Some CGI is a toy. This is not the science fiction being the original premise. <br /> <br /> This series is not everything that has been worked on. Moderator, edgy, dodgy, jumpy, editor-crack camera job sharpened, this show will be for you. It seems like nerds about this show, as Picard's TNG spokesman voiced the opinions of voices.
