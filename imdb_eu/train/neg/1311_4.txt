He listens to a terrific story of Jerry Spies Tom and repels his nemesis. <br /> <br /> I did not find anything funny to find: it seemed like humor was deliberate and it was full. kinda lame (Jerry is basically a "bad", that is, it's impeding Tom poorly for no special reason). <br /> <br /> Sometimes it seems to be an inspirational source (for example, Tomen's "hearts" is a literal experience, and his nine lifestyles absorb his body), but in general, this effort is frantically frantic, excellent animation and T Most of J's's cartoons are missing out of mind.
