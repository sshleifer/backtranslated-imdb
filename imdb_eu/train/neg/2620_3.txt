After seeing the new version of 1996, Cruella De Vil thought it was a more entertaining way to punish herself for torturing her skin. The movie was really fun and I think it was better than it was animated. But there was no second need. First of all, if Cruel returned, do not heal and crazy again. Just let the prison away from her and it's a rap. I thought it was really fun. Only one original dog is supposed to be returned. I hope he was lucky, because he was the most attractive and also Roger and Anita. However, they decided to make a complete refurbishment, and not really a hundred, nor a hundred and two, but only three THREE, and the growth is a dog (light). It was part of Gerard Depardieu. In the end, Cruella suffers much, in a very humble and excessive way to be true. It is baked inside a huge cake. The desperate despair of physical humor was trying to imitate the first effect. That did not work. It was an overabundance and not very fun. I'm sorry about Cruella.
