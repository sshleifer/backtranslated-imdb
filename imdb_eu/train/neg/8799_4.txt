Paul Muni is sorry for patience, giving him hours of hours every hour to see Zola's makeup room. Muni was one of the greatest stars in the 1930's and today I am asking myself how many people nowadays know more than classical films. It was a giant business for at least a decade. He won the Academy Award for this screening, which he was given two rows, before winning Louis Pasteur. In my opinion, while it was a bit accelerating, I still believe that it was one of the "Golden Age" actors. He played it in any part; You look at the screen when you see it. Unlike Pasteur's role, I thought that something we saw in the last 60 years was so amazing: a hero for a liberal ship. In 1937, even though Hollywood could not disregard the police or military contempt, it has been told that these organizations are "damaged". Filmmakers just love when the authority is questioned and defeated. In this regard, this movie is very important these days, since we have seen this big time since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> However, it must be remembered that events are protected by this story. Also, Zola is not reducing the achievements made as a social reformer, because it does not eliminate certain ills. Good I'd like to show more time than just having a single test.
