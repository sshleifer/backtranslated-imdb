* Spoilers * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is a great critique of media obsession with violence. But this fake movie does not take into account. Oliver Stone could show his murderers innocent and inhuman killers, with innocent people, and he contrasted it with a fascinating media. Instead, it justifies it. They portray the movies that kill people all over the world. In cross-stereotyping, Stone's victims present unpleasant cartoons - red mumps, broken English-speaking immigrants, vain people. Fairy pests is a stereotype. No doubt the American American Indians, who use hallucinogens, can help us - are they fashionable, kind? Let's make an admirable character. Fat, Chinese officials and "hicks" are uncool, so let's say it's worth it to kill. Their hate and hateful ones, which are damaged by their wickedness, think they are happier and love them. Mickey and Mallory are sexy and cool and surrealists are there to impress more people. Justice is mockery. Police and prison officials say they are gigantic and ugly against the GQ killers. Again, this is not part of the film's media reports, but the "reality" of the film. There are no nuances or nuances, interpretations and audiovisuals in the film. The film does not have anything new or important about the obsession of violence. The evidence that the film fails in its message lies in the real world reactions. Impressive young men who watched this film committed themselves to the inspiration of murders. The "message" of the movie is a failure, because people have tremendous real life results. The clear message has never been seen.
