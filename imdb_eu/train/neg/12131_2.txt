Kevin Spacey is very talented, but unfortunately he is not keen to direct it. I had a great deal of hope about the film before I rented it and maybe it was not for me. I mostly take the Spacey essay to make a movie that I do mostly in a small space, but it does not try. I found the movie sad, boring and long. The performance was not spectacular. Gary Sinise has done much better, especially since she is conscious of her most films. Skeet Ulrich was a disappointment, but it was one of his first films (I have come up with a ridiculous young man who watched Scream's star). The only thing that impressed me about this movie was the destruction of the car. The center line of the road was perfectly centered and walked across the camera line and overwhelmed. However, this film was a very "Usual Suspects" ish and my invention has been the idea of ​​Spacey from his first film, which is very good. If you want to see the wonderful movie that's made in a small atmosphere, watch Hitchcock's Lifeboat. Perhaps Spacey should have watched it before shooting it.
