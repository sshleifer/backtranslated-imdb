In all the history of the low budget. the movie must be the worst. It's true that some of the movie's pretty movies, but it's really great. I can not understand what a person could not run a bunch of slugs. I mean, they have to be the slowest creatures on the planet. The only part that deserves this film is the slugs that try to kill the male finger. That was pretty fun.
