David Mackenzie continues the film Young Adam, trying to be a bad story of a lonely voyeur trying to face some psycho-sexual problems with his mother's mother. He wants to be gritty, realistic, and mysterious. At the same time, he wants to have fun and judgment over his disturbed head as he settles for an adult. <br /> <br /> To achieve this goal, the film tries to be young. His poster is similar to Juno. The original soundtrack is indie rock and Hallam is well-intentioned to convince the audience; a bit wrong. Curiously, it's just the youngest movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> As a young Adam, this is a woman who is half the mystery of this movie. Young Adam keeps his mystery quietly, the observer, and is bored with the truth that comes with the truth. Hallam Foe makes the opposite. The character publishes its psychosis so light and so early, doing nothing outside of the unexpected parameters. Inauguration scene Hallam is in his tree house, seeing his sister deceived by her boyfriend. Hallam soon stops at home. Here we see everything Hallam will do for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The mysterious miscarriage of his mother indicates whether or not her father's boyfriend is killed or killed. Audiences have never felt Hallam confidently, despite being a great sign, he thinks his obsession has been mad. This mysterious item has hinder me because Hallam is occasionally casual. He has found some remnants that admit his claim to the rule outside of the home, seems to be looking for police first. Afterwards, a girl who looks like a mother comes out in a hurry. This story moves away from the mysterious element. <br /> <br /> While Jamie Bell shows her untouched character, she is confined. according to the evident psychological needs. This movie is not mysterious. However, it is not sharp. He tries to be realistic in these matters, but adds self-rigid opposites. Trainspotting is a solid soundtrack to help the audience developer, build buildings, locks and campaigns to get voyeurism. The urban adventures conceived by Hallam are very difficult to engage a teeming young girl who is not sexy, dark or pleasing. They are more neutral than anything else; Improve the character or story. Mackenzie understands Hallam, but still does not build a common foundation. <br /> <br /> You can enjoy Hallam's tests and difficulties without much ideological justification. The film focuses on the perspective that protects the audience from the point of view. Of course, most people would be tired. And Hallam Foe realizes it, but Hallam does not see the weight of his moral decisions. He goes from one person to another, trying to fill his deep gap. Hallam's interest in Kate is a particularly disturbing line that says "I love my beloved girls," and perhaps asks the audience to do the same. The line tries to foresee its understanding (its motivation is still very vague) and tries to try to judge ourselves. It's not hard to like Hallam, but it's hard to get involved in his adventure - it's also an adventure. Meanwhile, the film uses a flamboyant soundtrack to conceal its mood inaccurate. <br /> <br /> The show is cleansed by a movie developed with a faint third action, with great purity and sense from Mackenzie. Recently, this film was nominated for the US premiere and why? Not only does it lessen, but it's a hard truth that Hallam's character is never a "mystery".
