The film loves the image of 30 to 40 years. I love Salma Hayek. I was prepared to love this picture. but . . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No sir, there's nothing good about it. The only fun aspect for me is Colin Farrell's character, unstable writer, and although this script is a subject of racism, he approaches ABC Afterschool Special. <br /> <br /> <br /> Only one person was like Sutherland "acting", and there were only a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Approaching a tired plot.
