I do not know what George Schlatter's public director wants to sell this comedic patient. With Redd Foxx and the overwhelming role of the 1970's on the rugs and polyester rugs, "Norman" acts as an image of blasphemy, along with some episodes of malicious comedies that have mischievous comics, to cite a long way in Waylon Flowers! According to a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, the story of an unmarried spouse (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) is a tough way to learn to be gay - and live with rotation, guarding white homosexuals. -Christian jokes to embarrass the first episode of "Three's Company". Bailey maintains dignity, and Foxx's confusion is good for two to laugh, but the rest of the performers are humiliated. * ****
