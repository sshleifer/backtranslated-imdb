I do not get a single comment on this movie for the movie, how to lower the Jewish character of this film and how to jump a little baby as a pistol with a racist face pointed the black character of the film down the gun's canoe. <br /> <br /> I do not know how anyone views college life as a balanced account. I agree that the universities do not tolerate bastions, and the title would be appropriate if Singleton did not have his caricature full of his characters. <br /> <br /> He tries to portray Ice Cube's character. It was a bad remy that became a skinhead racist. But who will end up at the end of the film's epilogue? It seems that Singleton warns him to whiten him (I do not say no sympathy) or that his black fellow is capable of taking the path of a racist "skinhead" or a student. Many people of other racially harassed people do not go to the extreme limbs. <br /> <br /> Women who have not been raped also go to lesbianism, that is, worship is more worship than lifestyle. Honestly, what happened?
