Minion is ... well, generous. A Satan server and its purpose is to get the key to unlocking the door that is trapped. It is a kind of demonic possessor of human beings and one body that dies when one dies. Everyone who is aware will make some ravenous rage. Dolph Lundgren plays with Lukas, a member of a secret order of temples. The movie began a thousand years ago in the Middle East, where a couple of Knights Templar escaped. Then, let's move on in 1999, where the underground keys of New York create somewhere. An archaeologist is assigned to investigate the place where the key was found. There is no need to say, after being generous after the key, and the generous movie becomes a scene that follows Lukas and the archaeologist. <br /> <br /> The movie is a low-budget B-movie. . The film is lacking energy and it simply strikes it. You will still be in Chase, but you will never feel involved in the previous movies (especially the Terminator movie). The flower-scene minions is troublesome, you never know how good or how evil an evil war is in this demon. "Skilfully" he becomes a single-man army fighting a group of temples, but suddenly he is. And for a long time it is supposed to be around. All this shows that the sense of logic is merely facilitating the removal. The whole idea of ​​a secret order of the Templars, the hell gate, and the key is not clear. We have to admit that they exist only. It seems that the film created with a feeling of no great capacity for film, but enough money to make. Dolph Lundg surely seemed to be somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Judgment: 5 stars of 2 stars.
