This review also has a first movie spoiler. So if you do not see the movie and you do not want it, but you do not want a spoiler, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> While it is believed that the film should be the first time in Christianity and Kathryn, the film is a bad copy of the first cruel inventions. The actors that represented Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn, however, are very substitute accessories. The proud and inadequate attitude of rich and wealthy people from the original actors can also be made. It's totally awful that some of these conversations were literally - not so much in Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen well, you will discover it. There are also inconsistencies on the plot - this was really Christian and Kathryn's first meeting, then why is Christian in love with the end of the movie at the end of a movie? Seen, for the first time, he was originally in love with the movie (with Reese Witherspoon's character). <br /> <br /> Also, it was a connection with photography / "That could be a model". At the end it was totally bad and did not add anything. In general, this movie was a waste of time. I can not believe Krudel Put 3
