I called HBO almost a year ago and my money was asked a month ago because they ventilated this movie. I can see the cinema director sitting around, "Well, we have to come up with something like Home Alone, we'll add a bunch of money only, cut off by the actors, and we'll do it a lot more fun!" <br /> <br /> Okay Maybe it's not the last part, but that's basically what you're saying here. Although it is not worth the rent of someone else. And as a movie for kids? Forget I would not see my children see this, nor the bad sense of jokes, but I would not say: "What did you think of showing that sharp litter, dad?!"
