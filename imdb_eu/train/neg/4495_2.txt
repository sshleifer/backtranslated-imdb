Through this and the matrix's followers. <br /> <br /> I liked a lot of original Matrix. Although a short film was not about to philosophize Fishburne, but it was very good, it was fun, and I had a smooth fight in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> Originally, the secret life of Neo was the unfortunate Anderson cube worker. By day, corporate drone, and at night, brave hackers. In the end, at last, he has had to choose between these things with his actions - if the machine is to become illegal in the fight or return to a safe and unforgettable world that begins. It is interesting that he discovers it after being cut off by excitement. life is pretty rough. She has her girlfriend on her side and her assistant friends, but processed swill, she eats dresses dresses, and really skungy a little bit of a machine. However, he frees the truth. <br /> <br /> The main parts of this first movie are at least one of the "what would have happened" problems created by the viewer. What would happen _I_ impossible? What if "One" happened. It does not matter what you're the only example like you, because it has such titles. <br /> <br /> In addition, Smith's agent was a bad boy, full of fear of the authority. they take us As a terminator he was constantly restless and merciless. <br /> <br /> At the end of the matrix, he has to return to Neo Matrix to share the good news of freedom. <br /> <br /> This film tries to complete the film's original movie ideas, yet it does not work well, such as inadequate scriptwriting and editing, I can not believe that these changes were foreseen. When the conversation is on the fifth level, with random words, it is difficult to understand what they think they say. <br /> <br /> A short list of my characterizations: <br /> <br /> A very useful Oracle, which is the worst case without any real reason, includes the "great personalities" of the matrix - for example, it was the keymaster Nice idea, but not an interesting character. <br /> <br /> Fishburne loses his "consultant" role and replaces nothing. <br /> <br /> People are not particularly fond of them, nor are they really capable of running the world. <br /> <br /> Special effects problems: <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes are vain and incomprehensible. In The Matrix, you think that Neon was going to lose, and he had to have something to survive. The Matrix Reloaded is just the point of view of a particularly badly-drawn video game. <br /> <br /> The fight on the highway was quite fake and it was not interesting. <br /> <br /> Pacing problems. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the fighting scenes were constantly stopping. <br /> <br /> It was a long time enjoyment: looking at the watch in the theater in all of my watchful eyes. Because we do not dance and good looks, but because we do not know people without images, or even care. <br /> <br /> Any hack creator monologue should be blacklisted from that business. The writer used the words he did not understand clearly and was a waste of time and a killer stimulant. The creator's talk could be tenth times, and "Sion could have a higher risk of going out of the rebels to avoid the destruction of the Matrix. There are too many people who do not believe it, the matrix is ​​there to risk killing all other people, the Earth can not even sion. Suppose, even less, others. You can choose a person from Zion to create a new Sion while cleaning the memory. People in the array. "<br /> Instead, we've got a long and long range. If someone has a deep argument, ask for a transcript and try to break phrases. Each of these clauses is too long, and uses words that are lighter and shorter than synonymous. <br /> <br /> So short, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I saw the third, and although many reviewers said they jumped. This turkey does not store. Second and third films, who believe that "deep" reviewers have to see some deep movies. Perhaps read a book or two rhetoric and debate, and maybe a bit of philosophy. This movie is not difficult to understand, but it is difficult for the stomach. Scott
