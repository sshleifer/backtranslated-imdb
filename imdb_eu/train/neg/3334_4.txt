When I was a teenager I was terribly afraid. Now, it's more fun than being terrifying, but with some pretty dismembering moments and a quintessential quality. And, think, the plot is really boring ... but it is worked out with some tastes. If there is a problem with this movie, HANDIEE voids are exciting or interesting. In the same way, the ending continues forever, in order to be a tremendously potentially tremendous rise in a short period of time, Barbara Bache looks a little bit screaming and screaming. The "monster", when borne, is not very scary, sadly. The appearance of the movie does not work a bit, something that appears more than something made for theaters as a television stage. But nowadays it is an example of rarely made movies, so I ask that fans of horror feel and feel nostalgic.
