I tried to like Slasher, as I try to enjoy all slasher movies. I mean to die without a head, with a little nudity and a little suspense, how you can go wrong. But I think Unhinged is mistaken for an example of that formula. The main theme is the great performance of the three big girls at home. As they were under sedation, I'm never really interested in their situation. The movie wants suspense and creepiness, but those in the direction of numbers peel them, leaving the movie pretty dull. It's a pity, even if the movie was going to be better, that would be it. The story and the characters are incredibly terrible and there are dark and curious interactions between mothers, girls, and old daughters. It's a good nod and bleeding is occasional, so it's not enough to make the shot to the movie. It's finally twisted and terrifying, and it gives you a great movie lift, but unfortunately it's too late. So, in my opinion, it should be avoided if you do not really love slasher dark movies. There are many potentials, but there is little film that deserves to be worth it.
