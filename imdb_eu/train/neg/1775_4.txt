Based on the story of Stephen King's horror writer, "Sleepwalkers", known as ancient and cats-like creatures, are life-sized lifestyles that support this energy with supernatural abilities. "This means that they make them invisible and they can create subliminal wonders that fool people" in a country that has to sleep, sleep in their sleepers and feed their virgins. Mother sends her son to enroll in local school to find a virgin (Madchen Amick) and tries to get himself alone. It is not clear why the mother can not seek the virgin herself; It would make things easier for a pretty young girl who follows a young teenage girl who could imagine to fall into a pretty old woman. However, her plans are frustrated by the girls struggling back, sticking her pencil in the ear. Police are called and there is a hunt! The son is suffering from illnesses and hides his mother from dying and hiding his hunts for a girl who spoils her children and releases some amazing toys. In the end, the girl dies at the end of the mother's movie. This movie is nasty! The performance is variable, Brian Krause's average, Alice Krige. The special effects are averages, and they show some initial computer effects, which are very interesting as they have progressed so much over time as these things progress. Direction is mixed and the movie falls into some places. The director does not know if we were sure to sleep with the sleepwalkers we need to sleep or undoubtedly make the movie hysterical. Stephen King makes a nice atmosphere as an annoying gardener, as with Mark Hamill, as a confused policeman. Alice Krige seems to overcome the movie, gives her a great deal of character, and she can see what she might be like with a better script and better direction for the movie.
