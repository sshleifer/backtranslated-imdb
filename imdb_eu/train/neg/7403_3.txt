This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but we can say that. It starts with a good atmosphere; The hospital is sterile and strange, humor is "horrible". And then ... nothing. Well, something. There are some things that are not clearly included ... and there is no effort to make it clear between the trivia and the hospital, which is not particularly frightening. I mean, okay, biker duds? Some bandwidths saw Gwar too much. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite was a demon leader, especially when the middle-class truck was looking for a threat. To step down into the Afghanistan coated sofa, undo the belt, get a clean beer (probably Schlitz) and watch the game. Honestly, I've seen a lot of truck trucks. On trucks. Drink coffee WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Fear !! <br /> <br /> The other monsters are cartoon and even less scary. At least, on the DVD, video shows an explanation of the presence of the hospital ... apparently, in some places they appear randomly, they play "metal" bippy and people will be a bit dead. In the face of certain special effects, and this is not absolutely terrible due to the lack of decent writing, there is nothing here. The background noise is a movie.
