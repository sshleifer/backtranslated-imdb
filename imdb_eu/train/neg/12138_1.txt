Serious HOME ALONE / KARATE KID is attacked by terribly bad stereotypes and then filmed by writers. He could almost recognize the use of men without use at all times. Oh, and theater is also horrible. Although I have to say, the line: "Sorry, dude, big dump I have to take the big time" my laughter made me laugh.
