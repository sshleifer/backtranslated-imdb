First of all, I really loved Henry Fool, that is, I got into a swimmable pool of fans. Parker Posey is one of today's best-selling actresses. This film, however, was a huge hobby. About the actors who talked about Hartley and actors - so gifted and star wars, like Star Wars, was an rotation of the stomach. This was the maximum part of the producers (HDNET). The true example of the Emperor and his new clothes. Mostly, I think Halk HENRY FOOL has broken. I do not think I can see it again in innocent and vacant light. <br /> <br /> Remember Hal, you can scared people for a while ... etc. The director would not have done anything that he had done today if he were to get rid of nonsensical rubbish. Unfortunately, this is an example of ADAPTATION's lesson. The story has to be exciting and active, or at the box office they are hopefully dark. No matter what a decent story. For actors, it was like trying to act in an outfit. <br /> <br /> The score is Hartley's supposed score. Together with the battery that works in the dialog box. I found an Apple Soundtrack loop that gave me a smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw the trailer, I thought, oh, trying to get another audience. But this is really ridiculous. I would be happy if you wanted to break this movie, but it was done. It's upset FOOL franchise died Live Henry Fool.
