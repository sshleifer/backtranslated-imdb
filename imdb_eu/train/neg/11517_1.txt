I really liked the movie, because they are very cunning critics <br /> <br /> (at least) ... but it was horrible. It's very awesome Improperly <br /> <br /> play, handwritten, rumor direction ... This movie was like watching <br /> <br /> like watching car crash. You want to look, but you still look <br> /> <br /> you want to see what is wrong. Well, the car is damaged and there is no survivor. In a positive sense, cinematography <br /> <br /> was nice, I wanted to go on vacation, to clean myself for cleaning myself.
