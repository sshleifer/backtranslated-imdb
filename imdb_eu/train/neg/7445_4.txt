Very sad drama Roddy McDowall is a very young man, who prepares a wild Flicka horseback, and watching the movie is the only reason in the first place. Covered with loud and noisy musicals and weighs the conversation by schmaltzy, this is one of those films that is bored by the point of a headache. A second track called "Thunderhead, Flicka Son", McDowall trains the next generation, is higher than the original one, but it's still a slow rhythm and it still sends you the score, at least. One or two scenes that can be commas.
