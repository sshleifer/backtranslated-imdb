I've seen this small opus magnum for the first time, on one of these DVDs that seem to be everywhere today, and I can not afford to have that much pace. For those who have never seen this incredible Mexican import, and for those who do not want to see anyone who has not seen it, it's definitely the biggest spoiler. So if you're one of those strangers, stop reading at the same time and go and see yourself. If you drink it beforehand, it will be lucky before you pass it. <br /> <br /> The premise of getting started, a man would turn it into a long way, after a while had bite. It's never been said about how this movie setting works, and the rest of the movies are even meaningless. But throw yourself a cup of wine (or whatever you drink) and continue. <br /> <br /> Paul Naschy (our man's lupus) looks like a man struggling against pain. The only dentist exchanged his Novocaine supply in the cheap whiskey, and then he was drunk. (Is not it lucky?) Naschy's facial expression has never changed, put on make-up or away, and, apparently, nobody gave me training to act like wrinkled men. Occasionally Lon Chaney Jr. Crouch tries to imitate, but most of all his mafia walks in black t-shirt, like a dude over his facial hair. In order to be fair, this makeup is better than the actor, but the continuity is much worse. I'm changing the shirts that change the T-shirt by Naschy in a male wolf. From the black shirt to the red shirt, then he goes back to black and then red, then back to black, everything in a frozen night. Interestingly, Chaney's face always wears a red shirt and he's wearing a black shirt. And only in the red shirt is the anger mentioned in the title. I think there's something about that red shirt that comes out of the animal itself. <br /> <br /> So, after a bite of polycassin yeti, the poor schmuck returns home from Tibet, his wife knows he slept with a student. Two unloving lovers try to kill him by adjusting the car's brakes. It has slipped away and it's time to complete the moon. Then, after cheating on his wife and his lover, he walks again, and in some way he elects it. But is it enough? Can sorrow cause pain to rest? It is not an option. An alleged scientist has resurrected an S / M hardcore hardcore, known as "The Doctor" (and, undoubtedly, Who's who is not a new physician). He puts it in force and takes it to his chivalrous castle, drives it to a dungeon and hangs it on the wall and gives it a dizziness. Evidently, this violent chain should be enough to embrace any furious anger. <br /> <br /> After two strokes, he spends most of his films on our wolfman castle. to find the solution. (And who can blame him?) During his travels he finds incredibly incoherent topicals, including a man dressed in medieval armor, a mysterious curious Phantom Opera (presumably physician's father) and a tough one. - Participation of slave members. <br /> <br /> So, what is it that can reasonably be asked? The control of intelligence is something that is unthinkable, and doctors call something "chemotrode." (Best guess. I really do not know how it's written, if any). Mercy, the failure of the experiment is over, and more importantly, it ends ... before it is done. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is no sense of such a kind of film, but at least it must laugh. This is not. Forget, friend. There is a creator of anarchy about that movie, the tequila stroke and its stunning dramatization and incredible musical games, that is, dissipates MST3K sessions that try to spread any type. If that's not good at all, what's the hell good? If the revenge of Montezuma was digitally remastered in some way and would be placed on a DVD, it would be similar to that movie.
