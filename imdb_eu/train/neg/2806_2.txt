Worst film type. Basically, the US Independence Expression was replaced with a plasma screen which deceived the security of the museum for several days. Eh? <br /> <br /> Theoretically, the screen will last less than 2 seconds at least once a day, so that it is sufficiently small to provide a non-current internal resistance. > <br /> It could be possible with a car battery and a dozen inverters, but this system would not fit in. Sorry, it's anal, but that's not unbelievable. The rest of the movie is not much better, and I wondered why the budget could not be given to charity or me.
