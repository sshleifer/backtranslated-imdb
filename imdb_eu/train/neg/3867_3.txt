Oh, the story about the comic book Paul (Jason Lee), after the solitaire night, wakes up in bed with Becky (Julia Stiles), an attractive blonde who met tonight. After losing his daughter's daughter Karen (Selma Blair), he is increasingly forced to tell lies to cover his tracks. <br /> <br /> I am sure that this testimony has been ours. At least once in the movie or on the TV ... The movie formula and PREVIOUS is foreseen, and you will see the end of it. <br /> <br /> At least, the play offers some interests and keeps the clock. Lee is just right, and Stiles is very different from the very serious roles he plays heartily. Becky is a free spirit that changes jobs, as others change clothes. <br /> <br /> But you know, that's not exactly spelled out. At least one question remains unanswered: what is it about Ray (Lochlyn Munro), Becky's young boy? <br /> <br /> And I did not like the nature of Bucken. (David Koechner), baptism of Paule; The nerves were so badly wicked as the wizard, I asked someone to ask if I had to punch. <br /> <br /> Add another debit: Larry Miller, a comedian or actress, free and not accredited. grouch (in this case, justified a bit - his character is ultra conservative minister). <br /> <br /> It's not good at all, but, as usual, I give it a ten. Only the efforts of a cast.
