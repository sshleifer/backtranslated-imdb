The only antichrist could have been behind the disaster. That irony is just a motivational force behind the "film"! This movie was very bad, he had to register with the IMDb in the end, it could get it scratched. This movie is even more tragic, such as having a great source of material! I have never seen the movie all the elements that were so grotesquely medium, so that the result would be less so than the amount of the results. <br /> <br /> Looks like it seems empty, but I want to start scoring. . I'm proud of a music title owner, I have to register my indignation! When I was torn between laughter and dry, I heard John Scheffer make a great score for Goldsmith; It was much more terrible than a burlesque death, and almost like a little comedy. The lowest score I've heard so far is, of course, I can not think it's any worse. Maybe JAWS 4? <br /> <br /> In the plot ... Sorry. Mysticalism of the new era ??? What happened to the wonderful realism of the original trilogy? In those films (even before the third, but still !!), it was mostly influenced by supernatural, and that film was so incredibly incredible. Here we can see black crystals (all Skeksis and Mystics are called!) And reverse cruises are much larger, although some scenes were normal for crosspieces, but for an angular camera. The psychological disorder is touching the tangible mix of the psyche handling group: its place is a "face slap" recycled topic and incompetence transparent. Add to that the innovative "actor", so unbelievable ANNOYING, to thank the director for the scene that is missing. I have never seen a little girl so angry that little Stephanie since ALL FAMILIES. <br /> <br /> In addition, I do not feel strong about the subject ;-) Fortunately, the first three films are quite skillful. This unnecessary cellulose rail rupture is not relevant or, in most cases, a study of how to make a movie. Watch out for the audience! Congratulations!
