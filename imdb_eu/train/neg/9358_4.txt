Since the start of the movie, there is disagreement. As this film takes place in the borders of Normandy and the Middle East, and it is also an international film, we would expect the correct accents to be underlined. This is not the case in most American sounds. I also find the story of the play very well, the story from the beginning. Who is who Otherwise, the film is very accurate in costumes and landscapes. If you want to see a movie similar to what was happening in the past (even if there was a lack of accent), this film is worth a lease. If you're looking for a movie like Heaven of Kingdom, look elsewhere.
