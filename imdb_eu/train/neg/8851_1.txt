Did Joe Dante's original "THE HOWLING" (1981) original from Joe Dant? so I was not particularly interested in seeing one of his followings; Long ago, I caught HOWLING III: THE MARSUPIALS (1987)? the same director himself? and I saw that it is a clock, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> In the second half, however, it has a bad idea and I know I would have a good time? Especially from the horror icons, Christopher Lee looks bright in the middle of everything (the star of the old star has repeatedly confirmed that he did not appear on horror routines since its inception, the last picture of Hammer Films in 1976!). In any case, this movie should have "Your Movie Is A Turd" subtitle? Surprisingly inept at all departments (starting with men's big makeup)! <br /> <br /> The picture (and the interview) is not only horrible, but does it have a close relationship with Dante? Surprisingly, he wrote the author of the original novel by Gary Brandner! However, is it undeniable for the film (shorts ...) of useless elliptical edition? It looks like a whole style, but it works to increase its embarrassment factor! False scenes (and massacres) scenes, punk-rock songs, and special effects of secondary cheapjack effects. <br /> <br /> What is character then?: Lee is a widowed man, of course, everyone thinks crackpot ?? Until he is in contact with monsters; At least, however, the intelligence (or gal) of the makers must be admired with the design of two stupid subtitles with a huge meaning! By the way, Sybil Danning (Stirba, Werewolf Bitch, which is a well-known subtitle in the UK!)

Particularly striking is the knock-out that gets rough, but at the same time side-by-side. He later revived, under control of Stirb, Lee (taking childhood attacks through the streets) to enter into a trap. Does the final scene need to be a nadir career to get the imposing and imposing actress? Well, either this or the early sequence is a nightclub where Lee's nightclub is made to stop the couple, so they can be seen among the younger parties! <br /> <br /> In the end, I was forced to cite the items that were not very popular, I can say that the bucket set (the heroine must be sacrificed) is interesting, or the lizard / bat's hybrid (like Danning's pet is "living"). "The body of his victims is very strange to be contempt ...
