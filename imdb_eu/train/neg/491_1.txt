As others have pointed out, this film does not feel bad in the portrait of an artist's life, and I felt very angry and painful ... because of its transformation to tragic love, due to its violators. "Awakening his talent," as he turned completely ignorant of his work as a sexual object, you get that idea. At the same time, it seems disturbing for people who do not know Gentileschi to see this movie and get away from that type of impression.
