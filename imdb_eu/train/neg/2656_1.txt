(For very light reasons, maybe.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Normally Diane Keaton's enthusiast, I tried to see it tonight. I had to turn up before the second hour, because there was no sympathetic daughter or mother. Both of them absorbed themselves without respect for the others, even raising their daughter with impudence and courage. When her daughter died, I thought there was only one: "At least we do not see anymore." Keaton had a wonderful job of going into his stunning and gloomy situations, but it's been too far gone for me. I simply did not enjoy it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to take care of the protagonist, I have to pay more attention to the characters beforehand - it's too late for almost an hour and I do not like it. <br /> <br /> Help the vote was honest and well-behaved: * I felt them! * - And the best friend was wonderful, but combined, it did not take me enough to take the movie.
