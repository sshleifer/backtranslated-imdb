My Take: Tired of Christmas comedy. Laughter is tired and it seems that there are also talented people behind. <br /> <br /> I like the holidays with the next man (although I have a bad holiday blues case), but it seems. Every day of the year, it's just a waste space for a series of comedies that would be bad films, but this does not make the season more painful. If Santa Clause is enough to tell if enough movies (three and * gulp *) look like a movie about his brother? In a plot that would be at home with Disney's SANTA CLAUSE franchise (save a fake humor and Santa's "Little" helper skirt), it's a 116-minute tracking. Surely, Jolly Ol's brother, Saint Nick, but where is he going? <br /> <br /> It's really bad. FRED CLAUS will be delighted with the richness to make it fall off with the snow of that time, but it would be much better than that. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we thought that old brother Santa (Paul Giamatti) lost his old brother, who invites him to visit his good brothers. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant, and worse, the Efficiency Expert (Kevin Spacey) has come to the attention of Father Christmas, and this HEMEN will be closed. Hah! And guess the Santa Santa mother! Kathy Bates, of course. Elizabeth Banks is Santa Helper Charlene, John Michael Higgins is an elix, and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend! If I do not know how to praise the question or I will bash it. Here, we have known faces to add a touch of quality, but to work there are very few. <br /> <br /> Regarding love, FRED CLAUS is the best of Santa's brother. his joke about him and his elf DJ. I have to admit some of the advisors for groups of renowned Fred brothers (Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton, and Frank Stallone met), but rumors start and end there. Worse yet, the film teaches us how to "feel" this feeling and "Lesson for Christmas". It seems that Christmas means what Hollywood means to get the most out of Christmas shopping money. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** from 5.
