Timberlake's performance almost hit the screen. It was not bad, I think the journalist had a bad role for him. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J has played a role as rapper, the hardest, the worst of the bad. I do not think that he has made a smile on the whole movie, or even on his proposal to his girlfriend. He has some fun scenes that have been the protagonist of the film. <br /> <br /> It was not good or bad Kevin Spacey just had "there". <br /> <br /> In general, it is sad. movie bad plot bad actors or bad guys for actors.
