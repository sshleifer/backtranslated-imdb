For fans of Laurel and Hardy, it was very happy for the team in the 1940s and beyond. The contracts with Hal Roach Studios expired and were now "free agents", who were able to work on any studio they offered a job. Unfortunately, a French company hired by Fox, RKO, MGM (not Roach), as well as boys, did not touch them for their comic talents. Additionally, Stan and Ollie were much older and these geriatric men considered pratfalls to be sad, not particularly funny. Stan looked very rough and Ollie's weight was barely walking a bit. That's why I felt uneasy about laughing at their very tender outfits. <br /> <br /> In addition to their age, this particular movie provides Fox Studios in a strange way and creates a parallel plot with the couple; It also reduces the time on the screen and converts them into "hangers". Stan and Ollie slowly and marvelously in front of the old Laurel and Hardy, in the thirties and thirties - and they seemed very strange and badly suited. <br /> <br /> Even with age too, this may be. It was a decent movie if they had given a decent writing and they looked after the studio - and it is quite obvious that the "Unit B" was being used here with a secondary help. Especially, there are very few laughter and the last 10 minute movies are horrible: it is only trusted on the backboard screen, for the stupid scene of harassment, that is, the worst thing. history of cinema <br /> <br /> For fans of Laurel and Hardy's zombies, he is surely a movie that he loves. But lovers of teammates who want to evaluate this movie more honestly, in the face of the amazing films, it makes sense. Actually, from all the long movies before 1940, I do not think I liked less DANCING MASTERS. Unfortunately, from the 1940's movie, it can be the best among them. Unfortunately, it was a lot worse: THE BIG NOISE and no, but not with melancholic tricks. I just wanted to retire after SAPS AT SEA. <br /> <br /> Finally, I ask myself that all positive reviews for this film about myself may reflect the love of the review team, even if it is not an indication. Is cinema good? The group is no longer in love with the public, I do not know HOW DOES this movie does not do anything but it will be bored by the audience - it's hardly convinced that Laurel and Hardy are comedic genres. However, comedy geniuses need material that their talents deserve.
