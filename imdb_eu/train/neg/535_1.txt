Some of these commentaries are ridiculous. Is it painful to watch with your other meaning? My boyfriend asked me the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and incredibly strange. <br /> <br /> Two Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were not suitable for this purpose, especially when Vanesa made that ridiculous American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes was the only young girl she had when she called My Sounds. He has not driven yet. Girl, find a new way to shout! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was the only recovering part of this movie, it was five minutes on the screen and I swore to God, the movie shot out and woke me. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, whenever I see it better. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins have also been brilliant in the middle of two scenes. <br /> <br /> I mean, that it was a good movie, it was very nice, the settings had interesting attire, I felt the intense boredom of relief. <br /> <br /> I do not know, it's just quite pathetic that the movie "The greatest actors of our time" is so sucking. They probably had more bugs for editing, and the main character (Ann) was huge. He was glad he died. But I felt Lila, Ann's friend very bad, especially since these two women were better actors and they felt a bit of empathy. <br /> <br /> Well. BAD work in Evening. You were not entertaining and you were not thinking. I'm sure it was a better book, so I did not lose more people. 3/10
