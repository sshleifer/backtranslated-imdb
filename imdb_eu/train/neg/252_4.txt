Uninspired is a beautiful decent direction cast, but it blurs a bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems to be more sensitive than the heart, and the linkage of ghostly cash appearances fails in any fear or sense of magic; Edward Woodward, as a ghost on Christmas appearances, looks like hangers and looks like Bernard Cribbins is doing. Like Scrooge, George C. Scott is very shameless and never believes in it, because it robs the performance of its effect. The scene that shows the past has a profound impact on the family album as it has been exciting. No one else makes any effort, except Frank Finlay, except for chronicles.
