I think how this film was filmed for me for garbage. Only Reinhold is the only actor that is known to me, a successful actor, just to justify the production. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's worth a nomination. The evil tomato award, this film, B, makes a cinematic enjoyment. A car that runs along the highway with the police, and nobody knows how to stop the car, either. <br /> <br /> <br /> The script must be written on the back of a cigarette pack. Most of the television is horrible, but the word redefines it. Check out the actor's ability on the bridge operator, Oscar's pure material.
