I saw this movie as I liked the plot, an unknown group is captivating to know how to connect. <br /> <br /> The first (and the best) one affected the setting and premise. Seeing the movie and there was not much action story moving at a good pace. <br /> <br /> The comedy was seen in the form of two male alpha, and it was a welcome (though) for me) Melissa Joan Hart has not yet left behind. <br /> <br /> Some things left me personally; 1. Pedophiles were built dramatically in the way between children and the dead. <br /> <br /> 2. When MJH was doing his / her own police force, the truth is that at least one of the few people deserving to be there, KNOWINGLY did not contribute to the event. <br /> <br /> 3. At the end ... what kind of film does something happen in the middle ... There was no resolution, no clutter, no obvious ending ... it just ended. <br /> <br /> And for that, I left only two stars with my rating. I left the slide first two points, but not the end!
