I will keep this short; Thanks in brief to her: she is about a guy who captures a drink of a captive girl, is imprisoned and tortured, then captures him as a captive for sex. This is the only rumor of the movie. Slow motion is a torture as a rape. And it's not a good movie too. It's not so bad it's good; It's just a bad thing. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that critics are not dare to break the "spoiler code", although some are tempted so badly. Why NO ONE had to move forward and say "it's a scam, and that's why" he's out there. <br /> <br /> Do not give your money to these cheerful vendors.
