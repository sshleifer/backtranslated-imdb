It seems that some short films are the first of the frames. Even if you were totally excluded from Ed Wood's work, look at the "Plan 9 outer space" and you just need to see the masterpiece of the next film. Thus, when I saw the first shot of the masterpiece of "House of Dead" by Uwe Bolls, he was trying to get the guy who was sitting in front of that house as soon as he arrived from Sin City. to make a wonderful career. <br /> <br /> So, the movie starts like this: first of all, the main character says that they will kill others. You know, wandering around. Afterwards, the rest of the characters start "Karma ... think of Foxy Brown" or "Alicia, my example, we have presented lines, we have recently broken, I needed to learn and had to do the fence." No, I'm not joking. <br /> <br /> However, this huge 20 series that could not be pulled out of a bundle of baggage will go down in the "twentieth century", some questions, some tents, a port ship and a statue located in a small island in the middle of the Pacific. The ferry is lost, but luckily he finds a way to reach Kirk as a fishing boat (Cpt Kirk? Get? Man, a genius who writes this script) and his friend is a bastard. Simpsons's Cpt McAllister's son and the last summer what does he know what he does. <br /> <br /> To make a short story short, the group arrives to the island, unless anyone else finds himself in a bloody shirt and then decides to go to hell. You do not have to wait, they are not happy, really happy they get it and make it as a free purchase. <br /> <br /> With this scene, the movie gets the bottom of the rock and then goes down against all the slopes. Some rubber clothing starts, there are screams and shots, our team houses beats goes to meet other gangs; They leave home, they meet Cpt Kirk and some women police (around 500 pounds of them, weapons) and then decide to return home. Line somewhere S.W.A.T. The group, enter the Matrix, begin to multiply like the bacteria that begin with the rubber outfits and I've started to cry because I paid to see it. Injury, in some minutes, is based on vacuum-based video game shots and allow some characters to die when they die. <br /> <br /> I seriously hate this film. Does not include the famous "So good it good". It's bad The script is bad, the zombie is horrible, there is no tension, the lines are bad, the bad actors ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> You probably want to watch this movie. The fame of being horrible. No There are bad movies that are worth watching. This is not one of them.
