I'm a fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought of working on that movie. I can not believe in any other review and I thought it was a bad thing to see at least once ... but it's my trust. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the old movie. . but why they wanted to renew such a movie. The basic idea of ​​a horror movie should be a very intelligent script or be very graphic. This movie is not just below any of them, and it's just dumb. I think at some point the movie seemed to be interesting to me, but it never happened. <br /> <br /> So this movie is not for horror movie lovers and Cag fans. You probably would show it on TV.
