The land is credible but insignificant, that is, the beautiful and forgotten wives of the rich and powerful men, it plays psychotic and hides psyche and stalks. But what develops from that is not entirely logical. Despite the resources offered by the regular money and influence, our privileged heroes and heroes have only one home, while their lawyers and local police (who say nothing they can not do) have a suspense. terror They do not have private security personnel (a simple security system that is in error), home workers or routers, drivers, etc. They do not seem to have money when the retired nurses are hired to hire private ones. The injuries that endanger life, only men and women leave them vulnerable at home. Our hero opens the door and plays our hero, a tycoon, in an unreasonable and rational manner. Production is a rage against this drivel and the viewers who are losing sight of the crime are losing the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what they thought). And embarrassingly embarrassing the intelligence of the audience dedicated to Television Lifetime.
