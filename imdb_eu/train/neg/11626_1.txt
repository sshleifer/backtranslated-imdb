The worst show ever I've ever seen. Apart from having a Hitler sitcom, it's not fun or entertaining. In the 1950s, it is similar to the sitcom with its cornball humor and situations, but it can be done just like I Love Lucy, but it's not fun here. I think that the show was about the novelty, "Hitler is a bumbling figure in the sitcom," but it fell on all sides. Hitler's only kid is so stupid. I wonder what the network can do to believe that the air was a good idea. I thought America had a tasty show, but we were defeated by the British at that time. Americans could never set up a sitcom about Hitler, although Lincoln's slaves had a show on Desmond Pfeiffer's The Secret Diary. Probably you will never see this show; In fact, you can only post a section and it will never be published on the DVD.
