The film was really misleading. The performances are third parties, and the interviews are so sharp that sometimes it seemed to have died and died. The reason for renting this was simple: search for a movie with a scriptwriter. I needed help for my presentation, so why did not I use a clip? The boy was wrong. After watching the local video store, this is called "Starstruck". I thought, "What is it", and I decided to try. Well, I was very happy with my results. Perhaps I could use a scene, and in the meantime, I was almost asleep, for the mere banality of the film. So ..... I took this back and received Ed Wood. I can use a movie as an example. Again, everything that would be comparable to what "Starfucker" is.
