While others watch Bilal's work, they think they will know more about this movie, it's a big mistake. It does not keep itself. The plot blends symbolism with substance. Here's an idea to start with a specific story. Next, about craftsmanship symbolism. We start from two different narratives. This woman is, in some ways, becoming a human being, for some reason she is a "god" who is divine, but eventually thrown into the Earth, and it seems that this mysterious John character is developing a "resort". "Outside the city limits, why? One of these questions is not answered, but it does not matter, no. There is no development that we would like to realize with any story story, the closest we get to Jill and even at least that development is bad. It's very similar (that is,) but motivating development. I'd like to see a little bit of material from this and I'd like to see someone who can not re-write someone who does not have the image.
