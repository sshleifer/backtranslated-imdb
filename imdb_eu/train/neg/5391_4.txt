I really hate the biggest film in the world. People show Hollywood what they thought about the rest of the world, and they are clearly a series of sad idiots (or, at least, sadistic things that make watching an entertaining thing to react). I have often been to L.A.; I have a family that works for shows, and I just want to say the latest people to look for a reality check. Films with disasters draw at least one fast picture: Children of Men, 12 Monkeys, but it's just a message, "people will do everything they can to survive, all dark and sad and insignificant, we should all be ashamed of." /> <br /> I do not write badly, I like the idea of ​​trying to face the idea of ​​a social order regimen system and the fear of people's horror, and I think that some people would like to portray this movie, but sadistic as idiots aside I would seriously question the fact that society only dissolved each one's own self, that's just insulting.
