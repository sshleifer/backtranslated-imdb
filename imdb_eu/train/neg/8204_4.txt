The small budget of a sensible fictional formula, very versatile and only a bit entertaining, and we have seen it all a hundred times before. Scientists face unknown things and everywhere (surprise, surprise) face to face) Antarctica! <br /> <br /> The film has a double support for James Spader and almost unnamed (except for Carl Lewis, not even for non-actors). To reinforce a little bit of scriptwriting. To make things worse, it's a slow pace, there is hardly any subtype, and few actions are stereotypical and are not exciting.

And the final, bright, indirect space is like something that was extracted from the "Abyss". <br /> <br /> It has been done before and it has been done much better, although I think some lightweight surprises at the end. I can say a bit more about the earthquake, but it's not necessary. You already know more than half of this movie ever seen. (From 10 to 10)
