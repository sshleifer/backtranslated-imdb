I chose the "Dead Creatures", but I thought it was a zombie movie like "28 days". It's not a horror movie too. Nothing happens except for a group of women who have been infected with a strange virus that eats human flesh to survive. <br /> <br /> This plot creates a series of annoying scenes of cannibalism ... <br /> <br /> Very MOZIA Very bad. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 2/10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> - -------------- ---
