The movie is very bad. It's wonderful. The Bollywood bad movie has no end! The excuses for making such a horrible film (or not) are to be exhausted. <br /> <br /> The problem seems to be mainly with managers. This movie has 2 good actors and has proven in the past that they have the ability to deliver high performance ... but they were so straightforward. The poor script did not help. <br /> <br /> This movie edits hilarious times in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his first great concert, Ajay Devgan has found out that Om Puri (who now fled 30 years ago and told him again) is cautious about Om Puri. Salman's friendship! What a shit burden Serious No need to mention the Baaad soundtrack. What happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgun is portraying a rock star. <br /> <br /> The second half of passion for saving only is good performances. Ajay shows the dark side of his character. So Salman is a drug addict. <br /> <br /> Take a look for only half an hour.
