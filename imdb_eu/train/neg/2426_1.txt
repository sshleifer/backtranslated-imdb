Believe it, this is the movie you want to avoid, and it comes from Denzel Washington's huge hobby. Frustrating part is GREAT movie is 1/3. The first episode of this film is an excellent work on the relationship between character and Creasy and the sponsored girl. They kidnapped the trailers in this movie. So I do not give anything away, when he makes a mixture that is almost eliminated when he has seized the movie. What the director wanted to do, everything gets audiences literally nausea. Fast, sharp and sticky cuts continue half an hour later, while Creasy keeps track of crime. These operations are not so natural and nauseous as it's all about eliminating the story. I'm sure the director thought that the worrying way of telling the story was that the change in the character of the creature meant that another film should be followed. Well, he was right. Then the movie template was full and unfeasible. The result is the depressing end that destroys the quality of the first fifty minutes of the film.
