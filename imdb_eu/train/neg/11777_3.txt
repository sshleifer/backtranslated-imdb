A few years ago I saw The Godfather and gave me a permanent impression, the atmosphere of the film was first class, acting memorable and a classic story. I recently bought Trilogy and I saw Section 1 again. I saw section 2 ... I was glad when I realized the first part, because of the proper monitoring of God's Father's film. It was perfect and I could not wait for the godfather III ........ WRONG !, II would I stop. The story was not good, it seemed to me as a story that was just a story, the characters were particularly weak, especially the daughter. Pacino's protection was a weak character that could have survived in 1 or 2 days. Then, for example, they invested all the knotts of the Catholic church Corleone, hidden in the dusk at sunset. the shooting of the helicopter machine of the congress (where "goodies" flee and shoot all the others), the first daughter and cousin shakes hard-pressed pieces, pathetic films of steps ... Corleone candy fills him with diabetes orange juice (no man with his intelligence and deceit Is it ready for an emergency?) ... it was not good and I do not see the best will in the world again. But I'll see them for 1 and 2 years.
