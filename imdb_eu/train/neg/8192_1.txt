Well, I must say, the movie was so bad that I was not going to have to review the work. It was the worst part, and I wanted to see it so badly, when I was driving through the city, I paid twice a year for the paid parking lot paid for $ 10 because it was wrong. Vince Vaughn always always does. The only person who watched someone else watch is John Travolta. However, the plot has a potential. The forecast is very wonderful, but the plot is absolutely ridiculous, predictable and weak. I would expect that Christmas would be one of the Christmas DIDN "and that Santa was not replac'dmet, but it was the only one to go on the race, and it was a little girl. The best character, I'm sure this movie would be a wonderful youngster for kids but for adults, to be so strict that he is sitting.
