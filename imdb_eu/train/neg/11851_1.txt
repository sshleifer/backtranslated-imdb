This was disappointing, not one of the nuances of the original. The British seems to make it almost entirely disturbing, even in the midst of the American version. The original series combined with dramatic lighting and plays with clearances and settings very carefully. I saw the set series and it's great. <br /> <br /> There was another bad adaptation of the "adaptive" "Cracker". Join BBC America or BBC Canada and watch Waking the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness and John Deed. Check the Touching Evil, and then search for "Wire in the Blood" for Robson Green's true discourse and elegant performance. Hollywood must look at the actor!
