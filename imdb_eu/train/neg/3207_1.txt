My God is so bad! The story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and alive - even the baby. This movie really takes its head ... of course, it wants to be fun. I saw last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival and the audience laughed at every scene. I think that it was my favorite "I should not study medicine at Oopsalof!" And I think that they were trying to get into the line of the character of Niko, "we will be together ... it's our destiny." I'm sorry but first of all, words have lost all meaning. <br /> <br /> And what was it with the apple? <br /> <br /> I recommend the American Lesson: You can not cheer up, so do not try. You're just embarrassed.
