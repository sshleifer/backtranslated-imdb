Start saying how much I love the TV. The apparent dreams of a middle-aged man, due to his courageous and manipulative father, could not seem to be a tragic character, it was very impressive and fun to practice. In my opinion, it is undoubtedly one of the biggest British sitcoms of all time. TV shows are 10 out of 10 without reservations. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this spin-off movie is a real tragedy in all the words. The essence of the television essence is hardly ever transferred to the movie. This movie is very dull and depressing, it almost always tears me into tears. Watching Harold's pub (and not comic way) is not the idea of ​​the comedy, but television fans will definitely not like the movie. The film was unpredictable, except for the scene of bathing in Albert, and a neighbor who sees it. <br /> <br /> The love between Harold and Zita is totally tone and she was asking me whether or not the producer was watching the TV series. In the television series, Harold always shot beautiful girls and no strippers. Harold's reactions to friends' friends were not helpful in TV shows. In the film, Albert almost does not say anything when this opportunity arises. <br /> <br /> Most spin-offs in British sitcom movies are boring, ON BUSS movies (sometimes, sometimes). The respects were really better than the TV series!). But STEPTOE AND SON must be correct at the bottom of the entire battery, even under GEORGE AND MILDRED. <br /> <br /> My advice - skip this and watch the second spin-off, STEP IT AND RIDE AGAIN. instead. The tone is much lighter, the TV shows are loyal and very fun.
