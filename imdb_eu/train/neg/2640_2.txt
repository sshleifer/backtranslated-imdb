SENTINEL is as rough as thinking it would be quite difficult. There are many problems. The result is horrible and holes. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays Pete Garrison as a star, with Reagan's service reagan attempting to "pick up" the secret service. A few years later we were assigned to the Pete Whitehouse Family, especially as the First Medal Patron (Kim Basinger, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Difficulties arise as we can see the close participation of Pete First Lady and the sudden threat to the president (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When a Pete poligram test fails, David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series) was named as a disgruntled agent. <br /> <br /> As soon as the assassination of the presidency extends to the plot, Pete finds himself running. personal people His only confident is the First Lady, and recites anyone wanting to tell about his affect (that is why Pete's polygraph failed). Is Pete really innocent? Or is it only time to buy it to kill the president? If he's innocent, how can a killer from the Secrets Service help? <br /> <br /> The big and huge problem of this movie is that there is no reason for the presidential threat. Is not it a movie about it? You would think that! The audience has never wanted to kill the killer (s) president. Hmm. Does anyone forget to put this writing somewhere? <br /> <br /> And what about the new partner of David Breckinridge (Kiefer's) (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? It seems that in the film $$ - they were only part of the sweets. What was it again? Maybe tight pants and a good looking blouse did not do anything? <br /> <br /> There are as many problems as the basic premise of the Sentinel. Actions "What is ...?" It is very difficult. The response from the unhappy ones to the movie.
