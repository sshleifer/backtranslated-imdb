I gave it four generous stars and four points, or points or markers, or something. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the two scenes were really fun. Amy Pek and Tina Feyek and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) have enjoyed all the scenes. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the usual stereotyped traffic, bright speed, driven by a stupid soundtrack. and the "soundtrack" is generous. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the two really funny scene Amy P. is a very horny animal in a way. It's a mixture of monkeys that make SNL and Lucille Ball. <br /> <br /> I hope (Amy P and Tina Fey) they only accept money to make money, because doing so is the parody of Sarah Palin, then we can say, the role of the black boy officials He deserves to come in, so that you can be there for more human being. <br /> <br /> Blah. The 4 departures that I said are generous. <br /> <br /> But not more, girls, right? Oh, I almost forgot. "Two Half Men" mother is in this movie, and she has a kind of plastic surgery, so this time she looks like a 30-year-old boy in her mouth, so I try every scene. reordering my face or putting myself in my head, or simply responding to this question: "Do not wait, wait. Was it a plastic surgery?" As a spectator, you do not really want to have a plastic surgery.
