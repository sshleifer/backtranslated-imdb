I loved the show I was growing up, along with others. So I told this movie, if not thinking well, it can be at least brilliant and fun. <br /> <br /> BUT! Should I ask that Charlie's Angels was really boring? It seems I do not remember that way. But this movie, which can be as bad as this type of film, has little resemblance to the illusion of that era and to show it. I saw everything, although negative, it was not unchachable. However, it was very soft, but I did not blame the interpreters, especially women with angels, as they really seemed. The movie was just interesting. Each angel tried to become a "character." (An angel is powerful, he is a "good girl", to her husband ...), all the characters depicted the main characteristics and depicted themselves deeply in stereotypes. It was missing the show's excitement and the interview ... was a dialogue. That's pretty. <br /> <br /> It's not horrible. It's not the worst movie television. But wrong.
