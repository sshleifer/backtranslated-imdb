As the final runner-up in the championship game, Ronnie Oullullan, Greame Dott's 18 frames and 8 BBC wins, he found a 2-hour gap, so I decided to shoot A WALK ON THE MOON completely. I did not decontaise the knowledge <br /> <br /> I lost a few seconds of the title credits, so Viggo Mortensen did not have any idea, and it was thought that TVM would be cheap, certainly open with Pearl and Marty Mawkish.
