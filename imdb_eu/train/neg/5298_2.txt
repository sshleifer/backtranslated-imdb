I rented this movie in the section of horror movies that I was browsing for anyone who does not know and is a curious film. I saw this and, as I am a fan of violence and gore, I got it. He earned an EM rating: He was very mature. I think that this strange and high score meant that violence had been completely violent and that was all. The checkbox said: Violence, extreme mouth, and nudity. It seemed to me the "greatest violence". The movie was slasher when it was a beautiful movie. He had one or two scenes scene, but I've seen worse in a PG-13 movie. The number of noise in a movie, of course, is not counted, right? You also have land. Well, the plot was boring and nothing special. Do not rent I tell you the truth. I can not imagine that someone can really enjoy: "I will rent it again." The moment they were there continued, but I will never see the movie again.
