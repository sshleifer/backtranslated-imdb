This is probably the fastest 80 slasher ever, but how can you get movies with beautiful movies covered with eleven beautiful gymnastics exercises by women who are keenly involved? Before being a horror movie, "Aerobicide" is a 90 minute video promotion for steroids, silicones and body fitness for stimulating products. If the boys 'footage that raises the pants and the girls' 80s decadence of puppets and parking lots, the story is likely to take about 15 minutes. A lot of time to improver a plot about sad killer who kills young killer murderers (yes?). The movie begins with a hilarious scene of a girl who fills her sunburn with an electric device. A few years later, dead people appeared in the same spa. You do not really need to be a horror fanatic or rocket scientist to know if there is a connection between the murder and the burning accident. The police investigate the case (and Charles Napier looks the same) and the beefcake detective is a private, the 80th beauty I've ever seen! Through credit, his name apparently looked Dianne Copeland, and he did not do anything else than this turkey and called "Surf Nazis Must Die." What a missed opportunity! It may not be a great actress, but I'm sure that the other great advantages that could have been on top of both business businesses. The quality and quality of makeup effects are not special either. We are connected to the flesh of roasted grapefruit and grilled beef. The final plots are ridiculous and predictable, but no-one is ever taken seriously, however. "Aerobicide" (a.k.a. "Killer Workout") is recommended if you want to deactivate all nighttime features for a night, but like to watch a movie! In particular, he would make a double-length feature with "Death Spa". Do the two films have a lot of beautiful and dressed girls? and the two films are pretty bad.
