Here is the good news. "Spirit" is one of the most animated films in the home theater version. Artworks and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend you take a look at this movie. <br /> <br /> Now it's bad news. I really want to say that animation is the only one that has the movie. Remember that "Spirit" "Lilo and Stitch" had been spoiled last summer. The first person who argues for a well-established Disney and has a better publicity wrote four pages "Why Lilo and Stitchen scripts did not smell". <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Here's a lesson and (as it is) it's not only applied to animation movies. However, you can have the visual effects of a mortal, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we do not like the characters, it's a bad movie. Just as simple as that. The animation still reminds us; I just can not see anyone who looks bigger.
