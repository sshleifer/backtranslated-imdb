Del - "You are the most intelligent person I ever met". <br /> <br /> Calvin: "Well, I had a brain, but they wrote again." br /> Asimov's work disaster seems more believable to me, as was the character of Susan Calvin. In books, he was one of the foremost leading female protagonists to think through a problem. Here's just a little girl, Wil Smith waiting to save her. <br /> <br /> Asimov's Robotics Law references are being made, but they are a reflection of CGI's and scenes of action. <br /> <br /> Smith is nice because he is in most of his films, but the truth is, the story is not so good. Find out these great characters before doing so.
