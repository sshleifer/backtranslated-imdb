Oh, Sam Mraovich, we know how to work so hard. This is your ambitious work, the bright example of the rest, undoubtedly worthy of the film arts and sciences academy (as you have stated in the 1998 website). Oh, it's better to keep silent and think foolish than to get rid of all the doubts. With Ben & Arthur, you just do this. <br /> <br /> Because it seems like lack of instruction or education, the script of the movie is really curious with each new scene. The excuse for a story that can be the best ally of the film is this insanity. Ben and Arthur are trying to marry homosexual people initially to fly across the country, under the shadow of some of the best Vermont palm trees. However, all this attitude is BLOOD. Then, more BLOOD, and more and more. I mean, it should be at least 20 dollars in the formation of false blood in the third of the third part of this film. <br /> <br /> The whole film is a technical whole. On the keyboard, a single bass note release, on the keyboard that is edited by a musician on a keyboard, is amazing in any medium that you can watch the movie. It's a pity, therefore, that some amateur-like performances wasted. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Sam. I am sure that you have made five figures of this flick on renting or whatever bad souls (such as measures) to watch this movie. Unfortunately, we're not laughing with you.
