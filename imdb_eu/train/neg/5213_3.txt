Like others, the movie is similar to THE FLY (both versions) and the science fiction movie ALTERED STATES. There is a huge difference between those who knew both well and well. METAMORPHOSIS did not have these advantages. METAMORPHOSIS is a fantasy science fantasy story that is why bad guys and actresses play roles. <br /> <br /> The story is a scientist, Peter Houseman, (Gene LeBrock), an obsessed man who works. genetic healing against aging and death. When the university in employment is trying to cut funding, it will inject the aging anti-aging. As a result, Dr. Houseman is slowly turning the film into a lizard. And yes, good medicine is a great joy during the observation process of being a lizard. It's really good that it's good. Some lines are classics: "What is it?" "A nightmare ... past!" <br /> <br /> Many of the reviews I've read for this point, the last five minutes of this movie are stupid and hilarious. I will go ahead and I will ruin it: the good doctor passes through a confusing semi-man, his half-lawned hair, being a man with no Godzilla clothed, when the police finally throw a gun. In the last scene, a small boy is seen with a small petty man who never dies, and the heroine of the film, Sally Donnelly (Catherine Baranov), decides that the lizard is the final flesh of Dr. Houseman. The camera then approaches the lizard's face; That is to say, I suppose, how to show the CEO's EELIA muscle. Yes, it's bad, but I laughed, so I can not complain. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because it was part of the Megapack of 50 movie Chilling Classics. I am sure that many of the readers have done the same thing, since this 50 pack movie is the only way to watch it on DVD. If you have recently bought and have not seen the movie yet, it's worth your time, but I'll end it. This movie may also be available online.
