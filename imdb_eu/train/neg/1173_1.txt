If I had a single camera that had not been stuck with the floor, just one movie per film was enough to buy some digital video tapes that had to be lost in the movie and all the video and some video clips. I have no more than 2 hours of the French Revolution, and I have no set and my 4-year-old son had to paint the autistic origins, and the actors that I found. The auditions in that year had to be performed and the whole movie was not used for music, and even the zoom function of the camera was not functioning unless it was zoomed out and could not. I stopped, oh and my audience hated me, then I will lose some loss of time in hell, but ridiculous. The latest fabulous but absolutely false wallpaper reminded me of George Lucas's latest creations, which made it much more depressing for the whole movie, this little hope that was in the movies of my mind. Laser space laser battle at sunset I do not want to spoil those who do not want to watch the movie, but it does not end this way. The only thing they could think of was writing a review that lost more time than seeing this movie. Peace
