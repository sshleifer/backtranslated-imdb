It seems that everyone in this film has been working with Woody Allen. They balance and stop and they make more sinners. DeNero real real wizards only! It tries to appear sharp and artistic, but it looks like a very small budget movie for college students. The most widely used word in the film is "rumor". The film connects the atmosphere at the end of the sixties or the early seventies. If people like movies that are talking to each other, even if there is a huge illumination (for the sake of art), you feel like you are sitting in political love, and that way you would like it. it's really boring. I found this CD in the dollar box and now I know why.
