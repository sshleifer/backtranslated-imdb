I probably deserve this because it is more Halloween than what it deserves, I was next to "Knott's Scary Farm" and I saw a Halloween movie that I liked very well. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the cost is just a dollar for me. <br /> <br /> Normally, I'll skip through such a movie to get "good things" but here I am keen to face it and I still do not know why. It was obvious from the initials, this was not a "real" movie, nor a B movie. More in the category of "horror" of DeCoteau, the film's 50-cent video clip "The Brotherhood" fears that it was a scary minute for me to be knocked out by a young college boy. his trousers or something). There were no cutouts (expensive to make a multi-camera setup) and the flat light but ... it's hard to pinpoint. A director can not see any money without money. It's refreshing to get a decent half movie. He's doing a half-honest job that is verifiable and has a merit movie fee - the performance is not bad, photography is pretty good (it can be terrifying to be terrifying), there are some surprises. and the whole thing ... it's somewhat different. <br /> <br /> The bunch of children in the university (strangely enough) are stuck in the store that decorates the house of the year. The old one gives a terrific satanic book and unexpectedly unleashes the hell's powers. This has resulted in people being disguised and creating a lot of enemies. Along the way a surprisingly complex and thoughtful relationship between lesbians is treated, it is interesting that the couple is a very rounded movie. Yes, it's a sex scene, but it's not salacious - or at least there's more about lying on any legitimate movies that you'll find over sex. It is unusual to make a horror film without trying to get time and effort into commercial exploitation. <br /> <br /> So, considering my interest, it was clearly emulating the "ugly, dead and dead" 80s of the 80s. It is difficult to take it, because there are many of the existing films, the genre has been killed. I do not know whether good or bad these filmmakers simply made another entry in that genre, without irony, as a LIVING genre, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> What is it? that's why I sat down; Sometimes, "A-for-effort" you want to watch a horror movie. It really was created too, there was not enough gore, endless plots, dead and clich√©s, and just had not had enough money to make a film that the producers anticipated were the movie that was generally unhappy ... but at least fairly pretty houses were. I would have to pay for the unlucky home if it existed and I did not like paying a dollar for the DVD, although I never saw it again. <br /> <br /> Oh, and ** it's possible spoiler **, but the short business coffin girl was a great vampire: "I was claustrophobic. But I changed it." Ha, good
