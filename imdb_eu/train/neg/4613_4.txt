Well what is it? Nicholson's character seemed superficially and unfortunately interesting. Angelica Huston's character drained my power. And the good Kathleen Turner slut is not good. I do not "I did not get". I do not think that some ideas could bring something else. This is just a movie with just the idea we need to accept, and this is the movie. It's absurd that Nicholson Turner falls, but again, it's like that. However, this is not like one.) Funny, or b) ... even if it is remotely interesting! This has been my loss of time, so do not let the best hype you get ... your time is wasted! That said, the early church sequence is pretty beautiful ...
