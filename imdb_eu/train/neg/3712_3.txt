When I heard about "Down to Earth", I was pretty excited. I am a fan of Chris Rock, Dogma was particularly ridiculous. But this movie has been disappointing. Chris Rock's performance was not as good as past performances, and the movie was very badly directed. <br /> <br /> First, Chris Rock. She plays the whole movie as a comedy standup routine. Of course, this works well, he thinks he's doing standup, but in the rest of the movie, no. While talking to another character, it seems people are trying to make you laugh. It has some fun moments, but mostly during the standup scene (not surprisingly, they decided to make a comedian of their character). As for the rest of the pieces, there is much less to talk about Rock, but they do not mention anywhere. <br /> <br /> In addition, the movie was badly targeted. The movie basically has a single joke plot: the old black man playing like a black comic strip. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, it can still work and it's been pretty fun. The problem was, we saw too many Rocks and there was no white whiteness. It must be fun, because it's a white joke that says Chris Rock's jokes, but for most of the time we'll see Chris Rock, so it's not so fun. The scenes that are white to say white whispers of sharp rock, however, are hilarious. If it shows more, the movie would be much more fun. misguided This was a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
