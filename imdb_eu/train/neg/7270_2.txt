I gave this Loooooooooooong film "2" to attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can not read a speed reader, you will never be able to speak with Spanish subtitles for speed! And what a hell happens if you're not able to read subtitles on the plot. Endless look and goof-eyes and constant rejection. After a minute and a bit boring. Some good cinematography, but also some DARK, if you think your screen is burning. How I will win I never understand. It's hard to speak about "ERAGIN", because they are just the main actors and they look at each other lovingly when they are not encouraged by one another. Geraldo's character is so appealing that it would be hard for anyone to believe it would. And what is it with my mother? I clearly did not have IT all the time IT IT GET IT, there were three friends who had been in history all together in history ... but they never knew who was "EX".
