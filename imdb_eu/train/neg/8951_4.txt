I am a book fan and Orwell definitely studied GCSE since he learned Animal Farm. I bought more DVD curiosity, Burton is an actor who plays with care, so I heard O'Brien's role, I made a balance. <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer on DVD. In the first place, some fears began to emerge, especially on the terribly terrible song "Theme song", Eurythmics shouted automatically "1984!" Electronic beat again sounds like bad sounds. <br /> <br /> Totally acting is pretty good, Burton and Hurt work well and sends true tensions to the Ministry. It can feel at the end, above all, stop the Room 101 scene. However, the movie is dropped. The film spends too much time paying attention to Winston and Julia's love. Actually, it was not written by Orwell. He was writing about a sharp future, how Ingsoce built the beliefs of a man, and then he would break all of them, in order to love Big Brother. She sells more than the most important part of the movie book, in keeping with Winstons's position in life and world, and re-educating O'Brien. <br /> <br /> A comment on the IMDb. This is a mistaken mistake that at this time the film is stuck to the book. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, they do not commit to Goldstate Brotherhood and confess their crimes. There is no mention of the initial instance of Winston with Unperson, but it is mentioned at the end, if you have not read the book, it is completely confusing. <br /> <br /> A great screenplay, a great performance can not be rescued. Michael Radford seems to have missed the point he was trying to make by Orwell, and his electronic sound is frankly horrible.
