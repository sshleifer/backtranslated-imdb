I watched and finished this movie, WOW was bad. Actually, the only thing that kept me watching was MONUMENTALLY wonderful that it was entertaining. The actions of the characters are hilarious, they are very funny from the shooting giants (their bad behavior was either bad or bad they were playing on the street), it was a very bad line, to their unverified actions (when they enter someone at the entrance shoot If you try, of course, the shooting thing will be shot directly!) This movie has to break some of the worst written and broken lines. <br /> <br /> Camera work was also very bad - you can hardly see what I'd vote for "1", but I'd like Sue Shihomi Chiba and Sidekick, and I took two scenes: 1) Break a criminal's arm to get the skin out of the skin 2) The drug king-sailor eats a brown animal (monkey), eliminating it with an outbreak of flesh. 3) Sonny Chiba performs some surgical eyes with a toe. > <br /> I am really a fan of Sonny Chiba, but this is not worth anything to anyone. I have watched its 7 or 8 films and I conclude that the only thing worth seeing is (and it's great!) The Street Fighter series and The Killing Machine. I heard the Executioner and Golgo 13 good ones. I recommend sticking them.
