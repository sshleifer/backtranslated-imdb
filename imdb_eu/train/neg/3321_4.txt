Normally, I know if I hate or worship after the first minute of a movie ... but now I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It was a great start; "This is based on a real story" and blah blah blah was a fun thing. Afterwards, I thought the images that depicted cartoons and the life of the images made me think I had the right choice. Then, I saw that it was a good looking hilarious look of Toronto. Similarly, the situation and appearance of the house confirmed my first idea. <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of the movie ... maybe it seemed like eternity. <br /> <br /> I am perhaps not understanding English in English in English (it is also possible that English Canadians do not even understand the Quebece humor), but ... such a short film, nothing more ... was enough. Maybe the title could be meaningful? In any case, almost everything was filled up, and it seemed to me very little. <br /> <br /> In fact, "making" was better than the movie. At least you understand the motivation of what's wrong. The idea's potential was great; That's why I rented the movie, I was interested in the "annoying disappearance" of the people. But, however, I did not know that the entire universe would disappear, and even a point of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are Canadian English, it seems to be appreciated by local humor, taking into account the amazing amount. 8 people gave this movie. Otherwise, just think twice before losing your precious time ...
