I try to paint Dark Angel's pitch. "I'm thinking of the Matrix, I'm thinking of Bladerunner, the balloon that plays in Faith in Angel's theater, wearing a bright black leather or some chickpeas, leaves us alone. That's it! I'll do some kind of plot, interview, character , with actions or budgets, with some listening and bright black leather, immersed in a bright bicycle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > Dark, superficial, obscure, formula, passion, boring, dull, bad, humorous, generous, competent. Live action with no anime or no life, like Joe Fanboy like SF :(
