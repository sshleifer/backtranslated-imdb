First of all, I was encouraged to download an open source animated film to ruin it as a demo coil. Animation is great, lip synchronization is awesome and you continue watching the movie while watching the movie. You do not feel emotion for the people, you feel the loss of time for the creators. I've seen double emotions in the middle of the day! It could be a great short film, because they took time to hire a real director. I am sure that all of Blender's excitement to showcase their software and rendering capabilities, but I feel the story of the boys telling me what the movie is about.
