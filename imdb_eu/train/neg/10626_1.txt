This documentary is based on the sponge cake, if you put any REAL test on it, the integrity goes into a huge sink, for example, as Bart Sibre seems to have many sources of lighting, because the shadows are interspersed. The case is not a shadow of two or more for each object, when Apollo 11 spent 45 minutes on the documentary spent on the Van Allan radiation belt, 90 Min did not receive a dose of radiation. x ray <br /> <br /> They study hardly some research to find out what has happened, do not let this stack of a documentary stack adapt to your opinion about what has happened.
