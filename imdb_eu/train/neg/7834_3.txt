I usually do not write reviews, but I can not understand why it was named and what warning they wanted to be for horror lovers. In fact, I assume only that these high ratings are provided by average television broadcasters. <br /> </ br> I only saw the first two episodes, but these two were very topical, it was no longer fun. It is possible that you have already seen or read a couple of times, stories, live toys, evil things in other dimensions ... and these are not stories that are not innovative, even bad versions of these topics. I'd rather, for example "chucky" and "silent hill" in these two episodes, at any time. and do not ask about visual effects ... the first parts are fine, but in the second ... horrible. A film student's project seems to go wrong. blood ... or gore ... forget ... anything worthwhile. <br /> <br /> It might be interesting that a ten-year-old boy probably still has not read a lot of terrifying storytelling / read (though I would prefer to recommend it "supposedly beyond" - I call it a mysterious television program. This horror movie for adults is not valid. I only gave 3 points to a beautiful cinematography (especially in the second section) and a beautiful performance.
