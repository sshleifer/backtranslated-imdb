We rented a good DVD to get a good western. The movie was pretty and the scene was reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here are the problems of the movie. <br /> <br /> In the first part, why did the bad guy say he killed his owner? Except when it's not connected to the movie, it's set to be hidden. <br /> <br /> The banker's work was badly malfunctioning, only to decide to hire hired killers against his employers. At least guess No character has been developed for the bank owner or bank staff. <br /> <br /> It is a long time delaying that something is happening. <br /> <br /> Martin still said he should see the trial absurd. He admitted that he had killed the gang laws. Even more honestly, he acknowledges that judges and judges will not hear the sheriff calm. even more ridiculous After Martin's hanging and breaking the rope, the sheriff takes him by the gun, and finally returns to his village and his wife will save the bank badgers. Would not you return the shipment of the gang to save your wife and get the bad guy out of the boy? Send a member of the jury a note before the death of a track? !!! In general, it is very sad to act and it is not a point in the movie.
