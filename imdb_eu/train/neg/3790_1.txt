I do not send comments, but I want to warn people about this movie. It's an unfinished movie. At the technical level, it is completely amateur - it is constantly disruptive jump changes within the scene, wildly off the doubling. The plot is completely overhead, the structure is longing, and acting is shame. I do not want to be hard: I have shared the students' films and all of them were terrifying, but there is no reason why they should watch the innocent fans in the world. <Br> /> <br /> The idea is safe as cast - positive comments are filmmakers, friends and family.
