... all the Disney movies are not garbage. <br /> <br /> First of all, I saw the "Boggy Creek legend" and I love the movie. When I heard 2 followers, I was gone. Eventually I found a copy and I saw it one night. I do not know how to make a horror film follow up on G's. The original is a movie / documentary about Fauke Monster and everyone is afraid of it. "Returning" is for kids and no one should see. I do not remember too much in the plot, since I've seen it from a long time and I have not seen it again, but ... they seek out the hunters to kill the town and kill Bigfoot. Three little children are left out of the house. A huge monster goes through. Hunters are injured, they are kept by the children. Then they are hiding in the boat with a large part of the tarpaulin and trying to wait for the storm. Then, suddenly, Bigfoot comes and really does something sick. I do not want to end any end to Yas, but it's not scary. Well ....
