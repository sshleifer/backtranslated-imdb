Steve Martin has to stop making classic comedy versions. It does not completely fit this part. Like the wonderful rematch of Out Of Towners, the movie falls on the face. Whoever thought that Steve Martin could not approach Jack Lemmon's wonderful performance and is the same for the movie. Dan Ackroyd could play Betfair. Martin is great at making his original characters, but fails to regenerate the classical work of others. The sad expression is that a funny part of a movie is included in the first line of the first credits of the film. "Producers acknowledge the lack of collaboration from the US Army", it was the only line that laughed the product. If you want to see the real Bill, take the original episodes of Phil Silvers Show. They can be laughable, unlike that mistake that never happened. I've put this movie on the classic Lemmon and Psycho remake category. None of them ever happened.
