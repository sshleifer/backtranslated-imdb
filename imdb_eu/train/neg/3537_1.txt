It was the conviction that the world was not there ... <br /> <br /> It's a line that many people remember. With Kaiser Gold I come from usual suspects with Sose ... I mean Sose .. <br /> <br /> I got another one like this: -There was a trick that the director was trying to persuade a real audience. I had a storyline <br /> <br /> This movie has been one of the most sad films ever seen. It starts with a very creative cinematography, excellent performance and a very intelligent premise. But, oh, the only way to do this movie is in a self-destruction course. And he does it, not a single blow, but with a small wrist strap. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to this surprisingly surprising way of explaining this donut. I would have been frozen enough in my brain, I would probably be able to explain a very sure level of human existence itself. As the story explains, I have seen a dozen different ways and I've read them. And they change from a story that is set in somebody's head, playing playing chess in a game, in a clear way by a criminal to play his enemies with similar chess games. <br /> <br /> And all that is enjoyed. But, at the same time, it is painful that this story is something wrong. In addition, there is also a sharp sharpness in any film and book such as "Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, Usual Suspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle". And we are not here dealing with this loan loan. It is a faithful robbery. <br /> <br /> In the end it is wrong in this movie, because the story is like a drunken speed, and this movie would fall like a roller coaster. At the end of the day, the attraction is never resolved. There is so much conversion in this film, if it were a cocktail, you will supply flower cubes after drinking. Nothing ever explains, and finally you will come up with another when you understand the direction you think. <br /> <br /> This story is not a paper and Ritchy will go anywhere. It must have been thought that it was horrible to make the movie anyway, that David Lynch had something to do with it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The art of jewelry, pseudo-intellectual discussions, could become food at the afternoon discussion clubs. <br /> <br /> Change your soul and stomach, Avoid!
