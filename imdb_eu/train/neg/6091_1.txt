I bought one of the most exciting movies I had, a high-quality free, delusional bleeding. I do not have one of them. The movie almost fails at all levels, it's not so scary or funny, it's just a horrible movie and it's not for people who deserve it. Therefore, it is so bad that it is so far away that he promised to be as raw, violent, and wild as promised by him. Almost no blood flowing, and any excitement. Playing, conducting and interviewing is totally unbearable. Honestly, it's really horny. I could not get rid of it once; Certainly, I never wanted to see. Do not miss this time with this waste celluloid; It's probably the worst film ever made. If I give up my star, I would like it.
