Thanks to this film, I can now answer: "What did you see the movie is the worst?" <br /> <br /> I can not even think about the second one, and I've actually seen some. bad movies <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing works in this movie. Name the only element of any horror movie and this movie fails. Actually, I've seen better on YouTube. Here's a typical interview: <br /> <br /> "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, right?" "Steve, I'm not joking" "Steve, this is not fun!" "Steve, are you?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?" <br /> <br /> "ARggh !!!! Ahhhhhh !!!! Nooooooo!"
