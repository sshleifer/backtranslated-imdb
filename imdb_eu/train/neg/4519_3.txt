Three Stooges - Have Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 This was the first feature film Stooges and quite bad. THREE THREATS MADE IN THE WORLD (from 1963), they look like a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Stooges are rockets. They climb up the rocket and go to Venus. When they bring them to Earth, they fulfill some things that speak a unicorn called "Uni". "Uni" speaks like a nice average person. "Oh, hello, how are you, a wonderful planet here, you like it, ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are very few gags and so many scenes that continue and continue. <br /> <br /> Stooges return space and the movie is over, but the story goes, but nobody says that it's about another 10 minutes for film photographers during a party, and Stoogea leaves the party, and then the movie is almost over, the highest point in the movie - Stooges about his trip She sings a small song Larry and Curly Joe put their faces on both faces, Moe. Brutal. <br /> <br /> Another writer spoke about a magnificent musical score. I realized that the only music was two classic tunes : I am ROMANCE, and its song will appear again, both of which are played at a party, and * really * is a high point of the image - the music of the old Columbi films. <br /> <br /> It was a tall blonde and sexy blonde. > <br /> Awful - A new VHS. 99 cents store only.
