Aircrafts movies ... WE ARE! In fact, I hate all! First of all, it seems cheap and they do not craft! Secondly, they insult the airport industry and tell their audience all the planes ... SKY AND CRASH! <br /> <br /> Why do I shake off that movie? This could happen to anyone who would have happened to them and the worse consequences of the characters in these films ... this is a great part of the disaster of air disasters like this. I hate this movie like 50,000,000 front-plane chaos movies! Freefall is just like everybody else: it's just boredom, before dramatic plays take place. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have the same work over the winged death trap: Cleaver-esquire three families, yuppie baastard and winged hair with a great 1987 hairstyle. Any scared horror! <br /> <br /> My second flu does not have to be a feature film, but a documentary that explains everything about Air Canada's "Gimbli Glider" event, called "Freefall", in accordance with safety measures. <br> /> <br /> My third and final denial is with all the airline movies in this calendar (except Fearless). Why did I ask the guardian of May to remove the shoes from travelers? (I have been able to understand great heights and soft and loose objects, but!) That way it will be as safe now as you can! This plane (travelers) did not know how to kill the land they knew better. Why do you force 100 wounded skin to peel and cause a stroke to hurt and ruin your foot in the waste area! Does anyone make sense? <br /> <br /> Fear and the ABC series "Lost" has been deeper and more realistic than "people who fly badly on the air" - people who are terrific guardians without rivers without a wheel The people of the area walk without shoes and jackets, etc .. 1975's Old Cove Airport! Freefall was such a typical crash movie, I expect to see Charlton Heston or Peter Graves in the damned cabin at home. At any time, we could at least see how badly standardized characters play, Looking forward to the people who are looking forward to the tragedy that looks like they are in the middle of the tragedy? Typical typical life story! Flight and stupid! <br /> <br /> The director "Freefall" has to keep shorts on television, middle-aged women, stupid children, medication and marriages with civil problems. With regards to suspensions ... leave professionals ... h ack! Why do we need to spend an hour and a half of the audiences? There is an opportunity to recover Airport. God will not make plane crash movies. If this was "Lost" like the ABC series, then something was seen. But this is an absolute crap and then some. Make all cadastral aircraft movies "airport 1975" This is not an "airport", this is a cheap pathetic waste of my time. I would not recommend a movie or airborne movie for a disaster anywhere else.
