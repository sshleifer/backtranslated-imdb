I could not connect to this movie. It failed me intellectually, emotionally or aesthetically. The conversation was very intense and involved. I could not connect and that is why it is difficult to find out about all the characters, and to find out more about it. <br /> <br /> I read what is needed to understand it correctly. to have knowledge of some of the darker aspects of Catholic theology. I admit that I am not sure I know about the details of Catholicism as an atheist, but I have also seen hints of film about the religious issues that have touched them, because their issues are universal human rights and they are based on Knowledge or specialized beliefs.
