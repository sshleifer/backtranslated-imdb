Okay, so the previews of this movie only tell you that a rebel girl will go live with her granddaughter in the summer to get out. That's not it! She shows herself about a rebellious 17-year-old girl who never thinks she is a mother or not. <br /> <br /> Actually, I really liked the concept of this movie. The good plot and the love and hate of the relationship between mother and daughter were really good. However, I did not see Lindsay Lohan's performance. Actually, this movie would be great if it were another person, maybe a better actor. Rachel (Lohan) is a very sexually aggressive character and reminds us of the real Lindsay, so she gets a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> However, if I think you're leaving Lindsay apart, you'll enjoy this movie. The endless one is pretty (and sad).
