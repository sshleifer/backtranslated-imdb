I feel the mood of the ghosts, and while I am sometimes enjoying the horror genre, but in terms of comedy, they must be fun to be fun. More than a 'killing body' seems to take a bit of life, and I think that I think almost every aspect I think. The story is incredible, of course, and it did not convince me in the comic or sentimental record. The selection of the main actors was tremendous. Although Paul Rudd is the most beautiful and kind guy, it seems that the hobby of his character needs serious improvements, because Eva Longoria is very old (for her), and Lake Bell seems very attractive (I feel it again). A romantic story without reason for romanticism is the result of the initial failure. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were better, but they only had one role. The rest is not interested and inspired, with cheap money from flat movies and successful television comedy. There is nothing worth seeing, no need to remember.
