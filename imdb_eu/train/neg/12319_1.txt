I saw a tobacco movie ... beautiful, strong, penetrating and horrible! Two-hour perversion litania, the most basic meaning of words, and both, sexual violence and torture, rape, decapitation, incest, corruption, burial, and abuse, abuse. There is no amortization. And I was entertained. I could not stop watching. What does this mean for me, about people doing things like this and playing it, and therefore a world that is in love, the actual snuff film will be the norm. And I am not a purity, nor humor, I do not try to hide in the darkness, and I definitely do not bring my life back, but I am ashamed of myself. AND I'm sorry to see my British cousins ​​see how my patriarch uses them. It should not be convenient, but has sadism been useless?
