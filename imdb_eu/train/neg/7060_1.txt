This movie is horrible. The characters are totally unbelievable and they are very passionate. The plot is horrible and some of the class scenes are astonishing and they make them feel uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The quality of the screenplay and characterization was only written by secondary school students. He suggested no credibility in the school environment, in fact, writers never went to high school. In most cases, acting was also weak, although it was a lot in the face of scriptwriters and bad guys, but I'm not sure the actors could see this movie. <br /> <br /> The sound said the track was good, and cinematography was pleasant in places (despite the poor editing).
