Among all the films I've watched The Rage has been the worst ever. The direction, the logic, the tracking, the scripts and the conversation made me cry out loud. "How could anyone bring something wonderful"? He knows Gary Busey "B" movies, but "W" is a sure film. (W = waste). <br /> <br /> For example: two dozen to be taken FBI and local law enforcement officers will surround the surrounding trailer with a jeep wagoner. Jeep is inside the MA and "confused" about why all the police are. In a few seconds a great gun battle takes place, MA dies directly. The police burst into jeep with Gary and the company burst into them. Police are like dominoes, and along with Gary it drives the jeep to the circulation and is not affected by a single bullet or ball. MA dies and it seems that Gary does not remember the guy's guy. Actually, it's a miracle, no six-shot shooter has held 300 bullets since there so miraculous.
