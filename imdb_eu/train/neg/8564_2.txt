The same movie is so pathetic. People deaf imagined cynical people when listening. True, the red people are silent with silent people, but they are not necessarily annoyed by the nature of Marlee Matlin. The bodies are not going to go to the bar and they dance like Matlin. In the end, the movie itself is more boring. It's so boring that I think it's a movie that heals insomnia. If I have a problem with sleep, I can only see Children of the Little God and see. It sleeps me <br /> <br /> Remember that a deaf person speaks.
