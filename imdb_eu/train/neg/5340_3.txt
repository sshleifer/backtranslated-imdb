*** SPOILER ALERTA *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, I really do it and he does his best with an unbelievable role. I see how a script is like a movie that looks good, but it is very confusing, difficult, and finally stupid. I saw that the false death came to one kilometer. Rene Z. tries to pursue a dreadful risk, and Patricia Arquette too. I can not remember that name (Chris Penn is not that) is a big sweat of actors. You can see that the film is so clear that you can not follow if you have enough intelligence to separate it, so you can not understand it. See the camera that works for you, the one that shores you. See Tim Roth with short notebooks that you would like to work with. See when it's late at night. Otherwise, rent ordinary suspicions.
