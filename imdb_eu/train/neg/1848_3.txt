There are bad movies, so there are so many movies that make them almost art. This is one of these films. My partner and I still have two types of curved stone, you know, looking in space and drooling! I can say that people involved (I hope they can protect themselves from changing their names) may have blamed, and they were definitely not shy. This is one tenth of this, because they are free and they are really bad. Most of the movies I laughed aloud, so it could have been a good time to tell me. See the viewer, the previous words are not an interpretation as a good movie because that's not it. Everything that I could say in my defense, it was impossible for me to have a great title for the movie!
