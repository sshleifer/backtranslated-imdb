Robin Williams gave a good performance on The Night Listener, just like every other member. However, the film runs and the loose ends are "seen". I think the problem occurs because the caller and Gabriel Noon have established a sufficient relationship (I had to write that because the IMDb does not want the correct spell automatically because it does not "character". The film lasts 1:30 a.m. and in the first 15 minutes, which seems to be , Noon begins to look for Pete Logande. <br /> <br /> It happens when it talks about the mysterious mystery, about 3 or 4 times. Conversations are not very deep, especially how are you doing ... in the hospital I am ... why did you go with a boyfriend, etc .. In the book, the child's midday is torn down and turns, and the reader understands why he is going to look for this boy when he learns that he is about to disappear and when he thinks it's a story. < br /> <br /> In the film, at noon are obsessed with Logande, but why do not they ask the audience? There's really no midday and there's no great connection between what they call, why worry? Does the caller not exist? <br /> <br /> I know a difference between a book and a movie, but calls and contact were essential to the screen, because it gives the rest of the movie. However, the movie is deleted. <br /> <br /> This is another wonder Maupin's work, Tales of the City. When the mini-series came into being, it worked well.
