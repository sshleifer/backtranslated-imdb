This is not a good movie. It disconnects, the performance is quite bad, and what you've seen what you have seen a thousand times. Regardless, it reaches a kilometer from the plot. Worst of all, no one wants to tell Lonette Mckee. But who cares, with a pretty look. But I'm digressing, there's nothing new here. Bottom line, take advantage of the hot girl's group, someone gets drugs to bind, someone gets to connect the guy, someone gets hell out, and then horrible things happen. Surprise, surprise Welcome to the music business. I can not believe so many people I think this movie is good. Many of you seem to use slippery scales in Black Cinema classification. I do not play! If you want to protect these movies - wonderful! If you enjoyed - super! Everyone on their own. But do not say that it was good to me. Pleeeease! Color people would not appear above these types of movies, because they appear in black actors. Do you want to see a good African American movie? See Love Jones. Ray. Or purple color. These would be excellent films, regardless of the color of the actors' skin. Why? Because they told you how to play a compelling play, you'll feel something after leaving the theater. Our experience is because it does not automatically turn into a good movie. It's good, it's good. Deadline
