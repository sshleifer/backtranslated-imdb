Check out the movie website; More time to write this film was put on record. You can not be more proud of it. The original story?

Forward, I could do it better with a Atari 7600 and an earring shell. Stylish cinematography? Oh, the funniest look of American home movies is still classical. I am sure that there was little money for this title, so of course the issues are not really good, or bad, sometimes, or just ridiculous, but this movie is a waste of time. and money Look at a story 4 and see befores and they are already headless.
