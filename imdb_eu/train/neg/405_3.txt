This movie deserves to see more than admire special effects. There are interesting images. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is an honorable hollywood of the nineties, without substance. Check the title. <br /> <br /> It is not worthwhile to distinguish the story. This is the brain-brain surgery of a dinosaur. There is not much at the beginning. Nothing original and not very unique. So do not get a story. Check the effects. <br /> <br /> As it has been mentioned, it has finally been fascinated by diluting the purity (and sometimes invisible half-invisible) character of the FX. However, if the "standard" pyrotechnics is excluded, it is for viewing (or not) sight. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a decent FX that is only for this purpose.
