The first part, Impossible, but in love with the planet, is what is called "The Satan Pit". There was nothing wrong with the rumor of something coming out of the hole. Then, they passed by to get the story out of the air vents, a shameless thing with Beast intelligence, so I did not face the doctors / wicked. TARDIS, in some ways, is part of the hole, although the TARDIS has not been open for long periods of time during the Earth's crust. And lastly, there was no other logical reason for it - why not give it to Beast Hole as soon as the hole is opened? Why do not you try to put him in all those years instead of jailing him? Why not ... I could continue but I lost interest ...
