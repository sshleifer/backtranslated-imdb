"The Rainmaker" released in 1956 - has some of the best actors of the time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster are the main players. They can not even keep this completely by melody. First of all, Hepburn worsens just as bad as the actress - this is not the case. It is pretended to be incredible to be credible, and age was too much. Lancaster performs extreme actions and Earl Holliman is a bit rough and like Jethro Clampett. Wendell Corey's only reliable and reliable bridges seem to go a little bit more, but they can do more. In the 1950's Katharine Hepburn was a time when she wanted to open the band a bit, and that's fine. He made a bad choice here. Fortunately for his lovers (I'm among them) he did not do too much. Although A-list cast and good production values ​​do not work.
