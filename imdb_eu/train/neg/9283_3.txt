I do not know how to watch positive reviews of this movie on this site! I'm a fan of Vonnegut and I know very well this original film shot by Showtime, but I did not even play poor plays, very bad castings (great Sean Astin, sports and individual. Harrison ?? The Guy is totally generic! ) And this subtitling script in subtitles was almost invisible. Someone underlined the great Maculay Culkin line. If you read this and think that it was a comic shine (unfortunately, it was probably the fun part of the movie), you might like this movie. But if you are a fan of Vonnegut, or if it's crazy, do not miss it. Please.
