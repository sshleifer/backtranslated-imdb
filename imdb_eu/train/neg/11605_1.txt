The first appearance of the earthquake, I thought the movie could be decent. Maybe I can be more wrong? The start of the film has picked up lots of excitement and decided to make a low budget movie. In the first 10 minutes you did not notice the theater of the theater, the horrible sound and the special divine effects, but it is worse then. In about 20 minutes I asked myself: "What was the plot again?" I could only think of this question thanks to the enormous balance of this movie. The main actor has a framework of emotions and takes the whole film, despite love and hatred. I almost vomited the scene of Flashback, they allowed me to spend a minute more of the film before the movie. Now we're playing in the middle of the movie, of course, they're trying to rip out Morpheus "Matrix", even though it's working hard. The actor speaks "Star Wars" and fortune cookie, it's almost unbearable. When you finish the movie, you do not realize that the end of the movie is because the plot eventually develops. The character "Morpheus" dies, the only thing about the film. He throws two words and credits. What is this? No plots, bad performances, all courses, could not be worse. Please, if you value human wealth, THERE ARE NO VIDEO ON THIS VIDEO!
