This game was made by Sega. I did not expect much from Sega, but I do not expect this hope. The angle of the camera's camera plays against you in this game. The motorcycle is a good way to get around you. Motorcycle is the worst part of the game. Every time you go to something you go in and you're not moving. You never fall by bicycle or sink. The main character almost does not speak, even though he has a voice that suits him. The graphics are awesome You're riding on tree bicycles. The camera makes the fight against the enemy impossible. This game should not even be worth the lease.
