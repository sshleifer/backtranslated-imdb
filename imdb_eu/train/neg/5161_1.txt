My life is saving animals. I volunteer with a cat rescue organization. I'm a vegetarian, because I can not even kill an animal to keep my life. I can not kill the spider, I put it in the open air. The scene that kills the birds until the birds die, Sooner took part in trying to accept other children, got sick and since then he condemned me. The need for human acceptance pathetically believes me. The final reception is that parents first take it - it does not free the representation of animal cruelty. Why does she want her children to watch this movie?
