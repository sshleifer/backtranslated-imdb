This is one of the films that damages the money from the British Lottery Fund. The main problem is nowhere. The characters are not very interesting, the story is common and intense, what is interesting is the location: Genoa city (Genova Italian). In addition to being a very knowledgeable Genoa, I did not even know the most intricate way in the Old Quarter, and the city was so interesting. I thought that Genoa was dull. I am glad that it has been proved wrong. So, from a travel perspective, this film has a great interest. The movie is a beautiful Perla Haney-Jardine girl. Seven films have already been screening for 12 years, so it seems that the actor seems to have decided on a route, and taking into account the performance of this film, it should go a long way since it is natural and has a great talent. Colin Firth, a trustworthy and professional actor, was shooting and was asked to be serious, was honest and was ashamed to be overwhelmed. But he was given a conversation worthy of forgetting him. The script is totally shameless. Catherine Keener works well as an assistant and shows sympathy in a natural way, so everyone wants them around (I will tell him whenever I feel cold when I feel like I was going to take me like a hot drink). So, there we were: Genoa, beautiful narrow streets, an interesting little girl, and a pretty woman. Forget rest Willa Holland is a character who likes to be the oldest sister she has ever played, and I think it's a tribute to the young actress's scare. That family goes to Genoa to forget the unhappy mother's death, it's so bad, if we have such a movie, they have the right to complain about being killed by the dead mother. If Michael Winterbottom wanted to make a movie in Genoa, why would he not go to the BBC and want a movie tour with a celebrity presenter? Why waste money in just a vain project of unnecessary vocationalization?
