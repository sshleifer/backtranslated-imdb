Charles Bronson finished the 80s following the worst movie of this decade. There, he performs a detective who is looking for a cyclist caught by an Asian girl and now sells it to the seller. Shameless action is action, and it is probably the most depressing film ever made. Many people watch the Death Wish film as the worst film in Bronson. The Death Wish seals were not great movies, but in most cases they were skillfully and incredibly spectacular. Kinjite, however, is a sad thriller because of the average racism and the average of the uterus. The film is really rewarding and it is all the worse to try to preach the "Law and Justice" mentality to say something. In fact, the film is interrupted by sex with Bronson and then rapes a pedophile with a dildo. I saw Chicago's theater before the scene of this scene, only in the face of evil in this film that young girls were raping. It only takes a while to exploit the movie as it was not well-written so it can be used to raise and operate the level of exploitation. Bronson seems more like things, but clearly, this is very gross. I mean that Charles Bronson is the greatest actress ever, but this effort is finally the worst. The sequence of actions are also bad. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * 4 from 4. (Awful)
