Herculis Puaro, we generally know books and movies. This movie or story did not work and it felt no mistake for Agathas. Casts are not good, actors make gestures foolish and do excesses; The costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even Arab clothes) is fake, and the serious viewer who thinks about the movie twice as a comedy. mystery drama The actor plays Herculis Puaro with a nice job, but nothing wonderful. As the scene says before, it's perfect and looks fake. The story is not very wonderful, but the mystery of the murder, but who is in charge of treating the scary woman in the wilderness and hating a woman's 45+ death! 'Victim' is not pleasant.
