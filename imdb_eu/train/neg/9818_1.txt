This movie puts deep questions on my mind. First of all, how Jennifer Tilly has managed to maintain a career theater career in all those years based on this stunning voice and her facial expressions. Secondly ... what did people who were responsible for carrying out this very offensive and abusive world? And thirdly ... To make sure that such characters are perverted enough people would not have someone in the system - studio, distributors, or somewhere - really healthy enough to actually finish and release. . You really should find a great way to turn this video into a very noisy way ... and it's not even billed as a horror movie; that is, as legitimate as can be seen in any type of manner. cinema is definitely a genre. The film ends at the beginning of madness, violence and ill-treatment, and basically has no recoverable features. I do not defend censorship (I really do not believe it) ... but I do not see how anyone can have a positive view of such a movie.
