The high school geek encourages the spirit of a dead man to whip up and then he takes revenge. <br /> <br /> This movie really annoyed me. It has a monster with a great look, it has low budget effects, it manages some little but bad atmospheres for short circuits. I started the video halfway and then crossed the DVD chapters. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with this movie. Before throwing he looks thirty years old, but they think they will be in the secondary school. You do not believe in anything. Scarecrow looks great, but it's not far beyond it. He said it was a stupid lining and the move is designed to be fun then a terrifying way. Is this a comedy or horror movie? It's a problem, it goes beyond the online section and creates the most part of the conversation. It seems more of a topic than a horror movie. Sometimes I hope that the movie was too close to people, rather than embrace horror fans of the genre, rather than looking at the genre. <br /> <br /> Despite being a good monster, it's a movie to avoid. If you get less than $ 5 in the bargain, you're paying too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
