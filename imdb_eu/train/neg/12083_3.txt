Yes! ... I think. It's hard to say. It's hard to be emotion about an emotional movie. This movie is just as sterile as the scalpel surgeon. For its surroundings, it has some stone columns, some stone benches, some stone crosses and some stone actors. They have no emotion! The only thing that holds this movie is Hamlet, and Hamlet is written in what is written. Duplication was not really that bad. The voices were silent, dark, dull and crazy, given by the movie. I saw Hamlet's version of Mystery Science Theater 3,000 times three times, and every three times, I was about to shut down the TV, even though it was MST 3K. <br /> <br /> The exemplary production of a drama that is not so much better.
