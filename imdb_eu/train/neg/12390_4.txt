The censored version of this movie after watching TV a few years ago, I was curious to see the unpublished version. I think it was more solid and well-remembered that I remember being surprised, but one thing really stood out. I also think that other reviewers have mentioned the nature and motivation of the Chris Sarandon character? Has he raped other victims before? Is it totally psychotic or "average" partner? How did he expect to attack his younger sister? Is this character compelling or is it necessary for more backgrounds? It seems that at the same time it is capable of becoming an unbelievable and incredibly incredible nature, and keeping up the teaching task that makes contact with bad and vulnerable girls. It seems that, in general, it is the biggest complaint from the audience. He has nothing to do with his performance, that is, with a very convincing movie. The film takes an unequivocal position in the midst of serious exploitation and serious treatment of the subject. The worst movie ever was, but not all is good.
