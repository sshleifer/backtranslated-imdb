When you get a British film, you expect a certain quality. And in terms of acting, camera work, light and so on; This movie does business. They are very skilled by handmade craftsmen. This may just be a pleasant and half hour. If you look at the layers of professionalism, you can not find anything. Not only is it a good idea to feel and liberate a drug vision, there is nothing. The script is crazy, the plot is predictable, and the end is to be the worst of the Hollywood scene. In English, it's just a shameless and cynical attempt to make another Monty Full. Why did this film? I have no trace, of course, as well as earning money.
