Rumors say the NASA Technical Advisor was asked to keep a compelling picture laughing for several hours. After all, if you are not a politician or working or with a crew, you are not transported. In addition, Space (Kadet) is Camp Alabama, not Florida. <br /> <br /> It's true that everybody on Earth will win a million-million lottery before any events that are depicted in this movie. This film was aimed at children, and one had to write it, because they did not know about the limitations and limitations on access to KSC / CCAFS. <br /> <br /> It's free of all movies. It was time, and it was a worthwhile flop.
