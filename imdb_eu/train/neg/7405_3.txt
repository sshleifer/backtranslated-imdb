I think the quality of DVD production is far from being pushed away. I rented the DVD from the 2 movie store and I tried to play it the second time to play in three DVD players. <br /> <br /> Has anyone else had this problem? It's really hard to review the movie without wanting to play it without having to play it. Together, I never saw Finland's horror movies, so I said the movie was made in English. Also, it's never clear what Sarah is wrong with, he's just been postponed off, so I just hope that someone will shoot her on the face and all that's going to be scary.
