As usual, in the IMDb, the vote of the majority, instead of the "weighted average" "film" entertainment, is much more significant. In this case, most give "one". What are the reasons! In order to start my review, I will first admit that I fully understand why this film is called "Alien Intruder". It also means "space" and "foreign" (I assume it), but there is no reason (or any reason) in the plot that can last at least anywhere in the long run. /> <br /> There are so many scenes that are so horrible (both in terms of lines, time, and how they are spoken), when the similarity of the films exceeds the curious feeling that you see when they are similar. Bugs Bunny does not know about something about an electronic talking about something about this part. <br /> <br /> "Land" is a site called G-Spot, sorry, do it. The G sector ... and a virtual reality program infected with alien (?) Viruses. I think that the image of foreign Ariel is rare since it appears as a negative photo. <br /> <br /> In most movies, we can see the people who shoot the space weapons, the falling lofts and seemingly endless. "Where is Ariel?", "Could not find Ariel" (it does not make sense if other plans include interaction with Ariel, however), on a computer monitor. Skyler commander (Billy Dee) is seated and this legend sees every fantasy VR program so he can find this alien virus and it will become ... ??? Or maybe I missed something ... <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams did some course courses before shooting "desperately behaved". We know that this is a long time since your fingers are moving down and feeling dull. <br /> <br /> The back of a boat on the other side was docked in the backstage scene. At the very least, and he offered a laugh in addition to the initial scene, we see several shots of the ship as it is rotating in a circle, apparently looking like a Lego experiment. This movie is dead, why worry? VR female offspring also die, what we suppose is what it is (especially if others die anyway) ... I paid my money for that DVD. I kept the dollar in these vanilla bags, paid for the reviser in time. <br /> <br /> I will add the same story, at least as a novel, and much more for more details. It would probably be quite interesting for the correct author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
