The worst movie I've ever seen! The ridicle begins and continues in the same way. I think something that will happen in this film ... and acting is worse. At the end it raises a bit and saves the entire movie from a flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor. Sorry Tim Burton was good at Batman, but this is horrible.
