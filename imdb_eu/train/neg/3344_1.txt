I would like to announce that I'm a fan of Dolph Lundg. Men make it one of the most entertaining action-pieces that can be imagined and arrest is probably my favorite. * Spoiler * even though there is no Dolph spoiler, at first scripts are so absurd: a boy with a handicap is immersed in a track gun. School Corridor and children to win? Good game, Oscar arrest. Dolph, if you are reading this, thank you, old friend. <br /> <br /> <br /> Summarizing: a horrible film, guaranteed. I recommend inviting some friends to be sitting there. Ridiculous
