As is often the case, the pioneering and explosive pennants of Asian films are only added to red stories. It was similar to Unleashed (it was great). Dog Bite Dog tells a tale as a wild dog that makes his master's bidding. The main characters, even officially unstable police, are an undeveloped emotional killer, far away from heroes and bad guys. In fact, in the end, you hear what kind of empathy you want, do not you feel the least emotions for men? It is the decision of the director, or perhaps it was noteworthy, to decide whether or not to emphasize it. <br /> <br /> The start of the film was full of intrigue and anticipation, half ... a story that survived and avenged. At first the suspense was clearly disappeared as a result of a serious musical score, causing potential story telling. And, in the end, you felt the basic detailed information and the introspection of the main characters were not very necessary. <br /> <br /> In a positive sense, the transition from story to point b was the transition quite atypical compared to US films? so that those who do not know the Asian movies and those who are tired of Hollywood's predictions should check out. <br /> <br /> The balance of white seemed to be in most of the films. It was similar to a picture taken with fluorescence in the image, because it was thought to be. Maybe I'm the only one, but it has strained my eyes. <br /> <br /> Do you like playing movies too? An interesting building gave me an expectation before moving on to the mobile story until it was diverted into a low-budget and low-speed scene. And when you think of an indie unanswered that you will be confused by Shakespeare's tragedy, you realize that it is not the end, but rather the transition from country-music transition to peace and peace. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < and you get an average Asian thriller of the same. <br /> <br /> I do not know why every scene that fights is covered with leopard lions' clips? I thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs Finally, at last, we are reminded of the real murderer hidden from us. tetanus <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
