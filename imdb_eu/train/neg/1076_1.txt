This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Branaugh had so much trouble remembering his accent, because he could not give his lines. The plot did not hesitate to call John Grisham's name. It is not surprising that it has never been published as a book or released in theaters. I did not see the whole thing. I do not care who made my decision, then realized that there was no "whodunit"!
