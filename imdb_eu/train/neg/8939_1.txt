Yes, I saw sharp cuts. Sequences without transformed sex scenes. Raw scenes. The almost identical to 'The Need' of the evil performance. This movie is as bad as bad movies. Bad script, play, bad effects, bad locations, bad bad stunts. The best actors in the film were hired for an additional vampire for the return trip. <br /> <br /> Sean Harry, as someone else says, "has the nonsense of the actor." Its an amazing ability to drive a car, it is known that the cannon is shaking people (look wind wind), to turn its left, that is class. OH and do not forget the sex scene. plus the use of his toy gun that yesterday guys could not even disguise as a true gun. The other actors on the screen could not get almost any lines. There was a certain number of waiting times waiting for a line! <br /> <br /> "Special effects" were so good. the boys who took the credit real names! <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh at a party, rent this movie ... again, it's good and funny comedies. Do not give people who do not deserve the money.
