Once again, Canadian TV is coming out and after the premiere, it will be kicking. <br /> <br /> Finally, I recall that the sitcom caused a reaction to the laughter of the business call. How funny is it that everybody in white can overcome stereotypes that Muslims think they are terrorists? OK, perhaps, it's just one joke for the masks. But not for 30 minutes. It is considered against the dead horse. Although SNL should be suspended after the commercials. <br /> <br /> Also, we have little conflict in these script. Will it or will not peacock sandwiches speed up in Ramadan? When will Ramadan begin? Ohhhhh Emmy wins here. <br /> <br /> And the characters! What characters ?! All cardboard cutts are, without any interest, to keep them from one state to another. That's the point of the comedy situation. We need strong, interesting and dynamic characters, we are constantly attracting ourselves to television every week. We have to worry about these characters to worry about what they will do next week. If I do not see these characters, it will be soon. Fortunately, I do not remember their names (note CBC, which is not a good sign). <br /> <br /> And acting is so soft. Above all, casting is a problem than actors. None of these people are the characters that play it. They seem like they're doing just like they're working on a weekly movie. Commercial situations call for the character and the actors that reflect it - they fall in love with them - they become inseparable from the portraiture character. See any American sitcom and see which are the identifiable characters. Part of the problem is that actors see it as if they were to treat this project, instead of being the main character for the entire life span of the next 8 years. It shows the degree and project of the disinterestedness of the characters. To make it sound, taking into account the horrible story and writing, it is not necessary for the actors to do much, but to try to say their own lines and not access any furniture. As mentioned in another comment, it seems like a TV movie and not a sitcom. <br /> <br /> And correct it or not! What can I say, Canada has a lot of talent, look at the comedy channels with Puppets Who Kill and Punched Up. Check out Trailer Park Boys (it's not a movie that gives a big helium dog). Check out any American show to see our talent potential, when our many stars find decent work. <br /> <br /> Give CBC credit to know how to create publicity without events. . Remember "One"? No, do not even try to learn the names of the characters in this show, because the way of the dodo is safe. <br /> <br /> Let's hope for a full ACTRA strike, nothing like that is created for a long time from Ceeb.
