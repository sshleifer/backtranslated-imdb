After the catastrophe, this film was the coffin of Goldcrest and, therefore, the latest British Film Industry. The movies are absolute pants, full of music from the 80's of jazz recapture, based on a book and author that was very famous at that time and was immersed in darkness. While Temple was trying to find Suzette and Happy 8th found Patsy Kensett, another well-known person at that time. When the movie came out of production, the Jazz resurrection was over, while Kensett's career and films were not so boring when they met a public. <br /> <br /> Worst-worst / worst-centered / cheesiest, thanking Britain for a 20-year-old British screen and the movie is really dull.
