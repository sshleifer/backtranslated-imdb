I have never seen this movie, but to say something about production. In a comedy / old radio DJ in 1988, I received a call from the production company. They asked me to write a little bit of writing and burning sounds like a TV show (they would never be shown on the TV screen). I was sure, writing a parody of the science fiction monster in the 1950s, completing some sound effects and calling me another DJ, Pam Landry, to play feminine roles. That time he was in the air, he put on a long song, he went into the micro-room in the production room and cut it in a single voice. When he was playing, he again returned to his show while I was confused with strange sound effects. We would never have known whether the "Woodchipper Massacre" would have been a turkey, but again, we never paid for our efforts! - Gary Theroux
