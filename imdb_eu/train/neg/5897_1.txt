The famous Japanese director Takashi Miike can not move the wheels with this thriller crowd, the adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto's book an evil old woman (and the child's abuser!), Who is a member of a newly-born legend: she tosses her cell phone with a strange tone - "One Missed Call" message you see - you will repeat the message before your last words are heard before your death. The most successful part of the movie is the Reality TV camera, which is the main satire that penetrates the future of the victims, but death is not so elaborate (that is, hidden by the red candy)! The planes of often destroyed bodies often appear discreetly, and in general, this polite may be a reason to be almost quiet. Hollywood predicted that it jumped in 2008, but still US versions did not get better. STARS NO ****
