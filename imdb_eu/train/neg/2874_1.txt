This movie starts a fairly embarrassing relationship with a woman and is psychologically tortured. In front of the male is full nudity, dead animal parts, dogs nipples, woman loses control of the bladder. All full of cold gray color. Effective, but a bit too much. Afterwards, we have seen the BTK killer youth and the history of today's crimes. The tension is completely psychological and the killer enters into the victims' homes and talks with them for a long time and they are awful. Here we do not see any beautiful images or images, it looks like it was shot in the home camera. It does not seem terribly, but killing a way to see a crime for victims for a long time is quite strange and cold. This movie is not really a drama. Sometimes there are some police scenes, but there is no excitement to find a killer. There is no big arch for this story. This can be an effective psychological thriller, madness analysis. Sadly, the movie is a footage of real slaughtering sites. It is scattered throughout the film and suddenly comes back. Sometimes you do not know how to come and do not have enough time to look away. And I have to deny that. I am a low budget horror movie, but I do not suffer from animal suffering. It was not necessary, too much, and it comes without warning. We are glad that Lionsgat warns no one else, but they should send this movie or publish their origin. Leave this litter
