The review is based on a double video dubbed Shock-o-Rama in 2002. It's wonderful, that is, it's a '1' on the IMDb scale - but it's a lot worse than that. It's good to think that the German original form can be improved, the English comic dubbing is not fun, but in fact, this is one of the worst amateur amateur movies you can watch. . The zombies of the movie are always as slow and evil as they seem to be unable to talk or think beyond their next set. However, they are smart enough to work with motorbikes and malicious people, Western tabloids on western genres would arguably encourage their dinner conversation. George Romero's people, raised a nation in the area that maintained a little social coherence; Here, the areas are just a mere canvas for the evil imagination of the director Andreas Schnaas. In spite of empty social value, and even worse, even if there is no entertainment, Zombie '90 is a bad joke for anyone who loses money.
