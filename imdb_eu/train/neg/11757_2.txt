Hey Arnold! The movie is slow and a bit boring. The plot is not very creative. The character of Paul Sorvino (Shenk) is buying all the square and sheltered buildings to build a giant shopping mall, shopping complex and a huge office building. This plot has been back in the 1960's for children's films. It's boring. Paul Sorvino is also not very exciting, so it's not a very scary idea. Gramps remembers something of a historical document, and since the rest of the film for the last 36 hours, Arnold and Jamal have to find a document that supports Helga's support. Children should ride around the city buses, so the exciting scene of a bus bus is not just stupid, but emphasizes the fact that this movie is written for young people. Hey Arnold, television cartoons are very entertaining and have enough humor to attract adults. TV cartoon is much faster and more imaginative than this movie. Hey, Arnold's movie, five times more sedated and the best way to make anyone sleep. Hey Arnold was tough to stay awake until he was completely upset and completely boring. If you want to send your children to a completely unknown movie, that's it. When trying to make a 90-minute movie, I feel a sensation that started with a 30-minute television cartoon and it opened in 90 minutes. This Mall Story can definitely be covered with television's drawings. Hopefully Arnold will give a better writer if the fight is always there.
