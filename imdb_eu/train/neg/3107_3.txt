Woody Allen made "September" proving that he could become a genius. Mel Brooken is "September". I need to admit that it is a monumental idiot, boring and shameless that it does not end until it ends. There is a small movement between some imbalances (for example, "The Money Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill"), which means that it makes me "sleep" or "delay" the button. And I say this, unfortunately, as a fan of Mel Brooks. He has to stick to comedy straight away and only leave a social comment. A dog made by producer "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" can take away such a dog beyond me. All expenses to avoid.
