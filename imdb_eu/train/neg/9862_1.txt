I can not believe this movie when I put my DVD player. I thought it was a laugh, as I played D + I in the midst of my life. I had to deactivate the company I had, and they asked what I was seeing. <br /> <br /> After finishing it, I would just let it soft in the pornographic clown of gay porn at the beginning. No, fart jokes, jokes, incest, racism, dressing like KKK ... This movie is for anyone who ever played D & D. <br /> <br /> It's not surprising. The real D & D did not use their game. To whom would his name be attached to it?
