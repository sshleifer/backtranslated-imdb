If you are a Christian who is not evangelical, avoid it like an Egyptian and avoid evasion of the bible of the Bible. <br /> <br /> Arima - why the IMDb lists the best comments made at the top of the list. Of those, I missed the end of the good afternoon. <br /> <br /> The plot premises began to grow strong: I got into the movie and I was interested. where the Biblical sermons were taken. What waste <br /> <br /> This film is so annoyed to complain that I have registered for the first time only to complain. I hope to save at least someone's afternoon. <Br> /> <br /> Haiti, what is my Christian action ;-)
