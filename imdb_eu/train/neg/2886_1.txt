Horrible, Horrible, Horrible do not waste your money on renting this movie. It's like a small budget for a Canadian movie. The worst movie ever I have ever seen has been there. This movie is not required to access the DVD player or video player. : ~ (Is it possible to write ten lines? The act was terrifying. It was not completely. I saw BTK being a TV maker and it was much better (compared to this one). I'm not sure what they were shooting. If they wanted to learn or tell a story about BTK killer, they were lost in miles of miles.
