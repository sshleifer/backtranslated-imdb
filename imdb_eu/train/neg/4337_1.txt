This is the rescue of a wonderful story by Edwin Torres. This movie does not follow the story in the book. And, in conjunction with the original movie, you have to remember so much about inconsistencies even though the scriptwriter has watched the first movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (the original and still best Carlito) comes out of prison. start of the original Here, Carlito will retire with his wife in paradise. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gail with Lorain (Ohio)? In this installment, he is not mentioned, and Carlito is retired and allegedly marry another girl. <br /> <br /> Besides, where is Kleinfeld? I think it was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I also like Mr. Guzman to play a completely different character in this movie. He returned to Pachanga Pacino days. Now, Nacho Reyes is the Cuban killer. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much better role in that book. <br /> <br /> Since I read the book, but when did Sean Comben come? I also think that the film shifts Torres as he writes more than Harlem's racial tensions. And the mafia is not the treatment they made in the book. They are also deleted in this movie. But, magically, it's about the bunch of Pleasant Avenue for the second movie. <br /> <br /> Books said a wonderful story. This movie could have a great story. This is a great despair. Read the book. It's better for your time.
