'Ninteen Eighty-Four' is a film about a government that controls everything and is a socially trustworthy, non-profit-making society. It is a very dark film and you do not feel good about yourself. It's about a love that happens in this society, and the betrayal of lovers and the self-centered man. The film has very good ideas and society shades dark shades of dark color (contrasting happiness and bright colors of dreams) and the overall feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places. However, despite the fact that the film is clear in portraying this idea, the movie was very slow and did not quite get that idea. It seems that spending too much time than telling the mind.
