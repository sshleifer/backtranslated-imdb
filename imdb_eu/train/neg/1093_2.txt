Kitten Natividad, a woman who has discovered Breast Cancer by Russ Meyer, Chastity Knott; So, will he go to South America to get a special fruit (Crockazilla with healing powers?) to get it. After dropping some parts of this fruit (it seems that the bananas are plastic in the stems) Chastity has some mystical magical powers that make them super heroes, specifically The Double D Avenger. Note that she also uses her panties as a mask. In writing, all this is pretty good. In execution, well, it leaves more than you want. Chastity seems to have a pub and a local bundle of clothes is being annoyed because he is taking down his business, as some strippers (including Haji, including the reputation of Russ Meyer) continue to continue. Yes, Chastity is fighting D D Avenger. Look for a spin on "Wonder Woman" to become her outfit and also lose balance due to excessive centrifugal. Bad jokes and dubious jokes do not fly like tomorrow. With intimate song on the subject, 70-year-old "live action" turns into a show for adults with adult content, although this one without revision probably escapes the PG-13. And it is probably blessed that the fuzzy stars are well covered. As a result, Doris Wishman's Chesty Morgan movie has a great deal. Forest J. Ackerman's unique look, but what. Very stupid, and I have never bought another movie on the cover of Joe Bob Briggs. 10 to 10
