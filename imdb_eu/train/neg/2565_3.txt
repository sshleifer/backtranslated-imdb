There are only bad things in this movie. <br /> <br /> To get started, the first twenty minutes of the movie may be compressed five or ten times. The general movie (compassion) is already short, but this could mean that he wanted more attacks by paying more attention to Mean Lion (how did he lose a "Wiz" reference?) And work on his sub-table a little more closely on the plot. In short, the script had a good idea for the seed, but the rewriting was quite a bit needed. Secondly, he could do it without humor. He also had some of the original ones, but at least it was almost a thought - here, there are plenty of flatulence and urination. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the show is very careful. The original series was pretty good, just like the first movie, but it's just here, too. Brendan Fraser's jokes were just a little bit higher (and why did you mention "New Ursula"?). Together with the narrator, there are other mistakes, especially the end interactions, in a couple of cases, they surpass the good sense. <br /> <br /> Fourth, he could pay more attention to CGI's work. In the first it was difficult to say that Shemp was not a real elephant (except for behaviors, of course), but CGI here stands out the pain of pain. Ideally, special effects should be good or not telling the story, and at least they achieve this success, so it's a small problem, but it still exists. <br /> <br /> All this, Christopher Showerman's performance is pretty decent with George. Brendan Fraser's charm lacks, but Christopher only fails in that particular comparison. However, George may give him a bit of oral prowess, a movie inspired by Jay Ward, but he was not here. Julie Benz, the new Ursula, better than Leslie Mann, was shocked to me. <br /> <br /> Most of the other shows were very standard, because they did not fit me well or not.
