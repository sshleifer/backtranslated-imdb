If you do not know what will happen in this movie in the first five minutes, we'll give you a few minutes. Lilia is a widow. He has left the shelf for a long time and wants to get out. The teenager has a daughter, and this only emphasizes that she does not get younger. Looking at her daughter, she never dared ... she found the world in the cabaret, where the man with thin scarves could dance while men throw money. The movie is very misogamic. Men's portraiture is very bad. Lilia is as curious as Lilia goes away from them, not for money, but just. When he gets upset, he feels it like a woman again. It does not want to connect with them, but it's addicted. All other dancers, in addition to aging, have a look like no trace of men and they realize that they live in a short time. I do not say it a bit short. Romanticism finds it, even though it is short, with what you have invented ... Here we have not seen any surprise. Although endless good, you realize that he has not finished any other way. Maybe this movie is not my demographic guy
