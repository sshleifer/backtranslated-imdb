I know that the previous reviewer (still in school) seems to have thoroughly reviewed this movie, and I only assume that the reviewer has not seen the adaptation of this classic 1989 BBC novel. (1999) was the main problem Anthony Way was casting Tom Long's cast. Anthony Way was a talented boy, after appearing in the television series The Choir. I can only assume that he dumped Tom Long's "The Choir" for the great performance. Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in the choir became a tall young man in "Tom's Midnight Garden", and so Anthony was not convinced by Tom's school. Tom is too far from the imagination (as Anthony's interpretation) Hatty was younger. In 1989, BBC and Tom's Hatty versions are much closer, and their friendship development is more credible. For 1999 a movie was not convinced that special effects were not convinced and there was no noticeable improvement in 1989's television effects. The question and performance of this version are less than the previous adaptations and all the films did not have a bright version of the classic version. As a final observation, I would like to emphasize that the VHS version of the BBC version of 1989 had more than £ 20,000 in second hands, while the new DVD of this version could be purchased for less than £ 5.00, should I say more?
