I expected a comedy like "Big Mama". Instead, a comedy, theater and love story was a strange mixture. <br /> <br /> This movie has three plots: the first one comes with Madea and the recipient. The second is a woman wandering with a wealthy man. Third, a single mother involves a relationship between two children and one single parent. <br /> <br /> There is really a very small comedy in the movie. There are a lot of wrong posts in the movie. For example, Madea plays the recipient with a belt (in comedy mode) to convince the child. The children, in fact, turn around. Apparently, she pays for her to overcome her children. <br /> <br /> There are plots to face child rape (mother's permission). There are male scenes that rage young girls with kids. (An ankle takes place at a family reunion.) The movie plays on the plot when you are out of balance. Is this comedy, love story or a drama? In fact, there is nothing ... except for time and money loss.
