... or maybe it's bad. The land is a cheap version of the first one, because it is strange, because it is like a past and not a sequel. It's just the first cheap refurbishment of the first movie. The scenes that mimic things that happened in the first place are much more hilarious and harder. When the first cast was cast, the B-list and the actors rejected. The operation is terribly bad. The top half of the movie line is taken directly from the first, almost as any of the main characters, including the first movie. I know it's a passage from a TV series, but that's not an excuse. They did not have to rotate footage (bad) in a movie. It's just a good thing, and that's the erotic sequence. However, as it is not as good as the first one, this is not even rising above level 1. If you have the opportunity to see the option, and you are a valid man, it might be. You deserve to see it, if you want something erotic that is not pornographic. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. 1/10
