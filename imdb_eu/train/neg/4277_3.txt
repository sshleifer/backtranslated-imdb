Allan Dwan, former director and producer, has played a leading role in many of the most striking and repetitive films (such as John Wayne in "Sands of Iwo Jima"), a great musician of "I Dream of Jeanie", lead singer of the past film industry taking advantage of the piece and, almost without a future, he made a fictional story, and Stephen Foster was not an offensive story about the great American singer-songwriter. <br /> <br /> Bill Shirley Foster is a young man, slaves for a friendship ring to save money, paying off the cost of hospital for a wounded black boy. His intention is to have Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence), his younger sister, Jeanie (Eileen Christy), who has fallen in love with the smith, who is in love with Foster Inez, the composer Number 1 Levee Hit Parade Tune, which is canceled against "O Susannah." Edwin P.Christy Minstrel (Ray Middleton) wins the Foster career to launch the phase. <br /> <br /> This is the great production of the early 1950's music. The sets are quite unique in that Hollywood way, as they were all falsified with their appearance. Singers are not half-bored and Foster songs are almost impossible. <br /> <br /> But this is also the literal white of the previous one. The biggest number shows a black face on the stage, a historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of racism. If these portraits of blacksmiths were close to reality, the abolitionists would directly condemn a good organization that could be condemned. "I am Jeanie Dream" was apparently going to whisper a death into a studio bargain. Now Alpha Video revives 4.99 dollars only for songs that are enjoyable and it is a piece of repulsive sentimentalizing about the great crimes of American slavery on the victims. <br /> <br /> This was before Hollywood was cast two years before Brown v. Educational Committee. He had to warm the heart of some of the filmmakers wearing the bed clothes.
