The plot of Corpse Grinders 2 is similar to removing the original corpses. They are alien strangers that are different to the other films. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie would be the worst film in # 1 film - if anyone saw it. The plot is offline and, in many (too many) instances, it does not make sense. It's really surprising why this film's sequel was created in the world (and still somewhat better). <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie if you enjoy watching good movies, laughter.
