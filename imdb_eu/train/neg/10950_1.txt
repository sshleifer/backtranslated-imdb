I knew I was shooting this movie as unpleasant and forceful in Dogme 95, and I never rented it. However, I took a play for the seaside and I gave it a shot. Fifty minutes, very, very long, I gave up. It is very boring and unforgiving. <br /> <br /> I saw the last French film "Romantic" and it was very bad, but at least it was a steady camera and the neck of the characters did not breathe. time I am confused with the ongoing success of Dogm 95 popularity - America will catch the leprosy as the next major outbreak at the same time. (It's called Dogme 95, the average number that the actors cast into their eyes according to this camera).
