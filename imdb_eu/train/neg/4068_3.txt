With such a title, it exceeds my comprehension, I do not like this movie. At the moment, there are a few good-natured moments and little gore, but the way the movie was shot and the story as a whole, they seemed like a foolish and lazy attempt by the "shock" tactic ... to kill a guy and put a woman on the side of the road. He and his brother are imprisoned with their mind until their brother is broken and his girlfriend goes into the woods. He ends up forcing him to enter home, and later shows a collection of boys captured in the basement. Prisoners of massacre, who raped his old boy, are a "grabby" neighbor and sexually abusive. He wants to kill all of them. Who does not kill him and then men (or pigs) are torturing and killing himself ... most of the violence and humiliation destroys both nutrition and genitalia - all disturbing and basically gentle. The best scene is a broom handle, then some male rapes ... Probably, "Based on your Kadavian, based on IP!", Especially the title, and suggesting a reference to the main character, it was his mother, Camille Keaton. Personally I think this is a very blasphemous statement! The mixture that strives to get bored of this movie is boring, but it failed to fail ...
