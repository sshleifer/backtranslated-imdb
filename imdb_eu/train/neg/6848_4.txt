I must say that this "horror" movie is quite disappointed. I did not even fear seeing once I saw it. It's not too suspensible ... I was able to guess ... I've been able to guess ... I'm so ... what's left of us? <br /> <br /> The "Ring" movie is very scary. .. I would like to stop copying other movies (for example, trademark: long hair). Please, give us originality. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film.
