I like Japanese movies, this is not just cut ... The survival of a movie about the rebels and the survival of a royal blood line has been a slow pace of film with a doubtful plot <br /> The photography is fine, even in other Japanese films I've seen better the scenes for the fight against the sword, they did not persuade me how fast the cameras and the characters continued. The soundtrack is so weak, you do not notice its presence. However, the worst plot evolved. I must admit it was sometimes difficult to understand who he was and what was going on. Well, the love of platonic love between the main character and love was completely useless and seemed like Hollywood's influence. <br /> <br /> With all, if you're looking for a Japanese action, this is not a movie. . It's very slow, the battle with the sword is very small and very sentimental ... in a bad way ...
