I bought this DVD without reference, but John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett's names on the cover. The Brazilian title seemed strange to me, but a fun comedy was waiting to see the wait like "Switch". However, a story that is unrealistic is enormous and difficult to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) is presenting Copenhagen to change her sex and return to Hollywood, claiming that Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) will uncle Uncle Buck Loner (John Huston). All day long, Myra and Myron's alter-egos fell into a couch with her uncle's academy. At one point, the evil script is so confused that the whole story was a mere trip to Myron's story. Unfortunately, Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett's beauty are not enough to have this movie. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Homem and Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("A man and woman at one point")
