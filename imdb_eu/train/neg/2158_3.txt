I can clearly see that Robin Hood has been peeling. The first episode is possibly the worst thing that the BBC has transmitted. The initial scenes were strongly, meaningful and intelligent, fighting two monkeys, Robin Hood had no characters, and the sword fight was stupid. The worst part of this episode, Robin Hood dressed some cows at the beginning of the make-up - how much clothes had eyeliner twelfth. In the century? Nobody. Since then, the series have improved dramatically, but in the first episode the expectations of the public have dropped rapidly, and basically cr * p. A great England England has been ashamed. <br /> <br /> "Do you accept this?" I'm not sure if the BBC understands what is a sensible investment. 3/10
