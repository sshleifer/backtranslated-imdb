Look, forgive that if there is a blame in the middle of the whole world, but life is quite confusing. I do not have to watch that way. With Anthony Hopkins, I get a great deal of time. I also saw the fracture, and I knew that there would be a pile of Quentin. But this thing does not work well, and it's not daring, even though it's art. The produced films have cuts and quick changes, but not the "oh but real interpretation" excuse. This thing gets hurt. It's the fastest image ever to take anywhere. I still love AH and I'll always give it another chance, but if you do not have time to watch bad ideas on the screen, jump on that.
