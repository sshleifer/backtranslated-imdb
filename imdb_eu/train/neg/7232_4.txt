When I got up with the graphic novel of Bilal, I was surprised when I saw the trailer of this movie, and even more when I found that it was directed by Bilal. The movie, however, was a great letdown. Visuals do not have a rich texture of original artwork and a bad story. Bilal seems to go to the esoteric aspects of the graphic novel and do no good work. <br /> <br /> The original graphic novel was a pleasure in friendship and hate between Nikopol and Horus. Both were time and place, driven together by the circumstances. It was mostly fun and enjoyable. Not here Nikopol does not have any personality, and after that, it is what he desires. Although the movie is French, Horus does not have to be! <br /> <br /> We all saw the movies, but we would not recommend it for reasons or other reasons. I would not recommend Immortel to anyone, except as a warning to overcome your talents and resources. Bilal is a tale storyteller, but, of course, he is not the master of all visual resources.
