About half an hour later, I remember thinking about myself: "Hey, that's the best achievement Bill Bill!" The opening sequences are atmospheric, they are instantly enjoyable, and our director refers to his famous stinker called "The Giant Spider Invasion". William Castle's "Haunted Hill" robbed the house with insolence, three million old and nine-year-old nunnery troopers were taken to an isolated house for $ 1,000,000. Of course, the participants begin to fade quickly and one by one, and the rest of the long strikes take too much time before they realize they are sadistic ... or another murderer. The movie starts and the narrator's curiosity ends up telling a lot about things that are not of interest to the plot, but it's a nice T & A that admires in the first ten minutes and it's really ridiculous to see the silent babe (Shelly, I called it). After about half an hour afterwards, it is inevitable and a book "Cold" becomes a Rebane textbook, with delayed plots, with the smallest and most intense conversations ever. There was no bloody sequence of murders, but our multidisciplinary talents (?) Try to compensate Danzas for dance girls and amateur rock. The film also has four or five different clashes, none of which is very little. Perhaps LOTR was a source of inspiration: King of the Return? Avoid this movie, you'll be longer and happier.
