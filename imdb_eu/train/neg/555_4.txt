The movie is quite confusing and playful. The land is horrible ... but the bet is very good in theater, cries and differences. Sharon stone is good at this time ... as good as half of the original mind. The murder is not as boring as it was before, because it is shameful. It is not a misunderstanding. Sex is pretty graphic sometimes, others are obviously false (they are dressed). The script is mostly weak, but Dr. Argens and Washburn emphasize arguments and arguments. Plots worsen several times, but at the end it is horrible. The tension is always constant, 'Oh my god!' Chase sequences are brilliantly directed, with shots and camera angles that are spectacular and bring the class to another short film. Sharon stone is also old. The bits we see in her breasts, first of all, were happy. This time, it's great to describe it. Own films are average, but it's worth it. Especially because it deserves a good movie buzz ... the highlight of the initial sequence. It's not critical, but if you first liked - let's do this. Do not spoil the race. You will be glad this stone.
