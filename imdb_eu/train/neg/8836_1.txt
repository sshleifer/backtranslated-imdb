This is not art, a propaganda that is politically correct inland cities! Jindabyne's political intolerance is beyond indolence ... he does not see people as individuals, but as members of the categories. <br /> <br /> This is the Australian (and that's) I remember that I remember. against a tough competition!). A message film, the subject of the left-wing fashion is tired. Aborigines are victims; White men are violent or alcoholic; White women are not so bad - especially if they are lesbians - but they are likely to be depressed. <br /> <br /> Four men find themselves a woman of four murderers who go fishing (originally, naturally) and leave them on the shore while they catch trout. It's a strange decision to make a little talk, as if men were animals. This man who comes out briefly is greetings ... we know that because he lives with a bisexual woman - he wants to keep up with his baby - and finally moves to fashionable locations (the bush is far from all these inhabitants). <br /> <br /> This is a film made by modern cities that are afraid of the landscapes of Australia and the dreadlings of these nasty coins that live inside. The ignorance of the country's life is almost as distrustful as its contempt. The film is made through mysterious and mysterious music recorded with long distance views. It is very clear that native autochthonous ones are the only ones that live in the landscape. The black and white reconciliation scene is awesome. <br /> <br /> In Jindabyne, rural life is less than the backdrop of a story that claims the dominance of the values ​​of hidden leftovers. other population over Australians. <br /> <br /> This film has not been made by real people, but has been financed by the Government Film Finance Corporation. The art group is a huge crowd of beautiful people that endangers this huge offensive government, which is far from real life, and is popular with people who want to see it. No matter if the movie is stinker, they still pay. <br /> <br /> Pay yourself time to waste it, do not eat it like a pestilence. More than a live entertainment, social commentary is worth more!
