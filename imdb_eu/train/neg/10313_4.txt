This movie was hard, and when I finally saw it, it was overwhelming. I mean, that is, XX. One of the greatest stories of the century: an unknown man uses the trusted sector of the air sector and millions sell their dreams, no-one's mistakes or bad attempts. With all this concern, how could anyone do the slight movement of this event in real life? Although Williams was always interesting, scriptwriters assumed D.B. Cooper is a kind of heroic stereotyped person that is a movie star, we have achieved a kind of way without any fascinating details and a person with enough courage and enough light. Harrold almost completely robs the movie, with its own style and pure beauty, but it was a real mastery of land management and full-fledged directions. I like pity for the movie.
