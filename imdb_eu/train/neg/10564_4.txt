The shame of "The Gathering" is not a bad performance, nor even superficial traces. It really was shame that it was much worse than it started, although it was the main attraction: Takashima. I'd like to see Lauren Takashima with Susan Ivanova in the room, even five minutes. Sarkasmoa, a nonsense, a character with a double fairy tale. Unfortunately, the pilot film "Babylon 5" has a terrific story about the murder. Patricia Tallman, who had never been seriously back in the series, fortunately, was much better than Lyta Alexander, much more than telepat tear and labor. I will leave you with a last thought ... why is Delenn resembling an outside frog man (even if he was a woman)? Thank you very much for having watched at Minbari show.
