That has been one of the worst movies ever made. For a biker movie, Rock is the bottom part. The small plots are a small town (which originally!) And includes a team of bikers who try to fight against citizens. Why not ask for external help? Who knows? Fight scenes are fake. Adam West and Tina Louise are there, but they both need very little and both are ashamed to stay there (of course) This movie is in the trash!
