Steven Seagal seems to be sleeping in a short film that is almost completely close to conceal the total lack of budget and resources. Technical faults - The F / A-18 silver and the F-14 have taken an airborne strike carrier and converted into a F-16 camouflage for the same strike - more credible credibility would be given to this movie. It's been said that the most interesting thing in the movie is that they are credit titles that disappear into a lightning cleaning and then disappear, that is, all of Cut Cut Pro's users can access it. Creating your creativity for your own credit Marcel Keusch places Marcel Mandu in the same category.
