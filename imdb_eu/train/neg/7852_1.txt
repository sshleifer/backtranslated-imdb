I do not have a horror movie, but my wife's nephews and nephews. So I saw the first movie. It was shameful and I did not like it. Still good. For the sake of similar reasons, at this time I am also in favor of a sequel. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is beyond the absurdity. I can buy catastrophes in disasters. I can buy the existence of mutants. Even though I can buy the military that may be strange and extravagant events. It is likely, yes, but I think I'm willing to hang out. <br /> <br /> However, I'm not in any way obliging the military team assigned to this area to refuse them. mutants As a member of the United States Army, I can assure myself that fresh contracts with eyes and no experience of soldiers would be included in such a good recruitment team. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br That's how it works. Right-wing movements, more fire power and, of course, radio support, would only guarantee victory. I do not mean that you are not dead, but as soon as the field is confirmed as an enemy, military training would be a priority, no-one would go for their own use for the bathroom. <br /> <br /> And it was discovered that the area against the enemy was so dangerous that the team was unable to manage the risk, they left without any solution. And believe me, their radios would not be confused, if radio would not be the option, it would be a military satellite phone team. If the options are not checked each hour, the search will be called. <br /> <br /> To accept this movie, you need to admit our soldiers to the foolish incompetent, the disabled leader and another. poor command It is true that the world map and the compass lieutenant are the most dangerous, but our military forces have intelligent soldiers, well trained and trained. Mutants with knives are much less likely to face up to our ability. <br /> <br /> The entire movie's execution is impossible to imagine, the movie fails. Instead, we believe that our soldiers, sailors and riders do not face the least threatened threats. <br /> <br /> As a veteran combat, I insult the movie.
