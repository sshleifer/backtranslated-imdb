Do not waste your time with this film. This actor, director, sound bandaketak, soundtrack ... has changed ... It's a bad performance by an actor in some of this. Paresh Rawalengana film does not do it justice, a talented actress in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar, a new star, is making a pretty bad job. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? Do you call the conference? Esan nahi nuke Jainkoari eskerrak eman behar zizkion aurpegi polit bat duela, bestela Razzie sariak irabazi zizkion Indiari, Bollywood-en sariak emango balira. Asran is a great talent, but it increases its bit as before. Boeing Boeing 1965 did not mention the script was quite bad. First of all, Bollywood people can not do something original. In addition, they do not know how to copy correctly. The jokes of the movie were so noisy, it sat down painfully through them. Priyadarshan south can be a star, but it's just not right to make a film in Hindi Hindi decent. Sound editing is amazing. I can continue on this topic, but it is essential that Bollywood should do this film as shameful. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that some people are fond of watching this movie. What's up with you? That's why Bollywood is there. Ba al zenekien Bollywood-ek Hollywoodek film gehiago egiten dituela urtero, baina film gehienak atzerrian ez dira sekula entzun, hau bezalako filmak baitira. I am Indian and I am so shameful that Bollywood will produce this thrash piece. Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were great films. They are world-class movies, timeless ... the best of this decade. Garam Masala, however, may be the worst of this century. Deadline <br /> <br /> I give you 10 out of 10.
