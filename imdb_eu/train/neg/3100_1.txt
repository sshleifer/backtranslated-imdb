Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins ... where do I start?! <br /> <br /> This film has earned money for Manos - The Hands of Fate and Future War. This is a fun laugh, as it was painful to see Manos. Hobgoblins will finish somewhere in a time capsule as a perfect movie to describe the term "80's". Playing (and using this term roughly) is made atrocious; Hobgoblins are some of the greatest puppets you'll ever see, and it's considered a martial arts strategy. The movie was the perfect MST3K vehicle, and this version is the only way to see this mess. This film features Mike and Bot's ammunition to capture some of the funniest lines ever performed. If you try to see this Mike and Robots without help ... God will help you !!
