Shintar√¥ Katsu plays Zatoichi with a horrible tone. Zatoichi films had a strange and compelling concept: a blind guy is the biggest sword in Japan, and each film passes the right punishment and rewards the criminals. It's a crazy guy and movies are exciting and addictive (I've actually seen the movie once). That's why I saw this last division of the Hanzo the Razor series, I thought it was very similar ... and I was wrong! It turns out that Hanzo films are very sexual in nature and "women who deserve it" also promote rape. You see, Hanzo Meiji is a policeman of the time and often mischievously guards women and asks them to rap the "steel penis". How did you believe in how powerful a member is to be believed is something to be seen, but it's definitely NOT released. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not recommend anyone who can watch movies and misogynist. However, according to other reviews, I see that they are still very popular ... and this is quite scary. Even though some lightweight and fights are awesome, movies are like brain pollution - and I did not imagine how movies can help women to fight violence.
