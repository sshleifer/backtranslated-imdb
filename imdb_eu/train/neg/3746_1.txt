In my opinion, it is very hard to do with the worst thing that has been happening in the last few years with tremendous reality. I still ask if this is just the end of the SCTV team. If Andy Kaufmann was alive, I'm sure he was there. Is a rock band smaller than INXS to make such a shameless thing? The premise is easy and morona. Listening to a Karaoke series will be heard to become the new singer of INXS, Michael Hutchence (1997) to take his place. Eight years later and later it has not been successful, the band is committed to the latest action of patheticism, to become a new singer of a 20-year-old group of talented singers. So they are fighting for all of these singers (I thought American Idol had part of the doozies) that make rock-rock classic (and predictable) rocky performances all around. Then, they cut off the members of the INXS group that discussed the merits of each of these perceptions. Any night club in any of the cities around the world can watch musicians (and originals) better. It has all the creative elements of all other realities. Lame reality participants, love conversations, love host / emcee, gratitude "judging" performances, and withdrawing from the hands of a participant at the end of each show. Can these shows be foreseen? It is clear that the advance of a public expansion of a group; The last breath of hope, until the forgotten old miss is forgotten. Michael Hutchence, if he is alive in dignity, must throw him into his grave. NO INXS was ever a great group, but I did not know it was pathetic. If INXS is a representative of the INXS, who has become a rock-and-roll, it would be proof that he will be dead.
