In response to this film, this war is wrong (and now only a few US wars get a bit of oil). <br /> <br /> How much civil death has been innocent, how many lives have died and what kind of stupid embarrassment are they? <br /> <br /> So, I'm asking you - if the American soldier fights enemies and women, it's okay, but if the government dies suddenly deadly chemicals that kill his forces, well, is not he? Your logic fails, sir. <br /> <br /> <br /> I will give a solid performance to 5 and all 1 to a total of 3.
