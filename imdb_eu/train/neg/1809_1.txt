There's nothing I hate, I'm mad I'm mad. Kevin Smithe deserves his deserves on his knees, deserving of inspiring inspiration for every movie of the white middle class why they do not know. I do not like inexperienced and low-budget productions, but when writing is clear when it smells of my potatoes. The money put in this way could go to a true filmmaker directing film like John Gulager. If you see Project Greenlight, you will discover a visible talent that is fighting against the system immediately. Everyone can take a camera and make a talking image, because it does not really say anything. When will we save them from the world of Smithonita and Whedonettes? The revolution will not come soon. Go for the first time with a special effort to buy Desperado or Search with Friends With Benefits. Thanks and good day.
