When Ritchie appeared in the first film, her films were entertaining, entertaining, direct and original. If he had compared the murmur with the first two attempts, and should you consider the near-most universal lie that created the last two outings, should it be considered - has Ritchie been found?

Or is it just a terrifying and booming director, what all that wants to be Fincher, Tarantino, and Leone are correct, and they all got into a huge and unknown colony? When seeing Revolver, the excuse to think was wrong? What happened to humor? Where did he get mixed and mixed ideas? The revolution is trying to be clear, philosophical, and short, being smart psychoanalysis tries to become a complicated and intricate thriller. Ritchie makes great efforts to fulfill all of these goals and invests great screenwriters to include existing concepts and some plots. However, in the end, it is only useful to build a strictly disjointed, structured and, ultimately, advertising film. Plagiarism is so sinful and shameless that even if Ritchie does not try to influence himself, he will try to overcome his work.

However, his absent face falls and fails to achieve everything he wants.
