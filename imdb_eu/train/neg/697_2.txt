The two things that are good about this movie are two unknown celebrities. <br /> <br /> First of all, Daphne Zuniga, whose first appearance in a film, is young and elegant, still strives to still look at her body today. It's all at the start, that is, that's it. Certainly it has begun to have an impact with its next projects. Secondly, the famous score for Christopher (Chris) Young is that this star does not get this star ... I know a star is not a lot more, but in this case, it's a lot. <br /> <br /> The rest is just stupid stupid, the horror pair is trying to break the university that is trying to clean up a university room, to get rid of each other, killer, blah, blah, blah unknown ... we all know where it goes. <br /> <br /> See Daphne Zuniga's first eighteen minutes. then turn off.
