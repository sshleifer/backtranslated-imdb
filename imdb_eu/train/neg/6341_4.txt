East Palace, West Palace reminded me of The Detective Detectors, with police officer Frank Sinatra, and William Windom is a boy. I think China is a progressive film, but it also perpetuates the myths of gay femininity: men make a lot of Chinese myths involving female roles. The film is directed to an effeminate guy, a man who wants to be overwhelmed and desperate. He frightened the park without fear - the officer hopes to take him to the station. And this happens. The official then tells the whole story of life while undergoing torture: it has been generously handed over for a while, wrists, slapped. This gay man is what he wants, and, implicitly, this gay man questions the police self-image as the same man. Gay males' story (including flashbacks) is acceptable, but when it describes Chinese myths and plays, the movie becomes unbearable. It becomes the cry of mercy of Chinese gay people, who only want to fulfill the traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can not associate.
