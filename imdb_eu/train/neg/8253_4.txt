It's almost OK to conclude that CORNY and PREDICTABLE is ... The most romantic thing goes with everything "likable" for each character's superb. The main character has made a mistake and the scene of the main character who seeks the "woman" of her dreams, in recognition of her love for her friendship. Come on In the end, win 'on guys', 'bad guys' loose ... you get a picture. The residue of an interesting movie.
