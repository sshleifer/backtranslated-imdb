LADY LOVE! By giving this movie, just 1 instead of 1 is the only reason Tom Hanks is fun as Elvis-in-the-Box. In addition, how did you manage to sign up for this decent duo cast to make a lame film? At that time it seemed to be a good idea ... It's not a laugh to mention, the stereotype is pathetic, the lost is lost, the direction is amateur. As I now think, most of the blame was with the director Joel Zwick. It shows flat performances for all the participants. Do not miss it like I did as time went by; But then I enjoy a good catastrophe. Well, now the system tells me I need more lines - go here: This movie is called Sender Return. Ok, now it was more fun than the movie ...
