The reason given is not what my lawyer knows, but well-known, the light is worth the time. My rumors, briefly: <br /> - Dialogues often as weak and sometimes unbelievable to the person given. <br /> <br /> - Does not convince the performance. <br /> <br /> - Storyline never hit the fire. <br /> <br /> Writers cut the bits they chose in half a dozen films, they were thrown into a bowl and they did not feed enough and tried to feed the poorest food we needed. <br> /> <br /> Long and short, though not absolutely terrible, it was definitely not worth the expense of absorbing NetFlix rentals.
