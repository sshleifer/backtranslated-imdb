Hey, I would recommend it for about an hour and a half to kill it. If you like cheaper b-movies like me, it's just pink! Also, I would not suggest you want to rent it, I would have to wait until I arrive at a tube, at 4:00 p.m. in the free access channel of your cable / satellite provider. He made a video camera for two years after he was on the road, and they did not listen to live on the reviews of these two small towns. So, if you find it good once again, if you think that grass is much more fun, it's good to see how you watch a low budget movie.
