As I see this movie, it's interesting to see how much black men do. The film shows time in which the black man who is visible in his time (heroic moment). In a large part of the movie, other black men in the film (and black women in the background) are almost visible. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams was a great and kind character. The viewer can easily identify and rely on it. There are also quite impressive support and three-dimensional support for characters, soft skins and some white stars with warmth and dignity. But 99% of men in this movie are just invisible men. The mere shadows on the back, no effect. Such huge mistakes, but nothing unusual in the mainstream media.
