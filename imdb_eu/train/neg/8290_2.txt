Alan Rudolph is so many directors without this special touch. For example, there was a shot shot at the dentist's secretary's office, which could indicate the full relationship between her husband's wife. Rudolph ruined it. The camera is viewed on the hallway of the two tooth offices, each time Dana and Dave each in their room. You get the idea of ​​their destruction and isolation, but not much more. Lighting, colors, body language, facial expressions have been fully enhanced. If I were a director, I would spend all day, if necessary, to get that movie. It is the beauty and power of the film: it can make so many expressions in life for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> The joke of children that are joking can be improved. The child should have been more fascinated by the well, he had tightened and hung his shoes, looking at the wellness that he should bend to the head. <br /> <br /> Campbell did not deliver it. It is true for human communication, but his voice, gesture, instead of moving an internal movement of the body, is based on the narrative and dialogue voice attributed by the movie alter ego interpreted by Denis Leary.
