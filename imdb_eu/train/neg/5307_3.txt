What happened "Doubt" was a potential to be a potential film, but instead I failed to do the stroke with a drag-and-drop line and I wanted to see it. The only thing he had to do was to make Meryl Streep's films, DOUBT deserved the Oscar nomination. Although he is not one of his best performances, he still gave us a solid and true character that flourished throughout the screen. <br /> <br /> However, the glow of a screen legend could not even keep the movie going down the hill. With a boring beginnings, no power or no hole, the end was really desperate to obtain a convincing ending - especially given its potential for promotion and trailers. It was clear that the director had trouble with the simplicity of the plot and finished with boring film, it was too long to crawl, with too much debate and not enough action. <br /> <br /> In addition, the other Oscar nominations were not convincing. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman earned a decent performance, it was not worth the Oscar. (Mostly in Will Smith, Seven Pounds) were completely abandoned. Amy Adams did not deserve to be named. Seeing Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box, on one side and plain. It would be sensible to name Razzie, I'm sure that I'm going to win. Viola Davis gave a brief but true performance, but she longed for her long performance if she had to name the academies. In 2008 it was so much a potential that the movie was confused and I did not recommend it. Meryl Streep is the brightest light in the movie, although it's a solid and robust performance - it's not enough to save this movie. *** / 10.
