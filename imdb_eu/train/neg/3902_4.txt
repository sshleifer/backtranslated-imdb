This is exactly the adaptation of the novel by god Jane Austen. Along with Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written as far as possible compared to the American version. But the play was horrible. In addition to Kate Beckinsale, when I thought Emma was a true image in the book, all other actors tried hard too. Mark Strong was not a "gentleman". She was often rude and offensive, with no feelings, and you can not see any Emma love "grow" like Emma. This had a great impact on Kate Beckinsale, trying to "revive" himself and his partner. Also, there was no chemical cast full. Hariett Smith, led by Samantha Morton, seemed to be no real attachment to Mr. Elton, led by Dominik Rowan. Therefore, there were not enough laces to be portrayed in the book. Movie settings are also bad. The clothes are even more. I would like to wear Emma Woodhouse fashionable and elegantly here. The end is too long. It's good to look like the end of the book, but it's a killer for a movie. And again, I can not see the feeling of happiness. In front of Knightley Finally, I thought this adaptation was loyal to the book, but with poor actors. It seems that the movie was made without any budget. I'd rather see a "lighter" version of Paltrow and Northam, even though it was a "blockbuster" rather than seeing actors (except Olivia Williams and better Kate Beckinsale). full script
