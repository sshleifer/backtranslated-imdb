This movie was awaiting a specific movie about the impact of Sam's son on society. I did not expect Spike Lee to force more junk-throwing tension, mafia justice, or ordinary people's junkies to put pressure on. Lee introduced extreme opinion. <br /> <br /> The whole movie can be more efficient in 90-meter format more focus, if lower sub-plots. <br /> <br /> Don 'not the worst, apart from renting the video, if you enjoy Pleasure by Spike Lee; In that case, it is worth the theater. This is not a fugitive movie.
