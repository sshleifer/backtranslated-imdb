How can I get comments like high school girls' titles on this site, the stupidest movie I've ever seen, how ridiculous I can sit and say in the movies. A good movie jumped out, I could hear what I ever heard, I could run away and "Boo" could jump and jump, but that does not mean I can write or direct the movie, "all sleeping together". It's not good reason to get it right. What movie would it be if they did not match everything, I think it would be a half movie, not the whole movie. So, essentially, to make this stupid girl complete the movie, I love how modern media and production companies maintain their high standards today. It is not surprising that the political system in this country wants to get out of it, we have similar idiots in our country, what would happen if that girl is a terrifying thought when she's doing something. Live and watch a real movie sometime, try Shawshank Redemption or On the Waterfront, or something like that, and do not say it's "boring", just to see what God used to do a bit.
