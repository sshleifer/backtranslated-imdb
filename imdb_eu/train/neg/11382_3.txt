Anyone will notice that Tommy has only three faces expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. Angry eyes give each enemy. 2. Hands with face, sharp mouth and horror eyes. 3. Tommy Turnbull smiles. <br /> <br /> I have to say that they hate this show, I do not see it but it's like Code Lyoko, we've all seen it at least, I need to say that this show is the limitation of racism, interest and sense. <br /> <br /> In all episodes the robotboy wins with the winner, excepting an exception to the fact that robotboy basically makes this geeky freakazoid fly on an airplane. <br /> </ p> <p> The joke seems pretty raw, especially I think people say "Suck" or "farting", I think the show is astonishing. <br /> <br /> Is it not that he conceals a bowl under his hatred, and the other uses a chain, in God's sake, what type of school he goes to school. His oldest brother, with a psychopathic boundary, has no nature. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that the whole show is extracted by megas XLR and Fosters. It's similar to those of Coop three, Jamie and Kiva, as well as Robotboy Megas, it's similar to all the people that have won it, and it goes along with freedom despite being a robot. <br /> <br /> There's just that. No appeals to this show, I'm surprised I'm still on the run.
