I'm insulting that movie, not even fun ... And I thought Mulan was incredible! Although Disney's expectations are terribly low, I never thought that something stereotyped should do something. Here is no respectful true Chinese culture, a tradition of martial arts in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I know that they tried to get into a normal Wendy teenage girl ... But, fortunately, the most common teenage girls, especially Asian teenagers, are much less obsessed with these superficial aspects of life. And from a cultural point of view, it is almost impossible. Yes, there are girls that are celebrities and fashionable, but they are quite rare. And there are still still decent minds. Another stereotype, perhaps, but quite true. How Chinese parents work. That's how China's values ​​work. If they want to become authentic, Wendy will become an ironic young girl with glasses and her relationship with the deaf in love with her family. <br /> <br /> This adds my frustration to American films. Asian culture is not about fuzzy phrases about meditation and nature. At all times we are not eagerly stuck and we do not know martial arts. WE ARE PEOPLE, and I would like someone to write an Asian section, because we did not imagine a dumb caricature.
