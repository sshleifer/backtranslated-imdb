My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years and shared an office with her. When he was telling BTK he was amazed. He told his stories all day long he never saw as Wichita Killer. I heard them say again. I asked a lot of things, and I went to the conversations to go. I have read the entire book written about Raiderri, Wichita is in my hometown, and I was surprised to see that things like this happen in Kansas. <br /> <br /> It's not a different BTK movie a long time ago, and I thought it was a portrait of Dennis's killing, maybe it might be smart. <br /> <br /> I'm going to be a bug in this movie. This is when my mother portrayed me, video tapes I've read about all my readings and their conversations. <br /> <br /> First, the camera angle was horrible. He seems to have filmed on a home camcorder. The play was awful and I could not see it. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider has never had a long hair. Dennis Raider was a "very anal man" and was a type of "follow the rule book". As the film looked like, it was not very nice, very polite and violent, like the business. As we all know, it works for their murders. If you've been confessed to the court, you can think of it already. <br /> <br /> And about murderous obsession? No I have never read or acknowledge that Dennis Raider has no problem with animal cruelty or bad mistakes. In fact, he used cats and dogs to overwhelm methods. However, he crossed the whole movie to act like the animal on his victim's faces and their well-being. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But she also tells the lady who also knows her first movie. <br /> <br /> I do not really want to get into this movie, and I'm already ranting. It's NOT the real BTK events you want to watch. This is not a good movie of horror you want to watch. If you want a semi-porn movie filmed with murder scenes, you were serving side by side, this is your type of movie.
