If I had rated this movie I would like 0! I see some ppl on the IMDb, said it's the funniest annual movie year, and so on? ppl snorking LSD or ........? There's nothing fun about this movie N O T H I N G! I really want my 27-minute piece of my life back to see this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> I sat in an airplane I read in a person after the 30 minutes after watching this movie, I fully understand that, in fact, I would see a snake in an airplane more than 2 times instead of watching this movie! <br /> <br /> DO NOT watch the movie, make your life useful, something else, dog, dog ... something better than before before the TV.
