Battlestar Gallactica was so close because she had a close writing, an excellent look, excellent actors, and interesting stories ... And yes, hot men and women are turning to uniforms. <br /> <br /> Caprica was lazy. Heavy writing Actors burn a storm to "character". The external sequences that damage the feeling of being somewhere else (yes, this is what Ford Focus is sitting behind). There are many drops in teens. Gyrating naked women (but in the background. I'm sure it will be cut in series) and token towels for some men. Except for Polly Walker, I did not even take care of one of the actors. After an hour and a half, I asked him when he would end. <br /> <br /> So, what is it supposed to take with me? Science fiction? It's clear about it. Actors? In addition to the good round of Polly Walker, it's not interesting here. There's no "cast" cast, perhaps except Esai, though it's a bit older for younger than 25 years old. <br /> <br /> I love BSG. When I heard Caprica I was skeptical and, unfortunately, I'm right. I'm very short to face this series if SciFi does not really sharpen its pencils and work on more than one OC on another planet.
