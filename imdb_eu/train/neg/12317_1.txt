Fortunately for lovers of this movie, but it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Slow, badly thrown and misunderstood is the movie that tries to escape the romanticism of recent years and has failed! McDonald and Parker can not convey real emotion and survive. Apparently, they do not seem to be in any check they get from this money, and they thought it was not a good idea. Land DULL !! I love the big chick movies, the next girl and that's not one !! If you avoid a movie this year ... leave
