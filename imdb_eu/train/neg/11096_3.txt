I awaited the great hope for this movie, because CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first feature film) was a wonderful movie, I've never seen the smallest movie budget movie ever. <br /> <br /> But a large part of CLAIRE DOLAN is completely trivial and flat. After the scene, the scene is moved to random mix, without the narrative or the character's thoughts. <br /> <br /> Can Claire get out of being a prostitute or not? It's hard to tell. Why does it take to try to escape this life at the airport at the airport? Why does not the tricks that Seattle needs for tricks? Why should we see almost the same color as dyeing hair? Why Claire accepts some John and not others? The filmmaker does not know. It seems that everything is improvised (although I understand that this is not the case) and filmmakers only make a camera on it verite documentary. <br /> <br /> After watching the project, Kerrigan defended his lack of narration as he condemned the narrative of films as politically conservative. It was like rhetoric. I think it was a cop-out. <br /> <br /> I think film, SHAVEN CLEAN, the creator of a movie as exciting as SHAVEN will be a film, and then defend it tired. "political topics".
