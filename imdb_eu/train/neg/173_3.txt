A decent sequel, but does not link to the original drill. A killer screenwriter (Judd Nelson) takes on new personalities to direct his novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. He is still a murderer, but the movie seems to be very massive. No humor is funny either. In total, it seems that the quality of the fast project is sometimes high in Nelson. This movie is about a script that has been rewritten before going to the screen ... this should happen to this script.
