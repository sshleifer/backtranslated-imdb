Cinema could be entertaining, but it is based on other bugs like Leeches and Rest In Pieces, at the bottom of the cinematic food chain. If they had a moving mask, it could be a very entertaining movie like Re-Animator or Dead Alive, but Juan Piquor Simon played boys in stains, but more often. <br /> <br /> The premise of this movie is a small community surrounded by mutated extremes. There is an abandoned waste of toxic waste, which, alongside a sewer line, turns extreme slugs and flesh into monsters - slow-moving monsters and breaking them into your boot. Michael Garfiled, a healthcare inspector, and the only people who are ready to face the two accomplices sponsors, are believed to be sheriffs and the mayor. The end of the body is to depose hatred, that is, unwanted (head-actor and screenwriter) as a scenario for the destruction of slugs. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (It's not a new earth. Simon seems to play gore on cheeks, but it's a direct conversation. Simon worked on a screenwriter - one of a kind linen and curious characters, this worship movie It could be. br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (You will not leave here.) A cavity in the piece has a lot of scenes and a great mental burst in the midst of a beautiful Italian restaurant. Blood and guts are enjoyed by many spectators, That is, it's totally rich. You'll also get plenty of slug smashing scenes from snails that werehes people's body and slug smashing. <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (Wow! Michael Garfield knows that this script is sour and his lines face- with a statement that she knows how to absurdly film this production, it's a nutshell, as Kim Terry, in his wife's way, works well, even though he does not wait for more than one more face. "Teenagers" were all horrible actors , without exception. This man, this film could be used by Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < ).
