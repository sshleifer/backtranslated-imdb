Cannon Movie This story is much worse, and it is a positive test that a five-minute fable is not a feature film. As Sid CÃ©sar, the poor emperor, is so stupid, it's hard to see him. Robert Morse is a sizeable size. Also, his apocryphonic nephew (Jason Carter) "songs" are not horrible and only slows down the background of the plot. Direction does not exist at all, and contributors know very little. Lysette Anthony's daughter is a pretty emperor, but, of course, her voice has doubled for a reason, a fate that shares many children. And the film crawls at the pace of snails. Hans Christian Andersen had a loss in his grave when he appeared. It can be said honestly, at least for the story of this movie, it's not surprising that it's going to be a direct forgetfulness.
