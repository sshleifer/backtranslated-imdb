It destroys all the intelligent forms that live as soon as you enter the screen! However, in the name of its producers, I do not mean that the movie goes into popular categories, it deserves a new name! It's "neurological drama"! Every neuron in one person's brain is dull and depressing. <br /> <br /> The color is the closest thing to never endure. He speaks to you, the members get disturbed, your mouth is open and it continues, and you are the one who gets the most curious symptom blind and red. <br /> <br /> No small feature such a "movie" like this. <br /> <br /> The only word that comes with me ends with my mind OUTRAGE !!!!!!
