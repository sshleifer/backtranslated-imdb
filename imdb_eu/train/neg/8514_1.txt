This movie is an ONE, because it's really a great movie. The DVD soundtrack is so bad, it is damaging to my ear. But the sight, undeniably, shows something fascinating in Italian society. I will not go into detail in something so amazing, but different events are completely abnormal. So I give it a kink value. Otherwise, the role of video, photography, adult actors and actors is a standard, practical jock for people who love foreign films. Roberto, the main character, has a full spectrum of emotions. But the point of being unbelievable is excessive. However, children in the film are usually 3/4 years old, and they are real and they offer illustrations of the Italian film life.
