I have to agree with the previous commentator and this Maltese. This second rate is a Western extreme confrontation that overlooks Western West and tries to eliminate stable time stamps. He would like to be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid", but he lacks film and charm. The direction of Andrew McLaglen is moving somewhat, and for the last 30 minutes, they are a real botch, an incomprehensible strategy for the heroes of Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone gives me a pin to explain why they explain to me on the surface). The treatment of the field of rape was somewhat embarrassing, and then the reaction to the woman was not true. Coburn is very bad, he escaped half-breed to take revenge, but not all of his refugees (such as those who bowl like a bowling alley). Michael Parks's incredible trends make it unnecessary and astonishing, but in this case it has been a good idea because its sheriff's modern style symbolizes the pleasantness that technological advances can bring.
