This show had pretty good stories, but a bad conversation. The main character was particularly annoying. It's evident why he canceled the show, though, like most UPN, I never knew how to run again in unions. <br /> <br /> Most of the plots seemed to have been copied from other shows. and movies, thinking that producers did not have an original idea of ​​their minds. <br /> <br /> I did not comment enough. You must have at least ten lines. The special effect was not bad in 2001. <br /> <br /> Gnomes were a nice character.
