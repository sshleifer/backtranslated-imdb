I'm writing this review for a while while watching the movie. It's the first time I try to do it, but I'm getting it from time to time without breaking. It's not life, but it's bad. <br /> <br /> It's almost painful and boring, especially when a hard-and-hearty brother who dies, Ryan (Colm Feore) is tragic and insane. -pitying. This would be much better if this movie could leave the story away. <br /> <br /> Debate, maudlin, just adds melodrama. Maybe someone decided that Ryan was not incredible, he would play it wrong. So, the problem is: who cares for the spoil of the jerk, the dangers and the wicked is dying? No, I do. <br /> <br /> The only thing he's doing for this character is killing him, and he's sorry but it's not enough. He does not die anyhow. We kill all of us sooner or later. He does not give anyone what he expects sympathy while he plays as a jerk. <br /> <br /> The other two characters and their actors (like David Cubitt Theo and Chandra West Sarah), are a lot more interesting, and his story, without interruptions by Ryan's self-compassion, would be much better. But it's not over yet, and it's time to hit PLAY again. Maybe something great will end before it's over. <br /> <br /> No. I'm sorry. This rented turkey returns tonight!
