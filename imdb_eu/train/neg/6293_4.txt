I wanted to see this film early and I thought it would be boring and I can improve how Bachelor Party 1984 version with Tom Hanks thought it was pretty good. I guess ... I thought it was honestly better ... I'm sure there were some fun moments, but it seems that I did not mark it with me ... The play was fine and the story was fine. The original continues, but I think it could be so much better ... I say this movie is for young teens and hearts; full of females, alcohol and sex ... this is just another typical movie from the Roman party that is taking place. This 4/10 is my vote.
