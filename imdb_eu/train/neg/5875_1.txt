This film analyzes Fred Williamson (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey (Lenny). They work as a private eye and meet all kinds of men and women with bad backgrounds. Mack Derringer's ex-wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer) approached a sex-talk phone call. Jennifer is trying to make a huge call to the threatening callers and he asks for help with other women. Mack & Lenny has more time in hand and will often go to Miami. Golf courses or sports centers that can be pulled out of the sports bar. There are many drumming, murders and double senses that this film brings to a great ZERO. Do not waste time, this film cost just 50 cents and it was too much.
