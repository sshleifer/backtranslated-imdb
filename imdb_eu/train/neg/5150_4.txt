I received a DVD from the Library, I hope you get a good idea of ​​how well it continues in the back of an opera production. I must say, I was very disappointed. The matter had so much potential. The groups of a Wagnerian production need to be elaborate and impressive and, after their creation and use, a good story can be an educational experience. Instead, we get the annoying clips of people moving around the great landscape elements, I do not help with a comment that can crash my attention. I used to listen to music in the back of the music. I felt the effort needed to make such a production - they found it quite well and the next time I'm operating, I'm sure I'll remember that the video is part of it - but I've been tricked a bit. Inaccurate comments and explanations.
