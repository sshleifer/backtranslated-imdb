You're kidding! <br /> <br /> But, nevertheless, I gave this film and three others, all of which were on DVD. The movie starts a good movie, but it's downtown. <br /> <br /> And finally, let's just say that it is one of the most anti-climate fighters. If you want a lot of Gore at the end of the sequence and a schlock horror dose, this is for you film .... <br /> <br /> <br /> 3/10
