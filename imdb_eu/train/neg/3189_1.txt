I think that Joe D Baker has proven to make money. The concept of the movie was not too good to start. This movie has so many bad things and I do not know where to start. The play is horrible. In cinematography it is marginal. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The score is horrible. Why this movie was created at Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted for this before writing and I can not believe that 9 people really think that "movies" are excellent. He liked two go-dancers. The ultimate justice would be if they blocked Wichitan outdoors and they would never see anyone again! It's much better than 1 out of 10 points.
