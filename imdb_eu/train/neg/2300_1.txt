The "700 Club" must have only one television program without television history. If he were to make a mistake, he began in the air in 1966, if not millions of people were hunted and lying. Pat Robertson, who has not written the megalomaniac founders of the Christian Coalition, thinks that "The 700 Club" misleads and misunderstood us, "thinks" us and convinces all of us. World-wide problems Homosexual, Wican, New Spiritualists, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, non-fundamentalist Christians, Democrats, mothers, foreigners, feminists, evolutionists, ecologists, NASA scientists and others do not share religious fanatic opinions. Actually, the "Daily Show" or "Saturday Night Live" is called the "News Weekend" section, or "FOX News". Of course, Pat always decides what each one decides, everything that he thinks and does not hurt what he does not hurt. In the meantime, his work continues in the process of transforming the United States police into a militarized state. Erroneous religion puts the nose on what he can do, and has asked for a donation after another. Approximately $ 100 will become a member, in a way that has been financed by Pat's African diamond mines and in the past government governments have reprimanded the environment too much to buy their oil. No, keep in mind that Pat was a good friend of Zair and Zimbabwe with genocidal dictators, to get that richness. God's glory is bigger, do you not know? And, of course, the hosts "The 700 Club" are always keen to read the "letters" by the audience, written by chance in the same format and written by the "viewers" in purple paper. They cure a host of various affections (they say they are "word of knowledge"), but those who did not appear in the program say what they have happened to them. Sincerely, how can a show be seriously when someone is using a bad appetite recording - people should be surprised at why there is In the audience studios. <br /> <br /> Pat's friends and audiences do not know what they do not know or they just do not want to know about it. He has said something incredible. He is the man who has agreed to Jerry Falwell on September 11, 2001. The terrorist attacks on the United States were the result of our punishment for the acceptance of homosexuality and feminism by God. Ironically, Pat has twice quoted publicly as saying the nuclear weapons in the State Department, I have certainly not deceived its wealth for these statements. Homosexuals, moms solitaire and "sinners" Her sexual practices are very interesting, but she knows that in some idiots the Korean war year As the Bible says, let it be fruitful and multiply, so congratulations, thank you, for Pat, it is probably a child of only one mother-born baby. Then, of course, the time he called to kill Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez (he was not a saint, but still). Oh, yes, and let's not forget that soon "conflicting in human life" was forced by abortion in China. A very "Christian" in him, would not you say? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> And despite the fact that Pat has forgotten, I have not forgotten that today Christians treated the evangelists as "they were Jewish. Nazi Germany." Honestly, the horrors of the Holocaust are almost impossible to compare "their attitude". Do you have to talk about it, how did he say he lied that homosexuality was a pathetic attempt to disassociate homosexuality from the Nazi party? History, of course, shows that the Nazis considered playing homosexuals as they did in the same way as Jews. Pat Robertson is one of the biggest liars in history. If it was a pinotxo, the nose would surround the earth. <br /> <br /> Sadly, more and more people believe each day. This is your people; The "700 Club" is one of the most dramatic programs in television history. He is as good as evil; it's wolf-clothes. The victory is dirty, it seems clean, pretty, and loving. There is evidence of a harsh and dangerous religion that is limited to some of the Middle East groups. Those who are not Christian faith know that everything taught by Jesus is the opposite, and as this "club" would appear to Jesus, he did not emulate them. Instead, he would punish the Pharisees of his time as did the Pharisees, and destroyed their telethon bundles as they did before the synagogue at that time. I can only say thank God that Pat has no choice as president; If he did that, he would be like a community of Armageddon - and not for good man.
