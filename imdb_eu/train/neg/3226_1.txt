We've got an unbelievable credibility with this movie. Basically, the old-fashioned dinosaurs Neweyes think they get into the aboard driven by the old man (after watching the movie I needed). Apparently, Neweyes listens to all children's wishes and decides that the will of the children would be to bring the dinosaur to modern times so that everyone can see their exploitation shaky. They eat things that make the dinosaurs more intelligent (they were not bad writers). By the way, it seems strange that every child's children's will in the world, Neweyes wants to bring Dinosaurs into modern times? Why do not you have the desire of children to stop hungering? Disease? War I mean! Is Neweyes doing anything better than this? In the end, when the Dinosaurs arrive at modern times, they start singing, dancing and destruction (basically what you would see in a bad LSD trip, I can say that they could see T-Rex playing golf and jumping in a balloon on Spider-man?). The children who accompany the dinosaurs that end up with the Brotherhoods and Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) signed a blank contract. Why? Why did the children sign an empty contract? According to Screweyes, they have dinosaurs ... "Brain-Drain" children will go. The evil dinosaurs instead of the evil Screweyes, agree and accept their terms. What ?! This is a fool! They could threaten him, he caused the contract to be removed, after eating, he went to the children. I think that filmmakers try to prove that violence is bad, that is, ultimately, the dinosaurs escape, and a rage of crows brings together Screwey and apparently eats completely. Yes, this is not violent. We're back, it does not make sense, it's not funny, it's bad, it's a fool, it's got a bit wrong and it's got some of the greatest pledges with the movie. For a child's movie ... this is it.
