Everyone with remote interest in science fiction should start. Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films, it's OK, but the truth is that THE TERMINATOR and SOYLENT GREEN are much better options than the series. SOYLENT is probably the best secret science fiction. One of the biggest films, still forgotten, remains one, but the impact of its implementation is becoming a reality every day. Charlton Heston overcomes his role but works. Edward G. Robinson, in his latest role, takes the most out of SOYLENT GREEN, touches more than anyone else and touches on the latest scenes. <br /> <br /> Manhattan is in 2022, the world is overflowing with food. It's wonderful (a tiny jam is worth $ 150). A senior director of Soylent died and Thorn police detected. <br /> <br /> The secret to the green of the sun is not a mystery when you're investigating the movie. SOYLENT is spectacular, but the script is a joke. It's as cheap as production. Screenwriting and dramatic plays by the actors of the film, but they were very hilarious. Everyone seems to be stupid, and nobody knows the rules, specifically that Thorn likes to get into the apartment of the people, he looks insolently and robs him. Interaction with the character keeps your attention on the movie, but you still realize that SOYLENT GREEN is sucking. If you have a nice time, do not expect more.
