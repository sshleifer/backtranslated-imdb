"Inkuboa" is a good mix (a mysterious, interesting murder), a bad one (a disconnected screenplay, an inadequate resolution, a mischievous attack on scenes) and a strange (intense stirrup, amazing and strenuous care of John Cassavetes - that character was really "wacko" to be it?). It is not nearly as offensive as it is, but especially as it is not successful. (* 1/2)
