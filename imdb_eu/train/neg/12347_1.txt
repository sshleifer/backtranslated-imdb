This is the worst film by Ridley Scott. Ridley Scott is a great director. But this film is a brand in its career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both of them are absolutely confusing about an excessive movie about a girl who goes to the army. Very stupid And there is no convincing scene. It's not hard to make a movie like this. Everything the crew made could be the idea of ​​anyone. Writers did not have much inspiration; many meaningless dialog boxes; and some headless actions. I strongly recommend it without litter. Many of the talents involved in this project believe that this type of film is not worth the attention, and in the future more and more intelligent films will be worked out in this unnecessary mix.
