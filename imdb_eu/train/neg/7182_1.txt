I could not recommend Christmas movie over drivel meaningless (trust me, negative doubles are needed here - it's bad). When this movie had problems with the initial credits, it was the same person as the scriptwriter's songwriter. Music numbers are too long and no one is good (the "Thank You Very Much" is a decent melody, but the stupid lyrics are beyond words.) I would gladly take Scrooge back on the strangest cloths of the hellish episode of the movie once again. <br /> <br /> The only fun part of that movie (quite unmistakably by the way) is included by Alec Guinness. Jacob Marley. Dressed in cloth dressed in white dresses, Guinness decorated his fantasy with his scene, floating like a ghost or his whole revelation to be a great movie. Albert Finney, at the same time, combines Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton with the disapproval of Quasimodo / Scrooge's unpleasant character. Finney's scrooge is so scary that it's impossible to believe his transformation. <br /> <br /> It is important to abandon this shooting purchase.
