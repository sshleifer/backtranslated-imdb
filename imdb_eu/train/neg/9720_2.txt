This movie is boring. <br /> <br /> Trying to cope with the borrowed effects of a borrower like Jeunet in "Am√©lie Poulain", but it's too much. The interviews are quite bad, the worst thing I've ever heard is Guillaume Canet is not convinced (I've never been very persuaded to find it), his father plays badly in the movie, the story is silent, the end ... stupid <br /> <br /> I think I have not liked the movie Christophe Gans's "le pacte des loups" (wolf-twinning) and I see 80-100 films a year. ), but the film had at least some acts and good actors. <br /> <br /> I never commented (rated only) here, and I thought I'd write when I saw reviews and comments. something down <br /> <br /> We have trouble selling a DVD that we do not offer: it's not such a bad movie in our collection (great) !!! <br /> <br /> I am open minded (SF, western, drama, comedy, silence, fear, fantasy ... movies, but the film was so boring as I lost an hour and a half.
