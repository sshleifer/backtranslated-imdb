This is the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre. It is uncertain whether Bront has read the script book or not. George C Scott is horny and as dirty as Rochester. The ancient ancient men are not angry. Susannah York has the most beautiful hairstyle I've ever seen in the 1970s. The characters hardly speak to each other, so the rich book of the book, their profound intellectual love and their rich love base, has disappeared. It's a playful fountain. <br /> <br /> Please rent Timothy Dalton version. As regards the book, it's just like reading the novel for you. Dalton is as magnificent as Rochester. G. C. Scott is laughable.
