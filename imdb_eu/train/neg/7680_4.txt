Snow White, in my opinion, is a bad movie in an artistic point of view. The plot is predictable, characters are stereotypes, excessive editing. However, it seems that a lot of artistic intentions of films do not. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think it's a straightforward commercial thing. In addition to the Swiss French character (the main character IS, the main character, the group SENS UNIK) wants to be a bigger audience. A straight German Swiss movie would not be sold in the French section - and vice versa. My nerves really got products made throughout the movie. Occasionally the scene of your ads clips! <br /> <br /> I also think that "the other young people who take drugs without any other purpose in their lives" is a reality in Zurich. So, it is very important to deal with it. I hope that Samir has earned enough money with Snow White, and his next film will show real artistic skills.
