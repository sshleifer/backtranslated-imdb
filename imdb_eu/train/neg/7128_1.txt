We have a red person for renting a DVD REDLINE. Chicago Pictures made stupid movies never paid for the Palisades Media Group to buy web advertisements in my automotive sites, including 16K ALEXA grade. They robbed the deal and now I got $ 16,000 and you've lost a lot of my personal time (Palisades Media Relations) who you know! <br /> <br /> Please do not rent or buy this movie !!! The flavor is that the people behind them are artists. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has losers and bad actors. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke
