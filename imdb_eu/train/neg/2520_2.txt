OK this movie has been a huge premise. Soon they have to be serious about a movie made with an apocalyptic war but they have money to buy large robots and drill them. Each country decides to invest in rebuilding its country, which would not be able to fight with robots. Here's a better idea, leave our resources inept, jocks, fight our battles. <br /> <br /> Everyone says what the director says. Good movie, bad movie. There's no reason to give this movie for the director's credit, maybe he slept? I really liked this movie, because it was so tender and ridiculous I had to laugh. I saw a good day, except for a cowboy teacher who was not a murderer (trust me would not see a killer murderer, so it's a surprise, though, hands). What kind of training exercise is, nevertheless, a Jungle Jim. I was sad Mst3k did not see it. I give two star scores, but it can be as bad as "the hands are the hands of fortune". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The budget does not matter. like cube The story was also not compelling, and I've seen better plays in theatrical theater. Of course, they could give a performance of a school of eleven years old. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's a funny movie to watch.
