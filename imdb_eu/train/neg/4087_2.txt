I speak a little bit about the plot in the first part of my review, but this movie does not really speak. Simply, it's just a mish-mash of the best phons of the pharynx and the witchcraft. It overlooks the lack of cohesion as it is vain. Even though the main town that does not want clothes to wear, then it's boring because a young boy is so boring. At least it's fun in inadequacy, and it's worse in a great delay. Lucio Fulci rejected the bottom of the cannon and shows it. My Rating: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Posters and Stems Galleries; Lucio Fulci Bio; and US and international theater trailers <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sabrina Siani during the topless (some people think that's appealing, I do not); Various extras are also topless
