I expected that this movie would be quite a genre, like other genres. However, it was a mud and I did not laugh at all. Look at HBO, perhaps, or if you ruin your free rental and you need the time you need the movie. But I do not recommend paying a visit. <br /> <br /> The plot is straightforward and straightforward, and it might be fun if the script was better. Jason Lee can be horny, and he makes some laughs here and there, but the movie is flat. Ignore this The lack of management, but what it is, correcting is not so important. I think his main drawback is not very funny. See something else, do not waste time here.
