This movie is not at all funny. Plots also make no sense. A scientist working on science lines opens a doorway of another dimension (perhaps hell ???) and absorbs something of his or her daughter and, one day, he returns without apparent reason and now wears large breasts and wears it. A skimpy outfit (other dimension demons?) The main character is a guy who wants to get married to his girlfriend, but that gay is, therefore, interested in his new girlfriend and falls into witchcraft. Witchcraft book (they want to be witches or something?) And evil witch begins to read again and so the evil demon comes out to the ground and looks like bikini and men who are in love. There is no topless scene without reason in which a guy my boyfriend says is a wrestler, but his part is totally useless, obviously, they did something just because he put it, maybe maybe fans of the fighters will actually see this It's a pointless movie. . Of course girls do not hurt themselves. Additional DVD features were more confused than the rest of the movie; I thought what was going to happen, but that was really confusing. Who are these people and what do they do? Basically, this is a go-camping-to-out fight-after-monster movie, but there are a lot of stuff (other dimension and book seller) than confusing. I did not like the movie, but it was only five dollars so big. I do not recommend that this observation be stupid, I could not think it was a good part of the movie.
