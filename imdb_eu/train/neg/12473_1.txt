This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen, everything about it is weak and incoherent. The play is absurd, its costumes too crisp and the story does not exist. "Sword of poverty", a sword and adventure movie, "Beastmaster" and "Conan" wanted to achieve what they did but did not follow it. The boss is hard and sad, he can not fight with a sword and sword XVI. It comes from the twentieth century. All the sequence of actions are like that, when slow and realistic, when they play the castle and the octave music, they ride on horseback. Do not worry about that.
