I really wanted this West, a fan of the genre and a "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Calamity Jane" fan, they all are in this story! Add the mixture as the star of Gary Cooper, and it's very good. <br /> <br /> The problem was ... it was not. In 40 minutes I was looking at my watch, death was bored. Jean Arthur's character was annoying and James Ellison did not look or act like "Buffalo Bill". Cooper did not do good either, it looks like wood. He acted as an actor several years earlier. <br /> <br /> In short, the western circuits are empty. Go up the path and watch another list, most of which are much better.
