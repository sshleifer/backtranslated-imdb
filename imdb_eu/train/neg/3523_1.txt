Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Written by Sylvester Stallone and the protagonist, it was enough, and it was a joke rock climbing, vertigo, falls and scene cheating, and a joke transported in the air. There are two plots, both in love. One has failed the traumatic rescue; The other one destroys an airplane that throws an airplane and kills a lot of people as much as possible. John Lithgow is usually trustworthy, perhaps the result of a horrible product, depressed, "Bostid!" He does not care about it. an intricate approximation of an English accent. Janine Turner was a wonderful and enigmatic when he played in the North Maggie exhibition, unfortunately, the escalator and pilot rescue is wasted. Stallone is stolid and is a muscle head. There is no death on this line. There are no lines alive.
