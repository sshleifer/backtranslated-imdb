If you value an Asian horror resurrection, do not worry about Gawai. The films deserve the merits of works like A-list (Ringu, A Two Sisters, Cure, and Ju-On) (or even Eye or Inner Senses). These films include subtleties, unpredictable images, rich characters, and not full western ones. Gawi is tightened with the body and organs that destroyed everything that made America's horror misfortune twenty five years ago. <br /> <br /> The film tries to confuse the Asian ghost story and the Hollywood shorts. bad. An esthetic one must bind to cover the other; guess what? Their story does not stop filmmakers from stealing Ringu from a child's underbelly, but the situation is no hope. Klises, strange characters, no drawings, dull ghosts, jokes.
