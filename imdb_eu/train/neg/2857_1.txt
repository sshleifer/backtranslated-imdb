I saw several original Sci-Fi Channel movies in 2002 when I started to watch it in 2002 (My first was Sabretooth, I think it's one of the funniest features of Sci-Fi Channel). Quality varies. Some are average but decent (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some are laughably bad, and then some really terrible ones. Raptor Planet consists of the latter. <br /> <br /> Raptor Planet, a loose sequel to Sci-Fi Channel Original Raptor Island 2004, plays a bit of a movie, really acting and lying. The effects of dinosaurs on life (puppets and animatronics, as well as CGI and Raptor Planet footage) are some of the worst effects we have seen in a low budget movie. Gore effects are also unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The earth brings a lot of commands, for some reasons (why do I forget) they travel to a planet of aliens foreigners. That's the people, dinosaurs are foreigners. Dinosaurs in space. What's next, sharks in space ?! The rest of the plot is very easy. The human cast is gathered and eaten. Now, we expect this to be published on numerous dinosaur movies and novels, but this is the first murderous dinosaur movie I was bored with all the dinosaur attacks. /> There is no laugh. One scene stands out because a man who is masterminded by a Carnotaur (originated from the film of the original film) becomes later a giant raptor. Also, it's a bit of curiosity, this is Steven Baur's first scene to film the scene of death. <br /> <br /> A good movie that was not originally a Raptor Island, compared to its tracking, is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Believe me when I say it, it's probably the worst movie. Syfy never reveals. Hide near it.
