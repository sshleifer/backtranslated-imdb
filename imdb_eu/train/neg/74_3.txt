This was a kind of fantasy. He meets Snowy River's Man From Butch Cassidy and Sundance, and Nedek and Joe have got their talented talent, wealthy young women of wealthy old age. OK, there are many myths about Ned Kelly, but there are well-documented documents and they still allow for artistic creativity to create a good historical dramatization. I mean, this is not the story of Robin Hood, nor the legend of the Arturian, nor Beowulf, which is not so much a life for many centuries, that it is an invention of 99% of their life and of any time. Life is just a couple. My grandparents were already in school when Ned was hanging. <br /> <br /> So it is absurd to me that this fantasy movie was a serious attempt to tell Kelly story. When Peter Carey's excellent novel "The Kelly Gang of True History" was read, he was eager to be similar. But not really, Mick Jagger's 70's Kelly's stupidity was much closer to reality, and a better movie, in general, does not mean a lot. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I only hire two dollars for the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and this is just because I feel generous the beautiful shots of Australian shrubs.
