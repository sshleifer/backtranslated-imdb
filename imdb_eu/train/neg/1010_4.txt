I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman there; so he waited for him. And it was until Justin Timberlake came to the scene. He is a very bad actor and never had to make a movie. I mean, one of the most boring actors I have never seen. He does not make any emotions on his lines. Why did Josh Pollack cast off? I think Matt Damon would be a better option. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was another great despair. His character is so sad that American Beauty and John Doe Se7 seem to be a bad mix of his character. It might look good, but believe it, it's not. <br /> <br /> Now, Dylan McDermott's performance is very good. One of the best things about this movie. It's just inspired. <br /> <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good, but nothing special. It really has excellent lines. <br /> <br /> Although it was clear about the story, it was sometimes good. I expected a great turn when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) died, but nothing happened.
