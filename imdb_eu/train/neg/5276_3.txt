No, this is not about this fairy tale, with a pumpkin trainer, a fairytale and a glass shoe, but if I want to try it, you should ruin it for me, and that's not it. But do not leave out the best, because this movie is not fantastic. It is one of those films that are beginning to take place before the audience faces the horrors of their horrors cheap and with an incoherent story. That's a terrifying fear. Yoon-hee (Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. It's a successful plastic surgeon and your daughter is a beautiful, obedient, and beautiful teenager. Their relationship is like a hands-on glove, so close you would think it would be, rather than siblings, than parenting. But things start wrong (they do not always) when the friends of Hyun-soo, caused by Yoon-them, begin to begin. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, it warns the audience and those who hide under the Koran under the eyelid when women are under the knife, if they need to believe news reports. These scenes in plastic surgery are really terrifying moments, somehow Kim Ki-duk felt Time describes and explains what happens around the same surgery. Two half, the fist is an attempt to tighten the audience agitation, I admit, for me, they got me. However, in the second half he made the movie mumbo-jumbo melodramatic without force, and forced the idea to lower his throat. Some things do not make sense, and while they are always presented to explain attempts, you probably do not buy, horror movies are initially logical. <br /> <br /> The hands are pretty beautiful, and there is a different lack of male presence, but the role of a non-prudent policeman. But, yes, I do not complain, even though the story has been greatly improved. I'd recommend watching this, only the VCD Korean is just a horror hook. Be careful about the moments in your face!
