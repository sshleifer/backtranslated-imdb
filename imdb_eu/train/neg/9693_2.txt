The warmest plot of "Bonjour tristesse" is taken from a young novel by Francoise Sagan, best-seller. Teenagers who want to get rid of a potential parent parent can have some appeals. Do not join David Niven's playboy dad and Deborah Kerr's mother-in-law perspective. Unfortunately, he also has Jean Seberg's shoulders. It is beautiful and easily fills the image of a damaged girl. The problem is that the process can strike, but it can not act. Anyone who saw Joan de Joan's Joan de Joan in Joan of Ota as Joan of Arc, the first movie by Seberg, knows that he was not at the age of 19 for a movie. With Preminger, this film also fills the "promise" of the first. It was his second movie; It was now 20. What was Preminger thinking about? Did Niven and Ker want to compensate Seberg's ability to act? Is not it an option? Sebergen's character is in the middle of the story, and although she's pretty pretty, at age 17 she's physically unable to meet the emotional needs of her responsibility. I do not know whether or not he has become a successful actor in his short life, since he has not influenced my consciousness later in his latest pictures. But anyone who thinks he's better than that movie needs a liked check. Despite Niven and Kerr, this young lady is still a story she has taken from a girl who needed a bad lesson to teach poorly.
