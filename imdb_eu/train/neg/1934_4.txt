A commonplace formula for launching a new claim - this time by African American (Cuba Gooding) for the first time, President Truman disengages the Armed Forces - is led by a racist zealot through a deep-sea training program in the US Navy (Robert). DeNiro). If the program is not bad enough, it must be located in Bayonne (New Jersey). <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the performances. Robert De Niro activates his southern accent and shouts crying sharply. The Gooding of Cuba, created by a sharp father in the southern black country farm, is a perfect look of justice. Girls - they're hardly called women - Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. They have small roles and most of them are there to argue that their men should be sensible. Other good performers - Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook - have more stringent roles. <br /> <br /> That's it. A computer could fit almost everything. A boat is called a boat. Robert De Niro has come home, revealed. After a brutal attack on the hospital staff, he was named his outfit instead of screwed. Someone cries out "Here I am" in the early 1950s. (Perhaps, at that time, it was a common expression, so "my bad.") People strike each other on the line - "Lieutenant", "Grandmothers of Vessels", "Commander", as they do in the Navy, while the Navy "Mister" are simple (if they are official) or their last name (if they are listed). I did not have to worry about the level of "Senior Master Chief" in 1950. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding has a tough line. Everyone in the army seems to hate Negroes, except for a Wisconsin guy. Other people in his room despise him. It's like a scene in "Animal House". He asks a petitioner of Sonia, a Sikh, a black man and a blind child to wait in a room. <br /> <br /> Gooding enlisted is a man, a small secondary officer. She gets married to a beautiful young woman graduate from the medical school. In one of their arguments, he demands it. He wants to be a doctor and he should join him, get out of the army and make a quiet life. "And will you leave your life?" He says Yes Yes, you just have to be a doctor's spouse and let life overcome. You can wave the Boca Raton golf course. <br /> <br /> The kind of film of this type was enough in World War II. "Bombardier", "Airial Gunner," such things. They were often cheap, they had some educational features. You've learned something about bombardier or artilleryman. Here, technical details are skipped, perhaps because the writer does not know anything about them (Boyle's Law, except what he learned in higher chemistry). For such an emergency there would not be such a movie. If you've received mechanical problems, I guessed it correctly. The direction is not even support. The films are close, losing their dramatic impact. And the emergencies are confusing because they are poorly focused. <br /> <br /> Why follow? Do you want to see a better example of this kind of movie? Almost everything will be done, except for "G. I. Jane", the heroine is a malignant heroine. Try training outer scenes in "The Young Lions". There is a Jewish victim. Or try "From Here to Eternity", where simple sympathy is not encouraged by buttons and refuses to denounce a victim victim and who is involved in the conflict, like "Cool Hand Luke." The excuses are not easy to offer, because excuses are easy. <br /> <br /> Well-learned and well-done.
