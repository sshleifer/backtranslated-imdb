I focused on the observations of an episode I watched this night (07/26/06). I do not think I see again. The performance was wood, a totally predictable plot, a realistic endless end - I mean what would it be for a 30-million-dollar trial to recover a drug-based cancer terminal cancer? The main actor (Victor Garber) seemed uncomfortable, almost ashamed of his role; maybe write how bad it was !! I fully realize that the drama offered in this season is quite bad, but they surely can find better writers. Perhaps writing outsourcing is being done to India or China! I bet I can not see it next week!
