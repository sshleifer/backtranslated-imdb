I thought the movies needed plots, or to work on the story or take care of everything that happens. This movie has shown me that you do not have to have something like that. <br /> <br /> In short, I am. The IMDb wants to have more lines. It was nice It's not at all compelling. You think the characters talk about the movie in a few days, but there is no time to go and I'm sure it happens one hour. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to entertain yourself, buy a gallon of milk and see what you can throw quickly before throwing. The use of your time would be much better. You have never returned. Jurassic Park 3 was better than this.
