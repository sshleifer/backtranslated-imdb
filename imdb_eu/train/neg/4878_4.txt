If you want to make a movie like this, be a true threat. Do not surround yourself with your patsy Bonzo bunch. Here is no credibility. The plot is dull and unbelievable. Playing is even worse. I thought Arthur Lake (Dagwood) was one of the worst actors in the history, when I saw the main character. Well, at some point, he has to face the musician and he will attack him. I do not care Do not you? There are all long scenes in this brave office (cardboard or masonite furniture). People talk and smoke and do nothing. Most actions occur in a five-minute sequence. Then it's over. Do not worry
