This film was a long-winded building. In the end, people who refer to a sword should also be intelligent or have not been. Often this movie has been soft. I do not say that soft movies are bad. But even if it was a sugar, T-bone steak would have no place. This movie was a vengeance for crimes against a culture, but it came as a final test. And it was not one of them that really knew what the sword was; Tim Roth's character (and yes, he plays it well). Rob Roy's "hero" was weak, he had no way of using the sword, and he was "embarrassed". As a drama, the film had some times, but its best performance is Scotland's character. This is the short spirit called "soap" in my book.
