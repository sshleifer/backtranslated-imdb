What was the movie? What was on the plot? I do not know. Shaq can not act, people do not know how to direct and I'm Kazaam! Who is a genius who hears? Come on Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park will be in a movie like this. I remember that I saw it to kill time. I'm not really interested. I rememorated, "Who put Shaq in this movie?" The whole story was stupid. He had no sense. I think that this film is an unmanageable morale that finds something in the ghetto and that something can happen. I can not comment much more because this movie is so awful, it's not worth the comment. The movie "I want to" disappears.
