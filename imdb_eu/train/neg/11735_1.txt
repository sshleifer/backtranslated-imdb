This movie completely crazy, because the main characters or all the characters had a southern accent. I have lived in England for 29 years and I know that people do not have an accent here. This movie is about a type of method, and I do not know the real plot or what the movie is about. It has a nice drug use and insults the use of these people with sugar. I missed my brother in detail and this film makes me sick in my stomach because it glam drugs. The film looks like a pretty drug, but at the end I was glad when the guy made it almost throughout the state's line. I also know that most women who are traumatic rape do not want to love their beloved or husband the next day. The movie is in all directions wrong. I would suggest "The Basketball Diaries" if I propose a movie about drugs.
