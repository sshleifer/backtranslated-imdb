"The Man in the Attic" is a movie in the 1910s. The real story is inspired. Unfortunately, it's a story to be told. <br /> <br /> Looking at the box, the film-maker was trying to make this film an obvious and erotic thing. They use terms such as "illegal passion," "forbidden affair," and "unlimited pleasure." Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser, M.D) also shows a picture of the gun! <br /> <br /> The story is Krista, interpreted by Anne Archer. Unfortunately, he is married to a lord with his own business. Edward (Harris) is a husband-in-law employee. Krista and Edward will fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The movie is supposed to be an "amazing" episode: Krista's husband discovers love and never forgets to see him again. What do they decide? Krista eventually lives in his chamber Edward. Wow! Krista begins to see someone else and Edward becomes jealous. So, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> "Attic men" does not take any new territory. It's the original image of Showtime, which explains why the stars are a couple of actors in the B list that are both short-sighted. <br /> <br /> <br />
