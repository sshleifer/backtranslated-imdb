As an engineer, I must say that the first season of the show is very promising. Most of the applied mathematics were credible, and the relationship between Eppes brothers and father gave them a great advantage. <br /> <br /> But after the first season, the show started very hard. Most of the maths and technologies used in crime repair are totally stiff and strangest to all those involved in real science and technology. <br /> <br /> The participation of the actors feels good and I can imagine a fair. The amount of money is still producing each section, but in the end this is a very unpleasant tasting dish, which is a grade C action thriller and CSI style police show mix. <br /> <br /> If you see, you will only go through the first season and the second parts. From now on I had not lost any time. I myself, the show that I gave in the middle of the 3rd season. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars <br /> <br /> Leave a maximum of 4 stars. Charlie does not know his mathematics, I will not disturb him.
