Until now, the worst movie I've ever seen was Ben & Arthur. You should really check out the reviews of this movie instead. The revision statistics for this movie have been positive, through an impulse and scrupulous impulse of people who make it. Online onset is pretty straightforward. At least, people who had been Ben & Arthur had the honor to leave their vibrant legs with an honor, but we were not encouraged by scruples, they would buy suckers like me. script, story, questioning, acting, direction, photography, editing, music ... what else does the movie do? Anyway, it's just as bad here. If it were not unpleasant, it would be ridiculous. I continued to see it, I thought it was better to do it, I still have not found that positive reviews for them are not reliable. <br /> <br /> It's not a lot of money to make a big movie. Low budgets do not have to be a bad movie. Gus Van Santen Mala Night is an amazing example of my creative budget masterpiece, but there are many others. Sideline Secrets? Director's Cut or Origin? It's a bad thing, because they did not have any money, because they were gigantic spirits and nothing special, nothing.
