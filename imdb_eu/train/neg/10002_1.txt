I'm sorry for everyone ... I know this is "an art" movie, but wow, the guns were to be screened so people could not see themselves and see them. Although scenic design and excellent photography management, seeing this story is very painful. No soundtrack was brutal. Loooonnnnng was too long. How long can you see two people sitting and talking? Especially when the conversation is complaining two people. It was really difficult to get through this movie. The performances were excellent, but how many dark, obscure, impersonal things can you take? Maureen Stapleton and the only thing I liked the red-and-white dance scene. Otherwise he was spreading to Bergman. And I'm not a fan. I think this is about 1/2 hours of anyone who says they enjoyed it.
