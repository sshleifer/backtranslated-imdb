The easiest way to describe the movie is a satire. The purpose of satire is quite broad, the US government is in American corporations. Also, it is not a buzzing satire, but a stupid one. <br /> <br /> Think of this movie as a mixture of Kentucky Fried film, Airplane and Police Squad series, less fun and less budget. I can see that this movie is a satire of several science fiction disasters in the 1950s and 60s. This film is a great influence on Tim Burton's Mars Attacks. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple. Genetically modified tomatoes go on a "crazy" giant and begin to attack people and cities. Initially there is a cover and then blows the war. <br /> <br /> The film takes on a range of characters and characters: Lois "Fairchild" (Clone Lois Lane), a very ambitious presidential. The secretary of the press, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (the FIA ​​agent has not worked since the Bay of Pigs), an unnecessary president (who only seems to be able to attack his name and New York), an inept congress. Marketing Director General, and Mason team swims a "female" East German, diving, diving, paratrooper and World African American costume, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and, finally, tomato. I also forgot to mention, many tomatoes? From small tomatoes to small tomatoes, giant plastic tomatoes, tomato crumbs, tomato juice and, finally, topped with tomatoes are all types of tomatoes. <br /> <br /> Above all, you have a couple of music numbers too. They are not good and they seem duplicates. The best melody is the movie ("Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"). He is very keen and you can end up whistling or public. Be careful. <br /> <br /> Most of the movies is very funny and shows some nonsense and different genres of entertainment situations in real life. I do not think it's caused by laughter, but above all I smile and bend over my head. I definitely recommend this movie for fans of the B and C series, but only for rent. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
