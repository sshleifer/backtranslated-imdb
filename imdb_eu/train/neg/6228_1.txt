This movie is badly incomprehensible. It starts with some random explosions and then throws a T-Rex puppet stock into the audience (!). Puppet stockings and animation are included, probably because filmmakers can not directly pay the actors. I will give you a wonderful, tireless slogan that puts a dark film for a sustainable 85 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of my friends found a very strange video in a store that sells. print b-films, and bought the sole purpose that he bought it, but, as a result, our intervention was not necessary. This movie is better than we could not do. <br /> <br /> I thought it was Ed Wood's "Space 9 Outer Space" movie, but ignored Japonamation / Lego auto / Sock puppets. Wherever you see this movie anywhere, buy it undoubtedly. It's very strange and it's a lot worth it, lots of laughter.
