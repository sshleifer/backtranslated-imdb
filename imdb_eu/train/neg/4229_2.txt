I am a fan of these horizons of low budget films, but come! This was the worst piece of monkey I have ever seen. I did not notice the comments published on this site when I fell asleep, I got bored and I turned it off. Let's see: <br /> <br /> Wardrobe: coffee clothes and painter's costumes. from home warehouse Masks that look like tin paper. <br /> <br /> Gore: Gore is pretty good, I have to give it up. But Ittenbach's Burning Moon was better for a low budget movie. <br /> <br /> The act: it was horrible! I do not care about doubling. I find this humorous "Premuts" in Ittenbachen. Wrestling and action sequences were poor pi $$. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Do not see Schnaas movies. Directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach are much better, with the same gore and the same theme. Check out Premuts, Blood House, Schramm and Necromancy.
