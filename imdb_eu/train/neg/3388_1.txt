I accept being a fan of original production. I never saw the movie in the movie version, and I saw it face to face, so my memories saved me, I loved the original show. Imagine my unpleasantness. A movie to be made must be the worst translation of the Broadway show. The story changed, the songs changed, their souls lost. I was waiting for a trip down the road, and I was singing Hello Thirteen, Music and Mirror, and At Ballet and Hello Twelve. No! Adulterate the music to a point that is almost unknown, but the story was added, adding songs and external drawings (hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) were not original, and no injecting "drama" was necessary. The original was enough patosa. If you're a fan of Broadway's original show, do not worry. I'm sorry I was wasting my time and diluting my memories, seeing this gut.
