It might have been a good time, but I just shut it off. It was a great British representation. Were they filmed before the British filmmakers? Do you put at least one foot in England? I do not think the British have any accent except the exciting comedy of the Royal Family. With 2 English boys ... well, I do not think that English boys will play, speak, or play with any British-American history, among the public outpourings of the Prince William and Harry. American filmmakers. There are more than one country in the United Kingdom. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. More than one culture! I can handle some stereotyped, but I could not see it so badly. Fire was good!
