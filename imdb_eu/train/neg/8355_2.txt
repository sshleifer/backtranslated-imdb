Wanda Nevada is a fantastic pubic movie and, in 1979, the 13-year-old girl is an unbelievable love affair. Scripts, pause and direction is horrible. The action sequence defies superstition. The characters talk about a simplified word that is usually found on films aimed at children under the age of 10, but also Shields's character and graphic death, which also includes multiple sexual references. <br /> <br /> The movie wants to be a comedy at a level, but it's never fun, an adventurous image, but plots and actions are bad and a movie for children, but it presents pedophiles and children's rape as a real possibility. It also wants to be an image of friends, age image, ghost movie, spiritual Indian film, travel day and the west. The general impact is stupidity. The loss of Wanda Nevada is a complete loss while you do not want to see many great Grand Canyon shots. Very well managed.
