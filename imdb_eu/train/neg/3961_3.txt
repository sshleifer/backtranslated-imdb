What is a movie dog? The play of Noni Hazelhurst is pretty good, but script is in the midst of a wild woodpecker, with medium management and woodworking. Many of the characters are misunderstood, especially Colin Friels. <br /> <br /> This garbage works very little. The greatest part of "character development" is made through a stupid and sharp voice that often violates the behavior of the characters that appear on the screen. In fact, it is difficult to know who the voices are talking about, because they are described by those who see on the screen. How do we know that Radiant junkie Colin Friels (Javo) is violent and reliable? He tells us one of those stupid voices. Loudly crying, the nature of his character is half the point of the movie and the only thing that knows us goes beyond the voice! They are the real killer characters. All about them. Their clothes are well maintained and they have a new look from the tray, although they are invited to be shepherds who constantly remind us. They speak absurdly well for "Junkies". It seems that no one understands their life on real covers, and yet most of them mean that they happen. This is what Crud does, well shot and technically presented, but it's a topical drama that comes out so credible and in a few hours it's a meander, without going any further. At least Noni goes to his birthday dress every single occasion. There are no other senseless reasons to undergo this litter.
