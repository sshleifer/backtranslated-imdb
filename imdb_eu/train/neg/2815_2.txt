Robert Englund plays a flop on another one, and Tobe Hooper plays a pretty good horror movie, but he's quite wrong. Englund plays the well-known Mars of Sade, XVII. Because in the century there was pain that was damaged and he noticed that he was suffering from pain, he liked others too. One century ago the accident was confused and something happened and what was the purpose of it. Everything I saw was captured by a strange woman who was caught by a strange lesbian, and this young man was captivated by the Arabs, and found that he would die and then from Englund. He recalled that he was trying to kill Sade de Sade for one hundred years of age, and reminded himself of Miss Momoselle (incorrectly written) or on the wall on De Sades. The movie was awful, Hooper is surprised by Englund hiring this movie and the special effects were so fake and dark, especially on the eyes. Englundek "Nightmare on Elm St." He wants to return to his temporary movement. To pull out and pull out these pins to get people out. Terrible, totally terrible.
