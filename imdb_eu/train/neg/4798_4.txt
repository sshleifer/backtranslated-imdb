* It has some spoilers * This film is scared in the 80s. The land is too long to get out of the ground, it never settles for itself, and then it's just about 40 minutes away from the movie. There are some strange moments for zombie enthusiasts, but it's not enough zombies to create a true sense of terror. <br /> <br /> The zombies also take a long time to look. First of all, half of a movie about people and prison groups. The movie heroine is a former Vietnamese agent and captured the mafia. The boss of the main Mafia and will go to jail. In prison, they are trying to find out about prisoners, ways of killing and a way to cure criminal behavior. But the bad psychotic head scientist / military is considering other plans. He wants to use a few different versions of the serum ... it's ... super soldiers! Some unhealthy prisoners have killed some patrons and most prisoners are having an infected communal wine, the military / scientist crazy may "be a problem, may be a problem," and the investigative journalist has turned the ultra-hot, cold journalist into a powerful and independent woman, of course, inventing the original serum who has. Going to jail to find out what is happening, the military man calls some SWAT groups out of a safe position outside of prison, and the hero man takes a few prisoners of gold when he breaks a rebellion. The guy and the scientist / journalist are grouped together to find cure, to save the patron's children and treat them with infected and unpopulated prisoners. Meanwhile, the mafia boss boss has made an agreement to join the jail so he can keep his prisoner brother. The military are ready to get out of space, and all those coming out to find a solution. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of bad scenes when people are forced to go out or get out of the jail bars. There is also a great decapitation scene and a scene of electrocution with the same trapped imprisoned. However, the most disturbing scene is in the first part of the film, when the guard ravaged a prisoner with serious corruption. <br /> <br /> The main feature of this film is the last scene. The heroine, woman and children are trying to make the most of escape. Their way leads to the length of the corridor, on one side there is a wall and on the other, there are prison bars. Hundreds of zombie reaches bloody hands along, while hair and faces gracing. In addition, "zombie pairs" with "zombie pairs" and "zombies many types and roundabouts" are also a good scene. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, if you are researching the area you deserve, refer to so many zombie clicks; It's almost a handbook of instructions for what to do when you make a zombie movie. But if you are in the new zombie movies and want a real fear, you should look elsewhere.
