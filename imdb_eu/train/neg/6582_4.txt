Geez, a Lifetime movie, but is not the worst movie in the world, but it's the best ever. I think the main problem is that it is quite important for those who are responsible, and in general it is quite predictable. Worse yet, some flashbacks have been confusing and the audience is asking "Ok, how much do I care about?" One thing I liked to show the movie is never as easy as "good and bad are bad", and sometimes they are good and bad evil-evil. Hadley did not do what he thought was right, he believed he had the right to become a family member, and to eliminate competition. In regard to Alice, the victim does not always prove that they are good people. Some of them really come true, "" although it was a painful and horrible death. "The Burning Bed" is an excellent example, but the difference is that something bad was done by "The Burning Bed", but Alicia "has come" ? Some will say that, but others do not agree, and the law generally does not. <br /> <br /> In the case of the operation, the bag is mixed, some do a good job, like Mia, but others they have abandoned their roles, especially when they were woods or simply were not convinced, the music was quite cool, and some scenes were enjoyable and lively, especially if you liked playing girls / girls, the movie does not shoot badly, but because of weak weaknesses, unfortunately, the forces are in the background. <br /> <br /> I've heard rumors of a sequence, but these years will definitely happen to me. But I would not be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared. Alicia EELIA just as beldurg If that's the case, as people say, then I do not think he'll think, "YAY! I woke up in the comma! Oh, Hadley was in charge? Oh! That's fine! I totally forgive you and you want to drop your charges! "However, Hadley would be in jail for a long time, even though he has not committed murder all the time. <br /> <br /> However, he deserves to see it at least once!
