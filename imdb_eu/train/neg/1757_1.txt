Do not get bad, Dan Jansen was a great skateboarder. There is a boy who deserves a gold medal in the Olympic Games. <br /> <br /> But how could it be possible Bill Corcoran has made a bad film about the incredible story of Dan Jansen, because it's true. Dan Jansen's story is really incredible! Especially if this movie looks at a sportsman's eyes, everything is wrong, Matt Keeslar and the other actors skate, the technique, the speed oval dimension works! <br /> <br /> Sorry, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jans is better off, much better! <br /> <br /> 10 of 1
