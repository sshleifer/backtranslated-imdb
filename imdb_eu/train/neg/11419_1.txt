I think I've seen such things before: college graduates do not quite realize it, at the same time complaining about sucking their lives. <br /> <br /> This movie is part of The Big Chill. and, according to what I have justified the reality, they have almost the same plot. <br /> <br /> If the beautiful thing comes out of the twisted party, it was music. That was it. <br /> <br /> I do not know for myself ... but I did not expect anything less. This film was directed by the same person from Batman and Robin; Another movie that needs to be linked to coverage. <br /> <br /> Now to get the verdict: from 10 to 10.
