If you read the review of the "Dinoshark" of SyFy, I appreciate the small budget given by TV movies. They are stupid ... they are stupid ... but they still have fun "so bad, good". So, I definitely like the "Dinoshark" I like (and I recommend) I still feel guilty, I saw "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy", the original SyFy movie about a half-man and a middle-class star. . SyFy Channel features a recipe for creating B-movie creatures and William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could it be wrong? Well, to my surprise, the brand is really missing ... not much, but it's not enough to let it be recommended. Why? Well, first of all, his title monster, a terrifying human hybrid, takes backseat to a bunch of military wickedness that becomes the first evil character of the movie. Even if he hampered the body of the hammerhead he racked (or that or that you call it any thing) that only reached someone who will be munched and straight after. The rest of the film is complete, they were heroes against the previous soldiers. That's it, for me, it's not so compelling to go on foot to eat hammerhead people! <br /> <br /> Please read the full review of my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
