One of the worst movie ever I've ever seen! Reperation, dialogue, manuscript, sound, lighting, line. Actually, I can not say so much, even if you enjoy Swedish films. Fighting scenes are so hilarious they do not need to be taken seriously. And when the character is in a loose shirt, while dodging the bullet bar, I do not know if it's a joke or when someone really thinks they're the ingredients of a good movie !? Regina Lund is a half-actress, but faint hopes and unbelievable reactions disappear. He frightens you that someone has spent time and money on something like that ...
