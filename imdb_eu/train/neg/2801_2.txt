After almost gothic music video and after a fruit, the film begins with the singer who kills himself Cassidy. In the perfect world, that would be and the final credits would appear. We are not living in that world. The member of the group is deciding to go to the great clown game to get in touch with the essence of the deceased. When I say clown, I mean real clowns. He tells them to die by the ghost of Cassidy (the spirit is Dora, one of the team members), we would not care less that the characters play boring, shameful and incredibly dramatic. Written by Adam Hackbarth (once you name it last name), and directed by Corbin Timbrook (after The attendant and the Tower of Blood, knowing that HART is alive), this film is a constant struggle. the incompetence of the film and the need for the audience to be awake. It is not enough to appease blood gore dogs, or enough naked to satisfy pervas. This movie does not need any recommendations. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Amanda Carraway topless <br /> <br /> Where I look: Starz on Demand
