The shows of Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante's Broadway were many years ago, but his power and charisma evidence have been lost in the adaptation of this film, and most likely the director's choice (Richard Attenborough, as B-way out) and the lead actor (Michael Douglas , director and choreographer, as a thin corporation lawyer). An overwhelming audition on a Broadway show that acts as a therapist for dancers and singers encourages us, coupled with high-quality talents. There is nothing modulated or subtle, especially a dancer about a dancer who is returning to the theater. Hopeful hopes are full of promise and heart, but personal stories of disturbances are shameful; This, with a slow stop at Attenborough, which creates disaster, and nowadays known songs fail through artificial wrap. * 1/2 ****
