Well, if you like modern billy pop / punk, punk, ska and psycho, it's the only thing worth seeing to watch live shows. This movie features a tone and tons group camera, along with Troma President Lloyd Kaufman as a midfielder role and scenes of death. The sounds may be good, right? Well, deaths have been ongoing, and repeatedly by various groups and fans of Warp Tour at the event. Some deaths are exquisite, but they are then recycled repeatedly to be completely repetitive. Almost everyone is killed by the fact that they have a broken head or bowel to the intestinal stomach. Gore looks like the "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence" by Andreas Schnaas; That is, the "blood emptying", but the movie is really decent, and it gives humor some of the missing film. Surely, it's made by Doug Sakmann of Troma, which has a low budget potential and tries ... but too hard. Everything is fun to make this movie fun, and that's what it brings. Everything tries to be comical and stupid, using a compulsory bad performance, with the abuse of supposed deaths and the same ... repeatedly. It's basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker", "Board of the President," or any movie made with your friends. It's fun for whoever made it, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Great potential, great idea, great use of effects - but the same thing ... repeatedly: a band plays, the team dies, fans die. Everyone dies, blood is sprayed everywhere, the process is repeated. <br /> <br /> The question is that this type of film is essentially a "bad slap-stick", whether they try hard or not. ?
