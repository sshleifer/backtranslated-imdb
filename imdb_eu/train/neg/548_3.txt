I saw the 7.5 IMDb rating of this movie and decided to watch the movie that my roommate room rented. He said he had seen before. "It's fun and sad! I cried for the first time," he said. Maybe compared to other Bollywood movies, which is worth 7.5, but compared to all other films I have seen during my life, it should not be worth it before 3. Not good for me. The character is incredible, as is not a realistic act and its reasons are invented. Dramatic and songs are not very exquisite. The Bollywood movie's biggest problem is lack of rigor. All emotions have an excessive reason and therefore they are not realistic. It should be magnified with any song or song that is supposed to increase with any subtle character. I think that the relationship between father and son was like that of one of the parents and children without having to convey it through a five-minute song. The foolish relief of the ridiculous challenge track was not funny or necessary (we got it, Laxman is not the main saver tool). The movie tries to get through tears as irrelevant as possible, it's just not insignificant, a bit shy. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Generally, if someone has a terminal lung cancer, the son who lives with them would be wrong without knowing it. It has excessive number holes too. Initially, the movie was fun and fun for people who did not see Bollywood movies in a malicious way, but it was boring. It's very fun to make a fun and engaging movie and the best way to do it is not to have all the fun movies in the first part of the movie and at the end of the heart converter. <br /> ***************************************** ********************************************* ********************************************* ********************************************* ****************************************** Deeper than other Bollywood movies I've seen Being, but not much. For more time, I was laughing at the stupidity of the movie so much as I thought it was fun. I did not even spoil a single tear, nor felt a taste, I felt sorry for the dramatic ending attempt. I do not recommend the movie if you want to see something good, I recommend you watch a sad movie in Bollywood.
