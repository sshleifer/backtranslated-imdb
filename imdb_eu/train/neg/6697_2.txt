The gun shotgun that is looking for truck drivers and obsessive control control imbalances has "ravaged me since the age of 12," because the right shields are all prostitutes, there is little character that will present the whole shame of a movie. On Sunday nights at 4:00 pm, it can be easily seen at any cable television station (IE: Skinemax). (Yes, I know that it was a complete sentence, but with people with me, this is a short summary without a short film.) <br /> <br /> "somewhere" Canada has filmed, almost no budget, the plot of this strange show is irrelevant It's not because the police do not even hear the "state jurisdiction" because they have never heard Miya (Hookers) and Trent (idiota, Anal Retentive, Generic, Insecure College Student) in the US (and I thought I could do just that FBI). The camera is shaken, the sex scene is roughly similar and the performance may be so bad that it can cause unwanted acid repetitions in movies such as "Ishtar" and "Leonard Part 6". <br /> <br /> Go on the skin scenes (that is, it's the only reason you can rent this movie, you have not bought it), there are two of them. The first is the spotlight that is considered the only Dominarrix Sex scene by Kari Salin and ____ (enter an unknown actor here, who knows anything else, of course) in a moody, disgusting motel room. dripping, and soda machine, this water has only blue tonic away). All S & M (white harvest, licking hands, wax and licking underwear) people will eventually enter the motel room without money and the police will be waiting at their door (that is, showing you, do not let a boat bind yourself to the motel in a room "in the middle"). Unfortunately, Kari does not remember the skin that she deserves, and this alone can cause traumatic deep experiences of the lords, so this film is pure. <br /> <br /> As for the end, * Snicker * Snicker * I'm sure I did not care if you did not care, but I do not want to spend money for that. In general, I will give 1/5 action, Skin for 3/5 (see last paragraph) and 0/0, character development or twisted plot twists. <br /> <br /> - Laughing man
