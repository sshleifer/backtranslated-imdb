SciFi is just a bit of a bad luck, which has been making good quality films in recent times (for example, the Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel believes that, based on the great epic Beowulf, however, it deters so much (and so little does it) television ads as "Christopher Lambert's short film". I expected that it was not as exact as Hollywood production, but I still hoped that it would not interfere with the "artistic totality" story (even if it changed a bit the two-hour graphic script will work well). in the given periods). <br /> <br /> Did the director and producer have the idea of ​​what they did (what did the research do?). Of course, no, Beowulf and his teammates (except for the unbelievable boy) as the horny helmets show. I had a major problem, however, although Grendel looks like Beowulf is supposed to fight him, he should not have sixteen feet tall and a weight of 2 tons. Was the death segment in Grendelen all the way? I think it was epic, it was better than the composer's junk of the script; For example: Grendel needs Beowulf to rip the arm from the hole? It has not been cut off by wrists after a firearm that breaks up with a weight of 300 kg. And Grendel's mother, did they end up with the dragon at the end of the epic when he died when he died? And honestly, what the hell was with the mulete? <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie, is it not because it's an epic connection, because it is not really there (rather than character names). The only way to recommend this movie would you like the Druids movie (directed by Jacques Dorfmann)? although I do not recommend watching.
