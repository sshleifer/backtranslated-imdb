Gadar is a giant movie that tells a fake story. It's unexpected and it's a regular movie star in Pakistan. We can think of Pakistan and the government as bad as the movie. trying to hide their mistakes will not work. And all the music and songs of the movies are bad. She probably loves Sikh movies. I think Amisha Patel was just a good movie. If you give it 10 to 10, but it will be the smallest 1. Save your 3 hours in your life and do not watch the stupid stupid movie .Disaster.
