I acknowledge the problem with the famous Ealing films I have seen so far. In my opinion, they are black and demolish, they are fun, or not as sane as comedies or stories. This is a great way to say "I liked The Man in The White Suit", but I found it hard to work in a short time. <br /> <br /> Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) may be a textile worker, but commits herself to trying to guess the fabric patch that has not been broken or dirty. A factory laboratory, using its latest experiment, plunged against material and human boundaries. The latter does not understand the bosses who do not understand what they are, and then they get the commitment to figure it out and stop it. <br /> "Your minds like yours are small in the path of progress," complains Sidney, who reflects what the man says in the mirror. <br /> <br /> A problem with "Man in the White Suit" is the view of Sidney's progress, even more than the bosses or their employees. My problem is crucial: "White Suit" is not fun for a comedy. A serious script, often, tries to try attempts to get strong attempts by humor, including kukuxumena, half doubles, triplets and dizziness. <br /> <br /> The best joke is the sound of the machine. Sidney plays "Bleep-Blop-Bleep-Bop" and is continuously taking extra curious looks from all visitors, trying to sidestimate Sidney until he or she strikes her miracle. As every little mood that loses the way in this film, it's too long. It's a long fit. <br /> <br /> I've never even thought that Guinness has not had a hit in a movie, though he's very young and passionate. Really in the 30s). It seems unprofessional, even more so with "Doctor Zhivago" than waxing on the general face. It's the same cold fish, but it does not ignore the sad affect of the mill that it would offer when saving his life. (Life Hope, as fast as Bertha), or the dearest charm of Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), as he says, in the fight against his "alarming and dirt" real ally, as these words sound like a very sexy sound. Only Greenwood may have. <br /> <br /> The assistants "White Suit" work well. Ernest Thesinger's famous "Frankenstein" reputation is a very bad industrial captain, who looks like Nosferatu and laughs like death. As head of the Howard Marion-Crawford factory, it is memorable to play in the official rumor doctor's "Lawrence Of Arabia". Then, the little girl who steals Mandy Miller from her little shirts is not an unknown charm. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> But most of the scenes live right, as Alexander did not think. Mackendrick made a comedy before ever (his previous Ealing comedy "Whiskey Galore" is not reversing his impression, ay! Roger MacDougall's performance breaks scientific progress into ruin, but fails to present Sydney with a blandly, no-glaring light <br /> <br /> Ealing cometh to catch the human being of the comedian comedy, however, the dirty things I have seen never do that any more, when we are merely compassionate when we are only working with our origin. "Kind Hearts And Coronets" and "The Ladykillers "(Mackendrick again, go figure) are classic ways." White Suit ", on the other hand, is not at all dismayed, as it should be together, like that unfortunate costume.
