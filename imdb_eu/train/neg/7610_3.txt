In general, I do not like films directed by Sydney Pollack ("The Firm" is being excluded) and I have never been a fan of Robert Redford. However, I thought that "Condor of the Three" should be well received due to the number of comments he received. <br /> <br /> Although it's very enjoyable in the panoramic photo, Max von Sydow was pleased to work as a sneaky professional murderer, I found a whole affair. The film definitely emits a paranoid atmosphere, but it has been damaged by a plot that has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The film also has one of the most endless films ever left, it has one of the most endless albums I've ever seen. a spectator hanging in the air. And what can we say about the absurd romance with Redford and Dunaway? I see Hitchcock's films five times in a row, again using this waste.
