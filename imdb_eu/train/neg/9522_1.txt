Wow! I remind you of the awful films that were disturbed during the early 1980s. Usually they were 27-year-old actresses and they were terribly transient. When I saw this movie, I felt a bit nostalgia in the 80's. But, do I know that this film was made in 1989? Say what! Well, this nostalgia factor is over, this is a bad thing. Plots prepares the city to close secondary education and endanger all students in secondary school. It is curious that the students of this school are rich and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in the house. Do you ask how they can not afford to keep this school alive, they never hear of property taxes. Oh, but here's the shooter. The School Commission says the school will remain alive so that students receive $ 200,000. So elderly people do this. Hmmm, you get $ 200,000, but instead of saving college, are you a senior in saving in secondary education? And why would it close an overflowing school before the end of the year? And ... if you forget, this stupid movie was made in 1989!
