How old are Japanese horror / Asian horror films coming out with hairless ghostly women? In fact, a million times "Ringu" has been ripped off and has often worked well; Therefore, the originality is not a great requirement of the horror genre (or I am very critical and please, please?). However, this time I was a bit disturbed, I was bored. It's not a bad movie, but it should be at least half an hour long with a 110-minute absurdity. Compared to the other Japanese horror films, the OMC lacks an atmosphere and enthusiasm. Moreover, the end is confusing: it has no sense. As for the ring, Miik could have a tune that is more effective than an unforgettable little thing. Although I played it twelve times, I can not remember it, so it was terrifying. Because of talking about Miikeri, this is something of commercialization. So if they think they are getting "Perceived" or "Audition" type perversion, they are wasting time.
