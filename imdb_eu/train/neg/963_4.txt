'Options are' to see a big mistake. The director Emile Ardolino may have knowledge of 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act', and he should expect something fun. But I think I should be disappointed. He made the movie really bad. <br /> <br /> Christopher McDonald says he is dying to revive as a baby. The baby grows up in Robert Downey Jr, and Jr returns to his old home, who knows his old daughter Mary Stuart Masterson (is it difficult?). <br /> <br /> They love each other together. Later, Jr., his former wife, Cybill Shepherd, and Jr. also appear to fall in love. I do not even mention that she loves Ryan O'Neil. <br /> <br /> In one of his first roles, Robert Downey Jr is his worst. It is copied by Michael J Fox. <br /> <br /> 'Moonlighting' after the Shepherd did not prove it is not appropriate for acting on movies. <br /> <br /> However, something comedy can not be used: insomnia as an antidote.
