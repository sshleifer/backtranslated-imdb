Thunderbirds (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Jonathan Frakes <br /> <br /> Actor: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /> <br /> 5? 4 ?? 3? 2 ?? 1! Thunderbirds GO! <br /> <br /> So Thunderbirds, my favorite childhood began. When I heard a Thunderbirds movie, I was extatic. I can not wait for Thunderbird 2 to save people, while Thunderbird 4 is immersed in the depth of that idea. I could not wait. Then came the album of August 2004 when it was finally published. Critics were prevented, but I still wanted to go. Eventually, as if the heart was in the same place, all this was important to me. So I sat in the theater, the only teenager of a 50-person crowd had more than thirty-five years of age. Perhaps the most difficult theater experience I ever had? <br /> <br /> The movie (to be a pretext) Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet) relies on Tracy's family. For a few days he wants to restore the rest of the family, but he is very young. One day he eventually got his chance to catch the rest of his family's The Hood (Ben Kingsley) with Thunderbird 5 (spatial station). This will overtake the hoods of The Hood and rescue them in their time before The Hood could steal all the money from the Bank of England. when you read paper. Once we get into the movie, we have a mess in our hands. For the first time the film was aimed at children, it was like the original show. However, Gerry Anderson treated us as an adult and gave us plots that were quite advanced for children's programming. On the other hand, the plot goes down while trying to rip Spy Kids franchise. The final product is a movie that tries to attract Thunderbirds and children's enthusiasts, because they are completely missing. This movie is jokes, cartoons and anchovies. No one finds this movie fun, and I'm sure Jonathan Frakes never wanted to direct it. <br /> <br /> Over all, everyone gave a solid performance, considering all the script. Ben Kingsleyk Hood was just as good as he was playing very well. Complaints about the characters are only the hood of The Hood, since Looney Tunes reduces the remains of ancient cartoons, when they're comfortable with the kids, it's quite astonishing. <br /> <br /> What's curious about that movie while I was watching the movie, I had fun. After reading the lights, I realized that the movie was pretty bad, I had 8 lighter prices and I spent two hours. Pleasure guilty Maybe However, Thunderbirds is unforgettable. "I'm going to" go for a big one, I would recommend staying away from this movie. If the rest of the movie was ten minutes earlier, it would be a great movie worthy of Thunderbirds. However, we get the film that would only be the only Deadliest fans of Thunderbirds (if you want to see your childhood in the trash) or be very bored. <br /> <br /> Thunderbirds is my rating 1/2 stars.
