The "blackout" crime drama in the early 1970s was directed at the black market. Pam Grier has a role as head, a nurse who becomes a couple of women after drug abuse turns Coffy's little sister into a drunkard. The absurd nonsense makes dull, with energy conservation and excitement; The horrifying nature of Grier only gives a story to the narration (there is not a big actor here, but it is the main link with audiences). At this time, Charles Bronson was not much different from what he was doing to commercialize and announce the movie as a gross exploitation and he still found a huge internal audience. But nowadays, in the 70's there is nothing more than a footnote in the history of the film, and there is a lack of resources in this genre's range. * 1/2 ****
