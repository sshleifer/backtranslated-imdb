I'm not a great fan of Stooges' slapstick, but I find his story interesting. Stooge has recently tried to see things in each era, but Joe's shorts are not easy to see; It's the only one I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Many people say Joe's quality problems are not Joe's fault, and I suspect that. Joe is the worst thing about him as far as interpreter. When I was more concerned, I stressed in another comment: third-party whistles violate the whole comedy band / Stooges etos. Perhaps Joe's style was perceived by the makers, he was not really adapted - even if the camera was not in conflict - and that was how they worked. <br /> <br /> And what is his title and some short Stooges shorts? Certainly there is a lack of creativity there; Did the effect of the cause or film market dry out?
