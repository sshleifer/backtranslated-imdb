I'm interested in Dorothy Stratten to buy this video. Although excellent actors and actors, there were too many subtleties to save interest. Moreover, it was not interesting. The conversation was rigid and confusing and the story was too much to be credible. I was really disappointed that I was one of the last films of Audrey Hepburn. John Ritter would always like the best slapstick. It was wonderful here.
