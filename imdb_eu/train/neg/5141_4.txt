Charlie Chaplin's 1914 was an amazing year. It was the first year that the films were made and it appeared in more than 30 films! Most of these films were not particularly good, but the screen's character allowed him to slowly evolve. However, through this film, the popular character "Little Tramp" was still under development. He surely looked at Charlie's part, but his character still developed, then he was not sweet and decent. Instead, Chaplin has done many things wrong, frustrated or done for the public, because she does not seem to have reason. <br /> <br /> With regard to this very light film, it's interesting to watch it. Although not known today, Chaplin plays with stars like Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain, all of the star stars of Keystone Films. The problem of this movie is that, although some beautiful scenes, the plot seems to be very blurred and poorly developed. The Chester and Mabel race track (a very common theme in Keystone production) had to be located next to a race track. Charlie and Mack will appear and enter. Mack's police escaped while Charlie chases Chester and steals his girlfriend. Eventually, without any apparent reason, the policeman leads Chester and Mack, leaving Charlie with Mabel (not surprisingly for Charlie's numerous behaviors). <br /> <br /> Unless you are. a great silent comedy or film historian, a very forgotten film that is important for Chaplin's evolution. What he and his other actors do on stage, but it's not an unusual movie, it's not really fun today.
