Do not give any impression to other reviewers. This movie is a bit worse than the Japanese whale industry (which is morally not the US meat trade or haggis Scottish cave). The origin of which transforms modern art into a bad name. That said, there are stunning images, but there are still stunning images on the average bus trip, if you use imagination, there's no reason to see this nonsense. What happens in the movie is very slow and often, along with a soundtrack that covers a cat, and then when you think about it, it starts again. They were hired for a weekend in a porn movie in Rome to showcase Barney's film work, which is a wonderful and promising way to proclaim the claims of a former men-man-in-law. The brigade, but if the young fashionable men and the oldest Bjork fans were to be honest, they would all be much more entertaining if they were to be more entertaining!
