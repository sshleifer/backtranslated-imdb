The old saga of the "poorly molded army", that is, it tries to make a heart attack (foreign subtitles) to convert ETA vulgarity (flatulence gags), but it mixes humor and nothing. Many of them continued successfully. Barbara Bach, Bond Girl, "The Spy Who Loved Me", has two or three short scenes. What waste! (* 1/2)
