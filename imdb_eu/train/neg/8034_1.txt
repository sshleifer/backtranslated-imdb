I know the lines are always bad, but you're going, what's the hell? It's like a 10-year-old boy who saves money from his food and started shooting this weekend. <br /> <br /> However, all six youngsters will go home to die on the screen. We fear, slut, other slut, black, killer, such stereotypes. Shaking the ship, a guy who carries a mask on his back escapes the people who are excluded from kutxa's poverty. There is not quite a decent murder in the middle somewhere, but then it's more boring and, above all, it has returned to false frauds. We really know that the murderer can not be attacked by a person, because he is surely loved by everyone's time. <br /> <br /> After all the characters that start to die after all the characters you die, the bad blonde is the standard. and soon his boyfriend will eventually be trapped by the murderer (they are similar, throw down and then the shelves) and the murderer reveals that I think that the writers of this film have taken a black lid and a pen and somewhere in the list of characters. The motive is just a fall and I do not start secrets. To explain too much time (and then, for about ten minutes more, it cuts his arm for some reason) and eventually he gets an evil gun. Well, there's no reason! <br /> <br /> One of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. I could enjoy watching Lindsay Lohan, a movie. I am sure that most of the 80 slasher were absorbed, but at least they were thrown at T & A. it does not do anything
