It seems that it was not for this adaptation. He left the soil behind and made up his mind. The things he wanted to leave were so surprisingly unbelievable that he was happy to leave some of the most important parts of the novel. The soil was dimmer, inconsistent and noisy to say the least. I do not mean anything about the actors, but they can not act! Dickens is difficult, of course, but this is pathetic! Micawber XIX. It was only Kramer in the middle of the century, and he said less about Betsy Trotwood! If you want to see the real Copperfield, see the wonderful BBC 1999 adaptation. As a scriptwriter, I think he read Cliff's Notes!
