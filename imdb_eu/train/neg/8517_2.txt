The biggest mystery of Veronica Mars is not one on the screen. <br /> <br /> The mystery is why this permanent classification that has survived is still in the air. This week for Veronica Mars is not roughly: 146 shows have been ranked 146 by big 6 (soon it will be 5). Yes, you have read it right. Veronica Mars has played with all the shows of the disappeared WB and all the UPN shows. In all Fox shows and of course all ABC, CBS and NBC shows won. <br /> <br /> Now hip hopers will tell you: but this was corrected again. However, everything on TV this week was run again! He remembers that CW would select this despair of proven proof that it is one of the few shows by UPN. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's clear that there is something behind. Please, the flavors are so cynical, but what are the explanations? The "Veronica Mars potential" line is evident, since it has been established for two years now and has failed. <br /> <br /> Maybe Joel Silver is influencing and influencing, but, in fact, I'm losing myself. why would someone choose someone who does not see a bad show? <br /> <br /> The great mystery and the CW premiere is very inadequate.
