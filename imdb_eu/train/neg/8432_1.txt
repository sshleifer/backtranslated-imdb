Leave the director of Ventura Pons, the Spanish director, to help protect this mistaken movie attempt to convince her country's highest level. The dreaded state of the film industry in that country is making a film from that thin material. Most of the photographs in Spain are included in two categories: Civil War in Spain, which writers love to present their past history. Another type of film shows the audience a lot of free sex, because "creators" do not have any interest. <br /> <br /> While the movie opens, we go to see Peter's penis, cut into a party and try to get into a dish. Later, Sandra will show everything she admires to the audience. Pere, an attractive lady, a married woman married to a married woman, is initially false. <br /> <br /> Mr. Mr. Pons, "Amic / Amat", but, of course, has nothing to do with the punishment we're seeing at this risk. With regard to the reviews presented on the IMDb, all negative votes come from Spanish audiences, that is, books that come from them!
