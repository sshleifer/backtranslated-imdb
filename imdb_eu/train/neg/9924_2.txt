"Dutch Schultz", AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person and his life quite roughly documented. This film, which is intended to represent his life, should be used as a fictional character, the dramatic events are the great deviations between events and chronology. Not only this, it excludes other interesting features that include other versions, such as the N. Y. fiasco state of public relations and its religious conversion. It's true that Luciano, Lansky, et. al. but that's the size. Lucian Bo Weinberg was performing at home, with the help of his mother, the meaning of the explosive plaque depicted by Luciano is very dirty. There is also a scene to be introduced by the Dutch to his mother to protect Legs Diamond. It just works. Mrs. Fleggenheimer does not work. This movie does not require strict Jewish mothers for comic relief. Legs Diamond was a fairly representative representation. I'm sure the man is in the grave. And, in a way, the Dutch really killed people, but it was not absurd that Rambo or 007. The decision is eliminated. I do not know. Maybe it was a comedy and I did not get it.
