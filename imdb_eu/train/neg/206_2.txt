I gave this movie a star 2, because Dominic Monaghan really strove for himself. Everything about this movie is very amateur. Everything under the direction of this movie was very badly executed. The director should think for a career, but maybe he should watch some movies. As Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, it's a great addition to a film in that movie. Anyone who plays "Actor" Jack's best friend has never been faced with the camera. I do not expect much from that movie, but maybe more time and effort would be put on the characters and the environment. Do not waste time or money in this movie (as I am) you will be very disappointed.
