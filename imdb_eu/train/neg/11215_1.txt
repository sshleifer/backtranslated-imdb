It was a good start to the beginning that this movie seems pretty good, although it was pretty fast moving, and it was only $ 60,000, but it was good for you to kill your sister's lakes and find her dead. around him and throwing a gun on him with a single bullet, and he lacks it and ends up throwing it back and falling back and slamming? Also, find yourself dead and found somewhere in the hospital and found out about the murderer who was the killer, why would not you hear that you would hear the police? And when he finished the movie, he talked to his poor servant as soon as he was there and when he was talking to the bad man he had to find, he told him what had happened to him as he was dead and "proof". I do not know that I was not happy at the end. This movie can be much better for a longer period of time and the performance was better and the end is not so bad! Do not lose money in this movie, however, here you will also write a review and it will not be happy.
