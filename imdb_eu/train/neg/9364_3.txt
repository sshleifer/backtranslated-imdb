I can not believe that this movie is due to the year 2007 and, above all, the horror of the lower average of the seventies. Do not have any special effects or modern CGI knowledge?!? Did not they have at least a graphic graphic of at least one millennium of horror and / or filmmaking? Or did the wrong goal I wanted to achieve, whether it was a deep and meaningful story of man and animal, linked in the great cycle of life, or to warn man or nature for something or something like that? Actually, it does not matter, as in the wrong way, and for me the movies failed in all accounts. <br /> <br /> First of all: the premise is very popular. If you are able to replace the total eye for a certain time, it will not be a responsible medical scientist whose first human attempt would begin simultaneously with both eyes, which is not quite professional. And all of this apparently without the patient's informed consent?! And why choose the eyes and victims of a totally unusual color for humans to make a strange look! Unfortunately, I noticed that all the real wolves in the movie were dark and normal eyes, could they wait for such a specimen? The story is not gentle, that is, Aaron, a man of horror, who gets these strange eye transplants, and suddenly feels like an owl (or at least that's what I do) and then the military are following him. . Especially this is a wonderful one. I mean, I understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment (imaginable with spectacular visionary night vision!) But if the operation fails due to the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient, it is beyond me why they kill him. Why not leave alone and find another useful recipient? (maybe a volunteer soldier?). And why did you try to kill Aaron with all the other people involved in poverty, is not it a bit rugged? Those who are military hell are anyway, I hope the United States military or government acts as a psychopath, automatically shaking weapons in the hospital, in private pedestrian apartments, the # 1 enemy public # 1, and in the final stage. In the woods show a lack of discipline, like a bundle of school students, scared and panicked around. <br /> <br /> Aaron, for some terrible medical reasons, feels like a wolf. Why would that be ??? Suddenly the wolves are wandering. What is this? Do we believe that the wolf's memories are based on our eyes? Therefore, the recipient of these balloons also includes the desire of the red (life) flesh of the wolf and can jump from a 30-foot-high balcony and damage the earthquake as a cat. ?!). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (unfortunate) and some imbalance inequalities about nature's strength, and it's a matter of course that all of Aaron is (but he must have at least one love scene). !). I really liked the actress Cory Monteith, who had a nice face, but they did not give much. More than half of the film has to run over the chest, while it could be spectacular, but then it was better to choose a more natural person, Monteithe should leave the shirt. His (a few) murders and attacks are hardly ever shown, we hear horror fears and then another victim is lying down and Aaron has more blood on his face and chest. It's not for science-fiction modern horror! Justine Bateman was the only performance, and I like how she has seen fashionable fifty beautiful and stylish ladies. She was likely to get her stupid lines and convinced me that I was dressed in a well-intentioned physician, but her character was a toss, which fully protects the bosses of these men. What the script did not appear a bit more! <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a short and boring film, almost scary or exciting, summed up by National Geographic's wolves, woods and slopes. (who cares?!), some pretentious departure from India and human beings, and a different musical score with Poppy songs at the right time. I think that the word "superfluous" covers everything.
