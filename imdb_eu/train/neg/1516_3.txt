THE FLOCK, although he plays well with the veteran Richard Gere, and some good photographs that some of THE SENTENCE OF THE LAMBS can retrace, extends credibility to the plot and does not destroy any plot that leads anywhere. br /> <br /> The film is about Erroll Babbage (Gere), which works in the security department and is preparing to retire. His office encourages his representative Allison Lowry (Claire Danes, STARDUST) and Babbage is obsessed with his work. And this work is not very funny. Contains conditional unconditional parole of its jurisdiction. Together with Allison, he goes to Erroll to learn about his "flock" for his delinquents and learns the need to retire. But Erroll works well, even if the methods are not. He performs prey for sex and has physical conflicts with them. The ruler justifies his actions that bring evil of his time. "Good justification" is to challenge the audience in a way that shows how Erroll's brutality is and yet how it touches (how close he is to his work). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br But how did he know? Is this erroll good at work? Allison challenges him and Erroll throws him back. As a battle they have become as hard as the need to find this missing girl in Errol. <br /> <br /> Although the story is being prepared, he agreed, but he did not have any umpf! I will give credit to Richard Gere, however, that plays Rroll's character very well. Retire the fight. His flock is all concerned about everyone. Bored with the people in charge of watching over. He has had to do some things that he has bored with himself. The character has changed for Gere. But there are not many others above it. Some sets are fine (dark and dangerous), but there are many other issues that can be expected. <br /> <br /> First of all, believing is a condition for me when I watch movies. This suspension has limits. The greatest impulse against these frontiers is the destruction of the scene of crime. Someone who is ruthless should know that there is no body moving. Or stealing a crime scene. Or mobile proofs. He has gone beyond the film and does not end the film. <br /> <br /> The most damaging part of this film is Clair Danes's Allison character. At the end of the film, it will almost fall into the paths and we will never understand its intensity: will it stop or will it stop? Should he continue to roll out as if he were? This is not a horrible film, because it touches some uncomfortable moral illnesses, but in general, the story has to be consolidated.
