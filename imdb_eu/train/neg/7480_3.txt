We all know what's wrong with the bad day at the office, right? Well, Neil Simon's comedy is similar to what you're trying to get into the office every day. Sometimes it's worth it to know anything, what do I mean? And sometimes it's not worth doing before, in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis ... and much better. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as Steve Martin's comic book or mistaken advertising as a harried and emphasized role; Quite the opposite, in both accounts. And, Goldie is not even here as being inept; His work has always been good, if not great, for the first time I saw it on television Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In in the 1960's. <br /> <br /> The problem with that movie is not that it is a bad couple. Everyone: really about New York and why should everyone come to New York to live and love their lives away in weddings? what? in the largest city in the world. So, if you're from New York ... <br /> <br /> Look, the 1970's movie is still a great comedy, we're really realistically exploring all the things that go wrong somewhere, including most of them. You can see what you can imagine in a strange environment, the situation and sight you can see. This version of 1999 goes unfortunately to free tangents, specifically for the excessive increase or for the public. For example, Rudy Giuliani, the mayor of New York, does not seem to have a star rating for the major players, as it seems to be a long (even long) comedy. What ?? Is Giuliani the president then rude? Worse? A bargain on a more pleasant face in New York. <br /> <br /> And then, is John Cleese, repeating the role of Basil Fawlty? But this time, also a cross-dresser? making the staff of the hotel quicker, sucking up the rich clients, and, in general, looks like a stupid looker. And, in the process, it damaged the memory of Fawlty Towers, but perhaps it was the best British comedy series ... <br /> <br /> Why did this 1999 film take place? In the 1970s, New York was dying, in many ways. Almost literally he failed. So, when it was created in 1970, you saw the city: dark, dark, evil mood, disturbing and not courageous couples were finally chosen together with their new life in Great Smoke (then infected and all). . In 1999, things were better: Glitz returned, New York was rich, it was Big Apple, it was ready to be moxy ... <br /> <br /> So , of course, the second pair is found inside the moxy, and in the end it is wonderful to continue dreaming of the American dream of searching for life, freedom and happiness. That's why the movie is really comical, but not for the producer's reasons. As much as Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn like, I would like to make this movie much better for Jack Lemmon. If you have seen the latter, definitely do not worry about it.
