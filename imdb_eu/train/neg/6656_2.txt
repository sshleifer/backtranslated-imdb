This one gets two of my children's likes, but it was very hateful when I started hating ... I can not give a review to describe this after confirming something else, I would probably not have everyone said nothing at all. <br /> <br /> The other thing in this show is quite rough, because it's a twinkling child with a boiling child. and about it. I have a cousin who loves this show and I am the strangest and most ordinary person I met. This show must be released from the air. It's always the same ... They need better Nick shows. I'm really tired of these things.
