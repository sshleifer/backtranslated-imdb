This film was very well-known. I'm a filmmaker and I have seen the previews of this movie in these months. While I was skeptical about this pretty amusing movie, my friends thought it was great and it was shocked to me. Then I saw it and I was almost seated at the seat I paid for the movie I remembered. I laughed before most of the movie things and I did not feel the bad feeling and I changed the good mood that I changed, I added that my money deserved the movie! I always open with open cinema, I try to avoid too much hope, but this movie is not fun. Now I have never seen the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely worth the wait for HBO. If you have not seen a lot of movie previews or you can enjoy very slow and enjoyable comedies, but they say it's a step for true comedian fans. Maybe look comedy king again. To say something, watch Discover Parents instead!
