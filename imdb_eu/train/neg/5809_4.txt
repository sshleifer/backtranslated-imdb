I do not know why filmmakers renewed the movie. <br /> <br /> McQueen and McGraw are an almost classic movie made in 1972. Steve McQueen was a great actor and Baldwin was just a bad actor. There's no passion in play. The original "getaway" was also a fantastic action. But this remake has no action! It's pretty boring that 1972's film was harder than in 1994. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how Baldwin took prisoner from Mexico. I think this is a mistake in the story. <br /> <br /> So I think there's no need to renew it, or when they decided to recreate a classic, they must choose a great actor as their first role. Like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
