An actor is something that wants to miss the first movie; Often, all those involved participate in the absence of cinema experience for the first time, and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> But worse than that. That is why even though the standards were so bad in 1982, it's hysterically funny. Shot in the Chicago area, despite being a small budget, he plays the entire cast with rigid, wood and cartoons. It is a crossing between high school theater and community theater. The noise of traffic in the vicinity often goes down and the conversation is really bad, very significant, compulsory and appropriate, not natural and organic. The scenes are noticeable and rigid, and although the characters walk over the years, neither children nor adults take age. <br /> <br /> I think it's possible to be fond of a favorite movie. Big secular audiences, but often the creators of these films 'message' or, in this case, their own autobiographical production are so focused on cinema as the good production of film production. (I'm sure it's not a title and cast member that nominates the principal producer / director / editor.) <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Michael Madsen was much more interesting and compelling. watch in the following movies. His work like this is definitely not based on such films.
