a friend told me he was another classic like "Debbie do Dallas". Just do not close. I think that my main complaint is that the mainstream porn industry is not the most attractive. It's even more awful that it's on the screen almost everywhere. But in those days I read somewhere; Porn had to be "artistic" value. I could not find it See if you are interested in the development of pornography, or you appreciate pornographic art pornography. I know I'm not. But the director of the movie looks like a talent. Simon and Garfunkel gave him permission to use his songs. Of course, they dismissed.
