"Crime perfect" is a typical thriller. The perfect crime is executed and the police investigator, excluding all traces, immediately knows who is guilty. The viewers have to wait for the whole movie to catch the culprits. The result is like "Columbo" or "wrote murder" in all sections. The director himself mentions the hackney story, seeing a section of the Police Matlock. This story does not meet almost 90 minutes, but the director starts using it for 120 minutes in the book. Skip this, you will not miss anything.
