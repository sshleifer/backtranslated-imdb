Not worth the look of this spoiler also determines what is worthwhile about "Annie". The character underestimates the almost-written story and causes a high quality feeling to produce. It was very clear to television, but when I found it on TV I would put it in a straight line. The children of the movie show a good job, but the adults are incredible, so the movie is not really drawn. This movie has no music / dance numbers the original wonderful and really Annie we the shine. all love Johnson, because Annie is annoyingly annoying, she's not convinced that she's really Annie. The character that looked different irritated me throughout the length of the film. Unfortunately this sequel was completely flop.
