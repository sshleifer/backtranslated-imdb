What do people talk about here? I've watched the other movie. I left the theater so bored. With those things. I laughed once and it was not that hard. When he plays this movie, he or she goes out and beaten. I always find something in the movie I like, but this one is crazy. "Slackers" seems like "Not Another Teen Movie". There are still "Body Shots", "Con Air" and "Theory of Composition" worst of all times. NO LIVING WITH NO LIVELY! I thought the studio gave money to people, because they left the theater as an apology, but I did not. Apparently, I never saw any money or two hours.
