Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. This is Scooby-Doo's first, most important and disturbing attempt to represent the company again. <br /> <br /> Shaggy's voice is sour and does not listen to any sound Scooby's predecessor shows. They have also changed the classic way of dressing and originality. <br /> <br /> I still do not know what they're doing wrong, but it's probably not the formula used in the previous Scooby exhibitions. <br /> <br /> And the animation style is very curious and distorted. I like it, but it's not the real Scooby-Doo type animation. They have created me some extravagant animations used for the WB shows; maybe that too. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look - to handle Shaggy's lack of proper voice. That's it, it's just enough to have fun in the show. Also, I'm not passionate about turning it into a sharp one. Evolve or die, as you say. We will see how we see more than two sections, then I will create a stronger opinion.
