I bought Bloodsuckers ebay a few years ago. I have seen the pieces and it has come to mind again. At first, the excessive amount of juicy "blood" is outdated, without mentioning "wind rumor". My friends and I made a super-budget super film, and the effects still surpassed this gap holiday. <br /> <br /> There are too many errors in this movie. I knew one of the cast members - believe it or not, my teatza was a teacher. HA! <br /> <br /> Last ruling: Do not worry about this "horror" movie. <br /> <br /> 3 stars (from 73 possible)
