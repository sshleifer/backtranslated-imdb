A movie given by Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews may well be worth seeing. Oh, I was wrong. From the beginning to the end, both O'Toole and York overwhelmed the nonsense. I saw it twice and I still do not know what it is. In my opinion, O'Toole plays a Scottish castle in Laird with a drinking problem and wants to retrieve childhood games with her sister (York). He is also mad at barking. But, apart from that, your invention is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> The movie does not have any kind of salvation feature. I can not only assume that the director and director have blackmailed their dull, inhuman and courageous piffle. Clearly cleared the talents and the loss of the director's time. Risible
