Why? !! Films insipid, shameless and shy. They're sorry they were coming from the city ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did people leave a BAAAAAD movie? <br /> <br /> When this movie was originally released ... it was a romantic comedy ... and nothing ROBO. They all changed, along with Disney's drunkenness. Why ???? A very interesting interpretation of this classical comic book. Matthew Broderick was not even fun to laugh at his own films. Sheesh !!
