Before seeing this movie, I had very little hope and I just saw cars. In the end I regretted it because of that, too. There is almost no plot. Characters development does not exist. I had a lot of clich√©s and so many cheeks in the movie, just as I could not wonder if I could not wonder. If they are not exotic, I would not even value this movie. 1. The consistency of a consistent coherence line destroys the nonsense of the greedy characters that make up this elite wrestling and its members. In fact, the film's drawing is very predictable and easy, an average child can announce most of the story. Bad operation, bad plot, jokes, bad movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see. Play Gran Turismo HD instead of it and automatically bring it quickly to your thirst without losing its thirst.
