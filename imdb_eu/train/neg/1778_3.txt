I have nothing against a horrific scare, but this nonsense derived from Stephen King is very new, shiny and modern. A land crossing the earth, a vampire and a wasp, about a new teenager of a small town, "Sleepwalker," and a virgin woman who feeds blood, demands a more mysterious and ambiguous treatment. . This thriller gives the wrong color and appearance, with little atmosphere. Children are beautiful and energetic savings, but great abuse is Alice Kridge as a boy; Kridge, by "Ghost Story", never came out of the women's molds, and it is a great loss that it is no longer used. His screenplay is incredibly intense and that the "Sleepwalkers" play better with focus and closer directions. It is excessively and commercially correct, with a different tone that starts with thriller and dramatic comedy. Stephen King is revealed in a cameo, like the real director John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 ****
