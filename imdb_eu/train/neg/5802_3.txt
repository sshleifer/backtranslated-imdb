Nikolai Gogol's story "Viy" has been shot again and has released a video in the U.S. across the USA via Faith Films. <br /> <br /> This original story has to take care of the witch only to see the body. to protect it. In America, it's very widespread and wide-ranging, even though it's filmed in Russia (despite the English signs that are home to clothes, clothing and furniture), it's a strange movie that does not really work. It's like being in America, but it's not clear. There are curious and delightful moments, the main character being a reporter at the beginning and a priest later. I do not know why they did it, even after watching a piece of the DVD.) The other problem is a huge duplication. However, if his lips are not talking on the camera, or, when appropriate, the voices are not distant. I do not know Faith Films blame their producers for blame or fault to the west (laid out in the established piece). <br /> <br /> The movie is not very good. As I said, it has a lot of technical issues, that is, they make this curious ball. Even though horror images are very good, it never works as a horror movie. When the film generates belief, it is too confused in this revelation to feel like anyone who feels closer to the gods. <br /> <br /> I'd give it to the selected one, even if it's a good price. My advice would be to find the version of the story called Viy, to understand both fear and god belief.
