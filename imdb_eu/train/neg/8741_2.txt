You realize that you've seen everything in five minutes before this movie. GASARITZA IS THE ROOM. IT IS REGIME. And DEVILS IS ADVOCATE. And there are no new items. Bill Gates-allegory, very clear. Experiences are always good for making movies, but why should it be so extreme? Boiler room is a good movie, it seems at least a bit like it - it seems realistic. Everything for Competition Defense is wrong. How realistic is it, for example, that your boss must pay a scammers to work for your girlfriend to work harder and more? I would give 1, but the soundtrack is ok, so 2/10.
