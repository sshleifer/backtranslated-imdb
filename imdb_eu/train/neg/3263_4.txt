Sommerset Maugham's story is the second British film adaptation to the film. While all the stories in the "Quartet" movie are not very memorable. and the cast of the actors is "cut", because Britons only had the distribution of previous actors of the 1950s. In any case it seems that it is more rigorous and filmous than the first adaptation of 'Trio'. <br /> <br /> One of the problems that these two films may not have been written was 25-30 years before the film. . As a result, in the 1950s Maughm's (previous war) popularistic story "small moral" seemed rather strange, if not fully charged.
