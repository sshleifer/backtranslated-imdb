I expected that this movie was great expectations, so they were given me with a salmon and I tried it best. The video was about to fall roughly 1/3 on the movie, just like the movie is a mish-mash that happens without apparent reason and it is disconnected. I think you think movies, but it's just an idea that goes hand in hand with that idea and is unmatched. Nowhere is there any trippy visuals. It's just a way of saying that the plot or story that there is no apparent art is just one reason or why it justifies just why you missed the movie for 1.5 hours. The performance was good, but he can not miss the story. I agree with the previously published commentator ... "It's like being in the head of another person ... while we are dealing with drugs", that is, it's not sensible.
