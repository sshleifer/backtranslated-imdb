Maya is a woman without any interest. He just dreams his life and admires it, why he does not feel full. This can be an interesting topic. That would be good, nice story and good conversations. It does not have one of them. This movie is completely boring. There are only lengths and there is no climate. The sole leader is Shahrukh Khan. But despite his great passion, I can not make the movie appear like this. Although he could not get out of this movie. The movie is not as bad as "King Uncle". If you're a fan of art, or maybe it's slow, maybe you'd like it. It's not fun, it's not interesting, it's not caught. My recommendation: do not see
