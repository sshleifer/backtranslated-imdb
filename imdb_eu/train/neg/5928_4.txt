Some of the greatest places in this episode do not get it - Miranda is so remarkable and so ugly that it would be insane. Here someone has warned that it is more than just the frequency or misfortune of light wave. Miranda is just a jerk. The episode is slow, inconsistent and very bad. Also, I do not know why the ambassador is Kolos - why is not Federakund left the damned Medusans? I like a bit, Kolos speaks of Spock about the loneliness of human experience. Overall, I love TOS and, even at his lamest, I've always tune in. Although this episode - mmm, I would not buy it unless I used the copy under $ 3.
