This movie has made me wrong! I think Cat in the hat. I think of the stack of cats in books. You know, a few years before, parents read to their children. Well, even though it will be like that movie! My surprise was not much like books! The mood of instinct is like a young adult movie. In a part, a cat is talking about a gardening tool (hoes). The cat talks to him, like his hoe (adult humor). I name her all her car, even if she is a little bit like a kids movie. You will find below the rating: Cude mood and a few double entries. In short, I mean that humor has come. I can translate this movie! Wal-mart said the movie was not open. If you are thinking about buying this, I recommend you buy a rental before buying.
