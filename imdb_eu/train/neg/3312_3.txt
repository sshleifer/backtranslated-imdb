... but I see that I regret it. Because ratings are quite high (and Netflix has to be quite high), I think I'm going to put it in my queue as a smooth and humorous UK comedy. terribly "Saving Grace" is included in non-category comedies featuring Hollywood-inspired films produced by talented Hollywood. Brenda Blethyn is the actress and I liked other films. I'm not going to offer myself a concept of a miserable gardener who overcomes the concept of the death of his husband's death. Despite the strong efforts of cast emotion production, the movie falls into the face (as if it were fun if it were fun) about myself and my wife. Be confessed, gentle reader, not all British comedies have succeeded. This is shameful.
