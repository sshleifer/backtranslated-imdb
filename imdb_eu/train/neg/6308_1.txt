The full brand of the content of this movie, as a Brit, was not aware of the US military segregation during the Second World War. Bring this courageous event to the world. However, the movie is pathetic, the direction does not exist, the acting is wood and the script is behind the other. I can honestly say one of the worst movie ever I have ever seen. I sat down from the beginning and finished it to the finish line, all in the worst possible way. The movie could be great, the story of many of us out of the US was new, unique and interesting. It's a great way to put together an incredible event. It's a shameful real story like that, which could have changed the people's attitudes in a small budget, because it was damaged in a badly targeted movie. I hope only in the future that one of the major studies will take on this issue and do justice.
