This movie was portrayed as a comedy on the trailer. It's an extreme tragedy. He left me stomach. I hate. If they want to make a movie like this, I think men would have enough to reflect on the true intentions of the movie. I would not see the movie if I knew him. I think the film needs to reflect on the theme and intentions of the film. I'm tired. I wanted to be a fun comedy and I'm very disappointed. A few days passed and I still have a bad taste in this movie. I have never been disappointed in a movie, and I have never written comments about a bad movie. I truly believe that the real fraud was involved in this trailer, if they were to show the real intention of the movie, that nobody saw it.
