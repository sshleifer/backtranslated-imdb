This movie is horrible. It is not offensive, but very predictable. The film continues in a small town in the mid 60's. Father, the principal at school, makes a crisis in the middle of life. Enter a beautiful teacher of a great city thinking about your students' minds as though they were thinking of yourself thinking about yourself. The boss does not agree with his teaching, but it's nice. You can connect points. Her teenage daughter (Winona Ryder Tara Frederick, child) is bored with a small town life and wants to live. He gets bad advice, he has bad guys, and apparently family planning was not taught at school. Shocking! Directed by Paul Shapiro, he has worked mainly on television, which plays like a version of later adult school or plays a very special part of one of the commercial scenes.
