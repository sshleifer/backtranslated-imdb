The world's film critics, Excuse me. Your job is to advise advertising to choose wisely to spend money. But your advice was ignored and I was injured. However, I did not see "Cat in the Hat in". Three years ago, all critics said that we should avoid "mishaps" known as "Grinch Steal Christmas". Afterwards, I saw some of my friends and the yuletide treatment was colorful, fun and almost hypnotic. So when the critics annoyed "The Hat in the Hat" when Seuss's great budget was updated with a great title, I thought it was the same old song. What was wrong <br /> <br /> I thought it was clear in five minutes. Initial credits are clear, children are charming and production values ​​are high. Then the cat appeared. From now on there are many problems, but the biggest Mike Myers was the confusion. When "The Grinch" was saved by the inspiration of Jim Carrey's casting, "The Cat" was destroyed by Myers. It can be very fun when they enter their energy, applying sketches comics. All the really cool movies featured just a short comedy from "Wayne's World" from Austin Powers. So trying to do the same thing here, these comedy sketches are like things that stick to the end of the SNL, not funny, just painful. The writers did not help. After a charming prologue, it becomes an hour of annoying mood for body, an immense humiliated illness with severe timing and hip-humor. This film was the most heavily cinematic experience ever. Deadline So much talents and work became so evil. I know the older stars of this movie will not feel well due to this illness, I hope Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will have a better chance to showcase the shorts. If you're a parent, avoid it so badly. With movies like "Elf" and "Brother Bear" nowadays, there are much better options.
