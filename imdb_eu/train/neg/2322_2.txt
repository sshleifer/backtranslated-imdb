I searched the video store everywhere to find this movie; I was a great elvis fan and I think that it has been a great disappointment. Kurt Russel's "Elvis Moves" declined most and the voice was imitated, but Elvis's double song did not work for me. The voice was not always in a hurry, and it was difficult for me to worry about the plot I felt was lost. Likewise, those who did not know much about the elvis in the film were so dissatisfied, they would surely think about it. The song is played before they recorded earlier, when the first guitarist got it wrong, I am sure that he was buried in the tomb buried by his brother Jesse, and not a large slab reading JESSE GARRON. I know it was just a TV movie, but the most important events jumped up, such as "back-special", for some scenes to go on. If you want to see a good movie, the elvis show in its main rental, or that elvis another concert. It's just the only way to see your true talent and to see real elvis prepositions. (I know the excellent statement, but still ... go and rent a good elvis flic.)
