In my opinion, first of all, let's conclude that I have seen this piece of "art" and I have strong impressions. The reader will be asked to apologize to my stronger vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is totally horrible, and I would never want to write about this word, "If it was not for 44 minutes." he was taken to death, and this happens rarely. I'm paying off that I do not feel better, as well as the great worth of movie reviews. <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with the movies? It's a "44 minutes" fashionable title. The first one thinks "15 Minutes", that is, the movie is better, but still bad in my book, and in fact, both can be compared in part. Congratulations, however, on the things that might be, are the worst of all. Both have appeared, Oleg Taktarov, with a very accented Russian, of course, who looks and expects local expectations. Its purpose is to recall the Cold War. Oh, we're good at times. Now, I do not mean that the actress is evil, yet I have to analyze his true performance, but here he is not a real individual, here is like archetype. Understanding how one can do such things is beyond my comprehension. Here we can learn about modern American xenophobia. Taktarov's companion explains to his friend that the Romans are not Germans, and when they live in America, they may really want to be. Do we suppose that the duo's worst misfortune is to be "true" Americans? <br /> <br /> Then there is a problem with the media. Yes, most of us seem to be cameras, interviewers and reporters. The director had to feel the pace of 44 minutes. Instead, he has bored interviews throughout the film, such as a cheap television program to guess the wheel. In 15 Minutes the subject of the media is central. A teacher presents a point to a deceived student, but this is a worthwhile comment, we are focusing on 44 minutes now. So I'm trying to identify the goal of this movie. What is that? Give audiences a good time? Glorify weapons? To glorify the police? Present Violence? Oh, the bible is given by the official as delinquency. So, in the end, it has to promote peace and understanding? I do not think, but do not ask. I know I do not like that. <br /> <br /> Oh, Michael Madsen. I accept, I'm a big fan. It was a bright point, but I was wrong. It's not his fault. <br /> <br /> As a final note, at the end of the movie, "firepower" and "willpower" were one of the worst lines I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> The summary, on scale 1-10, I get purified 1.
