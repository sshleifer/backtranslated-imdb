The problem I find with this title is not sure if the director tries to produce a documentary or film. The mix of both genres only works, and that's not all hanging in the center of nothingness. This is what the director brings together with the most extreme aspects of our everyday life, becoming a convincing documentary. If you want to be a thriller / drama, this is too dull and monotonous. In any case, what is the moral or message given to the director? If there are people who treat others who want to treat them badly? Is it totally bad about our environment? So .......... what?
