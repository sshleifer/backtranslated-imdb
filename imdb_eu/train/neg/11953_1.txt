Do you know the movies you've gotten in the movies? Before sitting three times before adjusting correctly, you are at the best seats in the house, before changing the appropriate seat and you feel trapped for 13 hours. uncomfortable and dirty, thinking "F *** when this movie is ever END ???" (You know the feeling - think about A. I and the Town). <br /> <br /> Well, Q, the visitor gives us some extravagant variations of that feeling. I was seated in the first 30 minutes asking me when the things started! It's constant! So "Arty" pain. This is the first movie by Miike Takashi. It seems that the movie does a dozen, and if they're all like that, I think it's the last one. <br /> <br /> I do not pretend before. David Lynch is among the top 10 top executives for me, but Q is the visitor's cut-rate, cheap, and nasty pretentious w @ nk. <br /> <br /> As you've worked on until now, I hate it.
