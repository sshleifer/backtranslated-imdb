Frank Sinatra great film with Tony Rome. Here he participates with a dead woman under the sea. <br /> <br /> Soon it is hired in Rome to find out what happened to a woman. Of course, she is a woman under the sea. Lainie Kazan, his teammate, soon died on the ground. <br /> <br /> The aging of Richard Conte plays a policeman and a friend of Rome. When the owner of the local club dies, the blame falls to Rome and the bullying scene becomes an interesting one. This is a bad image if you need to be subject to a harassment scene to supply the action. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch plays beauty in the neck, intrigued. His practice is desirable. <br /> <br /> Martin Gabel is a hoodlum retired, trying to overcome his son. At the end of the movie, you do not know why they killed the girl. Do not ask too.
