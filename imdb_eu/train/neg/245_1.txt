Without a doubt, the Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made, but it still retains love in my heart, the poverty of its special effects and the great soundtrack in the first 15 minutes (and that's all it's all right for you). See) to create something that divides side by side. <br /> <br /> It's similar to what the film scene opens in 'Space', sucking liquid bottles in front of the eyes. conversation Before getting up, you're crazy or not, you're going to roll your credit and fight for action. <br /> <br /> And in addition to the double-headed cardinally-made plastic cloth that bothers our heroes, you can simultaneously add voices and duplicate voices of the original actors. Pure genius <br /> <br /> I've seen only one copy of this kind of lovers so wonderful, so seeing yourself is a lot more difficult. I have only one existing copy. <br /> <br />
