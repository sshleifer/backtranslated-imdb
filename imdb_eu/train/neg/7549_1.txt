If Edward Woodward was watching this movie, he was afraid of what he meant. <br /> <br /> Sorry, it's enough. Get Carter, Italian Job, Alfie and now we have been. What are the similarities? It's no coincidence, above all, three of the original star Maurice Micklewhite and a great British actor. The main component of these original documents is British film. They did not get mad at Hollywood. They were a curious English film, a charm and a unique atmosphere that can not be replicated in the United States. The word is CULT and what is the best way to destroy a cultural film is to re-enter it with a re-enactment or a sequel. <br /> <br /> Wicker 06 had a tough task before reaching the road. Wicker 73 is even more enigmatic than others worship; genre, smart scripts, A-level actors, music scores, descriptions and all the stories about the film. <br /> <br /> So, here's a remake. Do not worry There's no original premiere to make this remake. Some of the most important aspects of the story were to be upgraded to modern United States: communications, paganism, virginity. But it's just a whole premise. So we'll give the police style Nam trauma the past flashbacks of the whole music with cheap scares. Without the mobile phone of the island that orders the island of communication, it would not happen in the real world. Police are just missing. Give blood to him a lot more motivation than the link between beliefs and rebuild you. But thin owls are not it? <br /> <br /> Simply everything was sharp. Changes to names were just hammers, almost Carry On, there was no sense of community in the island, you could not catch the bearings of the city center, it was just a few houses around a forest. Willow was simply annoying that he had not given any information, and Cage was in vain to let him escape. When he entered the ship, he just knew he would be blocked. The script was signposted to the finish line - and you just want to quickly and end it. Epiloga was totally fun and did not know when to stop. <br /> <br /> This conclusion is probably the best way to summarize the difference between them. One of the most beautiful sunsets ends after the most terrible day. They are presented with another final production: all explanations explain this to all sources. <br /> <br /> I love the originals, but I went to the cinema to see the movie I had with open mind and excitement. I swore this movie under a freeway, knowing that it will be underneath a path that is forgotten this time.
