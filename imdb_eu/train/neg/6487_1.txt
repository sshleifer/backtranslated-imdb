Well, thank you so much SO Diane I was using my favorite favorite movie to get rid of good memories. When I was about 5 years old, when the original movie came out, I remembered one of the first films I remembered. So, I'm 16 years old and I feel enough with Masochists, I decided to rent this movie. So I forgot all the memories of the original movie with the excuse for a movie. This movie takes all the original pleasure and destroys everything until the last details. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, Melody, and go to show off. everybody in the ocean ... BROADWAY STYLE! After finishing some musical numbers, Morgan's witchcraft appear and Melody dies to kill Triton if he does not leave the Trident. So he gives him a fight too. Eric is not in front of him, but Ariel tells him how to use the swords and keep Melody. Morgan runs away, so Ariel and Eric have decided that Melody has never been caught near Morgana by the sea. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Well ... I did not notice anything. Eric is total. It never managed anything. He's doing something like Ariel. Melody worsens things. In addition, the animation is a new bass in Disney. Computer-based images are tapped with different origins. The only possibility of developing a character is wasted. Songs are stitched. <br /> <br /> Look, do not waste your time. I'm sure the kids will get bored too, because it's not remotely exciting. They do not want to sing songs. If you take a copy of it, throw it in the ocean and hope that nobody will ever find it. Then
