I really went to see this movie in a theater, but what time and money to lose! The bad operation, I'm sorry to say, did not help me to enjoy this sticky script. <br /> <br /> Some of my friends told me to watch this movie, since he was the author of James Redfield's book, he is very much involved. The book really enjoyed, so the movie was perfect. Well, maybe I had a lot of hope, but I totally hate this movie! It was predictable, I enjoyed it too, I really let out a point I had to vomit and the worst of all would be a thrill! Make the world go by and stop this fake crusade.
