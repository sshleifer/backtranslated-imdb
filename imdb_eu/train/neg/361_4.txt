After reading the book, I love the story. When I saw the movie, I was disappointed that there were so many changes. It is understandable that books and movies are different, but there were two different stories; only names and the story of the book were only maintained. Read the book and you will understand the movie better. The book gives you a better development of the characters. These characters are very interesting and care about you. The locations match the descriptions of the book. Some characters are not included. Television has brought so many great books and stories, an excellent example. Author's entry does not always guarantee a good movie, but it can sometimes help.
