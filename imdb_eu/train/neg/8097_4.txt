Many critics believe that it is one of the greatest odors of all time (it is certainly the happiest career of Brian De Palma). <br /> <br /> Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a wealthy and wealthy man whose life is divided. He and his lover, Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith), participate in the race and success. His story is a tranquil guy, reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). <br /> <br /> Well, as I said in my summary ... <br /> <br /> What do you think this movie? be it It seems that combines comedy, drama and satire, but it surely does not add too much. The characters are unpleasant and dimensionless, but you will never want to pick up real life when you do not like it. <br /> <br /> I do not like the novel. (I started reading, but I was not able to finish it, I did not like it), but it is obvious to me that the novelists / enjoyers believe this film is impossible. <br /> <br /> I never had ever been. They watched so many talented actors as they try hard below the average movie that looks good and fails. What waste <br /> <br /> The problem makes Tom Hanks a handsome man who is clearly not supposed to play this problem. And Peter Fallow's role was a novel. Bruce Willis is wrong, in bad role. What a thought was there. <br /> <br /> Oh, no, nor even Morgan Freeman could escape the film in full dignity, because he was forced to offer a high-profile speech "after". <Br> /> <br /> This movie becomes absurd, absurd. <br /> <br /> I liked the Talented Conference; That's why I'll give them four to ten, but I'm sure some people might say that it might be a longer film from the source material.
