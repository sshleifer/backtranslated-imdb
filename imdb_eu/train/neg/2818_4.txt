Genie (Zoe Trilling) arrives in Egypt to visit her father's hypocritical and biblical archaeologist (William Finley) and is attracted by a group of cultural guided by a Sade marker (Robert Englund). Englund also plays De Sade in the flashback, included in his room. Genie Mohammed (Juliano Merr), who is nude in a horse, takes the path that Sabina (Alona Kamhi), bisexual and opium smoker. This creates wild hallucination, topless harem dancers who simulate oral sex. A serpent, an orgy, and his father's preaching in the back! In the meantime, they capture the black corporeal corpses, they face their faces and swords. When Genie gets slimmed in her medication, Sade hangs on a cross, a gold-colored woman, full of leafy rocks, and herself in a bed that stains bloody snakes. However, Sade is the revival of the lost love. This Harry Alan Towers production is usually redundant, fair and quite absurd, but sets, costumes, cinematography and positioning are excellent and at least something always happens. <br /> <br /> Score from 10 to 3
