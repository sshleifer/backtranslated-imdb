A dirty scientist has decomposed the girl so she can restore herself to life. The film's plot is honest. He tries to find another body, looking for a sleaze town for the perfect body. For some reason, he has a ugly monster in his cabin while watching the closet. The movie sleaze style is drowned. Nobody in the movie can not have one. The closet is a monster mask, it's a male and you can really say it. The plot is slow, weak and the end is so bad. See the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this movement. Believe me, people would not see the movie.
