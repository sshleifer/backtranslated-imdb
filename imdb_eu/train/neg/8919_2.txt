For the first time I saw it as a suggestion from the TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and it seemed interesting to me. In addition, I am a fan of Max Fleischer's work and started to look like a cartoon in the 30s. With these two, I would think of my interest. I was wrong. In a few minutes, I quickly pushed the button. I've been around for about 15 minutes and I thought that's it. <br /> <br /> Then, I've read other reviews here and I thought I did not give enough time. I recorded it again and I saw it. I'm not 75 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> I do not think there is any worse review. Personally, I think it's hard to get 10 comments on the minimum comments. How often is that time losing it? <br /> <br /> The movie is intended for children of high-level children who are ready to die for the whole world, with their breasts, the most ugly. and jokes. The characters are flat. The "adventure of the alphabet" parody is a lama, which basically tones the melody that goes through the A-E, pressing "F" with pity, and then does not know where to go. The forested land is not the first time it is operating, much less the following. <br /> <br /> Throughout the table, you would want to see what you expected from the whole movie "South Park" Stone and Parker to determine what is and is not fun. This can be fun if you're tall. Otherwise it is not.
