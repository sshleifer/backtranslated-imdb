It's hard to believe that people really love it! I think they will be able to enjoy the kids, but it seems like parents do not know what kind of movie they are. Predicable land, Belushi boring, and perhaps the worst child actor of all ages. I'll give the manager responsibility for the child, but actually seeing it was painful. Now I feel embarrassed, people know their being. When I heard the Star Spangled Banner, I had to turn off the sound. Then I came and I won with Star Search. I have always felt that Jim Belushi should be ashamed of his wonderful brother, unfortunately, in commerce with his name, and this joke shows why. Zero stars
