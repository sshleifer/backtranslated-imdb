In summer, it's also proud of stinkers like Snakes on Plunt and Da Vinci Code, a pretty bold statement. However, I leave. Superman Returns, like 6 months before King Kong, is longer, hyperplendent and CGI with eyeballs. God, I'm doing this thing in mind. <br /> <br /> <br /> Richard Donner continued his search for 2 outings. And it seems to me to be the most appropriate approach to special and optical effects. Brian Singer bombs us so much CGI, it's really a story and always reminds us that the only way to impress the audience is to spend about $ 250 million (a totally rewarding amount). ), on the wicked visual effects that do not fit into life. We've all seen and we can take CGI from us. There is no real atmosphere or implication. And for a movie that has 95% of this waste ... well understood. <br /> <br /> I've read so much reviews of fanboy criticisms about "soul" or "how" of the human heart "or" tender nature. "Puh-rent! We already have super-heroes who are shouting in silence" I would love to know you "In the last few years, there are dozens of times and SR is completely different from that. The plot is also a recycled garbage. Lex Luthor was made in the first film, designed to destroy the American mass base and directed by Kevin Spacey. It's amazing, they took 2.5 hours of painful, even if they were fond of cast, it would be unbearable. Brandon Routh but on the personal display of a mahogany hat-stand, Kate Bosworth is not convinced as a journalist who won the Pulitzer Prize, James Marsden is 250% wooden As usual, Kevin Spacey really needed both his agent fire or some better judgment. I just like the only cast, Parker Posey was beautiful, but she looks like a girl I'm curious. <br /> <br /> Every year, this film is as sharp and bigger. Soon we will have 300 million dollars. Students should realize that they should look rather than look. All the money that Warner spent, because of all the means to achieve this cost for the movie ... Was it worth it? I think, of course, no! This garbage has moved me to Superman!
