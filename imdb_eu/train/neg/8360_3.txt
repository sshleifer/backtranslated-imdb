What is it about this movie? <br /> <br /> It's a color! <br /> <br /> It has an amazing underwater photography! <br /> <br /> The music has a rhythmic score, sometimes it works well in the background! <br /> <br /> So, from 10 to 3! <br /> <br /> Sometimes music accelerates! Especially when sharks or evil are moving! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it slows down! The time to be sympathetic was like conveying to the audience! <br /> <br /> Just like another, it pokes dust! In a "Western Spagetti" similarity is similar! <br /> <br /> It's not Italian that they can not produce quality productions! Some of the television films were "Octopus" titles ranging from 1 to 7, and they were screened on SBS television in the 90s of Australia in the mafia-related conflicts. They were great! But, oh, you do not find it here! <br /> <br /> I thought it was made in the 1960s! Sadly he was 20 years old, as shown by a funeral scene near! <br /> <br /> Then there was a sharp bite of the shark and a red powder that emerges in fresh water everywhere! <br /> <br /> Either way, in the bar room or an unstoppable shark in the sea, when they see the last shore, the hero's friend watches over troubled glasses. He himself was bored with his constant work among the many developments of many plots or evidence! <br /> <br /> At least one heroes are worried about a worried wife, a former wife! <br /> <br /> But, of course, even if the music is not lit up, it is a nasty sound in the voices of the wicked, as if it were inflammable with another dark sculpture! <br /> <br /> In the end, someone thought of lies! It was totally predictable when we thought about it! But be careful, people, do you find another lie! If you look closely! To warm your heart, more or less! <br /> <br /> Follow the hero's advice, and take some beer on the way! The "Night of the Sharks" will be more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Then you'll be ready something like "007" when you make it easier for reality!
