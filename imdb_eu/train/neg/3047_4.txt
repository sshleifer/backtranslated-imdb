When I saw this movie at the end of the 60s / early 70s, every Saturday, when it grew like a reindeer in August and December, a head was created on Saturday as a kiddie show on Saturday. CHRSTMASE was always a tough contest. Can I say "Christmas"?), The greatest icon of Christmas season of all time. But it's another review. <br /> <br /> Then I admired SANTA-REN with the SANTA screen's ink. CLAUS was almost "pink and white", and so much color changed the color of the pyro-rigid colors. <br /> <br /> A little bit of a movie! So I thought, then ... and still the truth. So I was very entertained, still! It's funny again in "elf restarting" mode. By the way, the quality of the images is much better than the DVD I made in the theater, from 1969 to 1974. <br /> <br /> Expect some "special RANKIN-BASS Christmas specials" if you're expecting it! If FELLINI wants Christmas - read it ... <br /> <br /> Naturally, duplication of foreign films (the original version in Spanish) seems "surreal". This is because the movie adds to its own nonsense. Additionally, it is quite scary that the "evil demon" (as described in the original US trailer) will give the film a complete movie to make children "worthy" worthy. Latch-key. "The" Christmas-gift "of the" family of portraits "boyfriend suddenly wanted to be a Christmas-dad when he realized that he was only daydreaming! See this for Christmas lovers - and keep it, save your deposit - Do you think this film is hallucinated ... without drugs!
