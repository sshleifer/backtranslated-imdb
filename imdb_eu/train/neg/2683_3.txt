Have you ever wondered what would happen if Beverly Hills 90210 characters were thrown into Thai jail? If so, this is your movie. This is a crowd of Midnight Express MTV. That would be, but the story was poorly executed. Land conversations, poor conversation, and unresolved issues. This lightweight film did not have the right to be just as cryptic as it was. The potential line of disaster is impossible and the plot line is impossible - if hotel staff does not have a room there and when it is being thrown at the moment it's time to complete. (This moment, in the right way, is considered the same anguish and anguish as when a gun is detained). Later, the same hotel staff was found in some way, and Bangkok is a great city, I have an understanding, I have been there and I have a testimonial against girls, as if it had been sent to a 40-year-old prisoner like Mai Tais. Pull up Rent another day in paradise.
