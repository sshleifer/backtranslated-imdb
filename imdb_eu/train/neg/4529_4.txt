I will not describe the story, as it has been done in other places. Clive Owen is a great fan and when our Netflix recommends the movie, we were fascinated. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that we have never heard this "movie", it was a BBC Television movie in 1992. For this reason, bad production values, granular images, rotating cameras and poor sound work. /> <br /> But you do not mind the mechanic, because the story will sleep. The human story is interesting, but it is not in any way compelling, and there is almost no end. You do not really care about the characters, because life is boring, and you see this terrible movie. Save two hours and do something to make it worth more time.
