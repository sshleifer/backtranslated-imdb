I do not know why the movie was announced, as wild, bizarre and smiling comedies. There is no movie in this movie that will entertain or make fun of filmmakers. Annette Bening (saying that she was worthy of her as an Oscar in the theater) is interrupted here as her behavior routine seems. Brian Cox's character is disconcerting and disturbing, and does the authority play Augusten? Joseph Cross? It seems to have no personality to carry it out. The best movie is not Evan Rachel Wood, but it's not enough to protect this boring and boring movie. <br /> <br /> The movie quickly disappears and seems good. I have found some annoying scenes (Brian Cox's scene and its toiletries used compete with some of the worst competitions in "You and Me and Everyone Know Know" and "The Squid and the Whale", worrying about some embarrassment and most of it. I found it. Did not you waste time?
