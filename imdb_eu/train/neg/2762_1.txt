... No one watches the movie. My husband and I went to see it tonight. It's just a small theater, but there are many people. This time no! My husband and I only had Dragon Wars watching last night! Now we know why. <br /> <br /> The movie I've ever seen was the worst. Yes, CG was good, but that was it. Acting, screenplay and dialogue, direction, edition, etc. He was a terror of terror! As we were alone in the room, we could talk over the movie. This is what it was like to talk bad, remembering the powerful Powerful Morphin, Godzilla, the Deadly and the Lord of the Rings. It was the same as we saw the portraits of the army commanders Rita and Lord Zed Sauron. They were ridiculous creatures. You can only access dino / dragon-loaded dragonflies with a cannon without explanation. The rings have a wide spectrum of characters, but presenting and developing more than three films, not in an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Scene transitions are awesome. I did not sleep during the movie, but I found it a very simple plot, but I found it to be in the lost slots. <br /> <br /> The characters were from the Caucasian Americans, but almost spoke English. because the script is wrong. <br /> <br /> The last scene that may have some exchange value for the movie has failed. Ethan did not cry when Sarah died ... even though he did not know her life all the time. There was no need to stop "Mordor", he was not too silent, without knowing where he was or how to return. We could not know God's love where he was or how he arrived, but if it were not unpleasant we would not have been. <br /> <br /> Oh, and why did the dress look like she was wearing Sarah's queen Elizabeth's queen? Another thing ... 3 characters of the main hero were once again returning to work. Sarah plays her role and goes to life as a whole. Jack does this too. So why is Ethan getting tired? He left alone without a girl to return without map / compass / helicopter. What should she do? Send Smoke Signals? And when he returns home, does he return his work? Other heroes should have the same mercy to be out of the movies. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the movie or spend your time and money. We were at the end, when we paid for it, but when the credits arrived, we left the door.
