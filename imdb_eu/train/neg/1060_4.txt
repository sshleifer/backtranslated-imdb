OK, so it was written in 1996 before 9/11. That is why terrorism and the director of the CIA may think that this sky plane is out of heaven. world, face to face. That's it. That's a good thing. Event ... fair. Earth ... stupid. "Twist" ... it is not necessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM No one thought of what to do when the plane was infected. Do not you have the bureaucratic "pests" and how to have manuals? Successful implementation of such plans is always the problem as we have seen in Katrina. But they have a plan. Not sent to Iceland and sent to Mauritania. And if the virus is in the air, why was the plane opened and the "shooter" was not protected? In fact, has anyone ever stumbled on his legs? That should stop. I'm a crack: I always see a movie to see the end, when I started, but this was a waste of time, and it was mostly predictable. I saw a recorder, so I did not have to see all the ads, plus it was one. A good example of this is why I see the small television network.
