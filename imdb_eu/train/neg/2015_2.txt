I was waiting for this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I'm an aviation nut and love the helicopters. I do not like this program because it leads to fantastic levels. Several years ago, Westland Lynx ranked 249 mph worldwide in the helicopter speed record. The only helicopter that reached the fastest time was the Lockheed AH56A experimental in the 1960s. It got more than 300 and it was a composite helicopter. That's why he had an impulse for the end of his fuselage. <br /> <br /> In the end, a helicopter can not fly more than 275. flight flight And Bell 222, the "actress" portrayed as "Airwolf" was not very fast, despite helicopter rules. And he did not have a very long production. <br /> <br /> There was a movie called "Thunder Blue", which was much more realistic.
