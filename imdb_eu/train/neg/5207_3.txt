Anematic dramatic comedy, an unhappy, seemingly dangerous affair, that man who hires a contract with a lover with Cher, slowly engages in a great deal of friendship. Chazz Palminteri, as a contracted gun, has adjusted the script according to his play, the beginning and the beginning of the conversation that quickly sparkles the eye and ear. The unfortunate air hangs throughout the project, and the director Paul Mazursky can not take Cher from its permanent operation (it does not whiten him). Despite great talents (among producers Robert De Niro), "Believers" is fraudulent, the story has no substance, and rarely lives. * 1/2 ****
