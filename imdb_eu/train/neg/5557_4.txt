Ok, but is not it a good movie? Well, not really, I think. Not highly recommended. That's too slow, it's boring. There were a number and two predictions, but I have not felt so much this time that this movie was quite enjoyable, and I did not think it's the same as the series and the character. He's just a good actress, but I think he even played his character next to the tone of the movie. I'd much rather like the movie filma.plus, something pretty bad. . Returns the role of Arnold Voslook, but it does not work in this movie. The character has not really evolved, as I expected. This is my opinion. Well, to me, this is the movie. Not abysmal, it's pretty bad. My Darkman III vote: 3.5/5
