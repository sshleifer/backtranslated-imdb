What about Robert "Pretentious" with Altman? Was it saving on lighting? Everything was so dark in that dreadful movie, it was amazing. I mean, have you ever seen a law firm where everyone has a lamp lamp? <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. In fact, do not miss out on everything that Altman does all the time. It wastes all the movies.
