As a writer and conductor, Hopkins has made a lot of success in this film, we have never met in the film anymore. However, maybe there is a problem. The film has a great ambition and its intentions are very complex and very deep, but it is very impersonal. There are no characters. We never know who it is, so we do not have any investment. <br /> <br /> A scriptwriter can mix with his characters. Is it Maybe So, I do not mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean, it's not saying. Hopkins is an experiment on films. According to this face, it might be thought of one of the scriptwriters, when he realizes that life is lost, and / or success is a blind chance, it is thrown into a "revolution" of tenses between time, dreams, thoughts and reality. However, the brain is so irrelevant that it leaves room for emotion suggestions, though it leaves them with little or no rudimentary ability to make a connection with their characters. <br /> <br /> I did not think it silly. and machine-gun speeds were a great showcase for camera and publishing school for me, but I'm beginning to realize that I'm going to realize that I'm going to realize that I'm making a lot of movies. There are so many films in the past decade, where cuts or camera movements have sound effects and other technical atmospheric doodles. In this case, I suppose it was justified that he intended to understand the impressionism of his dreams. However, when I saw anything I knew about Slipstream, I came out the same way. And I do not like it, because Hopkins does not make any effort to care. There are interactive movies and swings and movies are made, your presence is unknown. This slipstream is the latest.
