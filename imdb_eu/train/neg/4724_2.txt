This is one of the worst films ever I've ever seen. I saw SXSW in the premiere and I was very disappointed. The director discovered little John Lennon and even said he was in the premiere. It's a drama, but people laughed when the movie was tender. This is never a good sign. They were friends of Dominik Monaghan and Jason Leonard Livien. It was fun, while the rest of the movie was very serious. The Beatles' letter was dropping. An excellent soundtrack, however, was probably the best part of the movie. If you were one of those crazy and crazy Dominic Monaghan fans, do not worry about it.
