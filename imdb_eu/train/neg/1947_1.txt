I'm 17 years old and I still like Scooby Doo movies and most of the old episodes. I love movies in the 1990s, and they have directed us the Scooby Doo exits on Scooby Doo DVD this past decade, Scooby Doo and Goblin King, which was as good as I expected. However, come back to get a track! I have seen several episodes, I expected a good one, but I was not surprised by what I saw. First of all, I hate animation. Flat, flat and very saturated in the morning - cartoons - it was standard, the worst part of the series. I really hate that some shows have had a bit of animation. Even worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like foreigners, and Fred, Velma and Daphne were really missing out when they added a lot of old episodes, because Scooby Doo was well off. I also hate character changes, as it seemed to be a mystery solution, as Shaggy and Scooby were playing superheroes now, would they never have had movies or where are you Scooby-Doo? show The tune of the theme was not too good, I could not remember, and the jokes were lame and artificial. However, I admit that there was a very talented voice, if they had a better material and they did not sound like the human sound they had, as the original voice would add. In the end, I personally thought it was horrible and I did not try to uncover it, what they feel personally. 1/10 Bethany Cox
