In fact, it was quite funny ... in a god, what was the reason this movie made "If you're playing life movies ... what do I do ... follow and see ... but really think about" is this a good movie? "eff off. <br /> <br /> This movie sucks the initial scene with the worst actor I have ever seen in any movie ... usually they get in five minutes before they can" create this movie "... but not, you know it well. This movie talks about Edgar Allen Poe ... he has never tried to explain people who do not know Poe's life story ... so I do not know what one said is true. <br /> </ p> This movie "Ethan Poe" writes about his "cousin" ... edgar allan poe's descendants ... or are they?! Apparently, people have done what their ancestors did. Guy ethan poe is actually "usher", Edgar It is supposed to be the descendants of the story of "Usher House" written by Allen Poe, revealing in Ann's brothers he leaves to try to force his rape ... he was walking in front of three different people at the time of the Ann movie (seriously, three ... behind his eyes. and he does not realize). The dying characters eventually reveal themselves trying to save the day ... but they can not. At the end, he shoots forever while trying to kill his best friend. Of course, before he shot himself, "never!" he has to scream. The movie has never been seen!
