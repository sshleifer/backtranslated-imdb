If you go to watch this movie, you would be a person who told you to go to the movie theater, director, producer, actors and watch. A pity, Sarah Michelle Geller, put my name and face on this bad excuse for a movie. Perhaps it was terrifying if Japan's Japanese actors talked about trying to "act" in English. When I finished the movie I wanted ... a real disappointment after winning the last money on television and film sites. Sarah Michelle did not have to work on this movie ... she practiced her scary skills. Do not waste time or money in this movie.
