I have to say beforehand that I definitely do not promise myself in Bollywood movies and I have not seen them. However, if you have never seen it, do not start with this! I liked everything that I have seen yet, but I can not accept it. I also have to say because I can not finish this movie: it was annoying. So why was it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. There's a character named "Rambha" in the movie. Jar-Jar is more annoying than Binks, I would never have thought it possible. It's so # @ ^! # Tricky! Falseto spoke with a voice and I think it's a comic relief. Instead, he just crushed his nerves and wanted to kill ... slowly! His voice, his manners and his wickedness - he did not look like he was dominant in every scene, and he must die! <br /> <br /> 2. Heroes had an amazing ability to avoid the AK-47 bullets. I do not care - a scene where armed boys attacked by a small army of small assault rifles! And repeatedly, they took a single bullet and avoided the Russians! This influenced Stallon's "Rambo II" actions. <br /> <br /> 3. The movie was so noisy, my face and life - I thought it was the brain! As if the film was made by the impacted by the method! Crazy cameras, intense music, action, action, action ... This movie is designed by anyone who does not want to film on the plot and almost 100% of them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4. Both main characters and their actions and motivations have no meaning ... in any way! <br /> <br /> Perhaps you are the most passionate act and Bollywood fan you can do this movie, but for me, I can see why I have 100 bad lists on the IMDb. Wow ... this movie is bad and very bad !!
