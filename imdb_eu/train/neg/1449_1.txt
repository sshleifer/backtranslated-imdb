First of all, before reading more, I have to understand that I am a neo-Nazi, I am trying to understand that Hitler does not reappear. <br /> <br /> I saw this as a series and it was horrible. I mean, well, it's interesting to look, but is it true? I found answers and found one: it is not entirely. First, Hitler was not angry at all his life, the series shows an angry Hitler, even though he is a child. Secondly, Hitler had never wanted to deal with his daughter, it is quite likely that Hitler was, in fact, gay and struggled to overwhelm this secret throughout his life. Third, people will hate me, but it's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think how the power got harsh and ugly? It was charming This is the common point I have encountered in conversations (or Jews) on ordinary or remote points. <br /> <br /> This series was horrible, because Hitler thought it was an angry base. Ugly, and of course, it's not charming, you're wrong. If you think this, people like him will give you power in countries, and you do not want to. In fact, if Hitler understands the power of access and fails to think, he can find dangerous politicians (of course, remember that he was elected) and before being late. <Br /> <br /> Life is important to protect, this series is absolutely terrifying to show the truth; If we follow Hitler, another will happen as before.
