THE CHOKE (AX UK AX) is a straight line to the DVD. I suspect that "I'm saying" the title of the movie "V" does not mean parentheses to indicate that it's made for the DVD movie (although it looks like it). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < A group organizes a concert in an old meatpacking factory and they die one by one. <br /> <br /> I think most people would agree that the film will never be a masterpiece, but that does not stop forgiving. here Even live DVD movies like BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE has a lot of richness and sometimes it's "so bad, it's good". However, CHOKE does not have much slasher (such as HALLOWEEN) or a "so bad" movie (for example, THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE). <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a good drill with a character. The blood effects were very cursive, but they were understandable with the small budget. But from there, he goes downhill. <br /> <br /> There are several faults in CHOKE, they can talk about them all day long. But some of them clearly stand out and I'll join them. <br /> <br /> The aforementioned concert seems to present the group about 50 people, but after stopping music, it seems to be. Only about 8 people were left (and they still have to be locked in!). <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are not like it. Most of the members of the groups are weakly stupid attacks or just strange. No one cares about what really happens, and even supposed friends are forgotten when they are sent. The highlight of the film is the presence of a homeless person (seriously!) Who thinks he is a man of a homeless man. He really drew some fun lines without apparent reason. Unfortunately, although his presence can not keep the movie. <br /> <br /> People have too many scenes to walk and talk without any characterization. The characters spend about 65 minutes talking. The characters disappear for a long time without explanation. Like in other live DVD movies like CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time against each other, without attacking, without any provocation. There are many discussions (mostly from men), and almost a fight will arise. In fact, the format could be said as follows: the characters walk - the murder happens - the characters walk around - the murder occurs. You get an idea. <br /> <br /> The conversation is horrible and it seems that little lines are used without using the word f. Maybe that would be fun, but it's just dull. And more, of course, we've seen all this done a thousand times before (usually a much greater effect). <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no suspense in the movie. The dead are the characters to give only one danger. Loose Mania is around and, nevertheless, the characters play like all the dusk. They make little effort to find a weapon to protect themselves or to protect themselves. They seem no longer afraid of time. <br /> <br /> In MASSACRE DRIVE-IN mode, the murderer is not seen at the moment of murder (with it). except for the last murder that reveals the murderer's identity. Random weapons come out of nowhere to kill the victim's victim. Never seen anyone. DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the movie was fun (obviously unintentionally), but here it's not fun. <br /> <br /> And, as the other opinion says, the soundtrack has music. It's very bad, even for punk rock lovers. Complementaries see uncomfortable dance. Score (at the end, there is no music at the start!) It is made up of a group of Sugarbabe singing some songs that are totally unrelated to the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand the points. This review has been made. This reviewers like bad films (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE), such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH. But it seems CHOKE has tried harder to access one of these categories. And they also watch live DVD movies. This is a bad effort. <br /> <br /> In a positive note, the film has quite a few murders. But when the characters that are alive do not take a serious state of mind, these scenes will lose significance, as the intensity given goes away in oblivion. <br /> <br /> Fans of the 1980s, B-movie slashers, would have to take steps. this movie And classics like HALLOWEEN and Friday, the 13th, should do their best to avoid this.
