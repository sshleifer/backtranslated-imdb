Most of Stephen King's stories are small gems with original ideas that are not developed for a long time. It's basically lean and it means - it quickly installs in a poor number of pages, reads it, and you're done before you know it before you begin. McDonald's is like a potato casket equivalent. They taste very well and you know that there are many nutritional value (again: from a literary point of view, they do not say much about the universal human condition), but you're still scraping your scarfs, just do not get a pig and go extra Whats up and fill up too much fat ("too much fat" in King King's novel is a metaphor of prose when you are reading one of them and say it - just pop-cultural observations or Yankee aside with the light - follow the story!). He has collected four short stories collection . I have read all the things in NightShift, at the bottom of Everything's Eventual, and sometimes they show the efficiency to reach the point that is missing in their sized novels. <br /> <br /> But her stories are never welcomed ... this is due to the TV adaptations to Nightmares And Dreamscapes ... <br /> <br /> How in hell Did they (series producers) green 50-minute 50-page episodes usually turn on average average stories? I'll tell you how - two words - "Stephen King." The stories on his behalf were probably not cheap, and one hour allows the show to predict more than half an hour, so ... especially in 23 or 24 episodes, the length of the anthology should be doubled and the commercial time has doubled ... Ka- Ching <br /> <br /> I do not want to miss out on the plot of these stories - because you have read the review stories and / or saw the show. ; Here are just reactions to the TNT ... So far, up to four installments, here are ten percent evaluations (the worst thing to do): <br /> <br /> Battleground - It's not classical. , but why can we argue that William Hurt opens his trap without a single line of dialogue that filths this section? Trilogy of Terror, a reference and destruction of the Trilogy of Terror, was revealed to me by the producers (and was the son of Richard Matheson, TOTAL writer) because TOTALA knew his role. The act was deadly, at the same time, fun. It took a long time to get a Hurt apartment, but I think that's what he got. 8/10 <br /> <br /> The last case in Umney - This is what William H. Macy's performance has been like. I believe that the writer / Umney story in the private eye / Umney should have appeared beforehand as a true reality of the story, and anyone who knows King (probably half, was not a spectator) knew that Chandleres's setup had to stop the writer's reality, so let's move forward, and cut it hard and booze, already impressed by the private dick. When the writer's / Umney's family's tragedy began to appear, I developed the emotional connection of the show's vision (at least) to the audience, trying to usurp Macy's misfortunes with an exciting fictional creation. life. 6/10 <br /> <br /> The end of the entire message ... Uh, this title is how I felt about that passage when it was over. Twenty minutes later, I was ready to go to the TV - OK, we already do it, younger brother Mega Mensa Genius Prodigy Extraordinaire! As Ron Livingston talks to us about the camera ("time is running out for me" - it's not fast enough, I thought) that the senseless young man knows something really bad for humanity - we know that it was already built. an airplane, but could almost not kill a tree that could not escape; and while chemically labeling his chemistry labs, he chemically taught (the end of the world could not be conceived if only this child had more parenting supervision). It took a long time to set off Henry Thomas's goal, when we finally achieved the resolution of his discovery - how many worlds do we see - through unwanted stupidity the end of the world? "- a short video about a reporter who is beginning to film and give a brief opinion on the day of the trial. Oh, and brother's parents dance and sing old people. My point is that your story really is about" ending the whole mess (the world) " I've got the "mess" to rise because of the flames and crashes and sunburns. Speaking to talk about it. 2/10 <br /> <br /> Crouch End - This episode completely marked me. I lived in the hotel to meet a happy couple's exhibition I was able to play slap-and-tickle, have lunch and a taxi (that is, it was in the middle of the episode). Crouch End was glad that he entered the episode, but failed miserablely. Not only was it scary, almost horny It was a look-a kitty ... wait, it turns ... my god! Look at horror eyes! Uh-eh. At night, they can make a long journey to the Crouch End sequence, no matter what day. It may be a shame to see that when you watch the shadows make a terrible night. But the budget is not too high to make fake at night in London. On the page, this is a very horrifying story, a place for tourists to go through the streets and discover what might be awful. The only fear of this adaptation was directing and acting - they were really awful. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Series overall average (so far): 4/10
