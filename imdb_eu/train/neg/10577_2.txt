Some filmmakers taking part in this series have made some great films, but they probably do not show much skill. Especially in writing. Okay, the first season is a bit better, but it's just the smell of these emerging episodes. I am a fan of horror and, in my opinion, most of the episodes are garbage. Nothing new or really interesting. Some of them are visionary creators. Hollywood filth is often manufactured, interesting, childhood, misunderstood and in some cases slim. Tales from the Crypt is the only thing that offers this series nudity. Others, then, the series are working hard. Sometimes, I think they've hired an eighth distribution range to write sections. Maybe they did.
