The movie was not completely atrocious, but it was pretty bad. The performance was pretty good! jeffrey combs made a good job as a mad scientist, that is to say, if you do not know such things as his specialty: D. bill aside ... well, I'm not sure why it was in this movie. This sort of thing is very good, and its mission was not sharp. I rented the power of these two parties, and I was not really disappointed. I mean, sir, is a movie about a half-man / half shark. Shakespeare's people are not. Hailing a pitfall and a bad conversation, I would note that cinematography wanted a lot. Some shots were looking for "fresh", but the scene was dimmed or crisp just came out. They also knocked them off several times when they had a decent conversation and when they had cut off beforehand, he could deliver a line before the person. it was pretty bad. But if you're jeffrey combs, this is worth seeing. It gives great performance and makes everything possible for the character. It's not bad at all, and it's also female. Although heck I remember his name. The bottom line, I would not waste time at all.
