Among these films with at least 100 votes or more. Best Screenwriter Candidate on Screen? Brenda Blethyn is the star of the best actress? Appointed for Best Picture? I do not always agree with many Oscars, but this movie could be the worst movie of all times at the Academy Award. Writing and acting was awesome. Blethyn, in particular, I've ever seen was one of the worst, and probably the best performance of all time. The horrible film is not worth the big screen and it has never been worth a cable or television channel, including HBO (where I saw it). I'm only grateful I do not want to see one of the best films of all time.
