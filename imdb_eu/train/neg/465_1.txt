The other day when I was in the movie store, I spent Blonde and Blonder, but it seemed like something pretty like that. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people have bashed Romy and Michelle before they've seen it, Blonde and Blonder just might have been a secret to pass another treasure. But when I was seeing it, Pamela Anderson, executive producer, wow, knew that it was something terrifying. Not only were Pam Anderson and Denise Richards who did not offer them, but they did not grow older and I think they are more for women. It must be in the 20s, not the 40s. The story is just bad and bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> And Dee and Dawn are beyond the stereotypical portraits of your portrait, they really do not think about what's happening in the world. sad But when the girls kill murderers somehow, police have their story and girls call geniuses because of their "ignorant ignorance" attitudes. The guy has been created to make a "hit" and think they only "have fun", but the real murderer is marked and wants the case and kill the girls. > <br /> Denise and Pam are very confusing and almost read as the screenplay for almost a day. I know that it was supposed to be a stupid comedy, but it was more than a fool, it was not necessary because it was evil. Would I recommend this? For a million years, girls are trying to keep them as "sex kittens", this is a sign of despair, and Blonde and Blonder is a big blond BOMBshell. <br /> <br /> 1/10
