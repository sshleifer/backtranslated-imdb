This movie always left me with an impression. I saw in the new student's classroom at High School and only at home that night. I think that Robert Reed lost his respect as the actor's "Brady Bunch". I also thought that Chuck Connor's role was horrible and evil. However, this film has had a great impact on me now that I am a volunteer in female prisoners, trying to change biblical studies and church services and change women's lives at the same time. What fascinates me, so few people actually saw the movie. No one has ever seen my friend and my family is today's game, because they did not see it as I discussed it.
