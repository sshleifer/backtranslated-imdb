I tried to see this movie three times. I rented the night. Over a period of about 20 minutes a night break would be better if you wait. The next day I saw 15, almost stupid enough to be stupid ... There was no stupid movie, but it was a fun movie, but I would only infect this movie (I know what I mean by the censored world we live in. And finally, on the third day I saw more than a minute of silence and I did not enjoy a single moment! None. How was the script created green light? Oh boy! <br /> <br /> G <br /> <br /> <br / > 1/10 - One is for Cheerleader ... at least they deserve something tough for their hard work.
