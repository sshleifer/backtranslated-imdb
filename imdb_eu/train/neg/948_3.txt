I've seen this show several times, but for a show called "The 70s," I do not have much to decorate my hair and with some disk albums that remind you of the 70's, I grew up. Since most of the episodes I've seen, most of the landlords and jockeys have been set at any time They can be removed from the novelty set in the 70s and the show is not interesting or fun. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a show that represents American youths in the 70s, my low opinion is better than "The Wonder Years."
