In 1985, Howard Hesseman's governing committee conducted audits for the first non-networked television network. They try this programming, that is, acting as a series theater. On the one hand, I can name "skit" good movies, I do not use my finger. "Amazonas mujeres en el mundo", "Kentucky Fried Movie", "The Meaning of Life" and "Mr. Mike's Mondo Video". Do I not even mention the "Tunnel Vision"? That's why this "movie" is like death film. Skits are not even fun, or even less light. For part of the filmmakers it demands a great deal of ineptitude, not even a laugh. <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dody full Dorn frontal
