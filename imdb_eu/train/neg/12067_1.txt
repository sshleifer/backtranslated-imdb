You know the movie will not go well when John Carradine (a.k., a script and a synopsis of the graph) reads within 5 minutes of his funeral procession. The narrative is the last testament to his character. Its goods will be divided between 4 children and servants. The children will make a division of $ 136 million, but if there are those who will die will be distributed among others. If all children are killed, it is divided among the officials. To be entitled, they have to live in family affairs a week. It seems a typical plot of a reality show. <br /> <br /> There are few texts about Dean's character. The family is powerful and has a profound function, but the real problems begin with the dog's drowning. Through the opening of John Carradine, you expect to create the movie Machiavellian cat and mouse game. <br /> <br /> The trip is slow and boring. We travel around watching people sitting around, playing in the pool, throwing darts, using "fish bowls", incorrect use of film, dramatic dialogue between male silk leeks, fake circuit, musical circus, fake muscles and templates. Expressionism, fourth-degree horror and aesthetic overload. All of this leads to a pathway that is unexpectedly expected and disrespectful. You will be happy yet to be alive, but it can be too heavy to carry it. Share your children, share them. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
