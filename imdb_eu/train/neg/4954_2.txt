I was watching Batman's original animated series, and I'm avid collecting Batman's graphic novels. Along with the Batman comic book hero, there are certain features that can not be changed. Creativity freedoms are good and good, but when the character changes completely, it's too far. I bought one of "The Batman" seasons, I hope to add an additional bonus feature to the reasoning of the creators, hopefully to show it for that nature. In a conversation called "The Batman", an artist or writer (I do not know who he was) said "we should not feel like Batman, but we could mix with criminals." So, the Joker's attention was being made that they continue to become a child, to go to some Penguin anime, Mr. Supermarket frozen food, Poison Ivy joined a teenage hippie and many other shameful acts. Bob Kane rolled into his grave. <br /> <br /> Totally summarize: I'd like to show more hands, four MITCH for this show. Thanks to my rating, it's 10 to 10 because it uses Batman. Warning Bros ... think again! Please!
