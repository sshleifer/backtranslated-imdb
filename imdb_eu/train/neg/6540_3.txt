I can not believe so much in this film compared to Argento. His work is much more ingenious and wicked - and it's much more fun. <br /> <br /> The director only needs the ability to create real tension. The scene of murder - and that is accepted, this genre is all - is not interesting. It was not difficult to guess who was the murderer, and I did not like it when it was revealed. Cinematography is not memorable, and the 19th century I was not attracted to the Gothic Gothic style of the twentieth century. They are good actors (mostly head and overhead teachers); Very little is done. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is incest, sadomasochism and lesbianism, but there are few surprises, species or suspicions. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
