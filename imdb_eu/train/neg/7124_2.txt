A man will take his new wife home as a result of an "accident" as his former wife. His new wife is liberated from an organization and is very rich! Suddenly, he heard noises and began to see skulls all over the place. Is he dead again or his first wife returns to death? <br /> <br /> You have probably finished that end, so I do not write. I saw several times on Saturday afternoon the television baby. Then I liked it but I was young. Seeing now, I realize how bad it is. It has been horribly played, poorly written, very sad (even for an hour) and thrown away by BAT (one director)! However, it has good things. <br /> <br /> The music is terribly frightening and is very atmospheric about a nearby well and a giant house. There are also curious moments (I jumped a bit when I first saw the skull) and the end was effective. In the end, it's definitely not a good movie ... but it's not entirely a havoc. Little worship continues. I give it 2. <br /> <br /> Also, try avoiding the Elite DVD Drive version ("Giant Attack Leechers"). It has all the jumpers and scratches with the TERRIBLE shape. It's not too bad on TV too!
