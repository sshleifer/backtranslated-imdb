The bad one is not worth the mention of the animal or Eddie Murphy. This movie is just bland. <br /> <br /> Children's movie? Well, maybe you're trying to sleep. It's not 90 minutes of funny lipstick animation. Lip synchronization works brilliantly compared to old Godzilla films. Meanwhile, Eddie's "Pluto Nash" Murphy drones overwhelmed, it's a bad experience. Apparently, he's trying to change his old character, but what? In short, the magic and surprise of the original version of 1967 is re-imagined or lost. A town wants to encourage some forest creatures and wants to blame for doing bad things. No, really. And Pluton Nash uses psychedelia with them. Things are chained together with some joke, without any unexpected consequences. <br /> <br /> Rent a movie '67 Or some of Yogi Bear's old cartoons.
