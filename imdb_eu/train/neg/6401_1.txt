Can I not do it until I need glasses? At least it proves the point that a movie can make. Talent is not mind Those who sparked the misfortune of a lot of vomiting all over the world resemble talent, taste or intelligence. They are made up of children who play with labotimized and with their feces. Anyone else would be very wise in the world to go out of this movie. It is a set of sophisticated ribbons, where the punishment is not extended to the obvious. It ends in the shade. The jokes they tell are the meaning of all the terms used by elementary schoolboys (usually sick or sexual relations). You know, like father's car and mommy's garage. Applying more rigorous methods of criticism would be senseless, because the usual standards of acting, writing and direction never heard the creative "minds". Behind this mess It's not a decision, but those who enjoyed this movie should reflect on their purpose. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
