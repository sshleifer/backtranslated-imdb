Before the TV movie, I had quite a bit of hope. That was because it was given in the last section of the series and many of the original series disappeared. There are no presidents of Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember, in the second of the last section of the series, all the usual ones left B-5 permanently by Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley. Now, Garibaldi (the last B-5 movie that was not) was recovered to join Zack and the captain and make the doctor look brief and important. But, since there was so much in the old chemistry, this film is already in a state of disaster. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a Soul Hunter (Martin Sheen), directed to Babylon 5. An archaeologist (Ian McShane) was stolen from a warehouse hidden. There was a lot of frightening Mumbo-Jumbo, but it was quite absurd and absurd. Yes, yes, the station has been almost broken, but it has been saved, but everything has been said, but it was true that "I had done something like that and made something better in the past". <br /> <br /> In the second plot, for more relief of comics, it was much more interesting, since an entrepreneur installed a holo-prostitute and the authorities did not know what to do and when they tried to close, they were oppressed. with the lawsuit This was fluff, but he laughed - something else was probably dull. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Sheen must do a good job at the beginning, Must Hunter - with her wild eyes and extravagant delivery. However, he repeatedly fell into the whole episode. They should see and correct this. <br /> <br /> So, the final verdict is with B-5 B-5 raw nuts (for example). Others supposed that they could absorb the series, that is, it is a great injustice. This is an excellent example of a show to leave.
