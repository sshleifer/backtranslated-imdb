Dear god That was horrible. It's wrong, then that was not it. This movie does not make any sense. He crosses the map and it's not clear what he said. Music seems like Batman. 'Edison' is not a true city. Since I was living in Vancouver, watching this movie and knowing all of these places is unbearable. Why not become a true city? The only writing was "Tilman" and John Heard did a wonderful job. He was the only actor to play his role in realism and beyond. In fact, it was a shame for John Heard to play a bad guy with a long screen and have a movie wash. Bad. Fortunately, someone will see something important and, at least, he'll give credit to John Heard for credit, and he'll hire him again bad, that's where he should be. On the list.
