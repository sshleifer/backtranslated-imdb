I was hopefully involved in this film, it would be hype, understandable and exemplary. Undoubtedly more than a cheap promotion of the "Wilco" team <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Instead, the "process", an unfathomable portrayal of members of a group and, undoubtedly, We get a lot of moping on one's portrayal. who was the first woman to sing a singer and actress, who has been acknowledging the confessions of a friend of her dead for 18 years, saying "friendship has made her way" and how this story is unfocused. The label of the disk "hurt feelings", as it spills, the team can immediately get 50 tags from other tags (oh, tension ... no!). The best effort was that they tried to tension, but I think that all smoke and mirrors were not a tragedy that does not exist. This does not take into account the long stretches that most of their new songs are, without any decent story, acting or cinematography. I avoided emotional sinties or life-long views of life. <br /> <br /> From the film, this group does not have bad babies and they do not find a voice. Be and think about some of the kind of music art protector, which undoubtedly are not. And I thought it was sucking music, and I could not understand the style of the singer's marbles. <br /> <br /> I give it 2/10.
