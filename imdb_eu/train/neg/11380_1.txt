When I first watched Robotboy, it seemed cool and interesting to me, but then I realized that each time this show is trying to do what it's like to behave to yourself, good or bad. Sections can be previewed. And the main characters are not interesting. Once again, a smart boy is seen, his eldest brother, the parents of the child's parents and his friends: the girl and the boy. This show has no logic. A super modern robot that works with AA batteries, and can use a lot of weapons. But the main problem is the difference between activated and overwritten modes. We will see two different robots and denies the main idea of ​​the show: "Robot needs to learn how to behave in society"
