This movie was not ... everything: story, performance, surprise, intelligence and soul. Within fifteen minutes, I was looking at the screen, "How did all these boys play together and make friends (even without women)?" About another fifteen minutes, I asked Amanda Peet as much as possible. When a bad movie is silent, eye candy is nice. But it was not a big part of it! Fraudulent on all fronts!
