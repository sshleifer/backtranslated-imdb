When I saw this camera on TV, I was surprised. In May of 2008, I was in the Six Flags of New Jersey and it appeared in 4-D attraction (you know, the attraction attracts seating). I have seen that the version was short (15 min.) And, again, it was created to add motion effects. The movie was pretty ... but that was it. He was educated and told about the first role, but CGI seemed a little bit of a beam of space ... well ... admirable. I did not have a great deal of film addiction, but I would recommend this movie to inform their children about the funeral story of the moon's first moon. I will say that the character actors were well chosen and the characters themselves were very nice. So, all-in-all, I would say, if you want to bring younger children ... go. But if you want to take your children older, take them to another movie ... they will thank you.
