More than 100 films that I have seen so far are the worst French films. He is a great script and directs the middle / unprofessional. No matter what western French scene and can add a nice fancy music story. <br /> <br /> One of the main weaknesses of this film is that these two characters do NOT attract people, the audience does not care what happens. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that he won the Cannes Jury Prize for the film, I love almost all of the award-winning Cannes songs, but not this. Great disappointment for me.
