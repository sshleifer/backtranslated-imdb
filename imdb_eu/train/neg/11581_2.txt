Film is horrible. The plot (such) is completely unknown. (I think he does something with xantay, but I'm not entirely sure.) <br /> <br /> Half of the conversation is made up of unnecessary clich√©s. The other half shows out in different actors that words that are not incomprehensible in "southern" words (fortunately) can not be recognized. <br /> <br /> But the true tragedy of the movie is just a historical tale, as this historic tale, such as Mary Tyler Moore, apparently seemed to be very serious economic or personal circumstances. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
