Who loved the original story, there was a lot of hope (the films were mostly in conversation), I can see and what can I say? It was Total MESS! Direction is all over the place, the show was very strange, bright images and choreography were flat, empty and completely unnecessary (what is the general video game technique as fast and slow cheerful? It is not necessary to play this movie and vibes on MTV Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo music video, although some killers are quite fresh and savage, some are ridiculous, hilarious (the first murder of Japanese was the horny one and the death of Ted Raimi was fun). It is strained and nonsensical throughout the place, and it goes away from the original story, and then goes back from that point to feeling more confused. There is no explanation, I do not know at any rate what was happening as I read the story, but they did not even make people more confusing, sometimes even I know where he was and what he was trying to do o It was a full-time tangent. <br /> <br /> God, I really liked this movie because I love the love and story of Barker's work. a cracking movie, hello I also enjoyed some Kashmare movies as a fun romps, but I am just amazed at this film's amateurity and annoyance from start to finish, the whole thing was rushed and serious cut down the real fountain, becoming something else. Surely it was a gory and Vinnie Jones was bad, but everything else was disappointed all over the place. gutted
