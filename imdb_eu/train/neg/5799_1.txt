Yesterday I rented this movie especially because of the good looks of the art and the summary given in the back of the jacket. After appearing on my DVD player, I re-examined the cover of the jacket and, although I came up with the plastic cover, STILL could not read the details of the production details of the film. This movie is under the title Evil on the Jacket and has to go to the Faith Films website to find out about the link here. <br /> <br /> Movies and special effects were quite good. ... HOURS, the actor was reading. Oh, my dear ... this reader of the actor is like a secondary-school high-school jock, and he has changed his voice tone and does not try to read lines that read from script. Initially, I thought I was getting a bad drive on audio synchronization, and then I thought it was a foreign movie because I could not read the jacket because it was a duplicate in English. If they were able to duplicate the interview, this film could be decent. I was given a chance about 20 minutes, when I found out that the bad reader was not going to die, but the main one. Yes, it's bad! The cover art covers and the art made in the film are excellent, so they gave it a star, but 1,999,999 less stars for the dialog box. I do not recommend this one!
