Tenants Both writers fight for just one apartment to complete their books. Initially, they help each other, and then slowly begin to build a tension between them. <br /> <br /> This is based on a novel by Bernard Malamud and, unfortunately, everyone speaks like this one. The conversation is a bit natural, full of purple and tone. He wrote with his head at school as if he were an English university English. It's amazing, and soon I found out about what he wanted to say about movies, that is, it's a shame that the movie has great performances from scratch. Down to Snoop Dog is a lovely way, unfortunately, none of them can come from false words and premises. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this movie. Although not very bad, he is very preaching and daring to get away. I had the fight I had to get to the end of less than a third of the route I missed. If you are interested, I would like to try the cable, but I do not have to pay for the money.
