I have to admit that the bodies of the body above did not really look so bad, my mother wanted to see it, so I rented it. I saw it afresh and fear before my eyes, but that was not really bad. I expected a horrible film, but the writers did not cause any harm, but it seems like Eva Longoria (like Parker, sorry) is like a cast, it seems to be a little bit of a movie. In my opinion, I found it better to do it a bit, I feel bad. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry to make the movie a bit more enjoyable. But you have to admit, there was no point for this movie, it was one of those wages of this kind of actress. The movie would not have been more fun if someone really cared about it and better it. <br /> <br /> Henry lost his girlfriend, Kate, an ice sculptor killed on the wedding day. . But when her sister gets into a psychic, Ashley, Henry falls to her, but Kate goes out of the dead. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to move so quickly and make sure that Ashley does not torture her with her day and night rambles will make sure, believe me, with Kate's voice, that scary. <br /> <br /> The Dead Dead Over Over is a movie, sure it's worth it or not, but I'd like to see if you'd like to see it or if you're curious. Eva Longoria does not have enough star power for film making, so she's not guilty of being guilty of those who do not love her, it comes in a small screen on the silver screen. Without saying anything about Ashley's character, he's still pleased with her "gay" friend, Dan, she's still pleased with her. Even if the movie was overwritten and well-taken care of, the film might have been better, but the average romantic comedy will be made available, leaving it with the slightest feeling. <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
