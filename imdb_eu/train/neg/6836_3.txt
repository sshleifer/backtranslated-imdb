Please, in mood, do not let me see this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not think this movie is something right or not. I saw it in a friend's recommendation, and I literally stayed 1h and 48 minutes down the closet of my life. Poor performance, stupid directions, weak stories and action sequences - and if you get mixed up, you'll get a "Double Effect". There was no hope. <br /> <br /> I think I learned something - I never saw Van Damme's action movies. The mere loss of time!
