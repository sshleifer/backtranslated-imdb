Probably, I do not shake the movie, because I could not see it. Perhaps if I saw it in the theater, in the original presentation, I could estimate it, but it's very slow for me. <br /> <br /> I read the book 25 years ago and the plot details have been remembered. This did not help the movie, because there is less than life and light in the presentation of events. <br /> <br /> This is really a four-line movie, or a movie in four parts, and I thought it was a good idea. to watch over four nights in a theater presentation. Section I seemed pretty agreeable to me, but II. I did everything I could sit on the stretch. Reading Tolstoy's philosophies is one thing. If you get good translation or original reading, its bright writing will be greater than the rhythm of the story. In the film, however, it is difficult to reproduce without reflecting on it. <br /> <br /> I have other issues with the episodes in the movie I have seen. It's very bright, this camera's camera gives this beautiful look, instead of serving the story <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm missing something, but sections III and IV I just wanted to call it.
