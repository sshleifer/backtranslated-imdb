Calling the "House of the Dead" is not really a bad movie at all times. There are worse movies. I can see many of Hong Kong's ninja movies, which are basically the result of a Japanese-style drama-inspired ninjas movie that could eventually be called "a movie" technically. The dead is the worst movie I've ever seen in the theater. I got out of the middle of the road, I really felt noisy because it was about 45 minutes of this piece of garbage.
