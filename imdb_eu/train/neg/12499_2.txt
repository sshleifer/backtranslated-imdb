I went to the movie as a Austrian Sneak Preview. So I had no idea what I would do. The story is very normal. The movie is very long, I think it could have been cut off at 1/2 for no problem. It's kind of a movie that you can see during a frightened night! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is well. The film is talking about caregivers in the U.S., how they are prepared, their way of life, and the problems they face. There is not much effect on the film. So if you want to see it, then you do not have to lose money and spend time in the cinema. Having a more effective DVD when it comes to viewing at home would be more effective.
