This was the worst movie I saw in WorldFest and then received the least applause! I think they are receiving this recognition according to the number of well-known actors in the movie. It's good to see J.Beals, but for a few minutes there's only a movie. Actor M.Parker is better than the approved part. The rest of the plays is difficult because the film is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally absent, so seeing it is boring. The story is not a real emotional depth. The film about an actor who can not get the job is not very original for me. There is no police development. It's like one of the videos that I saw in the 90's ... And even in these standards it's not good. <br /> <br /> <br />
