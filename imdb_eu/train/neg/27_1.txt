Awesome movie Nuff Said <br /> <br /> These lines are filled. The movie was bad. Why do I have to expand? I do not know. This is my loss of time. I wanted to warn others. Avoid the movie. The play is sucked and the writing is just moronic. In every mistake The only thing about the movie is Deniz Akkaya breasts. Although this was ruined by a horrible scene. The piece of garbage film is completely incredible and incredibly incredible. <br /> <br /> I now agree with the 10 simple, more stupid rules on the IMDb. First of all, I'm seeing this waste. Then I feel obliged to warn others about the fact that I create an account with the IMDb I have to write an essay about the film I think I only believe it is bad. Utterly useless
