There is a kind of film that shows French nonsense about thrillers. The director's urge to "sound American" is so glittering that you will not deceive a minute, unless you have seen the series's killer movie. "Peeping Tom". <br /> <br /> Two male policemen (or a half, as you will see more), huge murders, plots of more complex complexes.

A violent and nonsensical consequence, followed by a silent epilogue that runs along the coast, is a really silent silence.
