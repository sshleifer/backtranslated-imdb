I recently bought the DVD, how many hats that hit me "A Chorus Line" movie. Attenborough director has failed to make changes to the story. <br /> <br /> When the director-Cassie relationship became so prominent, the main set of music groups left the window. <br /> <br /> Some musical numbers are moving faster. The success of the show's song removes all the sense of Cassie's character. <br /> <br /> The overall scene is very self-conscious. <br /> <br /> 2 I give only one reason Some of the great numbers can still enjoy the joy and spontaneity of the movie.
