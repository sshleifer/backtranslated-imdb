And that's all. This thing is slow. The actors have the capability, it seems motivated to carry out the effort. The plot is not so great and the intensity of the one mentioned increases. Accents are British. Uh, many of these people are Danes. OK, well, the accents are not so important. But it's the language. I do not think words like "yeah" and "OK" in Beowulfen's day. And that supposedly cool weapon given by his king? Did he ever reload this stuff? Have you ever seen? Or was Beowulf a bad goal? Well, his goal merged with the graphics used by at least monsters. They were just that. Special effects bad. Bright spot? I only think. Marina Sirtis has been well-off throughout the years.
