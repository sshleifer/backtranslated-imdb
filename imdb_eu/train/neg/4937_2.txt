This is a 30-minute joke. Cranksmiths, Cavemen are not treated quite well. Hahaha !!! It can not dial a cell phone because it is Caveman. Cavemen are not as intelligent as humans. Well, these deserted men are so scared. There's no humor in this show. So much joke can only survive and already with Geico ads. This show is not worth the time to put it internationally. <br /> <br /> This show tries to be fun, but it's not like that. When I saw this show, I thought I wanted to be like the "Bachelor Gone Wild Show." He goes to the bar and tries to sleep with many women. Weeping crying is annoying. Gunsmans have too much intelligence to be the wildest man (HAHAHA !!!). All three people have their personality, but I do not know why I do not care.
