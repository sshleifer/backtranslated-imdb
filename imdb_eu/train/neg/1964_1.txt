When I saw the cover of this movie, I thought it was the first time I made the video. The second movie "Darkness Falls" was similar to the horrible movie, that is, a story about the witch's death in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was a masterpiece on this pile of garbage, and this film was not to be done. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a little story of the witch's back, or two more entree tickets that will go to look for a tooth fairy. Shining bicycle will give them a bright glow. The inauguration is badly filmed, and like the rest of the film, it is definitely not scary. This time the movie is about Peter (Lochlyn Munroe). He rented Peter house, and Darcy's former wife (Chandra West) and his daughter, Cole, are here. She is in the neighborhood of the Cole neighborhood and talks about fairy-lips, and how you do not have to lose your teeth, or you'll be looking for her. Unfortunately, a few seconds later, Tooth Fairy seems to have stolen his bike and tooth (ironic). Will Cole will live over the beloved Tooth Fairy, and her mother and Peter will save her and revive their love ... this movie is bad, you can probably understand it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br They say they kill you if you lose your teeth, but not. It's like a killer in a row that dies, and if you lose your teeth, you'll definitely go. He stole a bicycle, so he is apparently a thief. I said earlier that the idea of ​​this movie was based on Darkness Falls, but where did they get the inspiration from the look of Tooth Fairy? Let's see. Burning seems to be a victim, and previously, the children around the neighborhood drove. Hmmm ... it's almost like Freddy Krueger removes him from the movie "Elm Street". And this is not the worst piece of terrible evil. This movie may have a culminle (it's not literally horny, it's more fun), I've never seen. Ignore this <br /> <br /> Just curiosities. Lochlyn Munroe was in the movie Scary Movie, and Jianna Ballard was a Scary Movie 3, both of which were; So, apparently Scary Movie stars have to end the horrifying movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 ****. 80 minutes. R for violence.
