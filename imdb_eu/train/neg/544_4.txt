PROS: Akshay Kumar's performance (is it just that I or always get this AB together in his films?). In the second part some tangible scenes. <br /> <br /> TOLER: 1st full hour (the jokes were flat). Rajpal Yadaven every scene. ABB full abilities. Leave this right, as it violently abolishes the soul of his son (surely, their relationship is not going to lose any solution), Akshay will finally take responsibility, in truth, what he thinks? WTF? Akshaye thinks it is too soft, because his old father will kill him for cancer, but does he think he can make an offense? Is logic the only one I can not see here? Easily the biggest mistake of the movie. <br /> <br /> - Akshay has become an actor. LMAO !! He finished the year at University and said we were a MBA graduate. But time has come to protect himself, and when his wife is pregnant, he becomes an actor. LOL !! What is it really to demand normal work in the water field? Or Heck, is it anywhere else in life? This is a very stupid writing. <br /> <br /> - End. I hate melodramatic evil. Everything is excited for the kidneys, and I was not able to. The whole thing reminded me of Srk (I hate too much) in Srk too. "Please feel the guy with the disease" this shit has made his career. I felt the sympathy of being older. It has not been possible to see the last 20 minutes, therefore, so it was faster. the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Waqt is very close to calling a good movie. Vipul Shah, a straightforward story story that directs the obvious story, was aimed at emotionally fragile and humble people who could not help but lessen. Give yourself some amazing songs, exquisite outfits, plenty of gyroscene-filled scenery and powerful stars, and hopefully make such a rubbish.
