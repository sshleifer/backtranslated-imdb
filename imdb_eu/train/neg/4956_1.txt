When this picture was first opened, it seemed to me at least halfway down, I was wrong. In those years, seeing this drawing is almost incredibly painful to watch Batman and Robin George Clooney. I saw some episodes and two of them Batman literally got his ass stepped on and hit the right Penguin that fought like Jet Li and crap out Batman and another section. Batman got his butt kicked again by Joker, apparently it was used by Jackie Chan in the air ninja turn like a. When did Joker or Penguin start Batman match? And worse still, Joker and Penguin Kung Fu were the likes of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's really embarrassing, dull and sad, depicting Batman's image depicted in this show. Animation is awesome and conversation is awesome. As a fan of Batman, I sincerely and strongly recommend from my childhood that I flee and avoid this show because it does not project the real image of Batman. This cartoon is similar to Kung Fu Flicken and if you want to see Batman's classic cartoon, Batman recommends an animated series, but this cartoon is S --- T! Get Batman: Animation series and do not waste your time with this cartoon.
