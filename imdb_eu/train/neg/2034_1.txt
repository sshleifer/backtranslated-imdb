Really, very bad. How is this movie bad? I continued to wait to get some plots, an interesting camera or at least some nudity, but I did not get anything. I just saw Cabin Fever and I thought it was a ruin of the train (except nudity and crepes), but it's a great look with that dreck. The best medical writers in the world could not save this wonderful little stick. <br /> <br /> The only thing about "cinema" is that it's over. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to make a headache and write something. Ugh! I'm glad I'm paying $ 5 and it'll end soon in the dumpster.
