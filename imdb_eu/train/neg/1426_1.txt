One question: why? First and foremost, the premise is not fun or a hobby. They use recorded interviews, and they take audios with animals that speak parts. First and foremost, conversations are not fun or entertaining to start, and if so, I'm sure they would be much more fun than originally seen, without making cartoons. How is this silence added? I went to the CBS Monday night sitcom line (it has become a regular way of relaxing after Monday after work). Of course, the sitcom would be like a line-up, however, as it was summer, but seeing these sections would be really fun. I tried to "CC". I really did But when it started, it would be fun. Laguia. And then he went. It was a half hour long. <br /> <br /> And I can almost see if there is a purpose, if the interviews have appeared completely and give them points. But no, it was just a single line clip, very cut and stuck. Cartoon Network "Robot Chicken" was an awesome version. I was not a fan of "Commercial Classics" called "The Class" by CBS. While it was on the way, it was half an hour after the hour I would fight. But if he decided to decide on a whole season of three different episodes of "beings", let's say I would take a "class". Since then, since it's been about a couple of hours since I was here, I came here to see you as the first comment ... I think it's a good sign that he did not see anyone and it will not last for much longer. The cartoon route.
