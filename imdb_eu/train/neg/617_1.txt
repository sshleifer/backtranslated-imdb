First of all, let me have a buddy who watched this movie: "He had to venture the whole movie, you know, such as" DUDE, YOU SAVE YOUR DURATION TO BE CINEMA ". With this film, they have made a great effort to achieve this title. The effects, of course, are poor. DRAWING / INTERVIEW B is like a bundle collage from all horror movies. Actors suppose I was in college. However, its parts (especially at the beginning) seem to suppose that they are in the middle or upper school. It does not make sense. In addition to killing the txorimaloak people, it is not very pleasant. (SPOILER: Finally, when they sing the name of Lester, they will reappear, and the Txorimalos laugh, probably the last scene and the delightful conversation.)
