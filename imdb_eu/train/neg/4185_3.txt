I give this movie 3, worse than worship movies worth 2. worth. Does it make sense for you? Well, it is not necessary. It's a vampire movie with a stupid colleague, do not let write, a very idiotic plot, where space cowboy (cowboy's hats) fight a spacial vampire spain in Spain. <br /> <br /> Does it get any worse than this? The good thing about this movie was Natassia Malthe, with the amazing beauty of his Norwegian. God, I want Michael Ironside and DeLuise brothers accept silent roles in silent films! I mean, at least it was SeaQuest! Mr. Ironside knows a lot of movies, he has made it to 164 films this time! It's true that very rarely it was an important role, but still!
