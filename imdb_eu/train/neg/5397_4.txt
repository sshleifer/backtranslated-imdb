I think this is the weakest among the works of Kenneth Branagh Shakespeare. Much after making great efforts like Ado About Nothing, I thought it was a poverty. The band was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???) but my main task was to get mixed up with Bard's work and cut some plays into the music / dance sequences. <br /> <br /> You only have to do Shakespeare after a theater like that. Sorry, but it's wrong. I love Cole Porter as the next person, but, of course, do not get confused with Shakespeare. Skip this and see "Prospero's Books", if you want to see a brilliant adaptation of Shakespeare's Tempest.
