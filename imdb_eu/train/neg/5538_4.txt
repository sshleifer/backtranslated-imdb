This is not really a zombie movie, as we define zombies as if walking around the dead. Here the protagonist, Armand Louque (played by a young Dean Jagger disbelief), is controlling a method of creating zombies, although his "method" is to carry out his thoughts burily and make other slave slaves hypnotized. . It's an interesting concept of a movie, and Fritz Lang's' Dr. Mabuse films, among others, 'Dr. Mabuse the Gambler '(1922) and' The Testament of Dr. Mabuse '(1933). Here, unfortunately, Claire Duvall wanted to retrieve the love of her first classmates (Anne Heche is the same as with a Dorothy Stone hairstyle), that is, the main theme. <br /> <br /> The film is intriguing, as Louque sends a military archaeological investigation to Cambodia, to end the zombie worship. In some compounds (where we get clothes and clothes in the 30s), Clairer announces his commitment and then, five minutes later, unknown to Clifford Greyson (Robert Noland) loved his love. It's not necessarily fun to talk about each other. This would be a great movie for "Mystery Science Theater 3000", if you had not already said anything. <br /> <br /> He never showed how Louque learns the secret "zoning", but then he uses to kill his enemies, to build a huge army army soldiers and body guards. John Agar's "Arous Planet (1957)" will not be seen. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Claire admits to marrying Greyson and returning to America. Louque agrees, but he really becomes a hypnotized slave. At nightfall, she realizes that Claire will begin to love, if she leaves "her powers". To achieve his love, he does this, which causes the rebellion of the title, to awaken all his slaves and to attack and kill his composer. Greyson embraces Claire and at the end of the parable it seems: "God would destroy them, they are angry." <br /> <br /> So, really, it's not a bad movie, currently with a low score score. In repeated displays (?) Works of art are visible on the script! Dean Jagger has become a good actor, and it is almost impossible in youth. Is her hair really? We recall more "White Christmas" (1954), "X The Unknown" (1956) and "Old Creed" (1958). The Halperin brothers play stories about White Zombie (1932). There, the unfortunate Robert Frazier (Charles Beaumont) uses 'zombification' to get Madge Bellamy's love (with Madeline Parker). . <br /> <br /> If you want real zombie movies (of which a hundred!), I would start 'White Zombie' (1932), 'King of the Zombies' (1941). Zombie '(1943),' Night of the Living Dead '(1968),' The Last Man on Earth '(1964) and its two remakes. During the classy film, "Horror Express" (1972), "The Serpent and the Rainbow" (1988), "28 Days Later" (2002) and its continuation, as well as many others. lots to mention <br /> <br /> This is not really a zombie movie. This movie is about itself, the trial is semi-Gothic. In this way, Universal is in the mid-thirties and under the B horror movies of the early 40's. So I gave it to 5.
