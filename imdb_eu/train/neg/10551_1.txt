Apparently, the Mutilation Man talks about a man who walks on the lands, makes himself mutilating shows, as a way of coping with childhood childhood. I use the 'Appearance' word, without listening to the commentator of Andy Copp (I did not have it with me) or I do not read the movie before watching it, the viewers do not think what it is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < , an experimental cinematographic house, which will find real works. An ugly imagination, awesome music and an incomprehensible dialogue with 82-minute ugly images. It's a huge drive to try out your health way: if you've got all your marble, you'll change that garbage and you'll see something decent (I've seen the whole thing, but I know that I'm totally scared!).
