I remember this for the first time when I saw 7 years old. I was a giant comic reader of that time, and everything about superheroes was hard. The final result, however, is not remarkable. <br /> <br /> "Emma Peel" I noticed the stories of Diana Prince, who had just finished and Diana was back in Amazonia. However, the action that most bored me in the movies was so small. The latest costume was an interesting idea, but it was like a superhero cheerleader. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie in recent years. He did not improve much. Cathy Lee Crosby was known, thanks to Incredible, but his performance was no better. The script had some good ideas, such as Amazon Grenades, and Ricardo Montalban's nasty wicked one, but he just came together and was still boring. The story was better and the show was more epic. Espionage was like a fog movie, crossed by a superhero story that someone who did not see a comic book. Amazonia's items were exciting, but they needed to be expanded. <br /> <br /> The film preferred the producer to return to the drawing board and get something more reliable. . Here the quote is pretty low here, and superheroes do not give cheap. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to have the movie available on DVD, even as a comparative and historical document. Superman 4 is also available and has no movie on it (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). Curiosity is worth seeing, as well as a little bit of inspiration and inspiration for future versions.
