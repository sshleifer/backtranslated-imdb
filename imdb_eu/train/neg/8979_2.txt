Jon Pertwee said: "It's very difficult to be stupid is very easy." PASTY FACES is the case if it's "very easy". David Baker (as a Director / Screenwriter) and his theater are a comedy LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING, as well as stealing the scene and style, using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping very quickly. very loud voice Alan McCaffrey, in particular, is suffering from OTT performance, but it's not enough to break the movie, because it's not enough to damage a movie. <br /> <br /> PASTY FACES is awesome on all fronts, especially scriptwise. I could not understand why it was over, it was very sharp and stupid. Oh, and other flaws are a clear visa to the United States and a green card to work on. You think this movie is going to take off an airplane and start a new life in America - you have to pay for your blood in America - people who know America and blood give me a free payment a few years ago - and any weapon in the gun shop type you can buy. I know that the laws of the United States are changing from one state to another, but the cupboard stores are not sold against anti-tank guns. So America's vision is very wrong because the film is very unreal and commonplace. Maybe Hollywood's revenge comes from BRAVEHEART with Scots in Scots? Perhaps, but this does not mean PASTY FACES being a comedy
