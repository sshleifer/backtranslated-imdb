I loved Dewaere at Series Noir. His talent is called "The Waltzers" on "Going Places". OK, they make some agreements in absurd and unknown ways. Many people find a fun attitude. The workout designed to disturb this was boring and useless. Blir's face, the back of my camera, I find it annoying. The series of Noir was a personal freedom and vigorous behavior. When Patric Dewaere discontinues the first moment of the tower, we will get an idea of ​​the beautiful, beautiful hero that we will spend in the next two hours. Depardieu's friend, who is watching over the evil middle-aged woman who is watching behind with the help of "Going Places," warns the rich that they will spend about two hours. I also had trouble with this problem mix "3".
