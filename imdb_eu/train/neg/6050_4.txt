I just can not believe that people compare this to the first movie. I wanted to leave a comment! The first attempt to make money in succeeding in the first movie is obvious. The dialogue is just as compelling as the horrible movie and original. <br /> <br /> The story is ridiculous, arriving at the portrait of the French police and far away from Doyle's first movie. br /> <br /> How much do you think of drug bosses? The ease with which Doyle finds his own is pathetic. Like all French police, they drank coffee, until Doyle emerged from America until he worked for the police. What a joke Try to travel to the foreign city and look for the largest places in your travel map and tourist brochures. Pathetic <br /> <br /> It's really crazy to keep track of what he thinks otherwise.
