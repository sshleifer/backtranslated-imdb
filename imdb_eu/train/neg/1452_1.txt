In 1919 and 1933 in Germany, the capital of the Czech Republic of the Second World War is hardly ever seen. Sorry, it's the Czech capital and in 2003 it's really fun. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most horrific movies in the nearest event. Röhm Adolf is bigger and looks so good that Göring is 40 years old and at the age of 23, "Führer" always seems to be 56. And the buildings, the people, even the buildings have been young, sometimes. Above all, in 1919, there were many houses in Germany (WWI was not in German cities!). No need to drain! Then Reichstagingenilding. It has never happened in the city center around this building. And all this seems like a miracle: in 1933, the Greater Berlin firefighters have a variety of motor vehicles, some of which also have a stepped staircase, but not a hand pump. <br /> <br /> The last thing: what kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was this last sequence? For me, it was a kind of "Adolf's Wonder in Wonderland."
