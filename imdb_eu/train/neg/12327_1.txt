A previous reviewer said that the movie is not very bad. What?!?!?! The film glorifies the child's annoyance. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked, so let's take 5 stars with 5 stars. Why not the whole 10? Because the film was "horrible", the baby's appearance was "realistic", and the strong friends were "angry". No review has been made by the reviewers in the review, and in 1981, American films showed scenes of a sex with an adult woman. When I was in a hotel in Showtime, I caught a steamed steamer that was in a hotel. For me, although a friend made a storm and he deserved an Oscar, I would still get a movie on a single star. While the feature film was featured on Howard Hessman's WKRP, it's particularly ridiculous. But do not take my word!
