I had to see at the school. And the summary ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is your time losing da. Do not watch the movie. Do not worry You're so desperate. My teacher said he was supposed to be good. What was wrong He gradually slept. They were the bad actors of the movie. The best actress was an old man, and that's not a big deal. A terrific plot with a horrible character. So I can say realistically and honestly that he did not. The script was sensitive and confusing. When I saw the movie points, I crushed and said: "What?" Likewise, loose links and holes were too much. It was totally horrible.
