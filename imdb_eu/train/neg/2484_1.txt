I still do not believe Wes Craven was in charge of this basket. This movie is worse than "Deadly Friend". This land is stupid, the play is faint and the movie is deadly. I do not know why Wes Craven has debuted "The Last House on the Left" with his first masterpiece and probably (probably) this turkey. I'm not wrong, I really like cinema, but I see sitting and feeling real. in this.
