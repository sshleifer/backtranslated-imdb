A boy dies by his mother and his father sees himself hanging out. Twenty years later, he gathered many friends to exorcise himself, so he would not appear as his father. All stock characters are in good standing: pair; the "fun" type; harsh (but sensitive) hood; intelligent girl (she wears glasses, we know as such); nerds and two blondes with no personality. Everything that involves a stupid wooden statue (do not ask) and kills people. I know I was having problems after a brilliant opening-day 20 years later - we jumped all horror films! <br /> <br /> The conversation is serious, acting bad (except Betsy) Palmer - why Betsy?) And the killings are stupid and / or unimaginative. My favorite scene is that two people think that they are sexually ill and that they put the statue to show that it is dressed when it's dressed. A horrible and horrific movie about a horrific and inconsistent reality. Avoid at all costs.
