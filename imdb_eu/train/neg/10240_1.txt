I love movies of all kinds, especially fear. That said, Survival has no such argument. <br /> <br /> I can not give you an originality point. The same is true of not revising or redoing other issues. Only indie has traveled through the woods, a killer attacker and a crazy family lately. In these lines I have to compare with the Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn (obviously that tour) and others. Survive against comparable films. The land was not original in any way. Some films will perform a very weak (and too much) rendered graph with excellent performance, special fx or many other factors. It does not have survival for this. If you wish, consider the following: The film was never started. I do not hit such actors, nor the director. Interview was a mild fashion, and the actors involved never showed (they did not say) talent to get out. I mention 2 photo citations. The protagonist of this film definitely looks like it, but I seriously think that he has to take more training before making a movie. He portrayed Greges as the actor also had a potential, but we never saw it (watch the movie why you do not believe it ...). <br /> <br /> Pikotxeko filmak. Well, the movie was a little magic of the movie designed to be filmed in "Grindhouse". In the current film, it has become. It works or not. In this case, it just does not work. Other mistakes are taking place, so the movie moves away and does not add. That said, I think they have done the supposed job. This is a good quality specimen. I think with another script, a better direction and maybe even an actress with a "Grindhouse" attempt to try. They will probably throw away. <br /> <br /> As regards technology, I think that, in my opinion, I did not stop at all. The audio that could be taken care of (the sounds that were directly included in the camera, but nothing wrong with that) and the DV movie, was very pleasing to my liking. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have to say about all this ...
