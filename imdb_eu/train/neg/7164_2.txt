This movie is deceiving more than ever, using a suspensful actor like Walken is just like playing in this piece of garbage, rather than acting like a boring role like that. And the movie is about to think about a witch, and you're almost never finished almost like that, but at the same time, you need to sit and watch the movie while trying to get this boring movie or try to get the meaning. You have to go through the whole point and the whole career of boring actors and actresses, thinking about how you have passed another movie and thinking about what you decided to do and just make the most of your money, it's just time to make a point full of nothing. I'd rather watch the cartoons. Leave this alone, please!
