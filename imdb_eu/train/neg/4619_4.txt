Tell me first about the Westerns and the Civil War stories. I also think John Ford is a great director. I also have great feelings about John Wayne and William Holden's play. <br /> <br /> I can not remember when I saw this movie coming out in 1959. The first time I saw it since last night. <br /> <br /> According to my rating, we can say that it did not like the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I will tell you some of its shortcomings. <br /> </ p> <p> John Lee Mahin wrote the screenplay of Harold Sinclair, a very handsome writer and wrote good writings. They refer to the terrific conditions of Andersonville prison, Andersonville was not in operation at the time of the film. They also use rifles that were not used at the time. <br /> <br /> John Ford directed more than 40-year-old movies and won 4 Oscars. This disease had to be done in doing so. He was missing his usual style. This may not have been in the Valley of the East and the East in Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> Almost all of his films used in the stock market. This time MOST was missing. This time, only small cowboys are on the lookout for Hoot Gibson and Ken Curtiss, and, of course, Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other familiar faces except three stars. (see below) Mr. The Fords company's most classical films were classics. unfortunately lost here. <br /> <br /> Now we will find the main characters of John Wayne and William Holden. The Duke was too bad, as it seemed to be here. Such a role usually adapts its style, it was appropriate here. Wiliam Holden did the best, but he was not as good as usual. <br /> <br /> There was an actress in this type of movie. Here is her first role (the second movie) Constance Towers, she is a very beautiful person, but she is not an actor, she still works on television. Be aware and say that it has been a long career, it looks more like a talented performer. In Caas, Ms. The Towers server is tennis star Althea Gibson. I'm glad I'm stuck to the tennis player. <br /> <br /> The rest of the production credits were far from the usual John Ford films. Some supposed military songs made by cavalry of the Navy, no good ones. Action scenes were good but came to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Scores * 1/2 * (4) 47 points (100) 4 IMDb 4 (from 10)
