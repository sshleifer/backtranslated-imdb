An interesting complement to the stem cycle in the horror genre of the 1980s. This was filmed as Pranks, but The Dorm That Dripped Blood was released as a movie, which is a 1970s horror anthology that stole The House That Dripped Blood. Daphne Zuniga cast is the only known face and this was his first horror movie (The Initiation and The Fly II also appeared).
