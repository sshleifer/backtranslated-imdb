Spike Lee's movies always liked me, but this was about 1/2 hours roughly the whole waste. I expected more about Son of Sam, so I got a movie that was unrelated to the 1977 series of murders. The speaker's dog was slow (you're in trouble, when all the patrons of the movie burst into a ridiculous way). The film seemed very upset and not very interesting. The sex scenes on the plot were absolutely irrelevant. I am not in film in front of sex, but some points should be (unless it's a XXX film). After all, we were very pleased with the effort of Spike Lee!
