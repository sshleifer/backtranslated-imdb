It's nice to see that the ally that is a really skilled director and versatile alliance, Andre Maria Toth, did not take this concept first. It is possible to explain the true potential, especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop. As the films stand out, in the opinion of Chipe, it is a mess. The main problem is direction, cheap budget and poor script. It is an excellent cast force and an interesting general concept: the characters that were thrown into conflicting forces in different directions. It was necessary that the view was sufficient to reconcile the positive elements from one's own point of view, when the script was rebuilt with its consistent integrity, that is a very serious disorder, replacing it (try motivations and play it together if possible). In addition, higher budgets could be contrasting locations and studio plans, and all locations appeared in the LA area. True shame lies in the remains of a brilliant job: Hayden, Taylor (before they were eliminated), Dehner, Reeves, James Millican, and William Bishop, before his own death. A few movies show the importance of visual self-image more than the dark western shelf, it could be much more in the hands of the right hand.
