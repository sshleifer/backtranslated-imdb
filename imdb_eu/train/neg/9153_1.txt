I have never reviewed before being published, but I had to do it for this movie! This movie is a very bad thing, I try to justify trying to try it as a kitsch or parody. But it is not. Actually, it's not self-conscious. BAD. It's a serious attempt to be glorious. Other reviewers have stressed a lot of movie mistakes, so I do not try to repeat it, but I ask you to see this movie. I was talking all over the world, I literally got bored or fainted on the ground in the Hysteria. Seeing a movie for a long time has not been so much fun. In fact, it's a movie to be shared by all my friends. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: - When Arthur is going to listen to him instead of going out -Equery (incredible dance) - free nudity (director / main actor had to shoot nude) - preacher's office with cardboard and cardboard of Christ. Of course, the famous wedding palms and neglected rings (which is this narrative function?!?) Scene. Wife's wife's fight, to convince Ben with his gun. The exact sequence that Arthure preaches dies; It seems like he smokes the game very shamelessly - Yes, his gay brother-in-law brother with his shiny hair and WeHo fashion - And, my favorite, Joplin's "The Entertainer" as a soundtrack and "Pachebel's Canon." D Major "close as a soundtrack - list goes on and continues - A MUST SEE !!!
