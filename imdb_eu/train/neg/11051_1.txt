Because the Canadian film actors seem so self-conscious, their performances are very melodramatic and quite unforgettable, they have a huge Canadian actor. <br /> <br /> This movie is poorly written. incorrectly edited and corrected. Separate, incomprehensible and curious, but not in a good way. McDowell does a great job with the one provided. However, this movie is unique: it has bad stories and scripts to really work on. It's not a fun campaign to be fun. <br /> <br /> I still have to see the credible behavior of Van Pelleske, as well as sub-characters like Eisen (with his nose and noisy voice) confirming that he did not have to do it on top of any of the African barge in Toronto. <br /> <br /> Did not the director see the "alien" dressed up as a jazz dancer? Blue lightning and Pelleske's "magic" (!!!), A fierce fight against orange sarkot, is a result of a bad choreographer without any special effects. Has the director been bad for this film or in the editing room (not good)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... do not waste your time with that, I will regret it as I did. I did not say anything more about the cellulose waste.
