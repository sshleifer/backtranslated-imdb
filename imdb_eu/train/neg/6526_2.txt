Film is incredibly inept and dull, in which the characters are placed in the room or rocket aboard and constantly talk. It is possible that when Mars explores things that would rise, these scenes are shot through a heavy red / orange filter that is completely dark. Mars landscape / vegetation is mostly made with drawings and monsters are not very sure. The heroine of the "Bride Of The Monster" echoes that the octopus gradually shakes the octopus, as if he lost a ruddy bone like a flesh around the flesh, Ed Wood is a hundred times more entertaining. The headset to be better off will see otherwise the science fiction music scores, when they are repeated repeatedly, will make you mad. If you can not sleep one night, slide your camera into the player and your insomnia will not fit well.
