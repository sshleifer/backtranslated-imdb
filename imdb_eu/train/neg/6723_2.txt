Charlotte's deadly beauty and deadly shots become cooler than otherwise. The story is so bad, and Charlotte's character is so absurd that it is dying, if you wonder what the film was about at the end. Someone can say that an alternative ending exists, but I'm afraid it's not. Regarding the rest of the countries, I would like to say that they did not act very well; Although the guilt has to be inadequate. This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2, where Zhang Ziyi dies absurd, because it has been the only stolen show on the whole movie. I'll give this movie 2/5
