What has become our dear Ramu? Is it the same man as Sarkar, Satya and Comapny? So I do not believe it. AAG Ramu has been an ambitious project, it has clearly jumped the cliff up and has risen in the industry by providing some of the greatest works of all time. The movie falls into brick mode. I had to leave the theater, but I did not have to sit down before leaving the car park to others. Otherwise, I could not get anything beyond me. <br /> <br /> The movie is in no place at Sholay. It's not close, a mile. I believe Ramu surely loves Padru rather than Sholay, because Sarkar's work was a classic. Ramu's conversation I read a few days before. In it, the interviewer has said that Ramu has not been sleeping for more than 4 hours, too much. Now I totally agree now that he is missing out on his sleep because he has probably taken the movie. <br /> <br /> There is no power in performance. Amitabh Bachchan does not look awful too. Later, I've seen some posters and wallpapers that I've seen a bit more frightening. Ramu's favorite Nisha Kothari made Sarkar's great work, because he did not have many conversations (indeed, if I did not remember her). He opened it in the mouth in this movie and found a place in history. The man who plays Jai's role looks like a rude figure, but he did not get Jai's role. I can not ... Sorry ... my pain is too big to handle right now. <br /> <br /> I ordered the whole movie to see that Sholay's originals will see again I just saw it again. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: horrible movie. The media and critics cook Raman's goose. And to remind all readers, Ramu is one of the greatest fans, and I can not even serve this event anymore.
