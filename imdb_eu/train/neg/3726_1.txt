I had to watch a very young movie that was very small and they told me they were real. Talk about child abuse. I would be less afraid of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only good for those who believe in ridicule and their children to enjoy themselves. In addition to obvious topics related to brain cleansing and doctrine, bad performance, bad writing and "special effects" are also present. Film is horrible and horrible. Yes, credible (and horrible) for a child, but I can not imagine entering this basket of older age. Even today, I must say, I'd like to see it as an adult. They could have some midnight / worship movie.
