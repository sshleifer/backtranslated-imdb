Not all the merits of the movie are taken into account. As others say, the film shows Arab speakers in Iran, more than the Persians. That's enough to lose credibility for anyone with the least knowledge of the area or country. The landscape can not be different from the real one. <br /> <br /> Other factors failures: A train is operating in Afghanistan, because Afghanistan does not have railways. The Turkish ambassador will wear Fez (red cape), but Fez has forbidden Turkey for a long time before the movie. The Indian daughter of the Turkish ambassador is dressed in Indian, and Indian classical music plays on the back in many scenes. The filmmakers aimed at exhibiting an exotic woman decided to decide whether they would be exotic.
