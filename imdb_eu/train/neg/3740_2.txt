Immediately, this movie was ridiculous. Is not it an unfavorable aspect? For example, the best of this film was the beautiful landscapes. Those who do not live on the east coast should know that mountains are not beautiful western ones in the south. I learned that it was the right corner of Utah, but Dalton might not have taken the English accent because they said they should have been remanded as a southern country. Its accent to the south was easier. Surely the movie plays the plot, but it was a sensible place in the past. It is not Utah that it does not use any method ... so I think why writers were planning to stay in the South. <br /> <br /> I also take into account another action photo. Why do they always make a "cocking" sound effect when the character gets an automatic gun? All the sound effects of this movie were "chuk-chich", indicating that 9mm was ready to charge and burn. Of course, the weapons were already shifts, so it was not necessary. <br /> <br /> Finally, pyrotechnics were at the top of the WAY. But, in any case, I suppose this film was "aimed at a market segment" ... it's bad. It can be played by every actor, but it's not that movie.
