... in the spirit of this comedy. Fully reaching lengthy lengths, "Can I Do It ..." Till I Need Glasses, includes jokes (most) dirty. Many of them are so short, you can not believe that this is an alleged punishment (for example: Santa Claus gag); Others are so long, you can not believe that you spend so much time in it (for example: student awards). And almost all are directed without artwork. I'm not wrong: 10 jokes are fun (iron / phone is probably my favorite). There is also a wonderful forehead, that is, the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing about this planet (especially male nudity). And I agree with others that the deliberate stupid song of the title is really brilliant! But one of these reasons is not enough to give more than 4 of these films.
