So, this country I wanted to believe in this movie is the statues and slapstick. <br /> <br /> Of course, one way to go - let cool and edgy - and it came out. to show on the other side. I have a small bet for that bet. I know what SL has done. <br /> <br /> No one of the main characters ever comes up with comedy chops. Even Danny K has a better time. I'm really serious. When I entered the character a little, I continued to think: "Darn, this person should be the boss!". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The black-and-white does not do anything for this movie - the blurry conversation makes it even more painful, even more so with boredom. Black was not crisp too. The composition was horrible. The use of music was horrible. I was surprised to see this film and its great composition, Little Miss Sunshine. That's why I think there are errors in this movie. <br /> <br /> I think Corne (more fun than the head). even before he said anything) he was talking about this movie and not David - you can see and understand. The boys who were playing opponents were terrified. It will not happen that would happen there. I got the feeling I could have shot in someone else's back garden. With these "comics" I get to know conversations with much more fun, brave, and more rigorous guys. Those who came to the finish line were welcomed. <br /> <br /> Guess SA will stay in a comedy stone for a long time. Nice job
