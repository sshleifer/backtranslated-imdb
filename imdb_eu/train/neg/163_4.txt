The first part of the film was quite fun, but it was, at last, crazy. Although Turturro is generally a favorite actor, his Luzhin looks like a bad impression on Rain Man and his portrait of Genius was a semi-autistic man. In general, it seems that it is a hard film and tries to make the most of it.
