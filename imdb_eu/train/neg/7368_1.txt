I was sorry to buy a new SS movie for 10 films on the DVD: Attack Force. Now, in my opinion, I can still watch movies that are like this movie. A bit of salt and a few darker nights on the couch, I'm watching a buzzing late afternoon, it's a perfect alpha for me. I thought I'd buy cool martial arts I bought this movie. <br /> <br /> I made hell. Segal is old and yellow, plots also became a fun standard for the SS, and sealing Segal's behavior (as it began at the beginning) is sensational. It was so severe that a man who said that no half of his voice was anything like that. SS did not have any effect (a boy) because the crew was so scary that they could not record. The voice of Whisper Segal and the voice that makes the Honda announcer voice move! <br /> <br /> Arguments are not the problem because most movie stars work on the same premise as this. nothing new A common mix of characters that are devoid of cannons and stereotyped beasts. <br /> <br /> Do not get this film in front of a high-speed train or avoid the dose of a H5N1 bird. flu <br /> <br /> Delete garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> This was a public health warning.
