I saw this clear Schlock party in a video store. And for the first time before I got my first video player, I'd be baptized with this gem and it's one of the best films! <br /> <br /> The conversation is unnoticed most horny. And it has a camera with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn inexplicably. And it seems Christopher Walken seems to want to star in all the bad films in recent years. This movie is by Mr. Quinnen Country Bears. <br /> <br /> Has the following lines: "Turn off and stop WISH!" <br /> <br /> And "you are saying a lot to sh_it!" <br /> <br /> And a priceless return: "Unfortunately, sh_it, it's hard to be angry!" <br /> <br /> You will see a fight scene Bo plays a SOMMERSAULT on a billiard table. ! And it's a good kick kung-shot from the shot! Tune up with action and T and A emotions! <br /> <br /> What Schlock filmmakers can ask for more? Oh, and when Quinn's character becomes suicide and asks him to return to Bo as a ghost, why does he kill himself, but rather he confronts his debilitating illness? He said: "Real men do not eat any quiche." <br /> <br /> Aaa, aaa, yes. If it was a good cookie, it would require an exorcist!
