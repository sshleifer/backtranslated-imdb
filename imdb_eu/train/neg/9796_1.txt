Okay, I'm not serious about thinking something worse about the PR series. There are many bad things in life ... treason, lies, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers must be under this list. Five or six teenagers (who do not play as adolescent giants) do you think they're stupid, dancing in the same dance, COLORING, DRAWING? Has the fans met a real person against a mental wall and is almost immediately lifted and continues fighting without injury? Power Rangers are for five-year-old boys and, I believe, I never liked this show when I was five years old. <br /> <br /> You can say that Dino Thunder is an exception. Teens act as teens, and teaches Tommy Oliver as a teacher or not. He got a teenager's mood, even though he battles ironically, I do not hate Dino Thunder. <br /> <br /> Many people say that Power Rangers is rough, but I would not. It would be wrong to attack. So face up, five-year-old boys, is Power Rangers rubbish.
