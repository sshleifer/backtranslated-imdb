Although they do not know that Sellers was in bad health of shooting and before publishing the film, THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. Seeing FU MANCHU would be painful. It is believed to be a lamp from the famous villain of Sax Rohmer, but he has no focus. Explanation The ability of satirical comments about anthropological concepts in Rohmer is ignored. In fact, the film uses rational humiliation. There are almost no jokes or gags, most of which are actors that are totally invisible and emit sad lines. Especially disturbing is that Sid Caesar's silent forgiveness and a great laugh of rumors are forced. Most other actors are ashamed too. <br /> <br /> And then it's Peter Sellers. Fu Manchu, a wicked man whose role as a young man is trying to figure out a formula for recovering the British enemy Nayland Smith. The seller is not a bad one hundred percent; Smithe gives her warmth while she speaks of her fetishist shopping with Smith's crotch, and moves away as annoying as Manchu when she tells the love of the English music hall. Most of the time, however, plays two roles sadly and sadly, thus sabotaging all the comical options. The customs that abolish the electrical supply of Sellers are particularly nervous; It seemed more fun to be fun. <br /> <br /> Truly extravagant lines, by Burt Kwouk (in Cato PINK PANTHER) are extravagant, and as Manchu's generosity, and Helen Mirren's fun music can not be a rescue. If Peter Sellers wants to understand why he plays comedy, THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR will not learn anything. FU MANCHU.
