One of the pillars of low-budget cinema is to take on a well-known and classic storyline and to integrate it completely. Mall Mallorra is no exception to this rule. The scriptwriter Opera takes on a permanent fantasy story and leads it to a commercial establishment in the 80's. However, the purpose of "Phantom's" is now just a show of vengeance for those who kill his family and those who kill his family. Special effects give good chili, especially when parts of the body appear in yogurt columns. Pauly Shore has a small role, because he does not expect any hope, especially because his fifteen-minute MTV reputation has not yet reached. If you are looking for good laughs at the cost of actors and special effects crew, look at this movie. Otherwise, continue looking for something else.
