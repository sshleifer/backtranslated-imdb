Now I do not hate cheaper movies. I do not know why you should waste your money so you can shoot with your father's camera. If I rent a movie, I want to be a FILM, and do not think about people that it would be a good idea for some MiniDVs - wasting the tapes. <br /> <br /> Maybe I hate this because it's so much. He said he was a guy at the video store and that was not it. Maybe I hate it because it's cheap, PLACE plot has EVER, EVER realistic characters and EVER's film history really really really reveal. Although Tom Savini can not save it. <br /> <br /> Really, this is a waste of time.
