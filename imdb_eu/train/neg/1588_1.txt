Billy Zane is the worst movie I've ever seen. I understand that this movie was a pretty good starter for beginners, but in general, the movie was not compelling. > With all the archery, you think the police would intervene. Although Sean was a coin fool. It was suddenly a mistake when you realize the mistake was not realistic. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be fast-paced. Bad work Get a better writer. <br /> <br /> The ending count was nothing synchronizing. He struggled more time. And it was a coincidence that whenever Billy would explode on Sean he would be out of the bullet. I can believe it once, but not twice. <br /> <br /> Actually, Billy's character was strange. So stupid when Sean finally dug. It was like a comedy. Bad Bad Bad
