The worst movie I've ever seen. I got bored so I changed the way to see the news. When I got up again, I slept. The film begins with a dream, it continues with a dream and ends with a dream. Then there are more dreams. Come on, what will it interest me? A movie must be an interesting reason. When you felt that the movie was just like a dream, the sensitive filmmaker is deactivated at any time. Have you ever been to telling a dreams and what does it mean? This is !!! <br /> <br /> Totally frightening.
