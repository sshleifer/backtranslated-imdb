Beaudray Demerille (Peter Fonda Malle, also director), an old-fashioned playwright, won the young Wanda "Nevada" (a nice and talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. Together, a difficult pair (of course) will start in the Indian gold search in the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> That's the story and it's not really that you're looking for a deeper meaning. It's just there. The theater is very weak, it was surprising that it was led by Peter Fonda. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something interesting in this movie, look at the beautiful landscape. and a good look at a young Brooke Shields. However, his character is so angry (especially in the beginning) and silent, never getting beautiful or attractive. But bad, given the story, I can feel more about it. Why did he direct and star Peter Fonda? Even though his father (Henry Fonda) had to speak (unnecessarily) a camera in this hilarious mess. Unfortunately, their only movie was. Could it not be like Henry to be EASY RIDER? 3/10
