What a horrible movie! For some reason, scientific and predecessor laboratories are always bad, dirty, mischievous and misanthropic workers. Those who work together in difficult scientific projects can not accept death in the hands of a CGI Dragon. Spoilers: a very evil scientist and his main performance is "leering" and cloned the "cunning eyes" dragon. While the Laboratory thought that they worked on such things, other scientists were amazed, they were apparently absent from the experiments they had left behind and their pants were caught. The rest of the story is like THE THING or Ten Little Indians. In which workers are hunted and killed, they try to formulate a way to escape and / or defeat the "Dragon". CGI Dragon is a dark gray creature, and it seems that CGI is a popular color for most special effects. They look better than cartoons and dark gray tones make it difficult to see the details of the Dragon body. It seems gray that everything is gray. The play is horrible. Scientists do not like children who do not have consensus, which facilitates Dragon's efforts to escape, hide, etc. Dean Cain is hardly any better than any other actress. this movie It seems to fit into its assistant cast level. This movie really is really daunting. The play is bad. The story is silent. CGI is very cheap and amateur. It's not beneficial about this movie, it's not a good time killer to see works and other works.
