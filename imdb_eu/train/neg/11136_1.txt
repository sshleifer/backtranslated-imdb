I felt enough to comment on a movie imdb. For the first time I've probably had a better movie I've ever seen, which was for Memento. <br /> <br /> Darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento. he saw the misfortune In addition to two scenes with bare women, there is nothing in the movie to lift it from the trash. <br /> <br /> Let's take a look, the simple effects, the regular script, the play and about 90 minutes. long My wife and I laughed as bad as it was. It's amazing that I saw it at the end, how I did not know! Avoid !!!
