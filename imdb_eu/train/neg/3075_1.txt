Yes ... this is definitely the worst MSTifyed movie, but I've definitely found it worse. Think Gremlins Rate R. Well, I met Rick Sloane in a science-fiction convention, surprisingly, he was teaching! It was one of these low-budget conventions, when everything goes, everyone brought something (if you want to see crap, see what some friends and I had brought). <br /> <br /> He seemed very pleasing to him, he was very happy about my questions and comments about Hobgoblins, and he even told me not to take it seriously, and he said he loved the MST3K version! <br /> <br /> With everything, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think that it was directed to evils like Mars Attacks. That's why I'm going to stand up for this movie and I'll give it to 5th and betray all my MST classmates. Sorry.
