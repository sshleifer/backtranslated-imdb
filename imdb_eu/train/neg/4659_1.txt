This movie is a film waste. Do you think that the map of a military mission plan would be to lay a yard in a day-to-day daylight in a yard to see a binocular camera or a zoomed camera? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that a DEAF person would enter into an active European obligation to serve as a "Black" unit during the Second World War ... cooking, supply services, burial details, etc.? It happened in this movie. Do you think that a black (and supposedly intelligent) official would be selected DEAF K.P. An active battle to take part in the mission to take a dam before the Germans are being destroyed before the allies arrive? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised if DEAF's soldiers did not notice that a German aircraft was coming up and would undo it and kill it? It happened in this movie. Would you have been surprised to see the German soldiers coming to a 50-meter American soldier from a group of farms in a country farmhouse that happened to them? They were made in this film and left in the Germans' entrances to verify the Germans completely defenseless. Did you believe that the captain, on the waves and in English, said that the captain had generally referred to his character, not his name, as a person speaking, and that he was open in English in the air, said he needed a dam. Do you need to protect yourself the next day? Perhaps they should send an emitter to find out where the American attacks were, in order to make it easier for the Germans. The so-called "Movie" will find 50 worst films. If so, I'm sure he would do well. Look at your care.
