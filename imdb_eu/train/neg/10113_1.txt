I rented this movie out of the boat. The area in front of the DVD looks cool and terrifying. then the movie and women are raccoon masks. zero special effects ... and even the fight scenes you can see missed punches 2 feet. It's a funny thing, Lommel's short film, and worse than the movie's other actors. I think that Lommel tries to make a bad movie that says "classical worship" ... However, I can not imagine now that this film is just a bad movie than ever. made This movie is terribly frightening about how bad it is. I was ashamed to rent it and I never saw another Lommel again!
