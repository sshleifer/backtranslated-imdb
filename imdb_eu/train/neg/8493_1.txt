After seeing the concept of Ada a few days, I'm still looking at it, any group of people would spend so much time in making such a great movie. <br /> <br /> No one watches the movie as a result of learning something. About Ada Lovelock, about her colleagues or her efforts. <br /> <br /> Nor does anyone have to watch this movie to be entertained. <br /> <br /> This science-fiction movie would undoubtedly be a huge failure. In some ways, the main character brings and interacts with the past life on his personal computer - with Timothy Leary's advice and strong words. I doubt that no-one could explode enough to make sure this was absurd. <br /> <br /> As a drama, this would undoubtedly be a huge failure. In a way, the writer / director will fill the drama for eighty-five minutes, basically nothing constant, unnecessary and boring drama. I definitely do not feel anybody's feeling that all the drama of the movie is only an irritable distraction. <br /> <br /> I find it difficult to express my own mistrust to get the Ada concept. The circumstances were banished from theater, but I did not question it otherwise. I'm still angry, I lost time to see it. I'm more articulate to be able to criticize this movie more efficiently.
