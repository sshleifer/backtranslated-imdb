This film "Joshua" is very disturbing and does not make sense. Actually, I was afraid to think of those who enjoy watching people. Regardless of the story, the young man is referring to his reaction to the emergence of his sister, which is just an ice tip. Throughout this film, the audience suffers from some of the most worrying uterine behaviors. Adding an injury to the injury, at the end of this film, there is no real except for the real result, which provided at least one children's group of infirm children. There is no confirmation, there is no justification, and adults do not have enough intelligence to see what happens around them. To be honest, I did not watch the movie. It was very disturbing. Even for those who enjoy horror movies, this movie might be too much. Although this movie worked well, the story is so disturbing that the dentist's waiting room looks like a 90-minute wait and a painful toothache procedure.
