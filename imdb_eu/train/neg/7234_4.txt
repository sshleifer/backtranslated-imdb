In a single word: shameless. After reading the article about the philosophical meanings of this film, I was just sitting 115 minutes in the minute of the film's incident and stepping slowly on its giant symbolism and slip oppressiveness, it seemed to be better for my reactions to the movie. After all, who will go to a movie with a learning program? And this film was not bad at all. The director of the actress Claude Layu, when the film's end is open, wears a weary and annoying mask of agony that is almost impossible to make with the constant and sad voice of the film. Shooting on one another would have better work for both listeners, because they say the same thing: the Ambricourt priest is a wicked man. The story of a persecuted priest who tries to help a wealthy family does not have stories that are far from interesting or enjoyable to the characters, as unpleasant families as strange creatures, and the priest finds himself as a nasal pest. . In the last 30 minutes, we suggest some suggestive messages about grace and a man's suffering, but due to the suffering of Lay and the subtle subtlety of Robert Bresson's script, all I felt was eventually over, we're going to go ice cream. Interesting to Bresson fans of fanatic Paul Schrader, just how many characters and Schrader had to see various elements in their scripts and movies, especially "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
