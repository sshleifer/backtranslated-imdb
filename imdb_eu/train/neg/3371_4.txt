At least a rich and crisp location photography is at least a foolish and nonsensical potboiler, but it's compelling to create a lot of voltage mode. I waited a bit because Stanwyck hoped he would not have time to go back in time, that he was really wet, that he was a husband, in many ways, and a child idiot ... why did not I get away with Meeker? But the remarkable question is ... what kind of wood was it made if the broken pieces were removed from the legs? Stanwyck, always the best professional, makes the best possible material, but it's wrong.
