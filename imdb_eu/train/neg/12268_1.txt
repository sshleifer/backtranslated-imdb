I have seen four other Japanese horror movies four and they were not very impressive. However, I would feel a sensible script. The path is not here. This is a detective trying to connect similar killings that are taking place. When he finds a suspicious question, the suspects make an incredible insult because they continue to see a ghost. Then the ghost begins to run behind the ghost. The reason is never explained. PLEASE MAKE CINEMA FOR MORE. <br /> <br /> Enough? Oh no. The film continues to change the point of view of different characters that have nothing to do with the story. I have seen in other previous films wherever it shows a different perspective. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> In addition, what's really happening on the screen ends quickly. For example, a few scenes instrumental score a bit and ... then just cut another scene. I know that this can be a great influence. That is definitely not the intention here. It's just a bad edition. <br /> <br /> In the end, the "ghost" is in a frightening or involuntarily funny way. It's annoying and a lot happens throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> All scams have been done in a better way, so you can see all that's coming. Then, after one of them, the movie is over. At that moment, as the wave of confusion passed over the viewers, I felt the time we all wasted. Someone joked and laughter followed. It was better than the whole movie. Simply put, avoid it.
