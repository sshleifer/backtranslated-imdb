After watching it well, I can say that the worst film ever made, although worse than this, there are some good points for the movies, you will see dreadful teenagers, they have a huge death. and it looks pretty rats eating some science experiments, and getting grotesquely giant, the drunkard, the doctor, and both the girls thong underwear absolutely not embarrassing, mutual jocks, I can not personally wait for the drunk duck with these stupid drunk in the afternoon evening I was. It was a good premise, the first part of the movie was interesting with a scientific study about rats, and a little back story, but I think that when the dead teenage boys are spoiled, I think the rat, the one that is lost, the name Brenda is so fake, The CGI had to be the mouse, it was like a guy who was dressed in a sticky suit, this was quite schlocky, lame but not terribly frightening,
