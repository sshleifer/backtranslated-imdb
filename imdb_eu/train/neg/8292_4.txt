The repression movie is a common habit in the style and shades of shelves. It is a difference, however, to use the limit and promote narcolepsy among the audience members. In the life of dentist secrets, along with Campbell Scott and Hope Davis, Alan Rudolph plays the role of director near the outfit, a film that is not much more than a metaphor that is a tooth break. lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Scott gives a good performance by David Hurst, a dentist married to another dentist (Davis). Rudolph accelerates the dynamics of his relationship - he gets absorbed in the daily routine of his parents' everyday life, he is reluctant to disillusion, with the anger of his family's life - and then the tension shakes when Scott does not have any witness at all. his wife with another man. From that moment on, the movie tells David whether he or she will face Dana's wife whether or not she's going to hurt her adultery. From time to time, David took David's appearance as an old patient (Brad Pitt's "Fight Club" by Tyler Durden) ". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < They are ashamed of the subject or narration. Instead, Rudolph creates a drama as a result of a malicious fever that travels slowly through the Hurst family, at the end of the visit to the hospital on the film's climate. The movie never gets David's arguments about his family; He does not spend much time studying the action of the preaching action that Dana's family lives with and with other more intimate purposes. <br /> <br /> If most of the movies are trying to worst the fever, Rudolph kills him. the impulse of his film. While the fifth limb of the family is showing sweating and illness, the film has used all the generosity of performance that Scott has measured well. David and Dana will finish again every step of the way to the end of the cathartic. Without having to do anything late in the last minute, it seems to be incorrect and patchy. "Dental living secrets" is a common issue and does nothing to improve. Totally depressing and non-captivating films.
