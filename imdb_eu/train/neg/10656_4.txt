What can I say? Kamal Hassan is a horrible movie. It works really well, but it's a great story, with a great deal of direction. In my opinion, director Gautham Menon has to give up. There is a lot of tragedy in the whole movie. In addition, one can not believe what terrible crimes are real. There was no practice in the film. Gautham's story is running out. Kamal Hassan and Jyothika play very well. The criminals are very ugly, although their performance is bad. I do not think this is a Sunday afternoon movie like that of the family Padayappa. You do not see this movie! However, Harris Jayaraj has done a great deal of work, which is why I have given this movie from point 4.10. His song 'Partha Modail Nallae' is a song and relaxing. In addition, excellent filmmaking. In general, it's just a bad and bad movie. Kamal Hassan, I think, should deny the movie.
