This does not mean that the live video release is over, this title should be blank for all costs. If you're not bored with good and well-executed movies, that's it. I saw this last night at AFI in Dallas, and I stayed for 20 minutes, I just did not care (insulting, not insulting the director ... that's wrong). If you only put in the movie about 5 minutes (one shot is shot, the window breaks down before firing, and the window breaks the foreground), things are bad. Let's say the only indicator of things that will come ... sadly. <br /> <br /> I will leave you with all the details, but this way is sub-par excellence in every way, even though half-assed play is a desperation of Michael Madsen, if you expect it to be half-thought. And rape scene ... Christ! "Shut up and take" would never use rape scene. EVER <br /> <br /> 3/10
