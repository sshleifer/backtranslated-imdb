This is the worst act I have ever seen. I love Almereyda Nadja, but this is absolute. Outside of cinematographic and interesting music, this film is a bad and endless activation. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but no one is far from good. The land is a joke, but not a joke. I do not even know if you are forgiven of bad movies. Delete the last minute and a half of my life. How did this director direct Nadja and Another Girl Another Another Planet?
