This movie was a piece of garbage that was confusing. You never knew what was going on. The characters were poorly written and most were not very similar except for Gus except George Eads's masterpiece. I hate this movie but I should win the Academy Award for Dark Harvest, Dracula's Blest. It was especially sad to see a talented actress like George Eads in a nasty and shaky movie. You've sunk all the time at the bottom. Someone needs to make sure that this director never works in movies. In addition, having a horror movie was much more fun than supposedly horrifying. Shame for all life, shame.
