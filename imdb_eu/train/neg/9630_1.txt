I realize that I have come up with more than just this Ben Stiller this year, but it should not be stressed by quality and quantity. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the filmmakers who went to the comedy "Along Came Polly". . "<br /> <br /> Stiller's Ruben makes charm, charm and is one of the worst acts of the year, Stiller's scratch is scanty, he's certainly a talented comic, but he needs to find another, or rest Take a look, find a really fun material, his films are not humorous and bad. <br /> <br /> There is no chemical between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a shameful actress with a good and intelligent career. "The Good Girl "(" it's amazing ") and" Ally Came Polly ", she will be proud of her career. <br /> <br /> Aniston is desperately trying to overcome blurry work But any actress is a daunting task, with Alec Baldwin, with Reuben Stan, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, except for the best friend of Reuben Sandy, there's nothing funny about this horrible film. Some hairs, such as Debra Messing, Lisa and Hank Azaria Claude, are annoying. Azari's accent is not just stupid, terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> The premise on "The opposite with Polly" probably appeared. Unfortunately, instead of a good comedy, the excuse for good comedy was a writer instead.
