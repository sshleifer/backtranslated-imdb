Brokedown Palace never seen the movie I want. Also, I did not like the Australian film, they accused me of abuse in Thailand, and Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale were denouncing drug trafficking. Since I saw this movie I would not go to that country. In fact, this movie is angry. I'd rather go to Germany to meet some pretty women. Germany is a country that I tolerate. On the contrary, I would prefer to the United States. After watching some of the movies in the theater, including the false accusation of drug smuggling, I can not accept this movie, leaving the theater and returning my money. You go to Drug-Thailand to get someone to know someone who might be a smuggler, forget it!
