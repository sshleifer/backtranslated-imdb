I do not know where to start. Throw away people who have never done anything before. Debralee Scott appears on the skin squares, but does not appear in the film. It's pretty bad writing, even for college movies. Of course, it's a low budget, having a scene sorority at the very choppy edition of the home. <br /> <br /> Typical characters are quite typical of the film - a timid guy, a nerd, a quiet black guy, a hard guy, a mustache, an attractive girl, a small town, etc. What could you expect from a famous teacher ... a heavy middle-aged boy, a guy who easily connects. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to see the University. move, stop light It's so bad, not even fun.
