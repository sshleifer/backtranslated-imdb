The camera may be compassionate to the "hulkshare" of the Hassan, maybe it's their ulagam tollywood! Comeon guys ... This movie is an emotionless thriller. <br /> <br /> <br /> Get out of your ulagera and just watch top-level thriller, like usual suspicions or the Silence of the Collection. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Of course, technically good but no camomile substances are not like an official police officer, but if there is no emotion dragging and getting bored, you will save valuable 3 hours of your life to stop watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Kamal's best is tollywood's best
