This movie could be much better, especially considering talent. Larenz Tatek's portrait of Frankie Lymon was not good, especially in music performances. It does not synchronize well, and its stage manners are Larenz Tate, as it could be Frankie Lymon. A portrait of many women with gold murders has been written by Hollywood. Of course, power was promoted, but the characters were not realistic. The film's reflection was Miguel Nunez's portrait of Little Richard and his own camera by Little Richard. Lela Rochon is an eye candy, as usual, even though it is a conservative task. It's hard for Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox to waste their talents. The whole franchise of Frankie Lymon was a wonderful one in real life. This was a bad movie, the chance was useless.
