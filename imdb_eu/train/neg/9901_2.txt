It should be a single star, but there were so many clich√©s, predictive lies, everything I saw slasher's film caused me to laugh at an extra star before, but that was never the director's intention. I'm sure <br /> <br /> I do not write a comment about movies; They must be both sensational and bad. <br /> <br /> Indeed, when I saw Jeff Fahey there, I know he would have the poor people because he had the special nose to pick the worst movie. <br /> <br /> Somehow I saw everything that was farce I saw everything. By the way, probably from the awkward voice of MRT (do not give Mr. T, but you know what I mean), if you see, make sure you do not pay. This work might have been a commercial comedy, but I'm sure you'll find funny laughs here and there every farce ...
