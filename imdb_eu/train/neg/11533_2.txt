If you are talking about the effects of rape-revenge for spreading and predicting, then you're doing something weird ... I do not think it's really true, so I could not find the only thing to free this special story. It seems like direct-to-end of the 1980s, that is, direct the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer write well with a dull script and dreadful scenario. But what is Gillian Anderson doing with such a movie, Lady Blok, after Bleak House last year's brilliance of the BBC adaptation last year? The director has promptly promoted rape and work on documentaries, but this excuse is not a strange scene that drives dog-dogs against Dyer. I do not think I was the only person I laughed at. I can not understand the involvement of companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. The latter two have participated in both major British independent. Verve distribute Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads is not worth mentioning in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve warn: this is the best thing you can really do? What will your artistic opinion do for independent British filmmakers? It's double in your reputation. Listen carefully: can you hear about believing fans of independent British films?
