Simply this would not have to be done. It's predictable and topical. The screen chemistry "My Girl" that is so brilliant is not here anywhere, and in general, the performance is powerful and powerful. Writing also lets a lot of you want, some "memorable" lines, such as "developing a barbaric habit", are just shocking. "My Girl" caused a real sad feeling and some fun moments, trying to regenerate the emotions created by listeners like "My Girl 2", and unfortunately fails. Perhaps this movie is a tough one because of the first way, but, in fact, it suggests the quality of the original part of the installment value. Certainly, this is the "Son of the mask" approach that is one of the worst sequel of all time. In both cases, the old saying is true; "If it is not broken, do not fix it".
