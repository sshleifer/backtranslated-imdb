I love Westerns. I can see it all day long. "Good, bad and ugly" is my favorite. I watched "Silverado" for the fourth time, probably the other day, because it appeared on the CMT. However, the movie Shiloh Falls is definitely the worst I've ever seen. The play was awesome around. At the end of the mysterious appearance of the valley they do not explain anything. I can guess the good part of the basement is a beautiful girl. The most notable long pause between conversations is a must-have movie length that is acceptable. This movie was not rented at my local movie rental I rented at a new store. It was stolen and I felt it was worth the money to rent. The only reason I finished was to finish the movie I did not see. I turned it off in the middle of the road, which was so bad. The director, please, do a better job if you decide to do another. This is the type of movie that can be used for people to return to Westerns.
