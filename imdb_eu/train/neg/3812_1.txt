Full House is the worst series ever! Why? Because all the characters are so impossible it is impossible. The best character is Joey, though occasionally it is quite disturbing. This girl DJ, did she write her character? I want to kill myself whenever I speak. No Danny mentioned in his philosophy. <br /> <br /> For example: The DJ won over ten thousand dollars in the casino. However, he is not eighteen years old, so he did not act according to the law. However, the casino was willing to pay for money, but then Danny, his father started looking for him and did not allow money to grow up when he was eighteen. Come on, give me a break? I set off the scene TV series immediately. Some of this series do not even buy a child. Who thinks that Full House is fun and fun in the whole world? Each word that says this series seems to be the same as Shakespeare wrote. Shakespeak did not know how to write, except for the stupid baby and stupid ones just as stupid as the script in his home. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Do not see the whole house" for those who feel bad in heart or in any bad medical condition or in any sense of life or in the real world. essay as an attempt. Follow the series. Save yourself from stupidity and nonsense. This is never the worst television show! Teletubbies would then like to see this. Do not look at this.
