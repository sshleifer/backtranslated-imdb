Allen goes to the country (somewhere in real life hates) and has a weekend with his friends. These are the most popular black half-coins in a variety of movies. <br /> <br /> I find something to have fun about Woody Allen's comedy, but here he falls completely into his face. The line seemed to seem like it. There are no plots (Shakespeare Pie Pie); But Allen seems to be using the location to allow the semi-mystic air to make it even more quiet and semi-baked. <br /> <br /> It just works at all levels and is boring. The good reviews about this film (not just the end credits) seem like they're awakening, and realizes that putting together a write-up scheme does not allow your buddy to be released to entertain.
