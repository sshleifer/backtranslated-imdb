RISKABLE, NON-ACTIVE, NON-FAVORITE CINEMATOGRAPHY, NON-SPECIFICALLY RECOMMENDED ... REVIEW MACHINE. The actors are reading their lines and not very well. Most "actors" played in a secondary theater. A story by a previous teacher said ... it's not really that confusing ... SIMPLE and DUMB is so true that it seems that a person believes that something is missing. No, it's not so much SIMPLE as you think. I understand the movie, I know that! Most of the films were seated by people sitting around (reading their lines), it seemed to him a wicked man. The accountant was ANNOYING. "Special Effects" were RETIRED. I love little budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry and Michael Berrymore ... just this movie ... you can say that they did not pay, or they did not pay much, because they were not their hearts too. the talents were there. I love Tony Todd ... however, this movie was good enough. In particular, Tony Todd's 3-star screening gave me only 1 and only Tony was in full TWO MINUTES (seriously)! I would recommend moving forward in the Tony Todd segment for two-minute DVDs two minutes. I went to the theater and paid more than a dollar to "watch this movie" I would like P.O.D. and I was asked for my money. Fortunately, people who have done it will do better the next time.
