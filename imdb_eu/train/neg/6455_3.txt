Really great movie But it is expected. It is clear that the budget is small: nothing new, an actor (if he calls "acting") whose routine show has always a nude scene, a man who is in a joke suit that is almost immediately behind the catch. forests, etc. But there are some exceptions. Although the story is not new, in most cases there are not so many parts that are lost. One, the black man does not die when he attacks (for the first time) and not the first couple to die. But this is small. More importantly, Kat's experiments and a tour that I do not see with Wes and Steve is very interesting. When Steve told Kat about what he did, he thought what he said to me and what he said was what he said. But when he showed what this creature was really, I was pleased with the novelty of the revelation. It may be due to lack of experience with the genre, or it is a real light. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is pretty bad and you do not see anything better ... If you're not remembered for a cheap Scifi flick.
