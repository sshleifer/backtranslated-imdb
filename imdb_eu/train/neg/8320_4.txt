After seeing Awake, I concluded: Joby Harold, director and screenwriter Awake, made him laugh at the viewer, which is full of ridiculous elements. An absurd and ridiculous element (for example, hospital uniform uses the spirit of the main character ... a doctor was the spirit left on the ground?) The concept of this movie is incredibly simple, but all plots and absurd things create stupid and evil films. Except Lena Olin, all the actors bring bad performances. Hayden Christensen does not have any expression and the actress Jessica Alba loses a lot. role.Awake the audience laughed. Being so hilarious and absurd is that it is impossible to take it seriously. My recommendation is: skip this crappy movie.
