I have seen the first Nanofilms and sometimes I did not see much fun. In the first part there are many famous television / comedians, the typical episodes of the stand-up program presented in fantasy dresses, and the problem that must be the second movie. Everything was there ... get anything. You often know the tedious and extreme "jokes" and you always feel like you wanted to get into the last decade of Comedylooser in the last decade. The story is not at all relevant: the typical tale of Rumpelstiltskin's story is irrelevant. I expected something like that, but I did not complain at all. I am now complaining about a frightening story story full of story writer; Their only business was to include jokes and parodies, but they did not succeed. This dirty thing, except Helge Schneider's great loss of time and money (if you do not like it, take away 2 points of my assessment) If you want to save money and get jokes, look dirty. Accommodation in the afternoon SAT1 or RTL free every Friday night. I'm sure I saw the "tits" last night.
