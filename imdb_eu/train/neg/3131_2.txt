Fallen Ones Matt Fletcher (Casper Van Dien) begins with the archaeologist in the desert, knowing the mummified footprints of a giant 42-meter high. Every day you do not see something. The land that works for property developer Matt Da Morton (Robert Wagner) wants to build a holiday resort and calls it an archaeologist archeologist Angela (Kristen Miller), for certain reasons. In any case, both try to find out what they have achieved with the hand, Morton calls security to his grandmother (Navid Negahban) for the management of the situation. Meanwhile, Eli Schmidtt Rabbi (Tom Bosley) translates an ancient (such as he wanted) ancient textual translator, and it is surprising that these giants will ascend evil prophecies and fall into the world to attack or something similar. Matt is saving all day and planet ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Kevin VanHook, he also has a small paper at the beginning, as the first warrior warrior. Fallen Ones thought it was a horrible movie and that's just as simple and straightforward. It seems that with The Fallen Ones there are so many bad things, both technically and conceptually; Script does not make sense, and it does not really get 20 until each last minute. I almost lost the desire to live. The character is horrible and as you like, the conversation is very bad, very bad or very foreseeable. I mean, it's not surprising that Casper Van Dien will keep the day. ? It is not surprising that a mummy giant will return to life, so why wait for more than an hour to enter the movie and most of the audience will be in a comatose state. This is bad, very bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It seems. The Mummy Giant's special effects are a great deal of credit, although many of them do not look like it's more than an hour, and Mummy will also come back. Directly by The Mummy's (1999) team, unfortunately, they do not use any kind of effect and, as a matter of fact, they are wasted as a comic relief. Mechanical Mummy was a good idea, but it seemed nonsensical and there is no way to synchronize everything on Earth that is out of this way can work together, the more I think the more ridiculous idea. Forget about any fear, tension or atmosphere and do not think anything is in any way whatsoever. <br /> <br /> Technically, Fallen On has nothing special and apart from the spectacular giant Mummy. The effect is little to impress him. Ghost CGI and water effects are awful, television and shows. The performance was inadequate, Wagner was embarrassed and surely Dien and Bosley liked the only thing he liked. <br /> <br /> The Fallen Ones is a bad movie, there are no two ways about it. I'm worried It is not recommended at any level or in any way, to be avoided.
