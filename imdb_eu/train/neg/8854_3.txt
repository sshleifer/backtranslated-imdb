STARZ had a free weekend and I turned on the station to see what it was. Howling II was the movie: the interpretation was horrible but the eye candy was very good. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown are the first eye candy. I saw a lot of scenes I was laughing. <br /> <br /> My friends wonder why I do not want to go to Horror movies, if they see this movie, why should they know? I'm laughing I'm laughing. <br /> <br /> Only two paratroopers: Reb Brown played with Ben White, and Mars Brown played Mars Captain, Mick Jaggers to inspire the song. "Brown Sugar" Mick women are very pleased.
