In the afternoon I saw the movie "Troy". Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> The Greek men who were opposite the general public opinions and history were not gay. Never This was clearly defined at the beginning of the film and was strengthened five minutes or later. So it's safe to see this American dudes movie. <br /> <br /> Helen of Trojan has always had hair and careful makeup. She looked at her in every short scenic camera, but many were surely doing the same thing one after the other, the director said: "Well, now it looks beautiful ... well, now ... it looks awesome. ... good ... now looks dull ... good ... now looks interested ... good ... now look beautiful again ... good ... "<br /> <br /> Mostly Greek and Trojan men accentuated by the British. Americans' accents can not act. <br /> <br /> Trojan was like Greeks, but they remained on the right side of the screen. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt does not wink. camera <br /> <br /> Troy was the main line of Helen: "They are looking for me." <br /> <br /> Trojan music is very similar to Bulgarian music. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt's thighs rise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < They were cousins No matter what the story says. or as Peter O'Toole dragged. <br /> <br /> The Greeks never touched each other as if they were not fighting for American men. <br /> <br /> The many aesthetics of the movie had the same skin color ... Maxi Factor had a light calendar, <br /> <br /> only three women in Troya. <br /> <br /> There were many Greek hairstyles, that is, good news. Brad Pitt, otherwise he could blindly. <br /> <br /> Despite the scarcity of coastal wildernesses, the Greeks had enormous ability to find unlimited numbers of woods, funeral parrots, Trojan horses, and the like. <br /> The British actors appear with idiots. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt expressly changes his expression only when the eye shines brightly. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers constantly fought, but their clothes always look perfect
