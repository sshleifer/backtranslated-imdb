It's just as good as Bela Lugosi, but the movie is nothing like Dracula. Probably, this movie is the only one that was perfectly involved, but no legends such as Lugosi could have saved the wickedness of the movie, and unlike most horror movies, this film does not make humor very well. Even though his worst part is Bela's films, he's half-like.
