I have run the teams to stop the exploitation of comedies and have heard horror stories of comedies that tried the "Last Static Comedy" in the last 2 months. If they do not have an agent to use, they do not have the chance to listen, so over 80% of comics are excluded, so they can showcase talent when they show off! If they do the hearing, if they get a second chance they said they were "predetermined". So the television audience does not have the best US comics. If the comic gets a show, most of them do not have the credits. I know I made credits for a 6-year season, because it's "Last Static Comic" and I'm not paying Producers' work. It's really shame. One month ago, I asked "Last Comic Standing 7" on Facebook why producers did not allow IMDb credits and I was banned from Facebook pages !!! I'm not a comedian, I do not have such personal involvement. People want to know the truth. I do not like seeing anyone who exploits it, and that's why I help my helpers. The comic strips are operated on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is a BIR HIRI network, makers should be ashamed to allow this operation to happen. <br /> <br /> Please see the video was the comedy victim: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
