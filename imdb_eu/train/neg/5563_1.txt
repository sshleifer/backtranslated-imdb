Dolph Lundgren looks at himself and drags himself through this mysterious and incoherent thriller. It's really pretty good here, but the story is a mixture of topical B-movies (detectives, revenge, tycoons, enthusiasts, and S & M). The film gets a little bit in the second half, but Lundg's lighter film, instead of renting RED SCORPION.
