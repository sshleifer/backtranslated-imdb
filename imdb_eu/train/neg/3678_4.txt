Actually, I did not know Notorious B.I.G. (Bert E. Gordon, director, not the murderer) was in the 80's! I always thought that the "Insept Empire of the Ants" was the master of the final achievement of its horror genre, but this was my small and dirty hand, before the "Coming" came from the old and dusty VHS copy. sorcery movie more enjoyable or more! The Dark Dark Age story appears as a civilian appearance as soon as the wild year of 1692 is inexplicably transferred to today's Salum (Massachusetts), and a girl from the history museum attacks her. When you see this girl, Ann Putman was a real bad girl in 1692 and overwhelmed her innocence with execution of more than thirty people with sorcery. The man who is attacked by flowers has lost his wife and daughter and wants his revenge over. But Loreen's century and three centuries old school is just innocent? or is it? "Burned at the stack" extends as a combination of "The Exorcist" and "Witchfinder General," The Time Machine was thrown into good measure. The way, Bert! Land is meaningless and meaningless with all new rumors, but at least it overcomes whole boredom, it often occurs in other contemporary witchcraft, such as "The Dunwich Horror" and "The Devonsville Terror". The film hits the current events and flashbacks of 1692. It's pretty funny and fast. Ann Putman's girlfriend is a wonderful character, reminiscent of the play "The Crucible" (Winona Ryder also filmed in 1996). There are several deaths of cool sequences, cemeteries or library journalists, such as the ghost of the evil Reverend with Ann Putman and perhaps even the Devil himself. The film gets quite absurd and absurd to the finish line, but overall, it was a good fun course. Additionally, it creates managerial powers over the years that you can tell me about Bert E. Gordon.
