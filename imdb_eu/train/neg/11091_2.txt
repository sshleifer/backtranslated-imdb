Denzel is about the only thing that is in this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe at one moment the movie was better. Someone decided to cut out some action and dots at the beginning of the film, giving most of the story lines for the first 5 minutes. The deterioration of the rhythm and the rhythm that this and the movie may have earlier. <br /> <br /> So, it confuses you first and then it will throw you away. The performances do not encourage them to believe. <br /> <br /> Of course, such a film potentially manages the injustice and anger that the audience wants to teach. Yes, he does it, if that's the way you're looking ... get in.
