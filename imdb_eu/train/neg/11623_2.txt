As I read about the movie, I was excited about supporting a movie with a Christian theme. The whole movie was not professional. Specially write! A film without a written one has no choice. The writer / director said in an interview that the title would not want to tell the story. Believe it, it's not surprising. I was waiting for the teens / adults to release the back story, but never did it. Someone who divorced was very disappointed. This movie would not give me comfort when I got emotional disturbances that could lead to divorce as a Christian!
