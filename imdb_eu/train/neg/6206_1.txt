Thomas Clay mixed with the wrong types. Nowadays young people have a problem, they do not respect. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie must be avoided at all costs. The action of the body of the film is slow and quite noisy and it is flourish to end the drug attack, as if it were not going to be the director. He is the main character of a foreign character, at school and at home, he is not very well suited, as a teenager who feels confused with himself. Robert falls into bad luck and school is missing and before taking medication, he is a psychosis. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the clashes of Clay's violence and the relationship between violence and violence. . Clay seems like a young generation of religious geniuses are doing the scenes of our television war. However, violence has been shot by the toughest SIMULATE piece. Is this guy real? <br /> <br /> If Clay did not watch YouTube, maybe he is naive and does not know about the wild climate of his movie? Everyone wants to see the movie's endless scene and I'm sure it will be in touch with people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film does not make sense to carry out a violent act exclusively for young people who actively participate in the prevention of warfare by Clay, as well as for the violence against violence. He does not have the best reason for his celebrity than his personal status. <br /> <br /> Shame for everyone involved.
