They had a potential for this movie and they completely fall. In the first cruel intentions, we ask what motivates people to motivate themselves and what they do. There is virtually no character development in any preview. It's a very sad story, but this movie is not for me. If they did not leave a good handwriting instead of unwanted f-words. And the end does not make any sense and does not explain anything. The writing was awful. They gave me another problem, because I used 3 EXACT lines for original originals. For example, the "bottom" or kissing scene, and others that I do not remember. I was not surprised at Robin's performances, but Amy did a great job. That is the only thing that unified this film.
