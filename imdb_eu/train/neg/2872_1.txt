This is the worst horror movie I have ever seen in my 29 years. If someone offers you this free, say it. This movie turns people into a sharper, so you can see it. The plot is not the worst piece of this movie ... its performance, camera work, lighting and sound. There's nothing like this movie. Everyone who wants to make this film has broken down. I hope that the director does not have any other film. In his defense, this movie was quick to activate the capture of the Killers of BTK, but I saw the film that resembles Oscars.
