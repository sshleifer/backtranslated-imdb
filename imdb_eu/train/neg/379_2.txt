This TV Guide calls a mysterious movie. For me, it's a mystery, how can a classical and complex music and a mathmaker create a unique culture that could not produce a single movie that would exceed a lower level of trash? This is Bollywood's best / worst, honestly I can not tell the difference. Nausea sweet, topical kitschy at all levels, story lines, situations, conversation, music and choreography. To honestly, you have to delay to enjoy it. I noticed my cultural curiosity, but I had to go for some time, I could not take it anymore. The rich quality of the movie is one of the greatest beauty of the main actors. <br /> <br />
