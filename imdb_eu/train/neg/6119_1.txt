In African jungle, a muscular male dog is caught by an opportunistic expedition team; She finds the first beautiful daughter of the team leader. Tarzan's version of the story is much better, but it's a bit worse under the direction of a movie I've ever seen. John Derek makes an inspiration for motion-slow motion and the eye of Bo Born's wife's naked eye. Ed Wood has the talent behind him. We are trying to treat sexuality in cheekbones, Derek does not have any delicacy, lack of bite and flavors. They have a sense of self-parody and bravura (the wind is very careful), but after the hope of hope, everything goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (probably all over the time using marble) has the title, but John Derek's situation and the importance of Bo Derek's head is third. * ****
