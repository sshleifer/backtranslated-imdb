I can not believe that one of the official reviews in this film also warns that there are two sexual assaults. As if, our culture accepts sexual behavior as sexual but not violent. The main problem of the film is not the rejection of these attacks, it seems that a woman who has repeatedly and aggressively attacked men never responds to their actions, and no one. A man is being attacked, if someone throws a dagger, but "you can not force yourself to love you" you only "reprimanded" ("you do not need a sex woman, shake it") is a reprimand ... From a Woman's Perspective, it's left behind. Women give "a bone" to women who allow fighters and bosses to be trained, but they define much more romance romanticism - that is, when human beings tend to influence a lack of power, human sexuality. the woman that loves This stunning fighter-fighting fighter is not used to combat his combat skills to fight the attackers. He never asked for forgiveness - but he apologized. In general, depressing and demanding films with superb cinematography and beautiful scenes, but not as good a hero as a feature film.
