I bought this movie because Shah Rukh Khan debuted. And I liked how he would see it. I have to say it's excellent in its role. DIVYA Bharathi is excellent in this movie. Rishik does a wonderful job. well.Alo nath was his role was good. Amrish and Mohnish made their fragments well too.Dalip has also been good at its small role. Brightness shines in a central movie shine. The management is average. Ravi pop tells us the famous pop pop. She has a lot of women. One of them is Kaajal.Ravi and Kaajal are in love and marry. Ravi's cousins ​​die. Kaajal is a widow ... Ravis cousins. They will go to Bombay. Raja will meet. She falls in love with her and is married. Ravi returns. The story is predictable. It is predicted for the first half. actors and music have been saved. They entertained in the second half. Music is a tough song. Cinematography is obsolete In the first part, but it is an apparent imagination. The song's songs are dull except for "Sochenge Tumhe Pyar" and the song of rain. The outfits are outdated. In any way it is seen actors and music Rating-4/10
