Well, I like Gore in this movie: it's really an imbalance. Everyone who goes to the dentist should know why. The story is not really bad, the motivation of the character of Corbin Bersen makes sense in most horror films. <br /> <br /> I made the worst performances, direction, script, etc., but in the end. The horror movie of that day is still bad. So, if you're enjoying such things or not. I tried to watch the battle, but it was exactly the same thing as this movie. Note that if you enjoy a dentist who tortures you, this is yours!
