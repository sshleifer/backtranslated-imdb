Thermorality of its amateur segment Along the same line, we have the Amos Gitai of Israel, for eleven minutes, to show a terrorist act and target a giant audience. Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu focused on Mexico's Towers, but forgot his camera. Sean Penn did not know about the shadow shopping center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura ignores all Japanese things. Claude Lelouch focusing on a vain and ordinary love. Ken Loach UK focuses on Chile. Etc, etc.
