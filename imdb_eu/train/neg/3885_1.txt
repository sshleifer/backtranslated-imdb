This movie was not bad; it was horrible After watching, I really felt that I had to get the dirt out. There is an elderly couple running 'gag', it's not fun, but it's fun. The monster's composition was good, but that's all. Continued defects will be angry, at least I. The edition is very bad. <br /> <br /> Any other thing you can do would be to watch the movie over time. Although your friend's team is 'bad films', which is very special, I could not laugh at myself. You have been warned
