Williamson's accent has to be hard pressed. She speaks very quickly as she hurries to pass through the lines. While soliloquy speaks as if someone were speaking, it works just like he speaks to himself. All this and his soot mixed me. It was old to get that role. While reading other stories in Williamson, he might have gotten involved in this role because he was mad and the director decided to play imitated-art art or act out methods. As the actors say Hamlet mad, you believe! Marianne Faithful is an amazing beauty and Ophelia's role can be tough and still overcome. The set is dark and prediction, but it looks like in a castle, especially tunnels / corridors scenes, where the killer dies shines brightly in the sky in the sky.
