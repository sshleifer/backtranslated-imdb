Wives are dying on the altar and their bodies are disappearing. They all know, but no one knows why and how it happens, nor can it happen. Come with me She is responsible for Bela Lugosi, who is getting a backache from those young women to keep the old woman alive and keep it alive. Keep up with me. In the end, the authorities imagine that death and disappearance must be engineering, but, of course, they can not understand dangerous reasons. Let's see playful pseudoscience and continue ... If you can spend the first twenty minutes of the shipment, Lugosi will be running his assistant laboratory by observing a wife who had been killed, as he finds sleeping. a coffin more comfortable than a bed, and other fuzzy parody with real horror films (with other budgets and plots). Anyhoo - a journalist continues to pity his nose (and, quite obviously, there is no inept policeman anywhere!), And then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and performance are well. In this movie there are many good and very good outfits. Direction is correct and script is better than deserved material. However, this film does not keep everyone's interest in the b-movie hardcore. The best thing about it ... It will end late, but not soon.
