First of all, let's say "bad" movies. It's funny that some of these movies leave them with more permanent impressions than those really brilliant. This movie is in a bad and bad way. This vehicle for love of Sam Mraovich does not limit his ineptitude talent, but has redirected the meaning of words. The barometer of bad movies should be forever. Zinema Mendoza line. Mr. Mraovich writes, directs himself and writes it as an object by Arthur Sailes, who is struggling with the Christian forces of contempt and evil, himself and his partner Ben "dead behind the eyes." As a libertarian, I think gay should be married. Ben and Arthur make more damage than a homofobo army. The so ugly and blue-faced portrayal of all Christians, as the giant Mraovich brand, you can not take any of them seriously. Arthur's brother Victor, a great biblical of Jesus, is so badly over-the-top you should ask the evil / badly gay how he rolled that role. For this reason, Sam "multitasking" was also Mraovich casting director. The worst thing is Sam Mraovich himself. Do you think the main men speak pasty, pumpkin and dance words? Sam also gives lines like pizza dominoes, cold and usually wrong. The last tally: you write, direct, act out and ask. This is Ed Wood's quadruple crown. Congratulations, a great little man.
