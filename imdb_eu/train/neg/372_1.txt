I've seen the movie for a long time, and I do not want to see it again. <br /> <br /> This movie is with Preston Waters, a happy preteen, always seems to be unknown. family and always seem to be little money. All of this changes when a bank robber crosses a Preston bicycle and pays an empty bill for compensation. Preston uses the check to get $ 1 million from the bank (ironically, it's a bank robbery that made money from the bank). Preston says then he is buying a palace and working as an assistant to a mysterious and wealthy protector named Mr Macintosh. After that, it tosses money. <br /> <br /> On paper, it seems to be an excellent idea. However, on the screen, the movie I've ever seen is an empty one. None, it's very compelling. I know some parts of the movie are incredible, but I draw a twelve-year-old boy with a thirty-year-old girl and put a small amount of imaginary people. In addition, it was a fictional, low-performing film, characters with less than one predicted plot and a memorable one. The characters were cursed, top, annoying or undeveloped. But "Juice" was a fun character. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this.
