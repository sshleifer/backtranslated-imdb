Have the filmmakers previewed before publishing? The scripts go from one place to another without much explanation. At first it was not clarified before the previous one. Superman starts from the beginning of the Earth and after the last film he goes to one point but does not warn his audience. Very confusing! Superman is weak and he needs Prozac. He has a home-wrecker potential, a stalker, and clearly depressed and someone who portrays someone. This type of character rarely is an interesting hero. Finishing is completely ridiculous. I just ended up in a superman hospital to kill him off. I am waiting for the SNL issue that appears in Superman Maiden Povich, and Maury says: "There are results, in the case of a child, Superman, you are a dad." In short - Welcome to Superman and Kevin Spacey, but HORRIBLE script. The movie is basically unchachable.
