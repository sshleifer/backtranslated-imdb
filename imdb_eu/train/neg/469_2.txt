Mad Magazine can have a lot of people who work ... but, of course, someone had a common sense when someone dropped out of cellulose waste ... editing it is the crapo, the plot is very fixed and stupid ... and it gets twice in ten It's the only reason that Stacy Nelkin gets her clothes a bit and she gets a beautiful breast shot ... I never thought I'd make the decision to make Ralph Macchio regret me. In this thing, but I do not ... and I really like Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, they would never have the actors presented in this piece of this movie ... at least Mr. I want to refuse to name his movie anywhere ... and it comes out ahead ... There are still copies of things with Mad's initial sequence ... something deserving ... about this movie that deserves something ... and a release to the IMDb.com people ... there's no one to ruin this film. Anyone ... the makers ruined themselves ...
