One of the fastest slashers ever. You can also call this. I would not be able to track it, even if it had come to be a type of movie, it seems quite like that. Watching a small group of middle-aged farmers in the woods is really unbearable. They made these kinds of teen teens, so who really dreamed about when they made this party? The favorite part of this movie is superficial and is the only reason to search for this movie in the Suspense Classics 50 Movie Pack. After watching other films in 50 films. I'll be aware that it's the other place. So, if you think you are immersed in the woods, I recommend Just Before Dawn and The Final Terror.
