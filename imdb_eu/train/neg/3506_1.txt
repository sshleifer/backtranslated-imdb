I would not be so quick to analyze good reviews and say that this could be a good show ... This exhibition is good if you do not know what "talent" is ... I do not say how offensive it is. (I know that a lot of people can be aggressive) because there is not so much fun in the show ... What happens to me is that we think people are fun and fun ... I feel like I'm getting our generation. I'm mad and really scared to see people who see this garb a day. <br /> <br /> Basically, the plot is easy ... it's offensive, self-centered, damaged women (Sarah). Silver in everyday life .. <br /> <br /> That's it ... It's not like it's been done a million times ... It's been almost every joke or it's racist ... <br /> <br /> Sara also likes singing ... I like her voice ... what is it ... not letters ... The lyrics are very dazzling ... I like things a lot. .. / br << /> If you want to see the hot women put others down and make me feel like crap at the same time, and every race in every race that is crap, then it's for you ..
