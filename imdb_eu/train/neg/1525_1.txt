I saw this on a weekend afternoon, because there was nothing else, it would be more entertaining to chew my feet and probably more painful. I ask anyone to see this, it was probably mandatory for the movie to be horrible. I plunged myself into all vain attempts at humor, reflection, and misunderstanding, without any belief. This is the movie that looks like Spiceworld Goodfellas, I think I'm exaggerating? Well, give it time and think again. Terrible, terribly terrifying. If that was not the case, the director and the person in charge should be removed, and they should immediately shoot to watch this movie again.
