This native, soft movie is a rigorous rigorous adolescent for men's body, which is a challenge for teenagers in general. How By burning gas and fast-moving car (or plane), <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> On the plot, Mr. Rogers (if he runs a much larger oil conglomerate) and Logan's execution a lot. Stylists and sense of style were missing). <br /> <br /> This film, featuring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith, is part of a post-gas crisis world. (* ahem *) drive the car and gas burn. The current Enron-and-Bush opposition to the U.S. SUV. <br /> <br /> Only that attitude is a huge film. But wait ... there is more. Although the film is set in the future, we do not show signs of future technology, as well as the return of bicycles, golf carts and horses. It will look like the future as it is today. The same clothes, the same suburban houses, the same green grass as today and the movie. There are no solar panels, no windmills, an alternative energy source. <br /> <br /> The effect is flat and unpleasant. Even though the scenes that might be moving, such as friends, honors, love, horror ... they are more vague than a paper doll underneath the wallet. <br /> <br /> Continuity is missing. Burgess Meredith's character colors and configuration change from one moment to another, because filmmakers insult our instinct and insecure it. <br /> <br /> In the plot, it's just as exciting and half as a section of the Hazzard Dukes. <br /> <br /> Hard-films and fans of SF should also avoid this film as a roadmap of a month-old, if you are trying to make the ex-director of Exxon as empty as a hero gas tanker.
