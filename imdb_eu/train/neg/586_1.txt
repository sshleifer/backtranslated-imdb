After what I thought was an interpretation of Man from Snowy River, why was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy? Spur and Harrison, as Douglas described, was not the same. Perhaps he acknowledged that he was poor at the plot - Jim would return after the lack of it, another man was forced to find Jessica. She could not expect a girl to wait a long time without having a relationship and did not find a match. For a Disney movie, it has a malicious language, and it's superfluous, without marrying Jim and Jessica without hiding, but LAME. Insult to the audience intelligence, according to my family members. I'll continue with the first and I've never tried to see it!
