As a summary, you only have made the most unusual comment I've heard in a RPG. Did you seriously think that it was a joy? Did you go back If you decide to save your best friend and decide if someone decides, he or she will help you decide on the well-being of his heart, and he owes debt to that man. Lavitz was a good person and they helped each other together as a friend. They were not for lovers of guys like boys. And you know that the game is set in the Middle Ages. At that time, women prepared lunches while preparing meals. Do you know your story? Do you know how long have you been to accept women in today's army? This game has a lot of realism, even though it's too slow to overtake you, and you really need to prove some solid evidence, based on the interpretation of your correct mistake story.
