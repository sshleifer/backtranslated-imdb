It's a strange movie, it's awesome or you sit down with friends, you can give it a laughing murderer. It's strange to remember again and again. Fortunately shot, even worse played and directions, maybe not. The special effects are fun, but surely the music of a flying demon will be helpful. See if you have time to kill. But do not try to take it seriously. It would be a homage to the 'holocaust porn'. As I have not seen, the tribute may be bad. He should give 1/10, but he laughed or gave me two, so he gets 3. Exaggerated gore, the only thing someone worked. Stop that you are laughing, laughing. I wonder if the authors laugh
