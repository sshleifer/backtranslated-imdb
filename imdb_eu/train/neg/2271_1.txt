Someone can surely make a great documentary about Jerry Springer Show, but this versed version of this version absorbs something that is not completely real or interesting from gaps and television phenomena. There are dozens of bad celebrities (for example, "Manos: The Hands of Fate") that have a more creative and creative film than most unbreakable and noisy movies. <br /> <br /> Really, why is not Jerry a documentary? The Springer Show would start answering the following questions: Who are these people? What happens after appearing in this show of life? How did the mayor of Cincinatti find it? <br /> <br /> A good idea: in the "orientation" session of the guests: "People, I can not stress this enough: NO ARMY!"
