The film is totally dull, nonsensical, foolish and stupid, and it is not the last proof that Danny Boyle and his "Trainspotting" film have taken care of: "The Beach" has already taken care of it. This little curiosity of budgeting has not only secured its place, but rather lost all the drugs, booze, ego, self-excitement, bad management, or whatever the director was that he soon disappeared. . <br /> <br /> The premise is absurd: two losers (some of Ecclestone and Jenna G, some of them rappers) are casually filled and start singing songs like a hit-making, like neighbors. they become A friend of his own (with an illiterate loser) turns the manager into a broken shop window and steals the video camera that fights his "action", and then tells the tape some musicians interested in it. rubbish Now, I know that, in recent years, in the United Kingdom, it has put in junk, but this is a ridiculous thing; The music seems like Oasis is the Beatles. In studio recordings, the pair - Strumpet - changed every change, and Ecclestone's composers proudly say they take or leave it, and they take it quite absurdly. Music is completely and pure, but they are social "interpreter". These newcomers are called drawings. It's very mute. It's very strange. <br /> <br /> The conversation is inadequate and it's not going anywhere, and the story-teller's story does not make any sense and makes no sense. It is often improvised - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a stupid guy. This small bin is so bad to see. Ecclestone's I.Q. It must also be questioned to be part of that nonsense. Anyone who has financed Â£ 1000 for this joke should leave the movie business until they finish selling their outfits.
