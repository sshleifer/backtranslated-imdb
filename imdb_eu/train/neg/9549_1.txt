With John Wood, why did not Dr. Falken play until I saw the movie. Bad land, bad science, performance and, in general, bad film. Do not watch the movie. Let the original "War Games" feel nostalgic. <br /> <br /> I do not like the plot of land to overcome the idea of ​​terrorism. In the first film W.O.P.R Russia was one of the leading US signals in the United States. In this movie, the idea behind the computer was to kill a terrorist before being threatened. Aside from politics, the stupid computer was a good thing about the first film to understand the idea of ​​an endless war. This movie does not offer such ideas.
