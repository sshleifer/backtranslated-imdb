Read and keep in mind: you could save your life for 88 minutes (all this was!). <br /> <br /> Certainly, dark, this film (I guess) creates a modern small town in America's Christmas. Factory in the style of Capra. If it fails ... it completely and completely fails. I tried to think a good thing and I can not. Let's emphasize some of the highlights ... <br /> <br /> People do not die, eternal people spend their jobs in Santa's factory. Angels really are cowboys who sit in trees. It can lead to the death of the dead people (if you send a nice letter). <br /> <br /> And on the plot ... I do not harm you, but the films have to be clear in contrast to the darkness, but there is not any. Likewise, photography is horrible; The snow that appear at the end of frost, because they are cold, humid, and miserable everywhere. <br /> <br /> As it may think, the movie is happy (schmaltzy). What a relief!
