The main theme of this film seems to be confusion, because the relationship, setting, acting and the social context are taking place in the same place: confusion. Although Harvey Keitel is out of his class, he lacks his usual clarity, direction and intensity. As a mistake, his character is called "Che", and we say that it is only "Che", a man named Che, for the narration (directly, directly). Family relationships are not clear to the end of the film, and once defined, the family divides - a younger generation to America. So clicking on it. Other reviews discuss how the film describes the impact of the revolution on the boys' family; However, the political attitude of the director is very bad, and we are never sure who is responsible for the blood flow. Therefore, they lost their possessions (acquired by the profits of the game) - and what? When it comes to making a Cuban revolution, a refusal to take a political state is a coward and cowardly stance. No mention of the movie in English! Why are Cubans talking in English? It is not surprising that they did not get permission to shoot in Cuba. And if the family's life is very important to see here, it would be great to know who it is, "we're all" involved in the beginning, to make it clear about relationships throughout the film! The plays were mostly superficial, woody and incredible, over time. "Special" visual effects were confusing and attentive. References to American films - and the black character as a Greek chorus - strictly free, intellectually appealing and inconsistent. I saw the whole movie, because it was waiting for clarity or because it's all. It never happened.
