Shame! I was there, I was comfortable with a chair, a beer and a popcorn, another night of entertainment night in Muppet's hope. What did I get? Disappointed! How can Muppets go through this Christmas Carol sublime? It was a terrifying humor, songs were worse than those of the countries and the West (and that is what it says) and the plot was confusing and poor like the Blind Pew. In my opinion, the main problem was trying too much at Treasure Island. A short story, such as Christmas Carol, is perfect for lifting around Muppet ... here the need to drag on the plot completely stopped. Where's Muppets? What's Ozko Muppets Wizard?
