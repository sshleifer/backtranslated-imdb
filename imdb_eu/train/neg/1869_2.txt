The veteran Sleazeball is Bruno Mattei again with this erotic thriller with 8MM echoed Joel Schumacher. But, as expected, Mattei has a small budget movie - it's already posted. <br /> <br /> After her daughter is kidnapped, her mother will enter the underground world of underground pornography, which is part of an international organization that directs Plagia films while paying their exclusive customers. His daughter's search does not only bring her mothers to Europe, but also prostitution. He goes to bed with some guys to get his marks. When he comes into contact with the organization of the tobacco organization that leads the mysterious doctor Hades, he is at a great risk. <br /> <br /> He's not saying much about it, even if he waits. The problem is that the director who made films such as BLADE VIOLENT did not expect a short or explicit film. SNUFF TRAP (it was first released in Russia!) It is not enough to be overwhelmed, naked or even sex, to really keep the audience focused. Plots are not special, except for surprisingly different locations across Europe. The endless one is very disappointing. The performance is not really outstanding, except for Dr. Anita Auer, who plays Hades: she looks very dazzling. You do not want to find such a way in a dark street (or your bedroom, in fact). <br /> <br /> In the end, SNUFF TRAP only catches the collection of Bruno Mattei's movie. However, it is good to see the man again once again: in 1994 his first thriller was giallo GLI OCCHI DENTRO.
