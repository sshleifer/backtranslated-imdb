Cinema was horrible. Christopher Walken and Michael Ironside are not overwhelmed. Both are excellent actors, but it must be the worst role in history. Even though their great performance has not been able to recover the most hilarious story of this movie. This movie is the beginning of US propaganda in the nineties. Colombian rebels were the most dramatic scenes that made their revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared fake, and his pseudo-love relationship Walken did not have any true, meaningless movie that was a pathetic emotion. I am desperate for such films as the good name of Christopher Walken. I could barely sit down.
