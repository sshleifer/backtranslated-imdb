In Evren Buyruk's films, you need to see my comments. I am not a different lecture, even though it's worth a minute to make a lecture ... This movie is essentially Dafoe drinking his character for two hours, almost literally - to death. In this movie, the only surprise is that you do not have enough trace or personality. It was just a sad, drowsy time. <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is an excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But the movie sucks. Slow did not make the movie bad, it was bad. It is not confused with artistic writings about art on anamorphic details that draws coherent cohesion in the plot, rather than focusing on the perspective of several perspectives, at the end of the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as an entertainment, I have slept. (Seriously, I was asleep and again I had to watch the movie, because it was even more disappointed). In general, I do not like commenting and negative comments about the work of others, even if they suck, but this film was guaranteed. . It's very bad that the best actors are ashamed of the final result.
