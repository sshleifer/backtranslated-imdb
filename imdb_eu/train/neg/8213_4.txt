I can not believe, IMDb has all the television programs that man knows! I have not seen this show for more than 20 years. I only remember two passages, and I am hardly remembered. I remember Tony was not in the beginning, one of the passages I remember is what everyone tries to join Tony, but he refuses them, but he usually becomes a member of the show's end. Power House, when everyone encourages us. <br /> <br /> I remember another, Lolo, for some reason, who intends to be dead (with funerals and condolences). I do not remember why he died or the show ended. <br /> <br /> This is one of them I persuaded myself that I should dream, as anyone else has ever heard.
