This is your only spoiler warning. What is the sad state of our cinema when a litter like this is called "Oscar worthy". <br /> <br /> I divide the material into three levels. The first is theater theater. Here the viewer is stationary and the power lies in the presentation of the actor and, most importantly, in the power of the writer. A good writer is better than a good scriptwriter, because words understand better ways. The best playwright creates images that can not show sterile plays. <br /> <br /> The second level is cinema. In this medium, a weaker writer can be used, but the viewer is not sitting in a place all the time. With the film, the context can take on the characteristics of visual poetry and meaning as well as strong writing. In addition, the film manipulates elements such as sounds and colors, just like surrealists. <br /> <br /> The last level is literature. In this context, everything imagines the author, translated to the paper and has re-imagined the reader. A novel can be much more detailed than an unthinkable studio for a movie studio. <br /> <br /> That's why adjustments can be increased, but never down. The news is never better than basic movies (see dime-per-dozen in your book store), but the movie can not give the original book power (Catch-22 and LotR). Pel√≠culas can rarely enter plays and plays in movies. <br /> <br /> Like 'The last image show', it fails. A movie is going to be a stage, the director is too stupid to shoot anything. The same characters speak and do the same thing, it is purely banal. Add such an evil soundtrack and your movie is completely intact. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the secondary drama class with another 20 women's theater. The teacher was wrong about the movie. The worst part is how the work remains depressed while the material is ridiculous. If this color were to be, the scene of disability, pool party and old-fashioned toys would be a great comedy. Look what Lucas did with American Graffiti a few years later. <br /> <br /> The American secondary education system has to start teaching the NAGUSI film instead of trying to teach ZIN film. Two visuals with a strong downward film: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. On these trusts, not this. He's the last one I want to see. Outside 5
