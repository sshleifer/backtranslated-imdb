What happens to RGV? Repeating in every movie seems. Is creativity finished with ideas? If so, take a back seat. I went to see the movie - of course, I did not think it would be about the original. He knew he did not, the promotions said everything. But I thought RGV would be an excellent treatment too. After all, is not Sathya and Company the same guy? Or is it? I have doubts about seeing Aag. I will not talk about the plot or the story, because most are considered original, if you go to see this, you can play fun friends: identify the original scene. One and give your ratings! So Veeru Heero becomes (what's that?), I think Heer would not sound. Ajay Devgan is a disaster like Heero. It is a serious comedy and the false conversation that was really effective in the company is false. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist. In fact, he tries to become more of Nishar's charm. This peak has reached the end. Raj, in fact, is not a bad thing about others, it's a guy who sees it in the future. Amitabh Bachchan really was disappointed with Babban, like Gabbar Singh's caricature. There is a scene, which drinks from a bowl that is covered in something, instead of inspiring fear, seems like a beggar in his bowl. The only performance that was truly outstanding was Mohan Lal Narasimha. I am afraid I do not have to send any more patience.
