The real star of the hilarious story is incredibly bright. Looking at the eye, the film does not stimulate the mind and the heart. At first, I was fascinated by Dietrich and Boyer asking for religion to find love "ability". Then there is a great despair. Boyer is the only real actor of production and we feel tormented. Dietrich's amazing wardrobe surpasses his performance. Sometimes, his face is terrific when he looks at his face: a compelling mask. As a monk, Boyer recalled the formula for the liquid monastery (which evokes the true story of Chartreuse). When he leaves his "wedding god", his fellow monks have a constant shock and fear of organized religion. The viewer thinks Boyer removed his past. However, the journey that follows is very predictable.
