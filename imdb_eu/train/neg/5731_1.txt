I saw the revised version of this film and I noticed that I never returned for about 30 minutes. I persisted in order to improve the dialogue, because martial arts would look like realistic, the special FX would look special. I was so wrong. I love fright, I am a full dog. I have been nominated for the short films of the nineties. However, in the 1980s, this film was not made, as the film appeared in the early eighties, it would have been forgiven by fax because it seemed so bad. There was not so much that defense. The conversation was horrible as I was writing in bad luck in torture claws. I do not like shelter, I never thought it was still conceived, I felt nothing more fashionable and protagonist, though it seemed to shine as if it were great after that rubbish. Live Feed would have given a tour of the back of the lid that I had never seen before, I waited for the tour that I had still ordered.
