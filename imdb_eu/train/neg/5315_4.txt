Kol, a space detained by the death row of space, kidnaps a shuttle and fled to America's forests and tries to escape alongside a new friend, to escape the "Alienator". The best film of the movie "The Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers" by Fred Olen Ray did not want to help, but it's a small budget as small as before, but I was not so funny. Not all of the actors really did. On Saturday afternoon rays, there is no separate viewer movie, but all this is pretty good. <br /> <br /> My grade: D + <br /> <br /> Where did I watch: Showtime Thriller
