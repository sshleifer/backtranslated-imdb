It's not so much that the KONTZEPTURA RESTAURANT had little potential. Indeed, the title-tracking phenomenon is very interesting and, at least, in the middle of the opening, Tobe Hooper hopes to entertain in the 90s as a horrorless fear. But Brad Dourif once again off-again-off-again into performances and intricate plot, this-thriller has lost its way. Dourif, here was built up before his fanciful horror fan base. The average guy is Sam. Of course, average men do not have an average length of time in horror films, so next to their original scheme, the body parts begin to light up. Soon other people are also awakened by Cynthia Bain, a well-known affair with her well-known Lisa. <br /> <br /> While the title of the film shows the monster of fire, he has chosen Hooper. Sam is not an impossible assassin. This approach adds to the depths of the human body, but also the fear of human flamethrower. We are glad to ask that this would be a better straightforward looking job, NIGHTMARE ELM STREET. <br /> <br /> A PRE-CONCERT CONCERT is a nominal effort when all is said and done. Dourif's fans and those who did not have enough horror in the 1990s will find an appeal against those who are not good, bad or bad, but in a dark night.
