Sandra Bernhard's Women's Off-Broadway version of the film is gaspingly pretentious. Sandra is structured in the living room and the superstars, but the sense of irony is very interesting and fun. His enthusiast will say that he is honestly honest and that can be true. But it is also wonderful to avoid having a proper face in a movie that is not suitable for a movie in this genre with a sharp face. He does not want to like it - and he certainly does not want to make friends, and that always rubs a lot of people wrong. But if you know him halfway, his material is seriously missing. The filmmaker Nicolas Roeg was an executive producer and did not direct, although this film has a cold and distinctive signature. Bernhard wrote the show with director John Boskovich; Its strangest touch was that all Sandra's inner audiences were bored, a feeling of true sharing by real audiences. * 1/2 ****
