This is a very "bad movie" for enthusiast enthusiasts. It is worthy for pop culture students of the 1970s: fashion, furniture, attitudes and a great "women's lib" in the early 1970s, which was still independent and independent of being a new and independent woman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Superchick" (Joyce Jillson) had a solid money to earn money (after all, what is an assistant, but a server at 30,000 feet - it's also for men). He slept with more than men, he could protect himself and others (karate) and there was no connection. It is a feminine type of female who frightens the anti-Feminist juices, a woman who does not believe her husband. <br /> <br /> "Stewardess sexy" was a powerful archetype. At the end of the 1960s and the late 70s (although I remember "The Partridge Family", graduate Ruben Kincaid, who constantly connects with stewardesses) and, from that perspective, this silly movie is a pre-AIDS pop capsule. , free love, women lib, swing 70 Plots is horrible. And with regard to the large number of spectators, there are few bare breasts.
