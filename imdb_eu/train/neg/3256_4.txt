I went out and saw the night. I sincerely believe that since they've been watching for 20 years. I remember having a serious mistake. I do not remember this being a bad thing !!!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Who is my fault? Did 2 write 2 guys (and I use the word a little) script? Three leading characters in the story, at least 3 major characters, are the misleading casting directors? (Only 2 of them are among the "5 amazing" ones.) The director, who had not seriously refused to take it, kept playing dramatic music bad and bad writing everywhere? (I liked the song of the theme - but never had to use the whole movie!) Don Black, who ASHAMED wrote for this song in some lyrics? <br /> <br /> <br /> That is to say, after having read the comic book adaptation again, I should have taken more than a week. The first 15-20 minutes (actually less) of the movie are parallel to the first issue of the comic. As I saw tonight, I asked him ... why were all the details missing? The doctor appeared and then used to open security with the remote control of the wrist and left the frantic bullet with only 5 inches missing from the refractive crystals. I mean, if you want to make the "adaptation", WHY ALL THE CHANGES ARE IN GOD? <br /> <br /> <br /> When leaving Doc's HQ, it's almost NOT COMIC (that is, when it's given). Roy Thomas, I'm probably in the book. I read somewhere in a movie that combines elements of two different novels. Again - Why? I have heard that it changed, because they could not make sure they wanted the budget. I look at the movie and I think ... I do not see any explanations on what I saw on screen! <br /> <br /> You know, when people complain about Joel Schumacher, they should really look. this thing It's the best thing I can say, I think the BATMAN function in 1966 could be double - and probably the triple bill and the 1980 FLASH GORDON. All 3 movies are "stupid". Perhaps the 1966 movie (and TV series) can be "blamed". Some fans report that AdamMAN's batman has ruined the comic book's image for many years in non-comic book generations. I think it could say the same to Hollywood. I have reminded ourselves of how many characters actually "really" rely on "classical" characters over the years, especially (it seems) in the late 70's and early 80's. Charlie Chan, Fu Manchu, Tarzan, Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Lone Ranger. Hollywood "comic books! They think it's STUPID!" Because they are more "stupid". What is potential loss? <br /> <br /> Let's say good things ... Although script and direction, Ron Ely GREAT. When I read the story of DOC SAVAGE, I do not believe in James Bama's paintings, I think of Elysus. Bill Lucking (later common to A-TEAM) is wonderful. Eldon Quick (I've seen somewhere else, but can not remember where it is) is horrible. Paul Gleason was completely unaffunked with the passion and vengeance of THE BREAKFAST CLUB, which "should be the forbidden" film to be taught as if it were "forbidden" by anyone. Although Pamela Hensley did not know the story of her part - it's wonderful. Before removing hair, I noticed that I also found that "Caleta" was similar to "Ardala Valmar", the other day by John Calkins BUCK ROGERS strips. It has a big nose like ardata. It's not so remarkable. Ardala comics, in fact, were like Aura in 1936 - or Cher movies. Or perhaps Streisand. Pick Selection (Ardala actually got plastic surgery on George Tuska strips - then it was amazing!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < in a passage. I wonder if he was like a character that was playing for himself? I do not know because this nature was not in the film's title.
