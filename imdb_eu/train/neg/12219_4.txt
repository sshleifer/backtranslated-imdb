This was a strange movie. He started well A solid sound track behind Gore and Mayhem's flash images as our psychopath did. <br /> <br /> Next comes its "drop". I can say that I am here in a real "B" movie. A bad performance, I mean, what is it hard to have a gun and act like a cop? These guys could not. After our scene with the death of our psychopath, we get the initial credit and the movie begins ... <br /> <br /> From this point onwards, bad jokes, secondary blood vessels and poorly executed death scenes. <br /> I said that I gave him a four-piece movie, because, despite his mistakes, I could not quite fear a certain fear. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie but I must admit that it is worse.
