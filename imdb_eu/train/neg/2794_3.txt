Well, I thought I was a musician, maybe I would think this movie would be for TMC, which will be good. Until now, one of the worst mistake in my life is only one and a half. I seriously thought that it was one of those crazy slogans and that was the correct effects, mere shots and effects. But no, I do not even get that pleasure. "Musicians" were not too good. I expected some laughter, but I was not sure if they were trying to throw off liners. But now I have to sit down and see the rest until Pulp Fiction starts. Or maybe something better. And now I'm sitting here until I'm writing 10 lines
