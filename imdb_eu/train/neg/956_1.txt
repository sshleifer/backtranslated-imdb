It's amazing that this movie has been in one of my political lines. The movie I've ever seen is the worst. <br /> <br /> Never before bearded (fortunately not for 1.5 hours more), the humor before the adolescent is humorous. This feature is not even a little shelf in my mouth. In the first part you expect the other parts to be better at least for the first time. You just need to waste the only downside. <br /> <br /> The movie does not tell any story and repeat it three times. We can only expect that the rest of the film will be permanently lost and Trent Harris will never put his hands on a camera again ...
