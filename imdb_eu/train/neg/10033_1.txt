I was very upset with this move. Everything was awful from the beginning. Comedy was humorous, excessive action, non-melodic songs. Although it's a heavy story. From a writer who has written a successful writer like Guru and Dhoom, I had a lot of hope. The actors worked hard and did not help the movie. Of course, Kareena got scratched on the screen in bikini but in two seconds. In my opinion, the directors of Hindi film accreditation must investigate how to carry out action movies. Excessive way too much. In Chinese films, this style is a simple piece of it. However, they are the Hindi signature of the movie songs. The good action movie will last for two hours and can not be realistic. But in the future I am sure that these action films will be much more rigorous. It is noteworthy: comedy and action movies do not work well. Next good luck
