That's Bruce Willis, the typical action schtick movie. Check out the popcorn and your friends. Rent to save money. <br /> <br /> It is not realistic. Fights are not realistic. Soldiers are not realistic. Victims are not realistic. And why did Tom Skerritt's character talk to Willis at Carrier? What is that with? It can not do that inside the bucket There is an average explosion range. <br /> <br /> If this film is accurately stated by the Navy SEALS, do not get stuck in Africa so you can wait for it! <br /> <br /> I liked the noble attack on the village. "The previous row of ethnic cleansing seats" ... Bruce looks at what dying in the village. So what does it do? He enters the city in his stomach. Yes How many died while they were dying? Well ... body counts were necessary, I think. <br /> <br /> <br /> And if that African man was so important, why did he not go on for adults and children? Can not say "Duh?" <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie was very dark. On the plot, but at night it happens so much to know what happened. <br /> <br /> Rent.
