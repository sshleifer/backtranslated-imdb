This film is the final disappointment for me, Tsai Ming-Liangen. It sends tranquility from all its frames. So I will not study it right. But there are several observations: <br /> <br /> 1. If competition is a drought, why should we see the urban landscape with green and green trees? I wonder if he meant something in the metaphorical context of the film (the desire for intimacy proves thirst, and the watermelon is tedious, sex). Or it's just a bad filming, it's not going to be consistent. <br /> <br /> 2. We do not know what happened to the pornographic actress, who was unconscious or sensibly dead. It seems to be an irrelevant question, as long as the message of supreme alienation (= innocent) is delivered, but looking back, does his inert body mean cheap drama? Free activity as a freelance operator. <br /> <br /> 3. Is not there anything to indicate that Antonioni did not indicate 40 years ago by the film ?? and no actresses need to be humiliated. <br /> <br /> 4. Music numbers (recycled from 'The Hole') were felt as an idea of ​​secondary education in artistic training in secondary school. If that was the point, he absorbed the point.
