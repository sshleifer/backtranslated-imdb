The predicted factor that could be an exciting and emotive-loaded nature is weakened. Fox is well trained by Julliard as Nathaniel Ayers, a musician who loves to play with Walt Disney, until he joins the schizophrenia to the streets. He is looking for a good story to boost his career, the reporter Steve Lopez {Robert "rehab" Downey} acquires and tells his story. We take all the elements of the classic film "Skateboarding", borrowing "A Beautiful Mind", borrowing a "feeling" of the likes of "Rocky". In the 1930s, all that remains in the style melodrama screen is the burning of a shell of a movie. Crispy, nonsensical, totally predictable and often acts on our feelings. I hate to say that, but this is the movie, if you say that you hate it, people will look bad. I really want to say something positive about this movie, but I really can not. It's a bit of a performance, but it's not enough to give more than one star. Made for television movies. You do not deserve your time.
