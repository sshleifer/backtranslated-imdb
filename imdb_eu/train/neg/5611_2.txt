Personally I thought it was difficult to see this movie, the first one was hardly the purpose, and it gave me an aspect of the debate. Billy Grahm was the only person who was said to be a bunch of people from Revival. Secondly, his supposed subject was diverted by Jesus (Yeshua) that existed to inform the violent Christianity and to show Mel Gibsons's "Passion" scene. In the end, the director has been interviewed with former Director of a private conservative school and tries to capture children's faith in teaching. Oh, and Techno Music also saw the movie harder.
