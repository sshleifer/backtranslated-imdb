A sloppy, boring and drama movie! A good vote, topical conversation, a boring story, and Mr. Marshal's soul with great enthusiasm! The story of the most famous prostitute in the Asian continent is commonplace and predictable, without heart, with new ideas and a lack of depth. The main character is not because of his contact lenses being tiny phisique and fake. The lexicon used by Geis is forced and somewhat sophisticated in limited exposure to educational modes. The story goes on and while trying to persuade you, it's boring, flat-breasts, Geisha's last girl in Asia, they say they're really hard on the movie, "Want to become a Kondai!" The movie is very boring, it looks beautiful, it is very interesting for some time when you go for cigarettes. Basically, if you do not believe the messenger, if you do not believe the message, and this girl does not fill the shoe. Borin, boring, skip!
