Since I saw the first cover of the film, and when I thought I had a long photography guy, 'Scwarz' should be 6 feet or 6 meters long. <br /> <br /> It's not 5 meters high. Not that, it's his fault. <br /> <br /> In any evaluation, I turned the movie into a cool night in Tucson, the second story box with a good cigar and let it be thrown. At that time, my wife had a love and things went on for me. So I needed a good diversion. But it was as bad as the movie ... I liked it, I also agree with a Merlot bottle. <br /> <br /> Really, I watched this movie several times. I always feel good !! It's not that he's "trying hard" to hit a cool or "so close" hit with an action movie ... It's wonderful. And then it's really clueless. Then, again angry. The best is the slow speed in the case of a bullying scene. Wow !! I have never felt in my life anymore. Hot and happy too. They thanked me for consuming gasoline at the gas station because of the smaller production in the summer months ... anywho <br /> <br /> Money was "inspired" and the actions and struggles were choreographed, or again choreographed and tightened, the sound was turned off Do not touch the shipment, he went on, in another way. Citizens in the town, but in the city, were "Off Cue", but it seems that they did not even follow what was happening, it could look like it and also "look" in the camera lens. On the head, like deer, they illuminate something similar, some of them with a smile, with smiling deer. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because they only have the 'Columbu' bet, it has a good heart and anxiety for America and even for its people. <br /> <br /> However, "Baretta Island" is very lethargic and compelling. I love it a lot. Now my wife x hates her, but I love her! <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that I am very discriminating in films I love or love. In short, I like Franco. So there it is. <br /> <br /> If you add an add-on movie that you want to add earlier, you'd like to watch video-B movies or "bad" movies for a small library collection directly. See, "The Big Sweat" (1991), Robert Z 'Dar ... You know the great guy "TANGO & CASH". "Great sweat", a bombardment of a police non-discovery, so dramatic and dramatic, might be "crutches" and I think the money was missing at the end of The Big Sweat. , because it had a cast-shaped image and burned the fire and burned over credit. -Goo. <br /> <br /> However, not as good as Baretta Island, I gave it a great grade for '1' and B 'frightening film. I am still waiting for Sequence, perhaps like 'Baretta revenge on the mountain' (it takes Franco's vacation and is sick in water when it declares war against the water) or 'Baretta dust war'. He creates a great drug in his country and chemically gene-splice and creates a hybrid super-defect that falls and falls into the cocaine field and transforms coke and defects it into a chemical reaction. Coke in pure powdered sugar. Next, he insisted that another young man insisted on excessive sugar dependence, and so on. It is possible to obtain a large dental adhesive company to partially finance the project and with the product's careful location. Right? (*)
