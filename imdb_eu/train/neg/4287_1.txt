Timecop gave me a perfect 10, I gave it to him <br /> <br /> The story is very boring and has nothing to do with the original Timecop. Timecop's many things were dismantled and replaced by stupid ones. This story happens in 2060 (although I remember), but for some reason, schedules are more dangerous now: mixed: <br /> <br /> And action scenes are not happy, and most of them. they are not ... the first is only great ... and there are not many scenes of action, and they are very short <br /> <br /> In a moment of the story, the main character travels in time for 5 times in a few minutes ... wait without doing it twice ... <br /> <br /> In short: Do not waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it.
