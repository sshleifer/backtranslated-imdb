I can not believe anyone who likes this movie. I have seen lots of low-budget indie films, but this has been completely sucked. The small budget does not mean that the movie should get dirty. Fear does not mean that the movie must be demented. There was no fear about this movie. Gore was just a feast, and especially disturbing. The performance was an average, because it was thought to be unknown actors, but the story was pathetic, it was a pathetic conversation. The film is "artistic" or something else. This is not one of these great indie films that cost only a few thousand dollars, but they are very well made. Some very ill people were just an excuse for making evil obsessions on film. Other reviews have also said that sucking the soundtracks ... because most people wrote it, and some songs were written by a movie writer. There was no free quality for this movie. I waste my time and money.
