I only had to watch this movie when I was pretty young, trying to remember a great deal of the movie. However, I can say it was not fun to be a movie called Killer Tomatoes and the most memorable things in this movie are the theater that tells the song and the scene about the poor Timmy. On the other hand, the film is just a scene of small tomatoes and large tomatoes, and people make the fear and abuse of a kind of film. However, having a very stupid story and a wonderful themed song is not a good comedy. It is supposed to be a film that is a movie B, something that should not be taken seriously, however, you should still make fun jokes and do not try to spread a sweet love in a whole movie. It's likely that a couple of older couples trailer would be well off and a man who tried to throw a larger tomato was pretty good. The video itself resembled a portrait of an image, but they did not make the whole movie, and it was weak.
