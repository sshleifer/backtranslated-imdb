When reading the review of MY FILM CINEMA, many people can imagine I am 14 years old when I think SCREAM is considered a "classic" horror. This is not the case, I'm 30 years old and I see horror films all my life. However, of course, I am a child of the 80s, slasher / zombie / ghost / cannibal, etc. ... I grew up ... horror film types - so I usually prefer horror movie and faster movies. Music, painting or, in this case, is like someone who can detect the movies, but it does not have to be similar. I know why some people can enjoy this movie ... I do not ... <br /> <br /> A story about a movie school for girls is very dull and boring. The heavy school lady is a rule of iron (or in some cases a whip) to keep the girls lined up. A young girl walks around and looks at the girls while they're showering (less on their cameras (?!?) ... while the girls disappear from school, they are victims of a murderer, hidden around the campus ... <br /> < > I can see why it has been solved by the HOUSE WITH SUSPIRIA (that is, I think it's a masterpiece of a movie), the school itself and the interaction between girls and their guardians - but this movie is very sad and lying, I'm hardly awake. I'm a "tension" and a "suspense", but this film is not for me. Fortunately, I did not like this much, and I can not say I was really disappointed - the SCREAMED HOUSE house does not have much more than what I enjoy in most horror movies 70. This is not a tough and fast rule, but it seems that I definitely enjoy it. Most likely, "horror movie fans with horror movies" "- but I do not know as much as I know too many fans of this material, I can not recommend this ...
