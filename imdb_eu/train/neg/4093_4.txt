Plots and characters are hilarious and hardly classified as "plot" and "character" AS. The main problem is that it is dark, external vision and fuzzy. Fulci does not support the full-fledged movie. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely curious and is filled with sex and violence. The inconsistencies are quite funny, as one of the main characters says that he has no friends, but he is a new man in a minute on the screen and there is a whole bunch of women. Although it shows its anti-social tendencies, by focusing on the arrow keys with someone in charge of their business, the blood or gore images get more attention than the characters, but what do you want from Fulc? . Perhaps he has ruined his career, but it was not really a zombie stupid. Renting is worth it if you like great Italian movies or disappointed, and if you're curious or strange. How do you sleep 2 meters in your head and ask for help?
