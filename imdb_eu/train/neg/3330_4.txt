This film O. The score and performance by David Muir Hackenstein was as bad. Initial and final credits show that most of the actors and "special effects" are a low budget movie. There's no movie in this great movie genre, horror comedy or low-budget film. No special movie for lovers of nudity. This movie is just here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are also not impressed. As you were curious and you can find out, you will realize the truth of a summary of the line.
