This movie had more holes than Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck had no way of trying any shape or shape. He sucked it straight. The film was not compelling. The first problems were at the entrance: everything that the man gives to the value of the Salvation Army Santa Claus, but does not show why. And then the grandmother enters the head in the oven ... very beautiful and has nothing to do with the movie - not even in the same tone of the movie. Ben Affleck did not have the motivation to choose the chosen house. He chose not the credible reactions of the family; and people shake it there and there without any hassle (for example: Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's characters descend from steep slopes, that is, she suddenly falls in love with this event ...). There was one or two fun moments, but the movies were strange. He needed to rewrite it seriously (or 4). Like it!
