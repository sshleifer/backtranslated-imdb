At some specific moments, when a few titer scientists know about the cave paintings that could be about the dinosaur monster about ten thousand years ago, burning meteorites fall into the lake and the egg of a monster lying there falls. ?? I think I'm more than a thousand years old! "The Crater Lake Monster" is literally a must-believe movie, but it's better for a lot of friends and colleagues to digest a healthy one a bit easier.
