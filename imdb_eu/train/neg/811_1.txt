It was a good original movie. I bought it on the tape and I have seen it several times. And although I know that the succession is not as good as the original, I hope I was not expecting that bomb. Romanticism was flat, the sight was old, it was just oral humor. Maybe I have never seen the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's coming.
