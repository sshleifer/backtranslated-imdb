I like the time, I like the essay, but a cough that looks like a bottle of cigar gives me a headache. If you played computer games that were faded and out of focus, I'd upgrade my computer. That was the look of the director, but it was not so painful for those eyes and before 10 minutes. I did not have someone with me to take this film. Although it was a series, even though there was no movie, Band of Brothers did this. They looked like the images of the Second World War, they only touched the beads, but it was still nice to see. The movie needs real people, with real groups and real locations; Use CGI when appropriate, not full movie.
