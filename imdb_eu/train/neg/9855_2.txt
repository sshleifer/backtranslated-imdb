Let me be a great fan of fantasy. However, this movie is not for me. There are many remote arguments trying to protect this film's claim. The film mentions connections to different stories in different countries, but fails to do more research, which could give credence to the film. The film CGI (nice!) Uses the fantasy story of a young dragon to tell the story. This is combined with the popular TV-show, CSI-style advanced, to make it look like something scientific. In many cases, arguments / clues are far away. In some cases, traces used to show dragons, or fly, or just fire. To see this you just need to get me to cramp my fingers. A fantasy movie also needs a reality level, but it just has that. Bottom Line: Fantastic CSI documentary is pretentious, it is not worth seeing.
