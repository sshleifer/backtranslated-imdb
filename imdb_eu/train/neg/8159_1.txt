This is only related to the first movie with its name. The plot has nothing to do with the first and the whole movie mixes! I do not know what they thought, but the movie is so bad. If you want to avoid it, the first film in the series is acceptable as Slasher Flick, so it's fourth, but this one and 3. are dirty!
