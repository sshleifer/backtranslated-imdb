I doubt BTK the cause of the creators of this fatal motive. Are they described as an evil monster for animal rights activists? Who is responsible for that? Do not you think that people involved with that monster do enough harm? Revenge and corruption of victims! It was like a personality experiment: what makes you more sick, slaughter or human murder? They used the real names of some victims ... this film was terrifying, shameless and insulting. The creators of this film used this tragedy for their own agenda! People must wake up and draw again!
