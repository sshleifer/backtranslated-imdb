This movie was long and boring. It's amazing to be elected in Cannes, even though they like disrespect. Unlike the Dutch genres of art such as Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels deserted. Even more, it has no cinema quality. A long break does not mean deep cinema, it's just a boring movie. The story was not interesting and the characters had no problems with any kind of identification. The actors were not corrected and sometimes seemed lost. Leopold tried, but he was not a talent. Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop? There have been some waves in the Dutch cinema. Leopold has made another attempt.
