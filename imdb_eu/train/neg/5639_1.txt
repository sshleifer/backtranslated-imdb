I watched this movie today after hearing the Haifa Film Festival in Israel, but the critics thought they were just sucking Willem Defoe and his wife (director). Without a doubt, I have ever seen the most slim and ridiculous scene I've ever seen. In spite of being a decent player, two other two and a half people including Defoe's wife, Giada, were amazing (the part of the sale of the bakery was thrown over me). This movie is a bit less plot to be abstract and out of the wall. The only scene that caused any reaction to the people was plain and it came from nowhere to add a certain amount of shock to the sadness of these films. Sorry for being so hard, but really this film is wasting time and money. I appreciate the good Indian filmmaker, but this movie is not for film lovers.
