I saw this feature at the Asian American Film Festival in New York and I was terrified of the graphic, masochist and spectacular pornography of the child. Sexual scene language is hidden behind many graphics, and no one is a bit erotic, the patient is feeling more. The director seemed to have a great deal of excitement, but why these characters are why they are going to study. See that in the stomach - I still have flashbacks.
