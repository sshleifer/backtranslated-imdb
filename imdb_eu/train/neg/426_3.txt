I'm not mistaken, the movie is beautiful, the shots are spectacular and the material is dramatic. However, it was a great disappointment and I was very angry at what Disney did. <br /> <br /> <br /> That's all, especially BBC Earth It was subtle. He showed the general balance and the whole circle of life and death. Tragedy and victory, loss and win. It was balanced. <br /> <br /> Disney's Earth Edition is not that. Americans would try to make them talk movies. They made DRAMATIK They've got a music score up there to scare you there. The prey were wrong. WALRUSES was wrong. All meetings were negative. She wanted to be suspicious and successful, but in the face of the lesson of equilibrium. The film was a negative portrait of an hour and a half and only 10 minutes were positive. <br /> <br /> I'm warned to avoid general warnings, but this was all political and environmental. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that I went to the big screen, but I was disappointed with the quality of the image. It looked better on home TV. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like this and take the whole picture, buy it, rent it or borrow it from the BBC Earth Earth series. Better students, better sound, and better Blu-ray image quality.
