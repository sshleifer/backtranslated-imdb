I think it's one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Identifying the "identical characters" with different people is a bad idea. If Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P. are not going to get this, they just have to lose their losses and said heck. Instead, they get new actors with horrors. I felt seriously when I felt playing in the lever in a university or (bad) at the university. <br /> <br /> Where will some of these people come out? Was the first movie? It sure seems. <br /> <br /> This movie also has native languages ​​in a few conversations. First I saw the first one and I joined # 2. I turned to see the second and it was the worst show I ever saw. I almost never EVER * shut down a movie, but this will definitely go away after about 30-40 minutes.
