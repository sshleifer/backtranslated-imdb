This movie had a potential, but Lindsay Crouse's performance is very bad. I've never seen anything before and maybe some of Crous fans are like something else, but the performance of this movie is a bit bad. <br /> <br /> His delivery is robotic. When he delivered the lines, he showed that he was trying to make sure he had the correct lines and was reading in his head list. So the voice is very small. I can not believe that a film that has played a bad role in the movie. The population must know someone. <br /> <br /> Now, I mean to say I'm hated, but the comment should be "this", and its performance is more than anything else. </ p> <br /> However, I liked the story where I was, so I saw it. The first episode of the script has a good movie adaptation. But the end was too disappointed. Perhaps if it was a better performance, I'd like it.
