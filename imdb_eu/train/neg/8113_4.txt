POPEYE AND BIG FOOT **; POPEYE ENGINE COMPANY **; HELP CONNECTION ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> I had children raised before, but I caught a series of three cartoons series a few years later (that is, before) RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [1953 ] Theatrical performance of the pirate yarn movie), I see how they do not keep it right! The character of the Pope is not particularly sympathetic to the beginner, Olive Oyl's remarkably vigorous and Bluto's theater did not get much interest? In short, the scripts were alarmed by alarms, incredible horrors and, in general, not enriched. They have a direct rate for young people, but today's kids can have patience to be patient! Also, the animation style is not appealing. <br /> <br /> If I take each short, I think they have improved the other: after the initial blow, it turned out to be in poor quality, so is it that third cartoon really likes? Popeye pet is in the hands of a goat army, because hunger is awful because it does not end the wickedness (hardly an original, I know it, but it's always nice). An interesting item was here: Popeye gave moralist headphones to audiences.
