Ladies Man is a fun movie. You're not thinking about that, but what do you expect from a SNL movie? It is much better than most SNL films (ie Superstar or A Night at The Roxbury). Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell are both very entertaining. Chris Parnell was also very entertaining in his short scene (one of the most entertaining movies). In addition, the rest of the cast is an average and there is only Meadows to help. I have seen the most entertaining films ever, but I've also seen favorites. Again, it's not a deep movie, but it's laughter. Although it was a fun thing. But, though, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, I'd recommend this. Just do not think too much, or you hate it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 6/10
