The false accusation is that John Wayne (John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (Kansas Charlie) pursue changing identities to "Alias ​​Smith and Jones". Mr. Wayne becomes "John Jones". Mr. Chandler is supposed to be "Rev. Smith," but Wayne calls him "Doctor Smith." There are never any entertainment like Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris or Ben Murphy; However, Wayne can be more successful than any of these, a wise career. Beautiful blonde like Mary Kornman (Anne), from "Our Gang", comes from Wayne. She and Chandler have pretty scenes with Wayne. If John Wayne is not a quote for small movies in the 1930s, you will not have a movie.
