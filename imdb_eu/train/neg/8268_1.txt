This movie is awesome. There everything has been done. There is nothing original. I can not stand when the writers come with their plots. <br /> <br /> A girl wants her 13th birthday and she wakes up as an adult. Hmm, it's like a movie called 80's. It's more annoying to play Jennifer Garner. At 13 he does not play, it acts as stupid. <br /> <br /> From there you can invent the whole plot. He works well and a friend of about 13 works with him. Wow, awesome! But, no ... he's a bad friend and he's trying to get his job done. But, of course, he ultimately earns it when it comes up with an "excellent" idea. <br /> <br /> Thousands of times I've seen a dance scene in the movie. > <br /> I hate this movie.
