These reviewers are all right. Over the years I've seen bad movies, I believe, and this has won a lot! <br /> <br /> This is not the loss of time "just so bad it is good", but true, hilarious, film atrocity. <br /> <br /> Check out the kind of white furry monster! <br /> <br /> WETSELF your laughter Thom Christopher's "spell-tile" acts at a pace! <br /> <br /> GAPE ZEHAR A ** E-CLINING DISBELIEF! in set sets! <br /> <br /> This is one of the "European co-productions". Not surprisingly we have so many wars. I swear, people in the 'Wizards of the Lost Kingdom' do not know that they appear in a movie! <br /> <br /> Truth! Originally I watched the movie HTV Wales one night later one night with headache and sleep deprivation. A few weeks later I had to find a copy to make sure it was really great. Da Even worse with The Majors's The Norseman, more ruthless than John Derek's films, that is, Citizen Kane Trash.
