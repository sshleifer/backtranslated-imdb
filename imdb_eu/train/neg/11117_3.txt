Spooks is a nice trash with well-targeted sequences, hilarious parcels and conversation, and a third rate similar. <br /> <br /> Many have described "24" as a UK version, and we can see similarities. <br /> <br /> The American version distributes plots of land but the execution is so demanding, more confident and suspicious, expensive. <br /> <br /> Some people describe a "soft comedy" as a weak comedy. . <br /> <br /> This is a gentle, smooth spying, contrary to what John Le Carre has done. <br /> <br /> Give me up on Smiley day.
