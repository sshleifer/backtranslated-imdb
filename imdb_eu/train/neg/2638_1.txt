Okay It's wrong. And then Sentinel is the "political thriller" in the bottom of the barrel, which is one of the worst movies ever seen. The plot of a Mole of the Secret Service is good, but there has never been such a great potential. Under the guidance of Clark Johnson, all the actors in this movie seem to work on an autopilot. Even though Michael Douglas gets bored. I can hardly say that I have never seen, in my whole life, other films with so many brilliant plots. Predictability is a breakthrough, and the reason for the character is so ridiculous that the audience inspired laughter. Avoid at all costs. It is the destruction of an unfamiliar movie.
