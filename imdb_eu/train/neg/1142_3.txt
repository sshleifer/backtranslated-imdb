The hard statements about "Femme fatale" / "guns n 'gals" have frustrated and frustrated you! Now another race will come up without restoration: ninja movies! I have seen many of them and let them know what they will say! They usually do not adapt to the point. All this, of all, has no originality! What should a ninja do to prevent the Russian holocaust? And is not it supposed to be a "martial arts" movie? Is there a lot of tires like an incredible action movie for you? Is it the main reason to kill blood? Will you waste a part of your fortune on a lady who sings in her spectacular cannon? The answers to these important questions are found in THE NINJA MISSION, which should be in the martial arts section of your video shop. For a fun ninja of nonsense, try to study Godfrey Ho film by Trans World. You get what you deserve, and that's the promise! Only Hardcore Ninja Toxikommares are recommended!
