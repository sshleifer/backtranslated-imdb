I was very interested in the high score in that movie (8.5) and I was very disappointed. I saw two foreign films good and I expected three consecutive lines, but it was not. I went with a friend in Spanish. There is not a large plot, if any. I do not necessarily need a movie, but somehow I must entertain or take it. I can say that I want to have an Altman-esque movie with a very small set. Of course, there are a few moments, but in a few moments they stop for 97 minutes. I do not know the high score for this movie. I give it to 3rd. <br /> <br />
