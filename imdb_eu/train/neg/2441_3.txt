"Intense care" I thought it was pretty bad and very funny. But, at least, it was not as bad as I thought. It's sometimes suspensful, but it's never boring. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD <br /> <br /> Funny is at the ridiculous moments. But it's time for the classic moment: Peter (Koen Wauters) is a killer. Run in the corner of the corridor. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels next to her and asks "Peter, I'll give you an assistant." <br /> <br /> This movie was filmed in Dutch and English. To pay for costs, all the cards are in the USA and the news studio background is in the skyline of Manhattan. Very funny if you see the Dutch version of Holland and Holland.
