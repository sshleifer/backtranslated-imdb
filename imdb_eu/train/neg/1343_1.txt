We bought this movie in a store called Poundland. We were looking for more inspiration as we bought the previous movie No Big Deal. <br /> <br /> We expected this film to be a weird inspiration, to redo it and put it on the tube. However, it was moving. BORING is the main word that comes to mind. Bad effects and scripts are not enough to watch. It seems that the main body of the woman at the right time has been a pathetic attempt to keep an eye on the audience. However, he asks you, did they knock the budget off of your clothes? If so, I would ask for a refund! It's like a home movie, the shots do not combine with each other, and the cameras are so amateur and they are professional ressellers of our bad films. I do not think selling this as a product for sale. <br /> <br /> THE LOAD AND WEEK is watching. Actors are bad and there is no level of professionalism about it. There is no word to describe what is horrible.
