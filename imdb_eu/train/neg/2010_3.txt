Oh, it's a movie - I thought I'd wait for a long time to get out of the dog ... I can not believe I saw everything I saw. I think it was a better improvement. A terribly unbalanced dialogue, pathetic play and totally uncertain events. He hangs like Toby's mother when he climbs up the Col, and at 24 ', he could go upstairs and downstairs into a room and raise a room, and chairs, counters or suspended on his cellphone. The daughter of the last family's daughter was the best actor in the whole movie, and the first couple's dog was a second close. The basic story has a potential and good scriptwriters and directors might be a short film, but this version unfortunately is not. I get more scared every month when I open the electric billing.
