The first episode of this new show was today, and it was horrible. Shaggy is far from ignoring the crying voice of his lines, not far from the original concept and animation style known as "Scooby-Doo" show. When Fred and Velma disappeared and Scooby's Scrappy nephew was also in dark days, the team still repaired mysteries. This new show, in spite of Shaggy and Scooby James Bond's super-evil and its neighbors, are fighting. There is no van called 'The Mystery Machine' (and a transformer-type robot car has ordered the presentation of the next episode, NOT a favorite in my mind). How can I get Scooby Doo and do this? <br /> <br /> The show earns two points with the whole Scooby Doo gang, that is, except Shaggy, which is why I am very generous.
