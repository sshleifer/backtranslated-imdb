YouTube has seen a better production quality! I'm looking for compassion for the actors, because it has been a great writer and a great director, I do not know how to get the lines - Of course, it was a good thing to get any movie star. The characters were not developed, and there was no real cohesion on the plot. It's really bad, it's a good movie premise and a better production quality, director and script could be a decent movie. Certainly, it was not a comedy, if you laughed at dubbing, it was nightmare, even if the English actor seemed strange.
