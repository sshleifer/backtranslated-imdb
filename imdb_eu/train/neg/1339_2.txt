A sad and dull view, in fact, is the Munster Revenge. Munsters takes it for the last time (Fred Gywnne has received a paypal to return to the role of Herman Munster), this grandchildren and herman engraving movie television series. In the city, a mom's show was prepared to rob a mummy. Along with the police, two-year-old TV icons prevent anyone who is really behind the crime to clean their names. We put on the evening dressed for the waiters (the small high point of the movie), my grandparent turns it into a wire attached to a couple of times (I think it's flying to Transilvania. I think Herman often travels). relative relative "Phantom" constantly sings and breaks glass ad nausium! The most sad thing is to point it out: Gywnne (especially) and Al Lewis looks so stingy in all scenes, so it does not matter to the material. The values ​​of school production are the robotic clothes they look after. Maybe the script is ridiculous. Sid César crazy, most unfunny antics. Or maybe he is watching something happy and wonderful memories, a baby who treats K-Mart fashion superstar makeover. In any case, the result is disappointing and bad in terms of standard Munster. As for the rest of the work, Yvonne De Carlo is inadequate in her role (even though she has shown more than a couple of years of experience with a female woman with experience). K.C. Martell Eddie Munster is always so unpleasant. Jo McDonell Marilyn is attractive. Bob Hastings mentioned Phantom looks and behaves and speaks absurdly. The film offers a real sense of emotion, even for a TV movie.
