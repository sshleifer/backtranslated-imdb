If I had ... I would like to have a crucifix on a wooden cross! I still try to determine the plot of this movie - and I am "generous" when there was a plot in the beginning. As we have already mentioned, Richard Dreyfuss is wrong on the cover of the DVD player. It was hardly in the movie. And if he was "frustrated" when he pointed to the back cover, well, that's probably he said he was in the disaster of a movie and he can not get it out! The film actually focused on Jared Martin, and excepting the extreme roles of the film, Gene Barry's role was not much mystery. . And when "Barry Genre" talked about a bright idea of ​​dressing up on a Humpty Dumpty outfit, the trousers showed literally drawn trousers, the film should be punished. This movie could be immensely awful, in the "actors" mouth (think Clutch Cargo), I could continue to converse with scenes and scenery on the other side (generously generous picture drawings generous). scene "), lack of plot ... However, if you were a bad genre of the early 70's and if you're in a box at a Michigango farmhouse and in a children's and cat's image box, I'd recommend having a good bottle of wine before starting a strange movie, thank you You will not remember the next day!
