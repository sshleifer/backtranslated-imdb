Dancing was probably the only one in charge of this film - and it was even less compared to other films. My gawd! <br /> <br /> For me, this is the worst movie, it's an artwork, because it has all the rumors of film art. Yes, it's a very good picture, but ultimately there's a lack of depth and tension around the movie that surrounds the movie. The tug is hard, it's hot, it's drama, it's brave, indeed, this movie is not.
