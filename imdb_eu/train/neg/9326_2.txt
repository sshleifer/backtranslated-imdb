I and a group of friends rent a great video to laugh at them, they have taken the money they thought they had but they laughed. Sick It's one of the most entertaining horror movies we have rented. It's done in the plot, in general, your friends get into the woods and never get back the old thing. The most common part of the movie would be to visit the local butcher's shop, except the senseless ones, and the blood you are looking for meat in the theater you are looking for. And if someone had the fear of this movie, at any time, Cartoon Network would be for life, it would be pathetic. The good part of the movie is that the two girls are hot, the other one looks better and the other is naked in the movie. Other good parties, this movie is so bad that it's so bad that you laugh until you cry. I do not like watching the tremendous behavior or rent of these horrible videos, I do not find fun, but people are making great efforts and it is still so bad that rent is ridiculous and deserving. I would recommend someone to fall for someone else. <br /> <br /> If you're laughing at your rental / purchase, I'll give it 8.5.
