Marilyn Miller made three films before her first death - SALLY FAVORABLE (1929), HER MAJESTY LOVE (1931), comedy and strange thing - SUNNY (1930). It's quite bad as an early talk and as an attempt to make music - it's four dance numbers, but it only sings two songs (WHO? And ONE MAN ALONE). The rest scores include the title tunes, but we can hear the latter in the background. Miller looks overweight and has amateur - not the quality of the star. Even though his dance is clear. The movie is very badly written, which includes jokes and stupid situations. If Miller is interested as an interpreter, check it out, but for general entertainment, follow it.
