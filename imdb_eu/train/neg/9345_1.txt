I feel like I was, con well, do not fall. After reading clear reviews (Director has been a movie reviewer for Sky over the years, so he has to be a lot of friends in the press to be able to write comments with him) Good event, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, interesting. Land development and poetic moments. Unfortunately, 'sixteen years of alcohol', criticism has not delivered promises, most of them sacrifice these features instead of special cheesy quote special effects (what was this clich√© on the cobweb scene?), Realistic fighting choreography and headless narrations, clicking changes and camera angles . <br /> <br /> 'Twelve years of alcohol' is interesting because it starts with some beautiful Scottish locations, but it goes down from there. Unfortunately, instead of spending some time with an atmosphere set, it was the creation or suspension of the characters we care for. The director will make you mad, with a heavy hand made voice. The main components are so sympathetic and so bad they act. Audiences do not care about what happens, because they are desperate things that are desperate for the actor ... like this movie! If you want to make a mistake, a "tribute" (the director who tries to pay his former masters) is totally topical or convincing. The soundtrack that raises me and is the only thing that was in the movies, but even less, the dramatic narrative begins on the stage. <br /> <br /> For some reason the movie was worse. and being quite honest. I have seen everything yet! <br /> <br /> I think I liked the essence of the wonderful realism of the movie, but when it was dissolved, they often cut out curious and abstract scenes, sometimes without any point. You do not need a lot of money to make the movie moving. He has said so much about making a few money, half a million is not a bit of money ... NO SOUND! Sometimes I ask what the actors ... Or their agents were thinking! <br /> <br /> If you go over the Indian fighter if you do not have a masochist or a fake ... I do not have my stuff <br /> <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
