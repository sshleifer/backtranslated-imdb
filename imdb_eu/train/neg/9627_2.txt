Okay, I LOVE Ben Stiller, I'm fond of even Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this girl can not play at least. Every movie or sitcom I've seen is very difficult to overcome his false play. It seems that the writer is reading next to him. There was only one good thing about that movie, and Ben Stiller was there. This plot is so used and excessive it is ridiculous. How many films does the same plot of land have? Can we say "the forces of nature?" The plot is so old, but the result is so predictable, it's boring. I knew all that was going on before. He was bored, but seeing Stiller is always enjoyable !!!
