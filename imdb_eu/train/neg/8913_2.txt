When I began my first session on the morning, I thought, "wow, finally, some entertainment." A few weeks ago it was fun ... But we have to face them, although these news items (although some of them can be called) play TOY MUCH "around". <br /> <br /> First, I thought Jillian was breathing fresh air. But seriously, this woman does not have a bit of journalism. Not very professional. Steve is suspended when the audience begins to report a news report. It's just not really annoying when I can see it. <br /> <br /> Jillian is NOT a good journalist. Hell is a celebrity who loves to be a celebrity. That's why it's becoming a celebrity soon to be interviewed. He is not very professional and, most likely, he finds himself more surprising than being an irreplaceable journalist with a relationship with celebrities, and I can say all that. <br /> <br /> Also (delighted) this show has new entertainment. about anything new about the world, the government, the US, or the best interests of the public or what will serve. Likewise, they are responsible for sensationalism, everything that speaks is considered commercial product. On the other hand, their reporters are of interest ... <br /> <br /> I think that "Good Day LA" is aimed at young people and celebrities, and it is definitely not for people who care about the news. <br /> <br /> SIDE WARNING: (I'd rather watch KTLA, but sometimes they're so fun trying to make fun. It's still a bit dull. Oh, NBC's "Today's" ABC's "Good Morning" America "is well ... as long as Diane Sawyer does not become too serious.
