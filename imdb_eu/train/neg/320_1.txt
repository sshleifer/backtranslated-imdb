With Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly one of the most stupid films ever made. Shecky (Sandler) is about a cruise ship server who wants to be a comedian in the cruise ship. First and foremost, the whole movie is not honestly funny or clear. It's so inadequate to be pathetic. Surprisingly, there is little sex or sexual, but the word f is abundant. The quote is very low and it spoils the movies. It is done on a cruise ship, but it seems to have only one money for renting a small boat and 10 money for a boat, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. Initial credits are cheaper, cheerful and pathetic. I hate this movie and they hate everyone else. <br /> <br /> 86 minutes. Choose R language.
