I recently saw the horny comedy, one of my favorite comedies, when I saw the delightful comedy show, laughed until the movie was wounded. So I wanted to see the episode, laughter could be the same, but Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation, American Pie generations, destroys the holes of the first non-dirty movie. Yes, the first movie has nudity, but it's not showing in every scene. Likewise, the plot is the same as the first one, it is not always a complaint with me, but this may be a bit more original. The only thing I'm happy is that the original minimalist actors do not appear in this movie, because they look cute or really stupid, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Melinda has a wealthy family, but they are very happy with Ron and Melinda's brother; Todd is afraid that Ron will do his job. So, they spend a weekend in Miami's bachelor party and thinks Todd thinks he'll catch Ron. That's why Melinda will change her mind about marriage. <br /> <br /> Bachelor 2: The Last Temptation laughs somewhere here and there, but more than anyone fails to get that first film. Ron's friends were more pleasurable than Seth, it was really fun. The only other character that is not Seth is Ron and Melinda. The others, more or less, get your nerves. Want to watch this movie? Just Girls to watch Gone Wild, it's the same thing, but he does not try to guess a movie. Stick to the original bachelor's party, that is, a movie to get tears to smile on tears. <br /> <br /> <br /> 3/10
