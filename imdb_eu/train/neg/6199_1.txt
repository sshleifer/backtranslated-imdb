First technical review. The script is very slow, it's a 25-minute story for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The conversation is so flat and really dimensional. "Playing" is pathetic, it seems that children out of school have really left the classroom to read some lines. In terms of the "point" of the story, it is "a bad war" (oh, there is a shock!) It does not really exist. "It's a great opportunity to vote and get great advertising" without being a scene, nobody would talk about this movie. It's so bad for me to really think of what's really good money for me. Believe me, I've seen bad reviews of "Emperor's new clothes", but the things I'm saying for you are well shot and well-done, while the camera is going through these two scenes! Read all other reviews - Avoid at all costs and not talk about it.
