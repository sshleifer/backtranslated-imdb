This horror movie is the best of Renny Harlin. This story is pretty routine, but it's really a lively atmosphere; In fact, the fantasy story is almost a thought. True horrors come from imprisonment, and Renny H. does not show exactly how bad the hell is in these hell (sadistic guards!) Viggo Mortensen is an excellent routine, protected by some very real-looking prisoners There are pretty guys in this cast.) Horror fans should check this out.
