I'm 47 years old and I've spent so much time as I remember, a fan of horror and science fiction movies. Quietly, in black and white, with no budget or budget, I'd like to find something that you can use very little. That said, I will give this movie credit to get good results and gore, but that's all. It's the case with story effects. It's true that we lived in a time when we did not see the horror movie. That's why it's really a good and original story to really entertain any type of movie. A good story can overcome bad effects and bad performance, but a good performance and good effects still have a bad film. This movie does not have good performances, but good effects. So if you can only make gore, pass this.
