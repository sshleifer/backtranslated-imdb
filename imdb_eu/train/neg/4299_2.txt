This is one of these horrific B movies, play anywhere with no theater. Women wear around the "bunny" outfits. A very fat woman tastes most of her favorite jokes and works for a dirty old man's restaurant (Jim Hanks, of course). Tome brother), the man wants to "set himself up". Hanks is really good, but this film is nowhere and there is no reason. Ask why it was done? However, Hank's performance and some moments have been entertaining (but more than a few), he has received a star "2" star 10. I think that's nice.
