My brother is in love with this show. I'm very pleased with people who told them to copy Dexter's Lab and Fairly Odd Parents. <br /> <br /> I have never liked a pretty curious parent, I mean, some things make me laugh, but most often it's very wrong and it's not very nice. This is the way I feel about Johnny Test. NO, NOTHING that makes me laugh at this show. Gag are so stupid and absurd, and in truth, maybe it's just for me, but the kids do not have such a Garment! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is horrible, but that's why! <br /> <br /> And Dexter's lab was one of my favorite shows and I still do not like to see it. That disgusted and embarrassed me to get the absolute Johnny Test JOKE out of that wonderful show! <br /> <br /> Another thing. The. Dog There is. So annoying. He's more wicked and repulsive than Johnny! And gay accent? What fudge is! I hate the dog to death and I hope he will die, because they see him better than seeing the bad dude that children are following in this show, and that includes gay accents. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
