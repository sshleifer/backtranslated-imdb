I've seen a lot of movies in my life, but not so bad. It's a fiery movie that has no real story, it's bad actors, it's not fun or much more. Do you want to watch this movie? I do not think so! <br /> <br /> I think that the creators of the film wanted to be original and creative, but it seems that a 12-year-old child has no cinematographic skills. Fun names are fun in people's faces, or as broken winds. If you want humor, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie!
