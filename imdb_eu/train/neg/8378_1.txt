This movie is probably the worst film I've ever seen in life! The plot is ridiculous and the whole "Little" is not so absurd. The whole movie is not realistic and silent. Let's see, it's just "Black comedy". This is not an unnecessary thing to ever have been for theater. Jokes are not fun and acting is awesome. Please save your money instead of seeing dirty money. I had been sitting in Little Man for an hour and a half to get my eyes to peek. I'm sorry to think of something like that! Who wrote it rough? Actors have no talent, such as how to get people to Hollywood? Money is being littered!
