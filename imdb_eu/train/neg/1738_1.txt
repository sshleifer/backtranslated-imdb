This miserable film is a remake of a 1927 movie. They should leave that way. <br /> <br /> What a terrible bomb! Douglas Fairbank shows no charisma. Cesar Romero acts as a real jerk and sings the song Bette Grable. What will I do with the Hungarian! <br /> <br /> A picture of a young woman in the earth's plot is done. 1561 Rome saved that day when he conquered the conquistador. (Fairbanks) Now, let's move on 300 years later, married to Romero, is in a similar situation with Grable, in front of her Hungarian nightmare invasion tonight. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Romero takes action and escapes before the army arrives. It disguises itself as a gypsy and will remain in the castle when Fairbanks plays violin. The worst thing to end is that Grable's Fairbanks will find the worst movie, that is, an angry Romero has neglected his marriage. <br /> <br /> The poor imitation of a film was made in 1948. Like Harry Davenport. her veteran veteran assistant, died in 1949; This must be his latest movie. What a bomb that should make a horrible journey. The clothes are like resemblances to those that would come out of the stone age. I can not understand what Fairbanks was wearing.
