!!!! USE LIGHT MILD !!!!! <br /> <br /> GUILTY AS AS I saw the first part I saw in 1993 because he played in the middle of the JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas clone. Decade of 80 He starts murdering and the audience say: "Is he guilty of being innocent and he's going to bed with his lawyer?" But in the middle of the film he shows the initial credentials of the 90s "he gets a lawyer." manipulates and gathers his clients "a film that ends up in a surprisingly surprising way, and GUILTY AS SIN is even more hilarious in that regard. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad thriller, but it's just that impossible. Sidney Lumet It is the same man who brought us into the classical drama of the 12th judge of ANGRY MEN
