"Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing that Chuck Jones's classic characters create. "Loony Tunes" have spin-offs and different versions; Some good ones, others are not. But Loonatics is the worst thing. The concept is stupid and influenced by "The Power Rangers" and "Teen Titans". . No similarity to the original characters and stories are boring and misunderstood. The new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic. This show does not work. This horrible footage of animation is a complete failure and this should not be a bad joke. Lame! Zero stars
