Maybe TV will be as sleepless as one day. Perhaps "Big Brother" was Stephen Richard Bachmann's first step to describe King's first step. But enough about that. If I talk a lot about talking about the key issue of this movie, I'm doing everything I expect from the producers. The same thing happens with the 6th day. It does not matter, which is the primitive film that discusses its subject, which will serve as advertising for producers. Let's not take that. This summary is suggested by the social critique, which is the only alibi, the creation of a speculative and violent film that allows more than cinematic films. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book. I do not dare to criticize Stephen King without reading it, but when I saw the movie I could not make a horrible movie through a good book like this: in the 1980s, he set up regular music and small actors with Arnold Schwarzenegger. The TV is found as a police escaping within a cruel show. Encourages audiences. <br /> <br /> Together with Predator, this is undoubtedly the stupid Schwarzenegger movie. 2 stars 10
