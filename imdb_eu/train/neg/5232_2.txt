Becky Harris is a female buyer, wrong in the store for the wrong time to be in store, and of course, the only thing he wants to do in this movie is to give him a reason to dress remote control! Miss Harris seems to be in the age of fifty years or more. After making red hair for children, it is clear that AARP is not a queen. These are never some of the best celluloid visual assets. In my opinion, I have to enter someone. In my opinion, it is absolutely amazing and I literally wore my copy of VHS capturing its charm. I would like to know if this video is available on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie has not been mentioned. I expected much to be persuaded and intelligent. However, I was disappointed with two issues. God blesses Becky Harris!
