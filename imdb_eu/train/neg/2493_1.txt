A really awesome movie. I did not know at first that Kiwi was an effort. However, very soon I began to realize that all the characters talked about little kiwi dressed up under false Americans. Why should America set anyway? - It can be set to NZ and then the actors can use their regular voices. Undoubtedly, a production team can hear incredible attempts to speak about American accents? Bad cinema I am amazed how long has it lasted - how did you get the cane out? The attempt by a man from Segal / Willis seems to be a bad thing. Money waste unnecessary! SERVICE was money in the trash, I would drive a revolution to return all the money to the Treasury. I'm still killing myself (I've seen, "" punch! "), I've just seen the absolute garbage. Why do I still see? Well, I'm!
