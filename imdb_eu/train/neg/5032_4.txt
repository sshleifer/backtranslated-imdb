This movie was a friend of a science fiction 50 pack at Christmas. Gozilla's first movie is very similar, and like this movie, scenes with American actors are not a real reason. There is an interesting thing about the seats inside the Cold War that is depicted between America and Russia. Like Godzilla, Gamera is waking up at an explosion and atomic attack around the world, paying close attention to Tokyo, when there is no monster, because Tokio does not bite Tokio. In short, this movie is fine. Some of Gamera's scenes, especially the Tolias scenes, are very spectacular and have special effects at that time. If you like Japanese monster giant movies, you really get a shot. I give 10 to 10. If it was a Japanese non-version version, it probably would be 5.
