Recovery is a play that is a play in this drama and the scene of fireworks from the addictive line that is later produced is dissolved by absurdity. Why would a man make contact with the gangster about contacting the contemporary wife of the mainstream? Why would a unhappy wife be encouraged by all the unknown and would expect her husband and boredom to be happy? Without a doubt, the hero, here Kevin Costner, hoped the film was the husband of an excuse for violence and violence without a husband. Anthony Quinn, an excellent actor, was surely worth it, and Madeleine Stowe is a tragic figure who is very much in love with her charming prince. Stowe is fine but his Spanish accent does not work. The smaller players' cameras are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland is an amazing rock star.
