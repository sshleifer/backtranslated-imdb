I can not believe that I lost five hours of my life about that garbage. This author had a very nice five-day offer and I really expected that. The majority of the conversations were completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the main culprit, whose lines were mute or fake, but most of the rest continued his example. Exceptional exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, since the old tongues were exemplary. Do producers listen to productions before they can be heard in the conversation? As a result, I think I missed what happened and, as the metamorphosis of the original plot, among Muslims and the rest, I soon lost interest. It was a climax against the whole end. Completely wrong.
