It was not one of Keaton's best efforts, perhaps, a hidden attempt to avenge the family he married - Talmadges. A Polish / English fence and some coincidences bring Buster to marriage, because they treat him with a great Irish woman (with her father and her brothers) with misfortunes. The bad identities that are taking place here are numerous - they are set by gag and generally do not pay. <br /> <br /> This little subway has at least two real laughs - Buster rotates his dinner with the calendar. The basic ignorance of the family and the family taken literally brings meat to the plate. The other is a family photo and the whole team falls to the ground because the camera tripods lose its stability. <br /> <br /> The brewing of yeast beer was built, which could be a catalyst for a large range of gags. At gag, but there is a short development (to achieve all the development). <br /> <br /> The Kino form is very clean and lightweight and a score is for players for piano, battery and sound effects. Buster's best no effort, but he lacks a lot of laughter.
