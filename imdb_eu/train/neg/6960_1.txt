After watching the first 20 million observations of Blanche (I could not take any more sorrow), I have now confirmed that it is not. <br /> <br /> Basically, this "movie" is an insult to the real French actors involved in this silly piece. It is based on a concept used successfully in the French comedy ("Deux heures moins le quart JÃ©sus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs", ...): anakrous historical theater / theater interview. This can give you excellent results if you admire the great actors and the dreadful "heavy comedy" continues to be a terrifying stigma. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Lou Doillon's knight face and Blanche ruin them. Comedy becomes a horror movie. He is afraid of filmmakers who are terribly surprised and amazed to see such good actors as Decaune, Zem or Rochefort, fighting in the midst of this evil kitchy-prissy farts bubble.
