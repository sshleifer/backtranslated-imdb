Omega Code was a model of film inconsistency. The effect was a bit solid (but a little bit), especially the two prophets and Rostenberg, who appeared only once and had no lines. Otherwise, acting was crucial. The ground line is quite weak, and at the same time, it is based on doubtful Biblical interpretation. Certainly not the best year.
