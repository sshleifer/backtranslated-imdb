The word can not describe the story as stupid (and therefore this bad movie)! Basinger, Del Toro ... what did you think? So there is a shopping center and its parking lot is full. Basinger's character buys a cup of tea and some packaging paper. <br /> <br /> When it comes out, the whole place is empty, that nobody will hear a near shot? Although he lives there, when he goes away from the wicked, he goes to the most distant and divine places, to a nearest police station or at least a crowded place? IT WAS !!! I will never enter the red-hot tool, as others have done before. Let him know how to kill a boyfriend one by one. <br /> <br /> This is so stupid, with no logic, I only warn, it's ALL of the time, honestly !!
