The movie is the worst year. The main characters have no chemistry and the play is horrible. Paul Rudd is the only and only annoying talent. I have never seen Desparte Etxekoandre, so I do not know how Eva Longoria is in that show, but this was a great film. Just like the play does not know anything. All his characters perform throughout the film, and he can not get out of b **** and it can still be fun. And the other girl, Lake Bell, shows little emotion and looks like reading the reading cards. In the story, such as a cookie cutter. A little surprise comes from A-B. Kate could be much more with a ghost. Plots around things and things like spirits should be more. <br /> <br /> LAST MINUTE: It is not worth seeing.
