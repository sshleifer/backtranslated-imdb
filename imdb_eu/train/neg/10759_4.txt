Despite the great touches of the design of the future, Asimov's fast premise and Will Smith's excellent performance, the movie is not a hope. Clays are thick and fast; (When a desperate nightmare wakes up, the police maverick has removed his plate from a tough lieutenant, the more he would list it would be ruined) you'll see the end mile off). This movie is also a scenario; You never felt sorry; The global disaster does not leave CGI Chicago, of course. Robots are very well, but the 'crowd' scene is a bit more dismal with Disney-CGI more and more. If you can destroy the robots, why do they need to "inject" nanotubes? I know a duff movie is like that stupid question before you start thinking about it. It could be great, but it is less than the sum of its sections, especially for the prediction of a plot that can be derived from any action from the last forty years.
