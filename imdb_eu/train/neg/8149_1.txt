What is an absolute pile of pants? Since reading Chris Brookmyre's books from a religious perspective, "Quite Ugly ...", I was happy to know that this performance was being asked. <br /> <br /> I had too much faith too. <br /> <br /> Probably Nesbitt is the best thing about this show, and it does not even fit enough.
