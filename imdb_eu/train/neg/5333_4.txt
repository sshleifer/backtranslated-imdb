Slapstick mess posing in comedy mode. Elvis Presley plays the Indian bullfight, leaves his home in his desert people in Arizona, Arizona, where government garments have recently invested family beef cattle (which is to be seen). . Peter Tewksbury's director has poor narratives, but he does not take part in making a series of comic-mountaineering evaluations (his social comment is not exactly stated, but Tewksbury has a satirical style and there are some fun scenes there). Although Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell's versatile turns, dizziness is generally considered to be too much and "too much" is at stake. He's still loose and brave around Elvis - and it's nice to be having fun on the screen, but he'll have to ask him if he's given that film at this time. This fall of an image feels hello-hell, and though they are great spirits, they are mostly low. * 1/2 ****
