Jude Law works in a beautifully filmed vampire movie. Eroticism, excitement, or major female appeals are lacking. A decent fight, a few lightweight suspense. And a single note plot. <br /> <br /> The film is published in interviews between Lawson's detective character and homicide detective, well-interpreted by Timothy Spall. But despite the greatest efforts, both actors bring them to the crucible of the movie. <br /> <br /> Starring with a smaller actor and for the benefit of Oliver Curtis's cinematography. Crocodiles would come in. low budget vampire ship.
