This movie is a car taste. See if you want to listen to this film in spoken Gaelic or enjoy a nice soundtrack. Check for any other reason and you will be disappointed. It should be charming but not rhythmic. Caring for characters is difficult and acting is inadequate. The stories of the movie are also charming. I expected an amazing family movie, but that did not have any image of my fourteen year old daughter. I did not see the movie at all until I came to fruition, but this one was one of the best. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is set to date, it looks like a cheap East. European film during the Cold War. The beautiful scenic landscape and cinematography in Scotland is not in the right place. Really embarrassing as a shame about Scotland as a film.
