Townies is one of the most watched movies I have ever seen, and I have seen Blair Witch films (first and second parts). He seems to want to mix. It's not fun enough for commercial comedy, it's not a tragic drama enough, it's not bloody enough, and it's not good enough to see it. We have scenes from a man who makes a "bloody / bloody" car, so I think that this movie will be in line with Avenger Toxic and Street Trash. Then he jumps out without warning to a missing girl, a delayed woman (mentally handicapped) and a drama about a trusted mother. Then, a movie similar to a movie that set it like a scene falls into a single part. The part I am speaking is a lonely lone, who finds himself so lonely and comfortable in a corruptible body. Any feeling that gave me this part of the movie. The rest was on the waistline of my life. Then, how CRUEL Wayne shows how to show DOCUMENTARY at the end of Wayne's film (Director) Toby laughs publicly. It got sick to me. Although Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd (the two other films by Wayne) have not been the best, at least they think that you have enough to finish. Even though I like Killer Nerd, I've had some excellent lines that I still use today. <br /> <br /> If you want to play underground movies, if you like outdoor movies, and want to see your feet, just not rest, you will not like the people! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (outside ****) <br /> <br />
