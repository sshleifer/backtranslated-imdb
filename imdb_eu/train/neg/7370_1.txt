I've seen a lot of seagal movies, and most of them are not very good or, albeit good, with a fragrant pile, this was bad movie. <br /> <br /> Territory: I do not really know. A thing about a wonderful, strong, or something-like drug. Who are good and bad? It's hard to tell. Most of the movies cut scenes in dark cells among Seagals's "Mashall" characters who complain about good character. <br /> <br /> Obstruction: Blows. <br /> <br /> Voice overdue ,,,,, what happened with the overwhelming voice overload?! Could anyone less find a sound like Seagal? Also, Cheech or Chong could hear the voice, maybe it could be fun at least. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring and completely stupid. Avoid all costs !!!!
