That's really awful. <br /> <br /> The only feature of this movie is the only thing that people ask me the next time, the worst vampire movie I've ever seen, I'd be right answer. <br /> <br /> I think shooting at 35 mm is like hell. I would not like to comment, but I noticed some fanboys (probably connected to the movie) since the matrix was the best movie. Let me quit myths and lies. <br /> <br /> No good movie. Everything frightens her. The actress is ugly. The choreography of combat is the worst thing I've ever seen. Wrestling scenes are incredibly incredible. Imagine that a girl surrounds her arms in a circle without protection and gives weak shots that will not end the conflict. Of course, the director only rolled over the street to give people a role in the film. <br /> <br /> I know the director did not have a big movie budget, but before that, better movies have been made in a smaller budget. Unhappy
