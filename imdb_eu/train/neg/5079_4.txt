What is the best actor in a horrible story ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Does not it matter? See a cathedral, you can see it all, so to speak. <br /> <br /> However, the story ... about any man with death and destruction, if he wants anybody else, if any. With a simple reference to the existence of telekinezi instantaneous instances, a narrative, a man, a teenager and, finally, creates a picture of a man who is used as a man; So much so that, in fact, it necessarily requires revenge, literally. Over time, does it conclude that the whole world is in a bad way and wants to destroy a lot? Just think about it! <br /> <br /> The problems of narration try to confuse the scientific data on strange mental powers, all of which is confused with religious religion to create a template. all theory In this way and mixing fantasy, it rarely works? and I'm afraid Richard Burton has tried to make sounds sound enough to attack him several times. His best scene, on the other hand, gave his wife and his lover's mouth poked as he left his house: a sharp, light and lethal interview, he could only deliver Burton. <br /> <br /> A good casting cast. I have seen Lino Ventura's (1981) last time as an inspector Brunel from Lino Ventura. Harry Andrews Assistant Curator; Lee Remick, best known in November, Dr. Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi, Towney, and other characters from famous actors. <br /> <br /> I liked the way I presented the story in order to fill the flashback in the flashback and, thus, I fixed the instant mystery. A murderous attempt by Morlar (Richard Burton), a murderer. Until then, Brunel and his daughter were a good visual detective in English. However, it was very predictable that my identity about the killer appeared very quickly, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Then, in the last fifteen minutes, everything was destroyed. If you want to think about this, think Samson and Delilah (1949), the famous Cecil B. de Mille, and how did Samson get the bad news. And the last scene is just stupid. Why? At least a hundred ways, the forces of Morla could stop completely. <br /> <br /> Sorry, in fact, it could be a much better story and film. I think Burton really needed money. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Burton, give this time to see the scene I mentioned earlier. Otherwise, do not worry.
