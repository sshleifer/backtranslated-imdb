I bought this movie on the car, so I was expecting a horror movie on A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977), but I thought it would still be nice to see it. However, it was not very enjoyable, but the performance and the overall movie was foolish, such as the murder of 'unsees killer' and the death of all young people. women It was a horror movie stereotyped. I say this for the following reasons: 1) Three blonde women are in danger, most of them die. 2) When he was alive, he is running away at dusk while he is dying. 3) An amazing surprise, it's a help shotgun! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Using three easy points, I've saved an hour of short-term horror movie. to not see enough
