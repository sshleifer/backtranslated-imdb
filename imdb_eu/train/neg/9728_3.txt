Tobe Hooper has made some great movies, I am sure that this can not be BAD. I did not read a review and I wanted to see this humorous mistake. Sometimes this made me laugh, sometimes I was asleep, sometimes Hooper almost completely made me in Hooper. <br /> <br /> I rated this 3/10 in 1990's "horror" movies and a lot of interesting or entertaining things. han I was thinking of something similar in the whole movie, "they just can not add more in this movie ..." but they did it. <br /> <br /> Some say it's a clown Firestarter. t. It is based on that idea, but all this. This is a fear, comedy, a funny religion, a funny god, simple effects, drama, horrible acting, an unbelievable script ... and more. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * Story is: Trying to build digging is the last weapon that uses nuclear power or something and fails, during the trial children are born 2 test people. When mom is singing from birth to child, she smokes wives and wives, and is a CONCEPT ACCOUNT. The government keeps the whole thing and lives among other children ... after about a year, the boy has grown, and he realizes that he is born for some reason born and can burn something with his brain. After all, everything is incredible and nothing is wrong. Well, the government realizes that "it's okay now that they can work to make this fire" they usually take to the hospital where they will use what this man will do if they use nuclear BECUS because they will do it . They can die, but they can not shoot anything! .. and argh, I guess it's enough to tell, I promise that there are 100 more strange things in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, if you want to laugh, see this. Gosh.
