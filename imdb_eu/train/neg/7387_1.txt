The DVD was a joke, the sound of the first minutes was awkward with the synchronization and there was no voice in Segals !!!! Pathetic! When audio sync was better than 5 minutes, plots, lines and weaker actors should get another job because the film business would not be the place where they should be. <br /> <br /> Segal had some great movies The first days were a joke and they should be ashamed of him and his company. <br /> <br /> If he managed to manage this seal, it would be better to make another party, because he has no talent at all. <br /> <br /> This film gives everyone a shame to everyone involved in their production and shouts everyone who has seen it. I shut off about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will ask for my money at Block Buster! Market from Ontario, Canada
