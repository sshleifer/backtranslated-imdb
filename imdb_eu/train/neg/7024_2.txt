I borrowed this movie because it was a gay theme, but it was really fascinated with role thinking. I was surprised to have shot in San Francisco because I'm near SF. And, of course, it was nice to see the shots of the Castro district (but the cadres take me more for men than for men). But besides, I can not recommend this movie. The character is not really caring for me for development and when I started to play "role play", I was bored in my mind. And I saw that the role scenes were scary. The play leaves something you want. I do not need to finish the movie. I would throw this out.
