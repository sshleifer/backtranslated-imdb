There is not so much wrong with this film, but summarizing it: The horrible asset, it was so bad. Writer - they can have good ideas but it was not the best way to present the story. It's a bad thing to get rid of in the end, in some cases, at the end of the movie, not in this case. If you get to sit across the movie, you'll have to throw it to the end because it's not worth the wait. The worst film I've ever seen. The whole torture was seated by this movie, I would warn him as soon as possible. So do not turn aside. Check if you have not had to make this movie. Then you will regret that you want to express yourself through torture.
