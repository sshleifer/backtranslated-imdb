How many more "slices of life" are needed? Fortunately, it's not too much. <br /> <br /> Lifting Victor Vargas Hollywood director Peter Solett wants to get close attention. Nothing wrong with that. This film is particularly ill, especially in all the pages that appear in the "production" of the independent production of Hollywood, in the eyes of the audience and the piles. <br /> <br /> It should be "genuine", so they shake the camera except "documentary style", the documentaries would not shake the camera ... <br /> <br /> "It's long," so let's not waste the movie. <br /> <br /> "It's" hip ", so let's use the whirlwinds like A Pacino in Scarface ... <br /> <br /> <br /> And so, etc. Everything that was left out of Hollywood is a huge effort, and it does not surprise anyone who welcomes every "great" indie crowd that strikes out the awesome movie.
