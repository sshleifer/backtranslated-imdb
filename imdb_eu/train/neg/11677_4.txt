When critics talked about death, honesty is not very good. Surely, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same movie, with just suspense changes. But I found "CHAOS" more enjoyable because it is similar to the stupid movie "Swordfish". The reason why this film was well known was released in the United States and "Chaos" was opened worldwide in film festivals and foreign theaters, but it has not yet been found in the United Kingdom and the United States <br /> <br> </ p> <p> It is true that this film has many homages He does, among other things, DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other classic films of Spike Lee, but this does not mean that the film is a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Look at it nowhere else than T.V., but you'll probably get bored a bit.
