Blue Monkey (1987) or 'Invasion of the Body Suckers' (as is known here in the UK) was a horror movie that was quite boring about an old man who bitten by a mysterious toxic plant! The man goes to the hospital, the worm of that creature that comes out of the mouth, of course, becomes an insect monster and goes out! Although Steve Railsback and John Vernon were a movie, it seemed to me to be boring, with a predicted story, unexpected characters, special effects and lack of action! Horror fans do not need to follow this strange movie, you do not lose too much confidence. I will give this movie 2/10.
