Watching the love of insect movie killer is so funny that I had to watch the movie as it was my favorite horror book by Shaun Hutson. <br /> <br /> I know it and I would like to hear it, as this movie said was a terrific sign, but he still told me he was dying, when I saw it as bad. <br /> <br /> Plot: people are mysterious and insolent, and no one has any idea. what is the reason <br /> <br /> Mike Brady has only one healthcare provider, but his bar killers' theory is ruled by the authorities. <br /> <br /> When the body counts begin to rise only and an English rummage expert begins to start around, it seems that Mike has had the perfect idea, after all. <br /> <br /> The movie you ever watched this movie! In this movie, the slugs are fast (then it's normal) and it looks like they look fast. <br /> <br /> This film is not like the book, the book was ten times terrifying, it had ten times more gory and more stories! <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie! The book and second book I'm a fan of Slug Growing land! Both books are good <br /> <br /> After reading the book and watch the movie, you would like it, then give it 2 of 2
