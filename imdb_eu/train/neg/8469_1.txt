"The kids like" could be a decent movie on this topic. However, he has become a television movie for the weekend, but he does not like it. The play is obsolete, the plot is predictable and there is no direction. To get a better movie on the same theme, try to film a brilliant "Le Huiti√®me Jour", a movie that really looks after people with Down Syndrome. "When we like them" they are used only as an excuse for serious feelings. Wonder 1/10
