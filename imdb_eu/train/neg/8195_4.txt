Let my children have fun at Christmas every day to experience another wonderful life. I liked the bad Santa too. Ask me I accept it. Happy, I like schmaltzy movies. I like intelligent and intelligent intelligents, but like so many, the variety is a good thing. What would be the Christmas season without the annual Californian film of Santa, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will not forget Bedford Falls over the course of nine nine months, but I do not think that a Christmas movie should have a great height to succeed. "Fred" is an ideal holiday film, enough for adults and a charm for children. My wife and I laughed, even though the humor stood out and it was only Vince Vince. Paul Giamatti was a senior Santa, who helped a lot. It's not a big movie, and probably everyone becomes a must-see for the Christmas traditions of the year. But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed what it was, with a little species of holiday schmaltz. There's nothing wrong with that.
