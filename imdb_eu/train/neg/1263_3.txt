There is nothing like Robot Wars, like watching huge robots fighting in a desert wasteland. Sure, the play is a bit wicked, the conversation is sub-par, and the characters are single-sided, but it has giant robots! The special effects are very good during their period. Undoubtedly, today's standards are not polished, but they have at least one computer graphics and instead use miniatures, so it's pretty good. His shortcomings are easily forgotten by providing shorts, and he has a moody language in some parts that are quite enjoyable. I would recommend this huge robot or young science fiction enthusiast who is looking for a shining time of distraction.
