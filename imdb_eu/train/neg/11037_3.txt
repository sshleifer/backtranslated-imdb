I love Jim's section that transforms Greenman. It is very good! When Jim throws this little person out of the window, his face does not work. Then, when he begins to go to Priest on his wife's behalf, he knows that he has become a Pee-Woman? Excellent writing and excellent interpretations, with excellent interpretation, is essential. I'm trying to find a specific picture of that episode. I would like to use it as my avatar on the message board because Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know where I can download Jimen Greenman's picture? Is there someone to get the right picture in the right direction?
