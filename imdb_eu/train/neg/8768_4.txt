Now do not start calling me "unpatriotic," "weirdo" and more like names. <br /> <br /> The length of this film itself (4 hours .. !!!) is its biggest mistake. No edition: J.P. Dutta fell in love with her project too. Although Lagaan was 4 hours long - but it was entertaining and given a message. <br /> <br /> Genuine incidents and real people are based. Congratulations, but were the repetitions of the war scene really needed? On top of that, the focus was changed from one battalion to another, and it was impossible to monitor all of them. <br /> <br /> In the battles, there were songs about loneliness, love affairs, and related issues. There were bad conversations. He initially gave relief to violence but later became a monotonous predictor of the future nature of the conference. <br /> <br /> Why were the soldiers walking like the jungle, completely? Did not you know that the enemy was somewhere nearby? And when they shot it, they created sympathy, but they thought their safety was so sharp. <br /> <br /> Music was melody and the letters were overwhelmed but there was no movie. We listen better than the soundtrack to the movie as a pro. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve special mention, when necessary, to clarify humor. <br /> <br /> Outstanding interviews ("Madhuri .. With Love !!"), illogical / monotonous ("Pakistan se zyada" Muslim Hindusthan mein hain "). And all the MCs, BC, C and F, all the words were not really necessary. <br /> <br /> LOC Charmers wants to pay tribute to brave Indian soldiers, but tries hard and eventually fails. Indian soldiers are worthy of a tribute.
