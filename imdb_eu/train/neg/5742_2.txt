I exchanged this movie when I exchanged a friend (fortunately I did not buy it) in the package (it was really bad and ugly) "The last vampire horror" was printed. Having seen this, I thought the marketing campaign was more expensive than the same movie. A teenager "story" (shocked!) Some zombie vampires / creatures start from behind. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of the first attempt at lighting, sound and everything, ten times a holiday video. If the old VHS system is not worse. The film was given from 10 to 10 and the promo-shirts seemed cool. Overall, I do not want movies or splatter movies, but I've seen Braindead and I've watched $ 20 in a budget movie that had ten times better than this crap.
