I'm never into classic movies. Movies like Patton, Going My Way, How Green were My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, With the wind, Lawrence and Kane of Arabia gave me the citizens. However, I would prefer to watch any of these films watch 3,469 times in a chair, every once in Paris to see an American in a luxurious suite ever made. If I do this last, I would surely sleep all the time. <br /> <br /> Color directing and music did not interest me, Gershwin or Gershwin did not. Dance and singing can fall asleep. Conversation with Singin 'in the Rain did not match. Basically, this movie is boring. The only other movie that I was in was Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid. But you can not blame me. I sleep only 5 minutes in the night. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (we can not give zero).
