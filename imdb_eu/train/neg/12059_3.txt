The most important star of Charles Bronson in the 80's was not very good. In 1982, "Death Wish II" began, and when it ended with a giant 89.89 film, Bronson's screenwriters were trying to gradually slacken into each other. "D.W. II" left little imagination as a result of rape and suicide of the daughter of Bronson's character, (they also showed rape and murder with her mistress). The movie "10 a.m." was a great pleasure to take a bath. Nothing recovers. "El Mal que Men Do" and the rest of the "Death Wish" films were immersed in a line between high and upper barf, with serious representations of brutality and revenge. I do not know if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) are making an effort to make an effort, Bronson older than the elderly destroys their grandchildren, or what they do, but their hand-crafted (and horrible scripts) were destroyed by the Pelcule's destruction. The last of these films "Kinjite" is quite well done, but it's really a cake in the misfortune of cinematography. In this film, Bronson: The perverse John sodomizes it; A Pimp needs to have his Rolex watch; A male prisoner may be raped by another prisoner; Other things I'm fortunate to do include notable remarks. A Japanese rape group of a young man is also depicted (thankfully, it was out of the screen, but well understood). <br /> <br /> What did people think about when they made this movie? What did he think Bronson decided to run his career with these horrible films? For anyone interested in the best films, see most of the films from the 60s to the 70s, "Mechanic", "Death Wish", "From Noon til 3", "Once Upon a West in the". , "Red Sun", "Great Escape", "The Magnificent Seven", "Rider on the Rain", etc. ...
