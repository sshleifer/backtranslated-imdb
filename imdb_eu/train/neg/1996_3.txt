The sad little film in 1971 has little resemblance to the Broadway revival. Remember that Burt Shevelove has rewritten the book when he led this revival. I have a belief that the scriptwriter has made a great change from the original version of 1925. In 1974 Jimmy Smith Smith played 'innocent filander' and I thought that $ 1 would bring memories of this DVD. It is not an option. Even though the "Parterre" of "Roland Young" was expected to be seen as "my" part, it was a great despair. They play three songs from the play and they are doing very badly. The classic double, "Tea For Two", is also a virtual solo. The many faces that are known in this 1940 fiasco do not feel proud, and star Anna Neagle is just ashamed. When I feel like I have spent a dollar, I know he must have a bad movie. Another commentary mentioned the version of Doris Day, called "Tea For Two," and it is called theater theater (the original, of course). So those who seek genuine "No No Nanette" can find a more understandable version. han
