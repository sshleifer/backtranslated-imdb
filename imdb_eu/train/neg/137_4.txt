It's clear that Scary Movie makers have found it so easy to find the 'teen slasher' movies. They are incredibly formulas. And if Valentine's been released for a year or so, I'm sure that this movie would also rot. When they saw that, they found original materials to distinguish cries, I know what you did last summer and Urban Legends. <br /> <br /> Valentine does not offer anything new to the genre, although it is a better end than usual, of course, it leaves a lot of space for the inevitable sequel. As always, it brings together beautiful young women dressed in psychotic murderers, when they kill the main character's friends one by one, in the main style. T & A is very visible, no personal development, bad performances, and excessive blood spills. <br /> <br /> What kind of movies I can not do is: who made it? '. The thing is that they are not only revealed because the murderer has been released, and the main character tells the story when his friends are dead. Usually the film was never something clear (for example, the couple's uncle's fishing couple frustrated the father's father's dog). All the people still alive in the movie are "suspects", but they are more "red wines" than suspects. We all know that at this time the main character manages one who does not escape, and when the reason is revealed, the psyche that kills the killer dies. <br /> <br /> Valentine continued to follow this formula. *************** SPOILER !!!!!! (however, the mini-spoiler) *************** Valentine's reason was not revealed, but you should think more about the fact that the movie was not quite typical. teen slash 'way. Only one part of the problem is resolved, and the goal of the lead murderer is not to overcome the bloodshed and almost all die. Does the killer want more or do they really defeat the demons? <br /> <br /> He has not yet become a good film of Valentzin. Instead, he has saved from bad habits, but has not yet been counted. much Anyone who thinks about making another movie in that vein, do not. Originality is so important and it is difficult to get any originals from that genre.
