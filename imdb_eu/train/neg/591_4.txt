Actually, I was really disappointed with this movie. He started very well and created a great atmosphere and suspense, but when he finally reveals the "monster" ... he was psycho-psychiatrist with skin problems ... again. Whoop-de-do. We still do not have another movie nutjob ... We're no longer good enough. <br /> <br /> Reasonably "creep" is really disturbing to look at, and how it moves and sounds extravagant. It makes me terribly terrifying, but I'm sick of renting such a movie, I'm aware of the monster being a man, even naughty, crazy, awful. When I saw the rats of the past, I had a certain hope for the monster-rat monster rat ... When the shame appeared, it appeared when it was revealed. <br /> <br /> Top Hortaz, some of the things in this movie do not make sense. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why does Creep security guard crash? What is "over-supervised" when it's going? I'm a PSICUS and here I am? "It's stupid and it seems that Franka Potent's character prevents her from getting help. <br /> <br /> What was eating there?

It's just an effective movie, but it has wasted so much of it.
