There are a lot of problems in this movie, but I will try the most remarkable and boring. First of all, while the suggestion suggests that the jewels of Manhattan's life are real, ordinary movies and television, something curious and, usually, sexuality. Story lines were thin or unknown, and almost the scene, the camera shoot, the dialogue line and the emotion expressed were completely and completely false. At last I reached the head (something is not something weird for me) after an hour the point arrived. I guess it was directed by fictional directors led by some of the eighth film studios. But I think the director of Mira Nair (at the same time, with the great talented former Amelia) took part in these amazing parts, so perhaps the American director talent has dropped to the well.
