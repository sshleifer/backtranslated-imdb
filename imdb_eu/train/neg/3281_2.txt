I suspected that the movie would be a bad thing. I'm the Duke's enthusiast. The TV series has been on the DVD for three years. Well, I was fine. He saw the family. In general, I wanted to see the jump again and some scenes of bullying were good. In short, the movie was a slow version of the TV show. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson was pathetic. Actually, I can say that they are as significant as the original Daisy costumes, but Jessica Simpson's Daisy interpretation was awful. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle must also be in the grave. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money. If you and my three children have tried and you are a true old Dukes fan, you will be very disappointed.
