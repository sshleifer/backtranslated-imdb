I grew up and saw the loving TNG. I recently saw the ST Voyager series on DVD, and perhaps I was feeling embarrassed with this section, because the difference between different styles and the two shows can not be more. Perhaps the idea of ​​using Riker's character can be used as an opportunity, and therefore, probably, it would be treated in VOY. They may show memories that could be "new" to the public, instead of retrieving old old clips. In this episode, transitions between "memories" and "present" come out and begin at the beginning, and they become very overwhelming when they are overwhelming. Anything that is unavailable.
