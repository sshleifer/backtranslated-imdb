Ironically, though it can make "split", Thomas is a tough actress. <br /> <br /> This movie is included in my memory as one of the most coherent and curious films I've ever seen. So I really like it. <br /> <br /> However, getting more than one star is the only reason why Thomas is an excellent look, and it is fun to look at these tiny muscle muscles in a variety of different ways of gymnastic gymnastic skills. About Eastern European countries (including "pommel horse") A good cap in the center of the town square that uses Thomas to sit on the faces of the town. But let's leave the foolish mouth and try to get emo, and any illusion that its cinematic career can be cut off immediately. <br /> <br /> Thomas had at least no actress at all. All other movies - actors, directors, editors, camera guys, etc. At least it's bad or even worse and most are professional. So Kurt is just as bad as you think. <br /> <br /> I hope the poor Kurt takes money and fled. If anyone asks us to do it again in the martial arts movie, I will bet that Thomas spots on the guy's face.
