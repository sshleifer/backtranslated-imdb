I can not accept this show! Is there a quality that has ever recovered, a fun punishment or a line of line "is not it" the average audience that wants to drown a horny melancholy in a bowl? <br /> <br /> Voices. Oh, these terrible and nasty voices. Immediately dragging a set of fixed cuffs through a slate bag, each character has a hard faculty in his nose in a sharp and confusing voice. He hears sounds like Cosmo soundless jokes, sounds like a stereotyped Vicky musician, and Timmy's father looks like a line that organizes game shows ("Sesame Street" "Guy Smiley"). <br /> <br /> Animation is horrible; as well as "Yu-Gi-Oh!" producers too. She laughed at the terribly bad works of this show. Each character has a dental buck, or a square head, or head, three measures too large in its body. And what about the characters talking broad lines and every smile line, suggesting a photo opener with the president? Then the character of the show is completely moral. Amelia Bedeli, Homer Simpson, and Buddy Lembecken's "Charles in charge" are portraying the characters as real as they were. Usually "realists" are synonymous with "unfunny", which is definitely the case here. Not so much with that slapstick, "The Naked Gun 33 1/3" ... and at least Leslie Nielson were good. <br /> <br /> Finally, the premise of the show (and it's the same in a single, so alert time alarm here): Timmy wants two of his "Oddparent" things, something is wrong, there's always a reason why he can not immediately turn the course and eliminate the damage. , and then everything is fine. Oh, and on one side, Timmy's parents never believe in Vicky complaining about it, and allow them to employ. It may not be a great idea for me, but it does not seem to be a subtle message that children's' show is not going to make any good. <br /> <br /> If you are writing a piece of paper and want to mention the extent to which cartoon life is coming, it must be a great place to start "Parents' Hairstyles". A great example of television producers, they were thrown into an infallible product aimed at children with little or no effort, because they know someone will see it somewhere else.
