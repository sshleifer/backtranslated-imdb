Tomas like "clear" mode; Like "heavy" like Tereza; Or should we ask, to address this question, like Sabina? How much does fidelity serve in a relationship? What professional life can we cut off for our lovers? How much should we participate in the political and social life of our country? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I have not read the Kundera novel, but definitely undoing the movie: I would like to understand that the story has broken the adaptations of the movie (that is, my intention) or if it's sad at the beginning. <br /> <br /> I disagree with most positive comments that were defined by the movie. masterpiece I can only see why. There are many flaws that I see and they follow an example. <br /> <br /> 1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it is very difficult to understand what drives them when they choose. <br /> <br /> 2) "Side" characters are just about to fill in the gaps, but they do not add anything to the story and really ask you. 3) I do not have any similarity to Thomas. Nothing is good for him. So he is selfish and selfish. In a sense, it is not human. But when he confides himself with himself and is under the influence of others and becomes emotionally aware of someone, I can not find a compelling interpretation. <br /> <br /> 4) It can hardly be used by an artist like Sabina. His life in a communist country in 1968. In addition, the three main characters have been very successful in their professions, and it seems strange to me. a) How can Tereza work for a good photographer? b) How can countries that have economic incentives that motivate people to succeed successfully? <br /> <br /> 5) The English-language fake mistakes are the actors. And I'm not my mother tongue too. Besides, it's a Czech letter from Sabina in the United States, which seemed to me very different. <br /> <br /> 6) Many comments were praised by the Prague movie, I think most of it. The film was shot at the location, so it's not hard to give the film an Eastern European feeling, and it's not so difficult for Prague's natural beauty to look good. <br /> <br /> 7) I found the finale trivial. Tereza and Tom√°s, finally, in happy lands, far from the temptations of the "metropolis", the social struggles that move away from the social struggles away from the livelihoods of the citizens, are dying in a car accident. But they die when they realize they are happy. And what? If they were grievously killed, the message from the movie would be different? I do not think so. I thought it was a cheap trick to please the public. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> 8. You see almost three hours, but in the end you do not stop at all. You do not feel empathy, you do not relate to them; Stay on the couch, you can see a lot of events and scenes. <br /> <br /> 9) I hated the "stop restaurant music scene" (some comments were greatly praised). Why has Sabina reacted strongly? Franz why does he agree with him? I really do not see any point. Only what you learn is that Sabina has a great personality and personality. That's it. What's so unique and special? <br /> <br /> After all these negative comments, let me tell you the two scenes that I liked a lot (that's why I've given them two). <br /> <br /> "Naked Women Photoshoot", where envy, jealousy, and Sabina and Tereza insight appear beautifully. <br /> <br /> Another scene is a representative of research after the occupation. Russians in Prague Photos of Tereza are used to identify what is happening to the world in Prague, to identify people involved in rebellion. I found a pretty original and the blame of Tereza's despair is well represented. <br /> <br /> Finally, as the "Types of Types" go, there is a small selection of films that will take the "types of shots". They will like it and they will hate the "Tereza" ones. If that is the case (arguably, no doubt), my comment should be thoroughly reviewed.
