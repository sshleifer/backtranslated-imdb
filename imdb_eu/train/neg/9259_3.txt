'The Omen 4: The Awakening' is the latest TV show on 'The Omen'. Instead of Satan's body with a child, he has a body of a girl taken by wealthy parents, who pursues school at school and who takes revenge on those who do wrong. It seems that the movies are fighting with all horror factors, and many of the incidents are just stupidity, and it's hard to think that this girl is Satan, with all the events around her. I just did not think this film was very suspensory or terrifying, especially compared to the original.
