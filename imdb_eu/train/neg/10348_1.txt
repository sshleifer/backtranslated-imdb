I was very pleased to see that my favorite book was made. I did not know that Disney was too late. I ignored the essential parts of the story. It was like someone's own film in a fourth-grade book. Meg was well at school, and he and his father did not wear glasses. Mrs. Murray (Meg's mother) was not portrayed by many scientists; They abandoned the kitchen lab and replaced it over the Internet. And that's just the beginning. In the middle of the movie, I cried out on the screen, the wrath of the rest of the people watching the movie that was not reading the book. I'd like to have more minutes to give them four fingers. I can say good things about a person who has not read the book is that the movie is fine.
