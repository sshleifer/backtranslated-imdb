This is all the stuff used to make this joke and shame. Personally, I do not care Jessica Simpson in one way or another and his talent or many people are fascinant. Similar to the movie, it could also get a grade in film school. The script is a mess, the play is very late, and I asked Luke Wilson ("Bottle Rocket" writer) to think what he thought. "Old School" cried out! This is not the same as in the DVD "Old School" DVD! Please, FOR ANY REASON, DO NOT LIKE THAT! It seems that a comment is so bad that it is good, but, of course, it is very good. When he can stop watching the singers, if I continue to try, I hope it will end soon. The actor is the worst part, really worthy actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook and Luke Wilson). As for the earthquake, it is not well-existent and so badly written and done (I know it's another version). Without a doubt, anyone will remember anything. Please, you do not waste your time anymore, but if so, I feel that the actors involved are losing time for this bomb. You're nice Jessica Simpson, but singing, though I'm not that fanciful. And whoever made this film, I would not put it in your curriculum. 1/10 you can not give up.
