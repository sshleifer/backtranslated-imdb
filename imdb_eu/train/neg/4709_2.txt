Cartoon Network looks for valuations. Samurai Jack's reboot, the network seemed so exciting to eliminate all the popular shows, such as Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Lab, Dragonball Z, and so on. When the values ​​began to fall, the CN began some beautiful ones. fake shows Although Total Drama Island / Action and Chowder stands out because of the brilliant writing and the great abilities of the audience, there are many other shows, including awesome remakes (George of the Jungle) and corruption of other shows, such as The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, Because the title character is like Spongebob, then it's something like Johnny Test Dexter's lab, though it's a bit more scratchy than anything else. <br /> <br /> The characters of the show It is clear that it is derived from Dexter's Lab; This time, Johnny, Susan and Mary, the twin sisters, Susan and Mary, who looks at Dexter, looks like an orange hair. glasses, impossible technology Bling Boy Bling or Eugene is a genius of opponents, it seems that he is sitting with Mandark. Then, Dookie, Johnny's best friend and dog, a Dexter ... Susan and Mary's first experiments. I mean it. <br /> <br /> Dexter's laboratory probably was one of the best television cartoons. But it's a good art style, the lovable main character, and it does not seem like a trace of long-lasting episodes. Johnny Test is a lot different. Art style is not so pleasing. It's a huge sign. They have motivations that make characters really annoying or evil. Most episodes of the series make up Johnny and Dookie as Sissy, like Johnny likes to be silent or like an obsession with a boy next to the twin. When they see these two geniuses in the abs and Johnny never sees them as undesirable, there is no real connection between the audience and the characters. <br /> <br /> The series of things is renowned for Johnny Susan and Mary's guinea pigs. They can go to Johnny fats, ugly, monsters and even a woman. Twins help Johnny pay for his services. Whenever a section about "win / win" occurs, it apparently disappears, and those who never get out of the rails never satisfy them. <br /> <br /> It's starting from middle-grade writing. however, to be terribly pleased. Episodes of "fat" always repeat "The PH is with PH. There is a difference, you know." That is to say, the line to repeat itself, especially when it seems that the occurrence can be promoted by child obesity, Johnny becomes a famous star making money and video games fat. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the show shows Do not completely riot the Dexter laboratory. The show has been cast by many characters, Black and Mr. From the two black men called White, that is, general problems that Johnny and her sisters need to solve, and they are also super-evil, even though here, the show will steal the ideas for other sources, Mr. Freeze as a teenage clone, like a bad cat that likes to dominate a man (like the evil cat about Powerpuff Girls), trio. evil skaters 'fonts' as well as Mole Man, which is probably the most dangerous media coverage. <br /> <br /> Finish all, together with strange animations and strangers, to play a voice. Suitable (voices like Mr. Black and Mr. White) in the ear (Johnny, Dookie, and all the criminals of the show). The song of the theme seems to me the only thing for this show, but it only recovered some events with the group. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, Johnny Test is not good. cartoons. Adolescent talk and horror jokes will unbalance the child's interest in the show, while bright colors, stars and dragging people will ruin their teen experience. Cartoon Network is just one of those showcases that people are promoting Cartoon People (for example, MTV rapping). If you need a show that suits your kids for half an hour, you should stick to Spongebob, Johnny Test is more "proof" than patience.
