Until the new season, I was a fan of 'Little Mosque'. However, he crossed the new season completely. <br /> <br /> The new Christian video has destroyed the mission of the show. It has always been to live together to overcome prejudices. The premise of the new Vicar and the Christians show it in bad light. <br /> <br /> I am not Christian or Muslim, but I love watching the show and see the friendship between Amar and Reverend. It's not anymore. <br /> <br /> Just cancel it and do it. It is no longer worth seeing. <br /> <br /> It could still be saved, but a lot of changes would have to be made. <br /> <br /> Return to the old format.
