It has disasters. The film's argument can be summarized as follows: Three guys are hunted in the woods. Two of them, along with others, shoot their heads without explanation. The last boy is clear, cried and did not do anything. He walks through an old factory and walks the evil people through his field without fighting. The criminals are in black and look like evil. <br /> <br /> The whole story is not summarized but in detail. Everything comes up with a man who plays a sensible door. We wait for him. A long and sleepy boy with bored pigs. With them we can nap together. A drawing by a jogger can be saved, if he can see his butt or boobs bounce. <br /> <br /> The interview is not less than Terminator and there is not so much action. They only talk about characters. And, at the same time, they do not say something crisp to say "I'll be back". If my friends have filmed this weekend, I would be encouraged because knowing the camera controls is quite easy. Renting a DVD as a money payment is completely inadequate. <br /> <br /> An exciting thing is that the director has told him that they are not aware of how they do not know that local police are shooting them and they treated them as a random man who was randomly riding a gun. If they were shot, I'm sure it was fun to watch the movie.
