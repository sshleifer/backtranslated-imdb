15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the nation's investigations, especially the youngest. When I had a three-year-old child living in the Philippines, I saw this show on Friday at ABS-CBN (Channel 2). When the movie was released in 1995, when I saw my father and 2 uncles, the accident was terrible. My grandparents also sent me a "Balikbayan" box with Power Rangers (a fully built Megazord image and Rangers full of toys). I have also played video games and I love one of them ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which was really sad. However, interest in the series of robots was a show that sparked interest in me (especially anime mech series like "Gundam"). As far as I am 18 years old, I would think that this show was quite a bit ridiculous. To verify this, I made a trip down the lane of memory down to a 2-set DVD collection "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" and I've both seen them. Like, "crazy, how awesome, just another dish for me in the attic." For all the people of my generation, this is not the thing you want to see repeatedly. I do not mean to leave behind all your life, but it's not bad at this time? Instead of "Power Rangers", I'd recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam" ("RECOMMENDED TENDERS"), "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (as well as Ninja Robots), or the original Sentai Power Rangers. "
