There is no reason to see the movie. A good idea of ​​land is badly managed. In the middle of the film everything changes and from that moment nothing makes sense. The reason for the murders is not clear. The play is horrible. Nick Stahl needs a better director. It was excellent in the bedroom, but here it is horrible. Buffy's Amber Benson needs to change her character someday. Even if you enjoy sex and violence, you will be disappointed. Although the movie is 80 minutes, although it's too short to get a good movie (for that it's too long), the DVD is not deleted. This never worsens the fragments that are missing from the characters. /> <br /> Do not give up on this time.
