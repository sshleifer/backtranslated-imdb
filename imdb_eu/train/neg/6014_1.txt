Left Behind is an incredible waste of more than $ 17 million. The play is weak and boring, the story is even weaker. The viewers believe in a plot of land that is absolutely unbelievable and ridiculous, and nothing has been given for their good faith. The film has acted poorly and not only when it is lacking in all the technical areas of cinema. The production design does not support anything credible. The effects are very small and flat. Lighting and continuity are generally not flawed; in comparison to one tenth of the budget. However, there will be no doubt that the family's millions will undoubtedly be a hug for the entire film and the religious rhythm; and who can blame him. However, it is unfortunate that the level 3 film market must be approved.
