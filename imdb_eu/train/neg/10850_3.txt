This movie has something in the bat. Being the main actor by Dani Filth will automatically create some people like this movie. Actually, I love Filth de Cradle and I have heard the soundtrack of this movie for some time. Dani Filth is a very popular character and is a lead. Shooting of the movie is a great independent style for an awesome factor. There are many actors in this movie. Due to the small budget, the special effects were not bad either. People were killed in a very creative and nightmare manner. <br /> <br /> Now, on the contrary. There is very little talk in the whole film, so little is done for character development. It's hard to fear fearless living characters. There was a lot of words in it, there were a lot of F bombs and appeared in random places. Yes, I understand people swear it, but it seems that births prevent the guys from scribbling and include the whole language. The story, which I can do, was pretty good, although it leaves many sections hanging out and asking what happens when missing conversations. <br /> <br /> In the end, Fear is like a Cradle. Video for people who love sex and violence, but trying to draw a story does not work well. If you are a bloody person, let him rent you to satisfy your blood and flesh.
