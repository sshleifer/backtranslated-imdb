Jean Claude Van Damm will try to rescue his career at Universal Soldier. But is this movie saved? After dying, I think I go to hell. <br /> <br /> In the first minute, we will see the interior of an installation where you can see the bad guy. Fear, right? But it's not too scary (details are followed). <br /> <br /> Then we will see a black girl from Van Damme (do not remember the name ... she does not care), trying to escape from some muscle men. They are, of course, new universal soldiers. More muscles, less brain (like movie). After a while, Van Damme fights against Goldberg, but the "mission" is aborted. It was just a test (this movie is our test for nerves?). It turns out Van Damme to work for the Government in the new Universal Soldier project (whoever sees the first movie that maybe this is the most inappropriate, can be done by Van Dammes). But it's a sequel. And the "story" must be created. Oh, I forgot She has a daughter. It is very important for the "story". <br /> <br /> Well, after about 20 minutes, the super computer listens to a conversation and is about to cancel and leave the project. Of course, the cube is angry and activates the soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme escapes the facility, but the computer comes up with some soldiers (as Van Damme wants to be a soldier) (is it the best (really?)). And what he invented, Goldberg is a hunter, a stupid phrase for the audience before he was always cheated. Funny Yes, like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> After a "story", Van Damme tries to save his daughter (wife - reporter first movie). The final show is that Van Damme is fighting with Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive scene in the whole movie (please see yourself, it's fun to say). <br /> <br /> You will see that this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Do not see it. But if so, keep six packages with you!
