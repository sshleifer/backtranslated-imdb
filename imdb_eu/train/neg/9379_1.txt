This movie. . . I do not know. Pippi Longstocking, and I'm not sure about why I'd take Tami Erin out of character. Why would they spend money in the direction of art and some of the worst special effects, then I should not worry about editing properly, I do not know about it anymore. Why they sometimes wear outfits and costumes, and sometimes even strangers, why they put up bad songs, why the script does not make any sense (even the slightest, at the children's film level). . . . what were you thinking about ?? There should be nothing about this movie. Each part is duplicated (and always wrong), all sound effects are a bit wrong, it is located in all wrong edits, in any case, the performance is bad. It's a good problem despite all the problems, but it does not ever catch Astrid Lindgren's magic.
