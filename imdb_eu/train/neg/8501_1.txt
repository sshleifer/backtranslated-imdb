<br /> <br /> This movie is a very long time. The Resurrection movie (Christopher Lambert) reminded me that it seemed very boring. And every week of "Easter", it's even worse. <br /> <br /> Alida Vallirena works well for this movie. Alida is one of the elderly women in the European film history. I love the hands-on look of "Suspiria" and "inferno" (Dario Argento). I will not give more time to face this movie. I will say a good thing about this movie ... use it quickly, if you want to sleep very quickly ...
