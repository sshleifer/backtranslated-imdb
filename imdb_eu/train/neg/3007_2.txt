Well, in an endless pursuit of horror, we will find this movie, apparently for some of the newly newly released DVD releases. The transfer is enormous and quality is sucked. I do not think this is a bad remaster or anything has happened, I think the movie is wrong. <br /> <br /> Of course, an undocumented school is definitely shot with cheap beer and a waste budget. Talented hack does not start at slow "Slaughter High" and does not take pace for about an hour. First of all, we will see "a nerd group", as a team member says ... Actually, "I know what they were ... jocks? The Director-General, who is so ugly with his ultra-hook, should throw him into a nerd, The "big guy" and the loser mum and chicks are 'hot' but they are not supposed to be a mystery, but it is a mystery why they dispose of this group, but I think the viewer believes that they are "fresh eyes" on the toe, As most of the high schools are playing for thirty-five years, other reviewers mentioned here have said that the actors (if you call them) are a British bundle, and they have been emphasized on this subject a few times. We must acknowledge that this group of "children" It was just that they were only in their "meeting" school, it is now only abandoned. <br /> <br /> The killer is lama, gore is not great and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people; The lines are: 'This place frightens me ...' and 'Someone gives beer' stand out ... It's just good. Skip this, if you're wasting some friends and try to laugh at a real attempt at slasher. If you want to see good, Bava's "Bay Of Blood" made 14 years earlier and much better. If you want to see BAD Slasher good, see "Just before Dawn" or "The Burning." 10 to 10 kids.
