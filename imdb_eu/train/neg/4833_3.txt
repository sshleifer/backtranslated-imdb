Yes, the movie is really a thief. Avatar stole some stellar stars. Politicians want to accept a war hero movie (help?) Because they are still fighting for the US war. I really do not want to go into politics, but continue, more clearly than the summer sky. Hurt locker does not really stand out, no real plot. I really feel that the parties of the 50s in Hungary did not like what they liked and what they did not like. They created the same propaganda films of that time, only in black and white. Although we have a sensible piece of the title genre "US wars cool", you will surely choose the best films.
