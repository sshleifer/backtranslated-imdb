LEATHER (2 star five stars) <br /> <br /> It really is not a very good movie ... but I liked the idea behind it ... and filmmakers seemed pretty good for the small budget quote. he had to work. The film is directly a "section" of a Japanese reality, some competitors are confined to "dangerous zone" and will send them three masked costumes. If he survives, if he does, he will win his reputation and money ... others are dead. The main objection to this movie is quite bad. The "real" people also do not seem real. The actors that play the killers are fun ... portraying famous types of modern horror films and high-quality drawings ... and how exactly they would do if they were a true show. The film must be done ... there is a camera that follows the competitors around the "dangerous zone" and everything is seen from the camera's perspective ... but the lights turn on and off. Constantly (I'd imagine "hiding the cuts" from one another to another).
