I saw "Descent" last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was a great disappointment. Because disappointment was potentially potential for the story, Rosario Dawson was a great opportunity to see him in a smaller intimate and was a fan of the 1970s rape / revenge (when he hears me, I'm not!) To watch the movie that is very curious. My conclusion: let the class stick! Yes, the story has a potential, but the interviews are flat, the actors do not think it. Even though Dawson is empty. Some would say that it is a straightforward representation of the United States universe, that the emptiness of the characters serves a purpose and all that jazz, but it does make the whole movie quite obvious. Dawson is like a scene that is raped: it lacks serious intensity! I did not expect anything "irreversible", but we still do not think his compassion? I did not. No, in a minute, he was so sharp ;-) And I read that they were impressive. Well, it's good, but it's not a transformation. I have to admit that the screening of the festival was not so good, maybe I missed something here, but at the end of the movie, I could not think "I feel the" Inferno of the Argentes. "More seriously, the club's first scene has been beautifully shot and it's all but I liked watching Lynch's 'Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with the Walk and the American Pound's Board on a longer and tedious version of the scene. Me' ... red and blue lighting, heavy bass music, lascivious / decadent atmosphere, in general. .. No, I can not get into this movie. Bad.
