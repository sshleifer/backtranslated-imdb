Being a fan of silent films, I saw this image for the first time. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> As we said, the movie seems to be long, long and commercial by Maxwell. <br /> <br /> If maybe the scene is half the length, maybe I enjoyed it with the movie. But he quickly grew older. And while I know that reality is often widespread in the movies, without reducing the enjoyment of the audience, what happened to Mexican bandits? I mean, cars are riding around the mountain, then a car that moves about a mile and a half a mile, but they can not get that?
