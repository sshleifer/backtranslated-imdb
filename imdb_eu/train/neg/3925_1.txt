I watched this "hot" movie as it was created in 1986. He had an X score to shorten the oral sex scene, but played in the main plays ("art" was a movie). She is allegedly the first movie to show a respected actress in an explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> An old girl who was in love with (an incomprehensible) older childhood. (Maruschka Detmers). As we have already mentioned, Detmers is very beautiful with good body, but also good performance. Pretty (bad) Pitzalis was pretty poor. No wonder he never made another movie. However, despite the sex scene being evil (explicit but very short), this is a tedious and dull tale. The good practices of Detmers came to a certain point. Mostly, I was looking at my watch hoping patiently. If this sequence has not forgotten this film for some time. Sad and slow You can jump on this.
