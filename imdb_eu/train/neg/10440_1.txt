Except for ages 10 to 14 (except R grade), there are very few things here. Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we should see more) is one or two lines that are both humorous and good as Julianna Margulies, but unfortunately, that's it. Bad plot Bad performance Improper writing and delivery. Special effects are fatal. As long as the whole situation is curious and horrible jokes, all the remarkable individual situations are terribly terrifying. If you take part in the action, there are sequential actions that are credible in some movies that hang out, and some cry. This movie has only the second. This is not a bit left. I'm glad I did not pay. <br /> <br /> Despite the difficulty, I can read and think, when I sat to watch it, I did not expect any good.

Bad Not even that material "so bad, it is good." I am very tolerant of filmmaking, but this "Six String Samurai" (I like it) deserves Oscar. <br /> <br /> No, this piece of CGI'd junk is in the same Battlefield company. Land, Little Man and Gigli. This is how 7.2 is now completely mystifies me. I can think of Brainwashing or somehow accumulating voting system as an answer. <br /> <br /> I'm going ahead and I could not but I said enough tonight to witness the train Wreck. I have to wash my eyes. 10
