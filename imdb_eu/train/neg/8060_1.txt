Bad and bad film! I tried to watch it without fast forwarding ... This has failed. After about 30 minutes the movie stopped, it was online to see how many minutes it was to see the disaster. (Only 84 minutes, Whew!) The movie was confusing and boring. I do not think anyone else is attacked by a fluorescent bulb! The fun thing is I saw the version of "The Killer Cut". The box says boldly "More blood!" "More sex!" "Panic over the theater release!" Yikes! If this movie was totally awkward to these claims, I wonder how "UN-Killer Cut" was: If you want to see a great movie about life and the world of the dead, watch any of the series of The Night of the Living Dead!
