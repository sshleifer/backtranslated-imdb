Amateur, no budget is surprisingly good for this movie ... but it is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Oh, the other atrocities of Brad Sykes. The play is awesome, except Emmy Smith, except for the promise. The "direction" of the camera requires serious virtual work. And no more "hold the camera and run" on both gimmicks; it just works Special effects are not images, a problem can be identified in real time. If you need to rip it in your ear, please do not let the actor see the real ear beneath the blood. The landscape is gentle and boring (like other Mr. Sykes's actions), and cheap music is cheap pornography and a guitar-driven metal is very bad (see the landscape comment). <br /> <br /> What is the lack of real plot or character development? Apparently he is not a scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> Anyone who finances this man ... please stop. I've seen other "home movies" (this I do not plug in) and they're just as bad. Usually, the "director" will grow and will learn from previous efforts ... not this guy. One thing is having an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hacker. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie of a crisis ... of course, it would be less than chewing the kernel that remove popcorn. /> <br /> Prize: the worst military impulse ever in a movie.
