Let's confess. I found this video used and I bought that Guttenberg looked so sexy on his jacket. But inside there was another story. While the movie was parodic of special effects of the "invisible man" (visible strings and other paraphernalia), it was parodied, the script did not lose any chance - indeed, it came out - not all were insulted -WASP races and real or imagined homosexuals Each person's insult to a script was either homophobic or racist, or both. Your nerves begin to roll around with vibrating sound, blurry camera and melodramatic photography. However, the end is a surprise. When you arrive, you do not pay too much attention. Very bad, it could be a good movie.
