Well, somebody, somewhere, a few years ago, thought it was a good idea to create a 3D IMAX movie on Apollo 11 and fly around the moon. So they did that. Someone, somewhere, was an idiot. <br /> <br /> I want artists to give props to do homework on hardware. As much as possible, rockets and startup hardware were promoted. Graphics were quite good in general: it started rocketing, as the good shot of the rocket always makes it (the blood of my Mechanics change the cell phone is still strong) and 3D was quite effective. CG was not the quality of Pixar, but it was generally good. The sun was medium-sized anthropomorphic, with colors of mid-60s (flying hippies, African-American silent and flying with black tones), and the skins seemed like figs with human babies, although they did not sound loud.) Some screenwriters did not have their home doing homework, overwhelming and outdated topics (most of the 60's in gender politics, including unnecessary characters, racial stereotypes, evil Russians, and fluffy, fat-burning, alimony). In a film directed at IMAX, they reflected a wonderful opportunity to show educational content on physics and space travel: they were not physically targeted (for lunar module zero landing?). You will be even worse to read original transcripts between Houston and astronauts, all in the public domain; Instead they wrote their own conversation, like noise. <br /> <br /> But we liked the skins. <br /> <br /> So, they got a point and a half for rockets and skins. Uh, yay 1.5 / 5.
