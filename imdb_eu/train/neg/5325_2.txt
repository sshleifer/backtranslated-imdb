The revision in Poland must be a feminist because it has an excellent and historically correct "Young Catherine" film. There is nothing in front of truth. For many years, I almost excluded myself as a Russian historian with YC at almost every turn, and in particular, it was politically correct for her representation to be the one hand that led to Russia's superiority. Is it true? She was only brought to San Pedrorsburg for her mother and mother and found her "bond" to survive with dvorians, boyars, and military. While he was not challenged, he was able to push his cultural wills (treasure hunters, etc.). There was not so much evidence "great", but proof of the postmodern review is not very popular. YC is just a costume drama, a movie by Ted Turner, just like "Peter the Great," which is an example of Western Russia in 1986.
