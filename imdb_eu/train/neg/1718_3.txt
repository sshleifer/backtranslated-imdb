I have read some books about Bonnie and Clyde, much more accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version, since the costumes and the premises repeat real pictures of the box. Particularly well-known is the death of Buck Barrow and his wife Blanche's capture. The photographer who took over the actress Blanche took a look like apparently the husband's killing. However, the movie is still in Hollywood and our anti-heroes are pretty good at the end, even though they are full of holes (in their lives, Bonnie was burning in a car accident and did not look like it. wonderful). The script is boring and the performance is inadequate, especially if it leads. Very depressing Beat Beatty and Dunaway. It may not be a "true story," but it's an excellent movie.
