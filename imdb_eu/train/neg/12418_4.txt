I saw this movie, now it has not been released and Israel has been nominated for the best year of the year. and to summarize everything right now, I will say: this is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is Dror Shaul's second feature, and I must admit first and he made his television drama before. This image is much better. Further, this is his first attempt at drama essay. The first works were comedic and fun and effective. <br /> <br /> First you need to know the first thing you can see on this movie: XXI. The thirteenth century Israel hates the values ​​depicted by the Kibbutz since the hate. state formation The real situation of Kibbutzim is very serious, and some of them disappear individually. Kibutx, a Hebrew word for the collectives, was a kind of partner country, where the values ​​of equality and socialism were dogma in everyday life. Changing social values ​​with time now seems to have been suppressed by the rebuffing of the human spirit, which was locked inside the rules of dogma without a card. The introduction of capitalist and lifestyle values ​​of the 90s and the so-called Kibutzians continued to grow. The mother of the movie is her main metaphor. <br /> <br /> But this movie is supposed to be unrelated to nostalgia for the day of kibbutz. Once, the dream of each young couple was a beautiful and beautiful environment for living and kibbutz children. But the film shows the opposite. Kibutz, with socialist dogma, was a place of worship of crazy people, with the crazy ideas that weaken the freedom of the collective's individual. This is the main philosophy of the modern post: your individuality is the most important thing. You have to put yourself in the middle, and you have no one else. That is, filmmaking is philosophy, and this is just the first sin. <br /> <br /> If you disagree with my political side, I am sure that the movie is the ring tone. They are four sins that follow the script and direction. The film does not have any authentic texts, and one of them is not remembered. It's also a "tricky" one, not an artistic attempt for the emotion of the movie, nor the artist's emotions. it just brings boredom. <br /> <br /> Someone can explain why this film has won so many prizes? Can it show that Israel is lined up with the rest of the world, hating social and human values? Or can it show Israel that it is "delicate", not dogma and fanaticism? As we are basically very human and good, those who are able to make emotions, especially when they are false, as we expect from capitalism? Or perhaps, in recent years, it tells one of the biggest lies in Israeli cinema, a lie that justifies the existence of the Jewish state? The answer does not matter, it's not good. not for the world, nor for human values ​​nor for the Jews.
