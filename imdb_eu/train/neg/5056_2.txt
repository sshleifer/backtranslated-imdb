*** SPOILERS *** The beginning of this film "good" - using the proper performance of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the play is horrible (it does not help with the bizarre script). Buntao is the chief criminals of a crime syndicate (Frans Tumbua). I was laughing at myself when he said that he had lost his money after he had "made his anger"; great performance Patrick Muldoon was not much better, and his "desperate purchase" line (the rest of the title of this film) was so badly delivered as he could. There is no other main character, but other actors or actors have not been featured in this movie. We will reach the next plot. You need to know: In the original "Rage and Honor", Cynthia Rothrock, with the interpretation of Chris Fairchild, was an in-house teacher. Now, C.I.A. Agent (or other non-governmental agency ... I feel, but I did not remember this film was so bad). Hmmm ... I can imagine what C.I.A. It's like an application process. Interviewer: what is your past job experience? Chris: I'm a teacher. Interviewer: well; you are hired! Due to the decent day I give myself only to "2" and at the end they create a nice plot (although we know that Tommy (Muldoon), a bad secret, will be caught).
