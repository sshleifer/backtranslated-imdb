I watched this movie this year on March 21. For more information on forecasts. But much better than "Tridev". Pota is about Prabhat, who lives with his father, his wife and his younger brother. However.Gghar Jhurhad makes a plot to kill his young brother. He makes a few men sending a plan. They will come to the school that looks like a friend of Prabhats. Leave the child He throws his father away from home. He and Aakash go to Kenyan to find him. It sounds good, Chunky was very annoying, Naseerdun is wasting. Divya has done well, Sonam was losing out, he played Sunnys brother. it was a pretty movie. Sad he managed to kill his character. The girl was pretty but annoying. Another good baby did. He did a good job. It was good for Kiran. Cinematography is very good both in India and abroad. Kenya.Script is weak, but it has some good conversations. It also shoots. Movie The song "Saat Samundar" was a good music, he liked it. It was a good song of this song. The rest of the songs have been forgotten. Ignore Rating-3/10
