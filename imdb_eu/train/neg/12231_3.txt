I watched this movie, and sometimes I was feeling bad that I saw this movie. Munchie's disapproval of the 'farce' that will come in years. See again Star Wars, Munchie not seen. <br /> <br /> As a parent responsible (now I speak with parents), I (you) will not let my (your) son participate from this pseudo-occult video festival. Satanic Munchie, a viewer, is likely to be "cold". Fendish, alien, rodential, and very bad - Bogey made the flesh, invisible to growns, tempted children to live with lifestyles (it could be maintained without caution or caution). It sells simple answers and fake ideals. It is not the moral awareness of the spectator. The devil is Pope Popeil. <br /> <br /> I pray (literally and in the figurative sense, I mentioned above), this movie has not made the format jump to the DVD. I hope that in 1994 the cold deaths in the cold nights killed the "yellow films". <br /> <br /> Munchiek also love pizza. I forgot It comes a lot.
