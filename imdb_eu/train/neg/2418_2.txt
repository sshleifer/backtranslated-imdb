The first mistake made in the title of a movie is to use "dead alive" to have no real zombie FX budgets. Surely, there was a low budget zombie movie - a small budget. I thought it was a film school project. Amateur actresses and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> It was not very bad at first, and the zombie genre was an interesting twist. If you get the "R" of violence, we will give you good shots for babies that can attack you. These women were very little used in this movie, they could be classified as "gay interests". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br/> And I'm out of Oakland. They were doing a lot of shots and they did not see the police!
