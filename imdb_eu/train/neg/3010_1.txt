The holy God was horrible. I slept in the theater for an hour and ten minutes and I thought I'd roll my eyes to Mr. Oedipus Rex. Dear god This movie deserves more than any thing done by a central filmmaker. Save your money, the movie can not offer you. If you do not sleep when you sleep in the movie theaters. You know, bring your girlfriend and things to come with. However, you will be alone. F @ c This slide show. <br /> <br /> Note. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this I do not see. <br /> <br /> hello. <br /> <br /> How are you? <br> /> <br /> I'm pretty good. <br /> <br /> Enjoying today? <br /> <br /> I am. <br /> <br /> This answer has been one hundred times More fun than watching this current movie. this is sad
