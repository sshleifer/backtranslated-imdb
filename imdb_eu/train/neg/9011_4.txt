B-movie standard. Seriously, everyone who watches Dean Cain, "Dragon Fighter", and a lot of people who make his first movie, should know better than real quality or even moderate intelligence. B movies are well-known for re-formulating formulas. If you also provide Token analyzes, the movie will ruin yourself (and perhaps write a bad review on your IMDb). Kristine Byers liked the female head. I thought it was charisma and I thought it was very attractive. B-movie was a memorable event. Unfortunately, I do not see what he has done in any movie. I'll look again.
