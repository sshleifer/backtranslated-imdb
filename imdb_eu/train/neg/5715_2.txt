"Esan Bai" is one of the films that continue to wait, but never does it. The "Motivatory Psycho" threatens innocent people, decides the beloved for direct video filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The interview is bad and, in some places, poorly translated. The play is uniformly poor, especially the piece's disease, which is considered Joong-Hoon Park. It seems that he does not think and speak with a deep voice does not believe that his character is threatening, when everything really matters was easier. <br /> <br /> The land deserves a special mention. Because they are stupid beyond belief. 'Heroes' are not uncommon for their hitchhikers to threaten to die. He manages 'Heroine' twice that he sees evil when he is no more than one foot. The criminal goes through the control of the police (wearing a shirt covered with blood and wearing a bloody pillow of his head) when a policeman shows up in a carcass on the driver's seat. The evil one has been dug up, covered with a shovel and stuck with a cart, but it does not seem to be a serious injury to any obstacle. And I did not even start to "turn" until the end of the terrible. Sheesh <br /> <br /> The only increase in this movie is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very nice, but not a cancer actor. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is written as rough and roughly directed, to copy "The Hitcher" and "Spoorloos". but every time he fails because of the lack of talent in all those who participate.
