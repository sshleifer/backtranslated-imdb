A memorable spectacle in short life. After watching this section of the line, my brotherhood band team started to use the line to break our huddles. Ready / Break instead of back in our quarter FOOTBALL said and the rest of the team responded BET! Our opponents cracked down on the fun way to break the hudd, a few of them saw the show. Using this line has added a unique feature to our season, I will never forget it. That year, we had the best time we had in college and the small amount of fun that we used to use this line happened. The show was pretty bitter, but Pi Kappa Phi West Virginia Tech's 1977 internship in the intramural banner football team resides.
