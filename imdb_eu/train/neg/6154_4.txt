A handsome, handsome man, a blonde falls; He also thinks he likes it, but not for reasons that you can think of. There's little conception of the black comedy about Pat Proft, good by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon. Norman Bates is just one of the quickest efforts made by Anthony Perkins. At the B-comedy level, a similar "Food Raoul" is a better bet. Certainly it is located here; unfortunately, this image never goes to its second act. Interesting session but short mistake. <br /> <br /> ** ****
