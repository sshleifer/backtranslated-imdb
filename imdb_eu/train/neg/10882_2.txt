This movie is one of the worst movie horror I have ever seen. From the first scene, I thought it was an empty division. He starts with a seemingly bad girl who dies in a misshapen. As it turns out, those people had random zombies. Well, a few years later, some college students commit themselves. An immense play is committed to the head. Things like Jock were getting worse, not just about making a chalonnage, but also a commitment to "eager to be a popular challenge," this cake is really a final conflict. Weapons with special effects, completely wrong. For example, pistols that make noise without extreme extremities, and vice versa. This is accompanied by the stop-animation animation (why stop motion motion is mysterious), cheesy music, and about 40 guns out of 40 guns. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is pure. As many as you can, you can rent more than 50 cents for your movie movie rental.
