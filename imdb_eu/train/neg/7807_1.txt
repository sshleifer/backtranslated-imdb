This DVD was taken to the Dollar store. The DVDs were for $ 1 support, but with Michael Madsen, I've never seen the movie ever, but I thought I bought it. <br /> <br /> I have to say what I needed to say. I like cinema He used to play as a documentary film or an advertisement for religion as any other thing. I realized the story of the director's flashbacks did not add to me. I'd like to see the language chronologically. <br /> <br /> I have not thrown it as one of the other commercials, but it may be a while before I can watch the movie again. <br /> <br /> Who knows, since it was the debut of Michael Madsen, maybe it could be an archive value in the future.
