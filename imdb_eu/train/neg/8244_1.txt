I think this movie is amazing. But it's a moving thing to do, then, to get it wrong ... and just. Breastfeeding has an hour and a half. Even more than for the viewer movie characters (five girls). <br /> <br /> The main characters surely listen to their bloody piece, which is essentially good, because it is fear. movie And (usually) I like horror films. I have no problems in these types of films. However, all violence in this film does not end. No show is just grotesque. It's so rigorous, so boring, and really clever. <br /> <br /> The worst thing (if the predecessor is not bad enough) has tried to copy Blair Whitch about this movie. Project, shooting with a hands-free camera. But (again, this) does not end anymore. In "Blair Which", there is probably an explanation, that is, with a camera looking for Blair witch. There are no other explanations in this movie: "Hey ya'll looked at Blair whitch!" The sound of the movie is also something depressed. Girls are so stilically crying, so you do not understand what you say. Also, there is no effort to do anything better, sound or other. <br /> <br /> In the end, the sound of the rest is a soundtrack, and it's just a cheap euro. the favorite rock of your house ... <br /> <br /> <br /> My advice: do not look at it in any way.
