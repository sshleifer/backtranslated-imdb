I did not feel like watching this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is a fan of the first. This film is absorbed right! He was missing the first magic. The mice told you that you could understand all the words, the animation is crappy, the palace is much different than the first movie, the newly mentioned characters were horrible and, fortunately, the prince did not keep a lot of lines. sting stupid Basically, The Lion King is like 1 1/2, except for different stories that populate the mouse. The reason for 10 out of 10 is because the characters' songs are not very enjoyable.
