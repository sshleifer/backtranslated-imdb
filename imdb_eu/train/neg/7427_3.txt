A friend gave me a set of "Amazing 12 films in film / horror movies". I was very careful. But since the item was a gift, I did not really make sense of my feeling. In the end ... movies for free! So if something is modest. After great reflection, Alien Intruder was the first of these films. Ironically, it was the first opportunity to look at the best of the bunch. I can say, if I have the best, I think they are like the rest. <br /> <br /> On the front, he had good things. I knew the very actors (count!) Four. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conaway. I said to myself ... "Billy and Tracy had a good Scifi (Star Wars and Babylon 5 respectively), so they did not enter the turkey. Max never wanted to get a short film ... But not too much actress, Jeff ... well ... the movies and TVs have done well and badly. " I soon realized that Jeff decided to add "ugly" to his repertoire. <br /> <br /> First track in the beginning scenes. Jeff plays his likeness by means of a "crazy" scene, before he dies. A really fun camera. Unfortunately, this is, without much exaggeration, the highlight of the film. It goes down <br /> <br /> The next mission commander (Williams) has been sent to Jeff and includes new crew members working on their crew. criminal element This variety is not much more Dirty Dozen - Inconvinciente like Foursome. Also, one of a computer hacker is shown on a laptop computer. Is not it a murderer like having a gun shop stop being a killer? An unhappy prison, you ask me. <br /> <br /> When they are finally removed they are terribly awful. It seems that the space model fell on an afternoon with Airborne Kits for eight years. <br /> <br /> But fear does not stop there. While Jeff's ship disappeared, the criminal crew rewards their good behavior in virtual reality weekends that give men fantasies. They're doing well, and the fantasies come true as the "Alien Menace that appears". But should they crawl? Alien intruder Alien boring, similar. <br /> <br /> In the end, they go to the G sector and the external presence fights against each other for their emotions, until only old Max remain. At the end of the day, in the garbage films, he looks like a sequel - as if he were! In this movie I will name a character "Sweatdroid". Being an Android is supposed to happen, but apparently this event has been lost to make-up, giving it sweat that offers any chance. But do not worry, finally the body counting is intended to supplement the numbers. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scoggins, in order to be true, do very little in the film. They just have to stay awake, and even less to act. And, as I mentioned earlier, Jeff started playing showers early, so his manicness is not allowed to clarify the film much. Max tries his best, like other cast members, but the movie is just too dreadful, to be honest. <br /> <br /> The only thing that this film offers is half-full of imagination. ship naming agreement. All are named for musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the films are cute and inspiring. <br /> <br /> I thought it was created in 1992, when I first saw it, it was one of those live clips in the 80's. It seems that they also did 90-year-old dog movies. <br /> <br /> Better avoid it. Even though beer is like a chip movie this movie is a stinker, but at least you can quickly move forward, I suppose.
