Private practice is a medical drama. So, my biggest complaint is the lack of medical history. When I saw the house, I did "repair" two mysterious (nine) doctors. Boooring Seriously, if you're a lazy writer, why not copy cases in some instances in some cases or some dark soap in Brazil? The house is new and well-known: recycling ideas is difficult to escape ... <br /> <br /> The second main complaint: these people must be forty-five, right? So why should they play with the emotional maturity of 15 years of age? Intense thinking for three weeks (that is, a whole three-episode of misunderstanding) is really necessary if your best friend does not want to be your "friendship", you might not want to hurt it, but it does not. Do not you want to risk your friendship? The psychoactive character that makes all the thinking, by the way, the whole story is not so unrealistic that you can not really enter into a supposed "drama". <br /> <br /> And I will not even complain. When we got to know Addison's favorite in Gray's Anatomy, what's happening in the show is ... Do you not think it's fun that Addison is a way to get bored after Pete's loser (sorry, but everyone who tries to cure is insomnia for Mozart's Requiem? is it a loser, doctorate or not) and Derek will end Meredith's disturbances? When it was amazed with the brand, it seemed to be the best of each other. Sometimes Shonda Rhimes is trying to get in contact with the unconscious, which is often our first choice ...
