This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Let's say it again: THERE ARE NOTHING FESTIVALS. <br /> <br /> All the ears of a bad movie: continuity errors, bad writing, bad performance, bad productive value. , bad music I thought that horror movies were in a couple of places. First of all, we believe that it is supposed to be suspended. This movie is F in this category. If the second point is when a character dies or something bad happens, we assume that we take care of it. This movie also gets F in this sense. <br /> <br /> The first story is a woman deprived of the wolves, fearing that they will happen. The next story, a typical OCD, speaks with a friend who has been careful and killed. Oh, and then, it's a terrifying story that's awkward in the room. Are you able to change topics that are more interesting and a little less in a home than usual, have an analphabet and have a roommate? Thus, hallucination, these stories show a virtual reality provided by a PhD by a doctor who uses himself. Wow, stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me explain something, I like to watch horror movies and they're laughing. I can not do that with this. It was very painful to sit and watch. Do not see this movie in any way. You will regret it
