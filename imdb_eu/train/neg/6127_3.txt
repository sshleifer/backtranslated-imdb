As I am in Hungary, I have heard of what is said to be a better and better thing about Üvegtigris so far, but I do not need to understand the rumor. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie's many points. Some quotes really encouraged me, but stereotypics reappear, like every Hungarian movie, and the story is very sad. I liked the first part, but then I started getting bored, and then we only found the whole movie BORING. <br /> <br /> Rudolf Péter is as good as it is, Reviczky is also excellent, but there are just a few others ... nothing has been done. <br /> <br /> How many years will it be for a Hungarian film?
