This is not a horror movie, but a boring movie sex. A very horrifying movie to avoid a horror hobby. No land, huge play and annoying music. If you only see the trailer, you just need to know it ... It is shameful that such things are not available in VHS or videos that are available for good. If you like vampires, try Hammer Productions or the Gothic Italian instead of Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti. These are masterpieces compared to this trash. Rating = "1" is too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one with that opinion.
