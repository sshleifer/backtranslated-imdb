I already rented it, so shoot me! <br /> <br /> A decent premise sets a different story without real gain, but at least shot. The director Jon Keeyes takes a simple idea of ​​a false real house without a risk. In most cases it must be a slam dunk, but this little stinker quickly gets out. Cinematography is above the average and the performance is the best half, but it is a great story and writing. The slower scene is dragged on forever and the fears are not too far and far behind without the actual point of the movie. An early island is in the beginning but it shines brightly before any horror star takes place and I get bored with myself and other sandwiches ... It's an attractive coating and you're looking to rent it without a low budget drop, but a good story If you enjoy the end of the event, you are looking for something else.
