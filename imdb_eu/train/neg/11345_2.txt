I mean the word "pedestrian". It seems that the film's producers have forgotten something interesting. Faith Domergue can do better than this. The mysterious and terrifying goddess Cobra was in love with Marshall Thompson (it's an idea, right?). Instead, it would be a common housewife of the 1950s, and I think that through the film, she's shot in the morning, through the only and four-eyed expression she's wearing, Faithe made coffee. As for the rest of the pieces, all of us are "American" very serious, with a brilliant result. This is covered in Val Lewton in "The Cat People". I think that the "Cobra of Cult" called the "Recruitment Obligation Culture" title. Why would so many talented people sleep in this way, such as a slow, foreseeable and slowdown in the fall?
