Scotty (Grant Cramer continues to be the star of the B-movie, "Killer Klowns") will help three boys of middle-aged learn "dialogue" in a bad comedy in the 80's. Not bad in the 80's, this is good. Bad as bad There are no more beneficial characters, such as: "Friday, Part Two, Part 2", with the most admirable look, "when the man directs and then goes to the hissy, when he wants to touch him and with the token, fat slob, after all What would it be like without a slob of a 80% sexual comedy Slob Well, this has two, this movie is under the 80s of the comedy sex barrel, then the proverbial barrel deepened this demise. <br /> <br /> My Rating: D- <br / > <br /> Eye Candy: you can count too much, you can also see the admirable child imagined with a boob. Think of the "Bachlor Party" but it's not so funny and very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Where did I see? Comcast Moviepass
