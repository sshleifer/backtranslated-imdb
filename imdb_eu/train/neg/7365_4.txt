Not bad, but not so great. Kirk Douglas has released a new safe-prying jail and, after making a bid for Mob, decides to take the job out. Giuliano Gemma hired a circus gymnast. Mayhem continues. Douglas and Gemma will soon find Romano Puppo, the mafia goon, as well as the dizzying little dangers that continue with the Douglas Florida Bolkan girlfriend with infinitely ill. Michele Lupo continues to move rapidly to the director and at least there is a great and creative sequence with Puppo and Gemma. Despite being an Italian production, most of the filming seems to have been made in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just in a Giallo quickie. Striking bowl yields excellent performance. Music by Ennio Morricone and cinematography Tonino Delli Colli is great, collaborating with all Italians (Wertmuller and Fellini Pasolini and Leone).
