"Unhinged" is a strange strange movie, a slasher from the genre's golden age. It's hard to write a nice review of this movie because the film is so unique. Plots are pretty damned. Three young women go to a rock concert along the way and end up joining an elderly woman and her unmarried daughter's house. Very quickly, women realize that there is something right in the attic when they hear breath and strange noise. In addition, it seems that mothers and daughters have a very strange relationship, as they talk about their home affairs for dinner. The old mother also calls her daughter a whore and a whore and denounces the boys sleeping at night. In the midst of the film, when a girl decides to go on deciding to get help, she begins to die. <br /> <br /> As regards the play, this movie is at the bottom of the barrel. Three non-competitive boys and girls can not act, especially the "lead" girl. It is almost unbelievable to listen to the films they hear in the same wooden tone in the whole movie. Mother and daughter are better, but not much. The film is also pretty dull and it's really disturbing. The killings are awful, but we did not see it before. However, as we have mentioned here, the movie really gets very disturbing and violent. It completely comes from the left field and has the same shock as the "Sleepaway Camp" class finishes. Sadly, the rest of the movie is boring and a terrific and boring performance, pleasant and boring. Insufficient, dreadful houses and dark lighting, they give the film realistic film, but this breaks down quickly when the characters try to play one. Maybe it's worth it to be worth the end of the term, but I'll tell you it's only forwarding to the last 10 minutes. 4 10
