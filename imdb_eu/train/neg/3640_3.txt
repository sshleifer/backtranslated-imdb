I did not know about this movie before I bought it, but I called it and I really wanted a movie I saw a Viking movie a bit ... oh, this movie was not what I was looking for. I expected the best, but it lasted for 84 minutes, but the Nordic Savon opera was delivered with great care. The premise of the film is quite interesting: he is talking about a warrior fighting his God, and Odin is so angry that Barek curses his son as Berserker. This guy Barek is forced to live with anguish for life, madness and rape. The movie is filmed well, a rich and semi-cinematic film made by the actors, but once again I was bored and questioned when this dribble was over. The filmmakers had the opportunity to become something fun and semi-unique, but the ball fell. Perhaps, with a cheap exploitation tactic, such as free nudity and gore, there could be some improvement ... I mean, we're talking about "Berserkers" here, right? The Vikings were supposedly sufficient, with what rape and robberies, so are not Berserkers supposed to be even more extreme? In short, if you're a fan of Young and Restless (etc ...), or you're a Berserker madman who wants to torture oneself, surely leave this strange piece of celluloid away.
