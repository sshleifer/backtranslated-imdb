This movie was bad. Each one of the police films is presented almost completely. Does the guy escape? check it out. Partner? check it out. Is the character awesome personality impact? check it out. Re-prove something rookie? check it out. Rookie Grizzled appears as a veteran. check it out. They did not touch themselves on those touches, but they think they're keeping those old chestnuts out for the next exit. Add a fight between sex with Girl Power, a tired old man with visual impairment and a bad material that is constantly damaged by Dooley's award, and you really have a bad movie recipe. Avoid this at all costs.
