I'm a fan of the Long Winch series. This movie was a grief for me. I had to use it quickly to sleep. It was boring! How do I get someone to destroy this title? The only thing that was good was. Actors sh.t. They can not play a role. The main actor (Tom ...) is void. See other roles of this actor. Fighting scenes were boring and not follow-up, in any way, they did not have to follow the situation. Like another reviewer, he has said low-budget movies have bad actors. Someone else can do something better from this title. French can not do with the right movies, like Alien 4. That was bit bitter, after the Alien 1,2,3.
