I think spoilers. <br /> <br /> The whole logic that is absolutely absurd to the end destroys the movie. I can not pass it. And what about Mark Wahlbergen's character? Suddenly I found that I was scrounging on a planet they are talking about, I'd like, "AAAAhhhhHHH !!! !!! Do your life! Monkeys have inherited the Earth!" But everyone likes it, "talk lightning, well. Next?" That would be pretty bad. He must enter things more strange regularly. Also, this is still the best work by Rick Baker. This movie is a veritable testimonial that has come up in the field of makeup monkeys. 3/10.
