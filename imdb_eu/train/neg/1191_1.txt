I'm a Troma fan, but I do not know why they bought the rights to the movie, it seems to me to be as boring as watching for 3 hours. Sometimes, in the summary of the plot, "but Satan does not know what to do with the annoying tourists," it seems they do not interfere with the movie for me. <br /> <br /> The only thing good is this movie about Satan is about the movie, I like bad movie but it was boring.
