Okay, I remember seeing the first one and sucking the boys. After seeing that, I laughed and said: "Oh a boy, another little budget B-movie. I will never see Part 2." Then, about 1/2 years later, the second part came. He absorbed even more. But, I laughed again and said, "I will never see this section 3". Then, approximately 1/2, 3 episode per year appeared. I had enough money to rent and the boy, when I saw him. God, I have never realized how many movies can suck in these days. Save yourself $ 7.50 and rent the whole series. Trust me, it's worth every Penny.
