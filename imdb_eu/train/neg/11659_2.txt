I love the original Scary Movie. I am a fan of Parody: it's my humor. Sometimes it is the most intelligent form of humor. Wayans boys seemed to have this concept perfectly in the original film, and they temporarily forgot to make a move. Wayans believe that they are family of comical geniuses. Alas, even though he made genius errors. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with the promise. I liked the "Exorcist" parody, especially "come, ma gag." Now, Wayans is a quality material. But even if that is not the case, I can think twice when I laughed: 1) Tori Spelling is seduced by a spirit in the middle of the night, then becomes stuck and talks with him about the marriage. Meanwhile, he says: "It was just a throwback!" That was pretty fun. 2) Parody "Save the Last Dance", where Cindy character plays an unexpectedly girl after practicing her new movements. However, innocent short-term do not match Scary Movie's second-class laughs. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is empty in the trash, filled with cheap gag crude. The jokes of the first and most improvised jokes are bigger and more overwhelming. For example, in the Scary Movie, there are innuendos that Ray is a gay character. He was ridiculous But in Scary Movie II, Ray with her bed underwent an entire penis-shocking scene that was incredibly inadequate. This is the whole movie model. Shock humor * alone * does not take a very short film. Sadly, this trend was in 2000 and 2001. <br /> <br /> As I would like to value the Wayans movie as little as I am, I have to give it 10 to 10.
