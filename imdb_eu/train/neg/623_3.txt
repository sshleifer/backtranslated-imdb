The txorimaloa is located in the small American town of Emerald Grove, where Lester Dwervick (Tim Young) plays high school classmates by teachers and peers as a local nerdy geek. The poor child suffers from daily indulgence, harassment, disturbance, and general appraisal to the abuse of their classmates. Unfortunately, she does not have great help at home when her mother is a slut and since Lester has angry her one of her blokes he chases him in a cornfield and strangles the poor boy. However, something magical happens (not, the film does not suddenly become good), the spirit of Lester will be taken to the pimples and then used as a body to revenge himself as a body and his life is hell. .. br /> <br /> Emmanuel Itier wrote and copied the credits of the IMDb, according to the role of that film, Mr. Duforq, although I do not remember any character of that name. I hope anyone who looks at the IMDb movie page for bad guys will surely know that it's a great reputation and that's pretty much worth the effort to say. Itier, Bill Cunningham and Jason White often use a story that tells the story of a loser's life, and they will reasonably be tortured for revenge because of revenge in supernatural, pretty teen slasher. We've seen everything before, the murderers we've seen before, when we saw before we saw a teens dead, we've seen that a loser of life has been revenge, we've seen the wise people, because we've seen the evil Sheriff incompetent seen by the jokers who die before they die, things are even worse. The only real question to answer about the scarecrow is it fun to see what kind of slasher is in the boys? The answer is not to be honest. The film has a terrible nature, a great conversation, a polluting and predictable story; When a whistle blows someone on a pile, "is it you?" And it's called the end of a tour aimed at opening things for a sequel. The movie moves at a reasonable pace, but it's not exciting and it is forgotten to die. I still know how I know how to do it, I try to kill a stick of corn and kill it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < they are wrong. Without erecting it, it is not handled that there is no tension involved in killing two seconds after entering a character. Also, I am not happy with the zipper murderer in the air and in a scene that is felt inside Matrix (1999) or Japanese kung fu-flick over the air. To give a bit of credit, it looks like a real scarecrow mask and it looks pretty good, but it can give you a little bit of a bit of bad luck and a bit to turn it off. Do you not think that joining wood in the middle of a corn made whole day would be boring? I know it's a scarecrow, but I still say it would get bored during a whole day around a wooden stick! There is no nudity and gore is not something to write at home, there is an elimination, someone smears his face, someone is killed with a stick, someone sticks in his throat, sticking some sickle at the head of the crowd. someone has pulled his heart out and someone has a metallic thing stuck in the back of the head that comes out of his mouth. <br /> <br /> The supposed quote about $ 250,000 is believed to have been filmed for 8 days, at least they did not waste valuable things like things like storytelling and character development. Technically, this is much the point, shoot and expect the best stuff. If you look at the man on the floor of the heart, you still breathe ... The play is sucking, because the boy who plays Lester's mum does not have a stupid mustache and mustache. They played two roles in the film and they were responsible for disguising it, but they made them look hilarious and they did not start with accent ... <br /> <br /> The txorimalo has some fun moments. and the true bird-creature himself has good creativity with special make-up effects, but in general, films are misunderstood, misunderstood, stupid, predictable and very cursive. If you want to see a giant Fuzzy Chorimalo, look at the Scarecrow (1988). It does not mix with Gene Hackman and Al Pacino with the Scarecrow (1973) or horror flick scandal Scarecrow (2008) currently in production. The Scarecrow home video was enough to launch two live shows, Scarecrow Slayer (2003) and Scarecrow Gone Wild (2004).
