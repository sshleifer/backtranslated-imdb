I've seen bad movies, but this is p ***. It does not make sense, and all the characters swear a couple of seconds, and I think there is little sperm. That's good. A running of the bulls draws a template. A beautiful English block plays a kind of unbreakable, unmistakable love with a paddy, and some smaller lights touch dark tufts. <br /> <br /> And there are some Russian gangsters. Yes, yes, someone has a gun and maybe he talks about medication waste. <br /> <br /> Do not get this movie like a plague.
