I've seen poor movies of my time, but it really has cookies! Why is this movie done? There's nothing. Please put confidence with me, turn it off permanently and destroy the copy of this movie. There is a plot ... it can take up to 5 minutes to show it on the camera. This is the key, namely, "story based on a true story" (mmm ... whatever) about 80 minutes. That's why we need to be seated in more than an hour to see people walk. That's it! In the first half of the year, nothing happens, as well as seeing someone in the store ... 3 walking through a male wood. This time he could be spent on the character developer ... but not. Therefore, there is no link to the people on the screen, so when they start filming, we would not care less! In fact, in the end, the ending of the movie was wicked! On top of that, camera work is really awesome! This director / editor / writer / producer of Ti West fails. I want to knock the guy, but really, his job is pants! They constantly close these sweet ones, and then the long solitaire people take while walking: I am convinced that he is passionate about it, but the results are so sad that I just want to stop the movie and put on my wrists! My way of thinking about how to direct the next cooking film to myself! Finally, the theater is very encouraging ... because of the whole movie. Save your nonsense, divide this total excretion!
