I agree with the previous commentator, the beginning of the movie is pretty good, and what will come to wander around ... This is nothing. Open stories are open; At first, the two characters that seemed to emerge seemed completely out of the picture, save 1 or 2 very short scenes. I walk, Ilyak would not have done it better if he had to leave it completely ... As for the rest, nothing is done. The visitor places a horrible place, and suddenly the movie is no longer around him, but for some days, geriatric wizards make sandwiches, who drink domestic vodka and blink at each other. Some people can say that the movie is doing well that society is disintegrating, like IFFR judges, but for me it's a bad taste, bad camera, script and bad management. So I could not have been as generous as my predecessor to get the grade: 1!
