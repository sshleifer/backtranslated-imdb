I would not be terribly called, but nothing in this movie will appear, and it's full of unbelievable development of the basics. He starts off, but after being successful, he has entered into a sub-sub-girl with a long witchcraft, and some absurd plays are not realized. For example, there are long-distance shooting at the airport, the lighting is stroboscopic. There is no explanation. How compelling is the airport storage area to light up and blur, and is it just that Snipes makes his trip incredible? This is just a few short scenes marked by the gaps emitted without errors, which is not supposed to draw a supposed one. <br /> <br /> In addition, it seems that the entire premise is that the United States CIA team is possible. shooting place, but escaping "national security" by saying to the British. This gimmick is based on a stereotypical way of meeting reality. <br /> <br /> There are so many action movies better. Better formulated, better run. Sometimes it is entertaining, but there is not enough meat in the bone, and after a while, it becomes more boring: something that would not happen in a good movie.
