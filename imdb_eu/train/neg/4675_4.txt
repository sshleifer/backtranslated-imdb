"Washington Square" is a flat adaptation of Henry James's short novel. In fact, the novel is very good, but far away from James's masterpieces. In addition, his story seems simple and unfocused to enter a movie (though William Wyler, "The Heiress", gave a beautiful version of the novel in 1949). <br /> <br /> In any case, the spirit of this great American movie writer is a betrayal. In this novel, Catherine's heroine is shy, she's not very attractive or bad at all, but yet she is an intelligent young woman, and she does not seem foolish. Father's commitment to his father is dignified and respectful, he does not side him wrong. In three quarters of the film, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) seems to be backwardly mentally poor. In the last quarter, suddenly (and very much) becomes intelligent, she becomes aware of her dignity as a woman and all that she is aware of. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br First, Catherine's nerve is well, she's having trouble with the vesicle. In the second scene, in the background, when we see a kind of airborne brothel, prostitutes held their clients, and so on. There could be nothing against the artistic ideals and spirit of Henry James. It is well known that the writer was very decent and honest in the Victorian era. I challenge in any way to find any seriousness in the thousands of pages of huge literary production in James. I was particularly annoyed by these two scenes. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know the director needs a reasonable liberty in the adaptation of a novel's screen. But if the director does not completely forget or mislead the art of an author (here Henry James), I do not see it as a bad way to use his work. <br /> <br /> The theater is a good movie: poor and flat, despite the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. The movie "Washington Square" is not recommended.
