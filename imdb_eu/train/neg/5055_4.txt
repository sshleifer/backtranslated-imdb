Two years ago I loved Sundance's debut director, Josh Kornbluth's Haiku Tunnel. So, his brother (and often a collaborator) in Jacob, I was waiting for the Best Thief World. A child who is growing in a lower level in New York City is a seemingly good drama. The movie is not without its bitter moment. Sometimes Kornbluth plays harder, as if to make it clear: life can be very difficult for some. Life is not correct. <br /> <br /> It is more subtle and, more importantly, to understand that we understand, despite the basic cultural backgrounds and the anti-social behavior that can be triggered. God and mankind. We can go back to language and living conditions, but we can not discount them with their intention. And, indeed, the struggles with the difficulty of maintaining a family can hardly be appreciated by a certain nobility. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood, and the compassion for the people is very clear. <br /> <br /> Taking this into account, the World's Greatest Thief has painful mistakes (including title). Characters are not very credible. There is a different writing And the plot line is hardly distinguished. Kornbluth is most disturbing that two young black boys use the gangsta rap scenes. Each one on his own: But I do not question the potential realism of this phenomenon, see 5-year-old children and talk sexually with a female line. It is a non-necessary shock value, and the interest of the borrower is obligated.
