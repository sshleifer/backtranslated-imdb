I was in the second level 12 years ago. I remember clearly. We were studying space. Little children want to go space, right? When I saw that, I was so scared I would "accidentally" enter a psychotic robot with only one follow-up. I did not know it was a movie. I thought it was something or a news program. I think that my own version was that people were horrified by the 'World of War of War' program. So, recently, I want to see this movie again, what my favorite actor realizes, was Joaquin Phoenix (now known as Leaf Phoenix). I'll tell you, the drama was laughing and I laughed at acting. I mean, when Andy is in the space, does he move slow, have you ever seen that? I do not think that being in space is slow or slow. The best possible oxygen tank to stop the unconscious Andy, the backspace and security doors shut. . Little Max is trying to get in. Suddenly, Max's face shouts at him (in slow motion) "Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!" I did not know.
