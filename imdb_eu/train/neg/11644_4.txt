Yes, Pasolini and his surroundings have "got", but at the same time, "Decameron" is largely overrated, and I feel a bit disturbing. Saved Realism "presenting" (milling crowds, undoing architecture, etc.) Because the characters absurd and wonderful are overcome. In search of realism, Pasolini does not use a lot of different actors, but his deer's focuses and the lines are still heavy and very sensitive. Actually, we see a lot of loud and brave people who owe the people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And Pasolini's "Decameron" is alarming (at least for me) that concerns homosexual casual and main content. I am not cautious or homophobic (I am not), but Pasolini puts images and situations homoerotic because it is contrary to the neo-realism that is eliminated, which is why it is free and enforced. We can almost hear saying "Ooh: I have to wipe a boy girl in this scene!" Sometimes Pasolini is trying to slow down the nose before criticism, because in other times he enjoys this aspect, regardless of the public's preference. <br /> <br /> One of the 9 or 10 stories of Pasolini's "Decameron" from Pasolini told me about Pasolini as just one aspect of neorealism. It seems to be bored with each story, so it unexpectedly and a bit of a supposition. Although the last line of dialogue in the Pasolinia film seems to be in the hands of some people ("Why should one create an artwork when it's dreamed so much happier?"), Why, why should I ask why? Worry if he made a movie in that way he felt? In my opinion, Fellini's "Satyricon" is a very artificial film (and more homosexual content). They are also full of strange people and absurd situations, but they have succeeded, in the direction and strong stories, while the same "Decameron" element fails.
