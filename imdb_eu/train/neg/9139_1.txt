I do not know about this filmmaker that the director Sam Mraovich confused about some of the little parties in this film. I would not normally say that it is an existing movie, but this movie can be the most important of all times. This movie definitely wants to be "The Worst Movie Ever Made". I've seen bad movies in my life, but I think something I thought was something more difficult to imagine. <br /> <br /> In this movie, everything is hilarious, but the only fun thing is Mraovich himself. He thinks it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Oh wow ...
