Well, the movie started to fun, but it got worse. I thought it would be a humor based on the first moments, but then the movie became a bad Disney channel, especially the go-kart racing scene was very long. Alana De La Garza is gorgeous, but she has a false Italian accent. The film seemed very independent and a small budget. It was a very nice moment when I called the serenading scene, but in general, this one was a yawner. Laughter is very small. As surprised by "Mr. Fix It", it's so ridiculous that he let me go crazy. You should check it for free or you can watch TV, but you do not have to rent money to buy or rent this movie.
