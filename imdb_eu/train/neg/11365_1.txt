It's a very sad movie. Really Nothing happens in this film. Script is bad !!! I think copying and pasting the first 15 pages and 90 pages. Producers have to think that in Belgium a Hollywood movie will be created. They did not succeed. Now, in the third week, it's only 22:45 or even in Antwerp and Brussels. In the past we have had good films in Belgium, such as Daensen. Tone is a waste of your time. Maybe you would enter the theater after watching the real movie. If you've watched Shades 10 minutes, you've seen everything. They were killed on the local radio and on television. I hope the shadows will soon disappear.
