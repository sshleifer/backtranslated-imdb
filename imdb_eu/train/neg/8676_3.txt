Avoid the US version. With the US footage and the worst duplication you can never hear from New York fans. Duplication is so bad that sounds like Mystery Science Theater 3000. It seems that a black man in Bronx makes the voice of Chiba. I could not see the whole movie as bad as it was. In the US version, you will be able to see other great Chiba beverages, such as The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
