This is my first movie on IMDb. I had to register after watching the movie. I can not leave a good conscience without analyzing this movie. People must be warned! <br /> <br /> First, my rating: 0 ("zero") <br /> <br /> I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis and I. Christopher Walken, and yet I hate this movie. There is a plot, but who cares when there is no script. The conversation is unreal and boring, situations conform, the flow of events is slow and arbitrary, characters are not boring and interesting, and the story, based on a good premise, is stupid. This movie is a poo. <br /> <br /> You do not want to waste your money in this movie, it's not worth the time you're watching with your time. Please do not see ... ask for it!
