Although it's a fun way to get away, this rocky cast of a movie will still not be respectful. Did the boys' bodies get dirty and stopped in 'Bernie's Weekend'? but only ?? Producer Larry Harmon and director of the film 'Ernest' by frickin use copyright as an excuse for forgetting heritage and Stan and Ollie. Gailard Sartain serves Ollie as an exhibit, but Bronson Pinchot would not reach the eleventh post at the Stan lookalike competition; Yes, even if it was one of those movies, it would not be hateful. At least about the nearby catastrophe will be said. Utopia is like an apparent song.
