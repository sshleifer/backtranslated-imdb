This self-indulgent mess, perhaps, put the branch of Branibi's kibosh, as a Shakespeare adapter for cinema. (Published 4 years ago, since it has not been adapted since then). I finished this I saw it on the cable - Holy God, it is horrible. <br /> <br /> I'm saying that I'm already feeling a reviewer. True, and sadly, reviewing something terrible is a daunting task. That said, I'm going to risk it, though it's a great prize for Mrs. Branaghen's management skills at Love's Labor's Lost * *. Branagh has always been a passionate director: grindingly literal-minded; star-jo; Improvised for his acting actors (he loves his American star, but he loves himself more, because he does not know for sure) <br /> <br /> In that sense, it's a great event. Missed * Hamlet * 1996 is worse than Hamlet *. In fact, this film can be improved, because it has a length of about 1/3. Branagh decided the first bad work of Shakespeare in Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, yada yada. For this reason, it works in 1939, leaving about twenty-one except for the dramatic interpretations of the texts of the 1930s. a well-known actor with dance or singing (he's included). As a result, it is a surreal disaster, worried that first, they will not horror at all for the first time. I do not blame the cast. To paraphrase in Hamlet, "script is the thing!" Nobody could get it right on this template: RSC alumni are better than Alicia Silverstone. Who can do this? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Believe it, it's not. It's an anomaly that appears in the canyon of Bard, specifically written for the curatorial education. He did NOT write a regular audience. Therefore, play prized (and TEDIOUS!) There are many references to the current nonsense school, Lyly's * Euphues * parodies. . . In other words, there is hardly any such material to call a broad spectator. Hell, it's not a call to a spectator before Shakespeare's comedian. Theater can not be dramatized with a gimmick that you can manually do by sharply delimiting the text and "updating" it. The question is, why worry? <br /> <br /> Branagh's second mistake was to think the Shakespeare's creamy potion could be placed next to Gershwin's jelly. It is clear that ideas or hopes could be modern intelligent recreational entertainment for modern audiences, establishing a nostalgic American culture in the nostalgic administration. But he asks again: why worry? <br /> <br />
