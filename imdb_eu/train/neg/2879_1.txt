The movie I've ever seen was the worst and I've seen bad movies. From Kansas, first of all, the movie does not have the truth empty. BTK was named and it was like the rest. On top of that, it seems that someone has only $ 20 to bring it here and make it a movie, and do not worry about something else, just to do something. Seriously pure, nobody would ever see the movie. The BTK did not do any of these things to describe the murderous cow's life and the victims, and the movie does not even see that god-love is never seen by god. The TV's are more accurate and better
