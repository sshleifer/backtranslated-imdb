I gave him more than this, I thought that there were some moral lessons in this story and caused some thoughts and suggestions from my wife and I. The play and the interview were mediocre, and I had to admit that I needed to feel. With God, he is made above our heads, God and Christ are our savior. The movie and the story were not needed. As I am, if you want to avoid a Catholic or a Christian that you are recovering, it will become nauseous. The movie was a good job to show a fine line between being a good citizen and becoming someone who could become a stalker potential.
