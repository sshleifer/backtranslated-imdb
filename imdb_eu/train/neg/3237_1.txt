I thought I was gingerbird in front of the real blood flow, but when I put a DVD that I expect a blood bath, and one of those I get is a bloody scene (eye balloon). At the table chair, I'm finally thinking about the 43-minute life of my life. I would not think this or "Flower of Flesh and Blood" as much as "movies" an exercise of will; You can see them by yourself. There were some hard places where meat and blood flower could be seen. The devil's experiment was not there. At best, stupid, and worst ... well ... really stupid. Maybe my expectation was too big. I think DVD "man, this one will be sick." Thousands of times I watched the girl look fake, and I watched as she progressed. <br /> <br /> Two types of people would be interested in this movie. 1) People who are looking for video clips will only see how they will be given, or 2) fear. This last reason I looked for this and other Guinea Pig films, but when it was included in the first category, the movie would not float my ship. In fact, I could imagine the bloodthirsty lust that ... "SEE YOURSELF!" As a result, the only reason for this film is to be collected. If you want a massacre that does not provide traditional fear, get the Death Traces. You're sure, that's too awesome, but at least you'll get blood and guts. <br /> <br /> Because it assumes that it is the only reason for anyone who prays this thing. An artistic merit that I do not understand, is no reason to emphasize anything. Lame is just to try to be moving.
