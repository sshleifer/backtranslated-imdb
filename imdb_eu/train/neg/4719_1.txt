I mean that this production is a very favorable one, which is severely disrupted by impartiality. <br /> <br /> There is no credit for interviewed people, so you can not have any ideas worthy of listening. <br /> <br /> It tells the story from a single perspective. Doing so is very dangerous because the next generation learns a bad idea, and that is why wars continue. I know this is not the only reason for war but it does not help. <br /> <br /> You can watch this documentary, but read a lot before the Internet. Balconies are complex, it's human history.
