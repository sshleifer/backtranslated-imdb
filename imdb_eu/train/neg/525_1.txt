I watched other comments and I was very entertaining, aware that all the people who actually worked on the film had commented on it. I mean, I mean bad things about amateur production, but if you do a bad movie and if you want to comment on it, make a little toning. "Advanced" is slightly above. She is a Boston university production, although she does not have the most amateur film in college. The kids were expecting a bunch of what to do. A stupid movie without a great creativity. It's pretty fun to be fun about it. You will never see something if you're an Emerson student at university.
