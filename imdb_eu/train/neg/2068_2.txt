Lou Gospel has been disappointed to me. I received an email from the theater, saying it was a wonderful and inspiring film. It was not great, nor inspirational. Cinematography was quite curious about all the films. Many scenes were flash backs, but they could not say what they were about. The voices were distorted without reason. Many people in the film were also very scarce. His relationship with his former and son is never clear. Likewise, the whole movie is in a way and, suddenly, BAM completely heals and inspires people. The whole movie seems to show that boxing is a bad thing in his life, that his life is a way of living, but when he changes, he does not leave boxing, as he teaches others. box Thumbs Down.
