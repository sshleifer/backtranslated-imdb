This film is an effort by Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While with a few problems, like all low-budget productions, it's a good start for Beaton and her company. <br /> <br /> The story is not terribly new in films like The Burning. and on Friday, the 13th, in part 2, the performances are honest. So, a lot of budget-starring roles the actor's motions; It's always nice to see the actor trying to really craft. <br /> <br /> The story deals with the murder (and return) of a disfigured fellow. . The others have sworn secretly, but the trauma of the event is transmitted to each person in different directions in their lives. Ten years later, his friend dies one of the awful stalkers known as "Bagman". Who will live? You have to check it out. <br /> <br /> If you're a Roger Ebert or a great fan of critics, you probably would not have any problems. But if you'd like to see Joe Bob Briggs and people looking for craftsmanship, check out "Bagman."
