Peter Greenaway, the writer and director, named Art House Pretension as the lord of her last exercise, vindicated by herself, 8 ½ Women. The film continues to search for rich English and her son for sexual satisfaction, as women joke and chase (guess) to enter their personal collection of their bridesmaids. <br /> <br /> Think about it so that this premise can be offensive, and the choice may be made by Greenaway. The female characters are not more than the catalog of fetishes involved in the two protagonists. The cabin is an obsessed Mio, pregnant Giaconda and Beryl, who gives something to the farm animals. She does not have Giulietta's legs and she uses a wheelchair, "half is a woman," does it get? Greenaway vindicates vehemently the allegations of misogyny, but if that is not then what is it? <br /> <br /> The film raises everything and everything related to Japan, its rhyme tracking. 1996 movie "The Pillow Book" honest (but less sexist) book. But The Pillow Book was erotic and elegant, 8 ½ Women just get horny and exploitation. Greenaway's work is not foolish and proud in its fetishism, and the only person who can enjoy the viewer is the author himself.
