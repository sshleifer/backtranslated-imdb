I saw the Lord of the Ring of Peter Jackson's version when I was reading in the middle of the two towers, and I thought it was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> At this time, the Lord's Rings animated version was released. On DvD, but I said to myself that they would end up reading the two towers and the return of the Kings (as I thought the whole trilogy would have shown). <br /> <br /> So, when I finished the trilogy, I went and brought DvD, because the stupid idea was absolutely nasty. <br /> <br /> I was very tedious in 20 minutes, which is why it was very rare because I loved the book and I shook the author. About this film, at least, one and two half-hour movies and 8-minute movie could be adapted. <br /> <br /> There was no excitement in the character when they were speaking and it seemed like reading a page, even though Gandalf is my favorite character, it does not seem interesting. <br /> <br /> The animation was only welcomed in the parts of the film (except) and except Aragorn and Sam's face. <br /> <br /> I do not know this way in this movie. It was released, although the ending was not right, but maybe it was a good machine to run out of money because the movie could not be better. <br /> <br /> I hope no one has ever judged this film. <br /> <br /> 3/10
