I missed this movie on the screen, but I saw a little bit behind my mind, so I thought I'd watch the DVD on the shelf. Great mistakes! <br /> <br /> The long list of stars can not keep this turkey, it's never the worst film. An incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented. Maybe it would be sensible if I read Robbins's novel, but if the film is completely different from the novel, and although Robbins would question the script, the reading of the novel should be boring. <br /> I hope the actors paid well in this celluloid waste and lately they are ashamed of the DVD's voids; For example, for example, Pat Morita. Though sometimes Thurman also has the courage to feel uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Keep up to date with something worth about 98 minutes of your life, cutting off your shoes or sorting the sock's outlet. Also, when you see "throw in less than $ 5" in the local store!
