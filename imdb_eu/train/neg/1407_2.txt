After having lived a Wondrous life, I did not expect much. It's hard to believe these films, like Do You Remember, made by the same man by Dolly Bell. Zavet has two hours of storytelling. The humorous and conviction of the earthly one seems to have degenerated into a pathetic underground. It seems that Kusturica has dropped down since it began to make good comedies in Black Cat, just starting with White Cat, but I think it was very good, but there were some disturbing signs of dementia. The first films I liked so much, and that's why it's particularly nice to see something like that. Let's hope the next will be great.
