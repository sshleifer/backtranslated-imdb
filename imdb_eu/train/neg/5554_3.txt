Darkman 3: Die Darkman is directed by Bradford May, the same guy who also made the Darkman fight. Darkman 3 is worse than Darkman 2, and there is nothing special, I think. Larry Drake is no longer a nasty master, now playing brilliant Jeff Fahey, which is why he wants to achieve the work of Darkman, and this time, man will be very powerful to get the leadership of the whole city. It's similar to the movie on the plot and running like Darkman 2, but I was particularly angry at the presence of many Darkman 2 scenes. In these effects, they were made in a short time and with a modest amount of money. made A couple of scenes are quite elegant and they quit, but this film is still quite tired and often stupid. The characters scream and laugh and it is very annoying. There is no philosophical depth in the film, which is still similar to the version of Darkman 2. Darkman 2 had beautiful scenes and elegant cameras, and Larry Drake's ability to play a great stick. Darkman 3 offers some beautiful scenes and moments, but most of this film is tired and full of stuff. The positive things in this movie are just a few flashback changes (Westlake's nightmares) and a couple of really awesome plots and tricks. It is worth mentioning, too, that the scene of the death is quite evil, quite comic and the main book without any invention. Much more interesting in the second half than the death of the main criminal. <br /> <br /> Darkman 3 is the worst series and we must remember that these two films were made directly to videoconferencing and not with Lime Neeson coming up with Raimi's Darkman original. Darkman 2 was well-off with Actioner's scenes and excellent suspense, but the latter (?) This introduction is hard and often stupid and boring. We have mentioned some merits, but in general the feeling is not the first thing to do. May is a talented director and we hope that the most important projects will be in the future. <br /> <br /> 3/10
