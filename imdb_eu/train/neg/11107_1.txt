Film was awesome. There was no story. Finally, blood and gore could not explain (good part) ... they throw some foreigners! I hate the director (or whatever) after blasting his ideas and blaming the aliens! Check out this movie if you like. But do not say that you did not warn. Two things: how can one say "Vinny's welcome" does not have the language? It's a shame Mr Jones did not play a bigger role. The second thing overwhelmed me, why we would have shown Vinny Jones boilers and cut them and put blue liquid on them, then they do not have other roles. Why not? I do not like to show something and has nothing to do with the story story. In short Bad story I would not waste my time - I want to see Mirrors instead.
