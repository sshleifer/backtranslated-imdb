Okay, do not let my summary fool you. This film SUCKS HARD. But the worst film ever? This movie was horrible for people to have no brains to describe. But it's not worse than Manos: fate's hands, hobbins, horrors of the spider's island, or some short movies. As a review, the movie is awesome. Do not see MST out or you can create health problems. But there are worse movies.
