I was very surprised what this movie was about. Up until now, they have been able to take a pleasant cinematography and beautiful scenery. I wanted to revive the hero, but it's a lot worse. <br /> <br /> This film has made Kung Fu a bad reputation in the first place. There are no credible characters (although kung fu films are part of cartoons, these characters are ridiculous), there is hardly any plot, and a violent story ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds you so boring and so frustrated. Trying to play a game with the child. Every time you think your fight is sensible, they create a ridiculous rhythm that is unwise ("Oh, think of your great powers and mix with 10,000 ray tracks, but I eat my vitamins with plutonium." And teflon, so your rays -Places are not working and I can not have any problems for your great powers ... Unplugged and infinite commercial PLUS. "Kids can keep this darkness because they really do not care, really anyone is listening because it's fun. Also, VIEWER, especially for the adult viewer, is a bit worse than the rumor that came with this bad movie. <br /> <br /> TIPS AHEAD Note to kung fu filmmakers, (a) if you have a knife, do not hurt if you are not in PCP, In this case, your kung fu is not strong, (b) if you fall off more than once, if a knife falls, it will hurt more and make more damage If it's not a fake, (c) you're in the heart with a knife, especially in ancient China where Kaiser Permanente is not knocking around the corner, (d) kung fu fights do not last for 3 hours, e) It is sometimes worthwhile to explain your characters and their motivations. <br /> <br /> In any case, see again Herora, because at least his small world is understandable.
