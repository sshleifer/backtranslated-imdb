With Paul Verhoeven, an angry and furious fantasy. Verhoeven is a puzzle: it's hard to say, if he guesses his guilty guilt, he works in sardonic or oblivion. He also does not seem to know that the magnificent (and most conspicuous) images of the world can not hide from the story, interview, and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a rotten scientist, finds the invisible and uses it to drive himself into a moral bankruptcy. Bacon is usually a dark actress ("The River Wild"), an attractive actress to compensate for her youthful appearance; Material, however, is not enough to get rid of Bacon. The other makers are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin. Nobody makes any mistake of making a strong impression and being forced to make harsh conversations embarrassed. High rise is a major study and must be overwhelmed with disbelief.
