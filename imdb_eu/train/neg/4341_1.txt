That was what I was missing out on the DVD ... maybe halfway up. It was so weak, I could not pay enough attention to tell how much I did. So I wanted to believe that the representation of the young Carlito was quite different, I could not buy it. I do not react to the actors, I think maybe it was a fading script. I found myself laughing several times, but I do not think these lines are intended to be fun. <br /> <br /> I bought money to save only 2 sets of DVDs and I would pay for the price I made exclusively for Original. This is one of these cases leaving only the classics.
