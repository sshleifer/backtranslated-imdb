If you have not seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you do not have it. A competition such as "Make a horror movie" can not bring in anything more than an outrage on an audience murder. Mr. Sheets forgot a story, plot, the right conversation, that people needed some basic talents and, of course, the lighting designer appeared. It seems that it has been recorded in raw manual cameras and has been copied in worse equipment. The make-up effect is made up of black masks that simulate the melting of the skin to the soil and yogurt for the heads of the people. This is just a homemade movie and very bad. It's only fun to watch friends, family, and neighbors who want to appear on the shoot. I can not understand for a lifetime all of this product's desire in any movie journal or website that is listed - Home cinema parties, which are better and more interesting. Loss of time, money and energy. The demolition of ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just the same as garbage.
