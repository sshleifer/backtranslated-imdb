OK, this movie made a reason and one reason to get the money! Producers did not, of course, die a horror classic movie. I know this movie pg-13 will soon suck up how much pg-13 slashers will continue to be good, so how many women have been on the moon? The answer is not! The nightmare of Prom night 1980 is definitely worth the trouble to recognize as a movie that follows her genre and try to make it more different. <br /> <br /> My problem with how to handle the murderer during the 2008 night of the night and 3 major problems with him ... <br /> <br /> <br / > 1) The path that escaped was in a closed-down school and escaped through air conditioning! WHAT ARE YOU? why would air conditioning air conditioning come in patients' room? Do they want to be at ease or something comfortable? 2) His intentions are doubtful if the murderer wants to kill the victims and all their families, so that they can have their own, he says he loves it, but he intends to kill him the next minute, so he wants to kill him. her, love her or just her rape ?? 3) The killer is very good, how did he develop all his skills? He was a teacher, so the main boy of the victim is dying, especially when he slept and he did not realize that all 2 stupid stars played a horror movie about 10 awesome, stupid, stupid attempts
