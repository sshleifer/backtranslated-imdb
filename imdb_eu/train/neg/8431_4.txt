Despite the fact that the actors make a conventional job even though the screen loses paralyzers, these characters are impossible to identify, with only 20 minutes of the movie, which I watch (and then more than once). Soil development is imbalance and slow; the main character's oral diarrhea is virtually impossible, the basic quality of most of the actions of the characters and the harsh ways that are being treated are annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> However, this sociological analysis, CARICIAS or caresses, is a great step, in which the characters abuse and despise each other for the best reasons they consider throughout the film. In AMOR IDIOTA, we must follow the meanders of a subnormal intelligence, while women continue to be serious and freed. Supposedly, this is due to his depression, but this script does not support it. I will not give the rest of the story, almost there are some masoists? Does he heal through his obsession, does he shock his depression with his disturbing attention? Although I saw the only thing, I did not even take care of some of these moments. <br /> <br /> You can put up with this preview, ignorance, betrayal, BAD conversation, a modest philosophy. etc. The camera's work is pretty good and it seems to be something inspired by DOGMA. Make-up also seems to want these players to show the lightest and slimmer, the worst thing I've ever seen in Cayetana Guillen Cuervo's films (which is really attractive). <br /> <br /> Let us think if we do not appreciate the idea that we should offer to see lower levels of society, Pons has achieved his goal. Almost identical sex scene was a dirt-like drama (if shot by the actors, but once on blue-green cloths, backdrops could be modified in studio-specific effects). It's true that when I heard a lot of men in these seats, but an objective conception proved it was not the real purpose of those scenes. <br /> <br /> Keep up and watch something else.
