This is the type of movie that leaves you with the image. The story is to write the movies. <br /> <br /> Incredible visual effects. Very good joke, especially from Shue. Everything is perfect ... It's just a bad story, so everything is wrong. <br /> <br /> Imagine this, if you have the power to be invisible, what would you do? Well, here, our crazy scientist (who plays Kevin Bacon) did not think that he has women and that women have to be raped. This is supposed to be the "intelligence" intelligence. Do you try to get extra power? No Never seen a study, how to be visible. The guy is completely upset. <br /> <br /> Add to that, the atmosphere of the laboratory, all these young boys. Like a bar, they threw jokes. Coats and white equipment, you would say imitation is "Cheers." The characters are very skinny and poor and very careful, to make them think they are merely collections of Wolves for Wolves. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> "Emotional scenes are so misunderstood and there are unlawful behaviors that the actors cries out". This is just a fool, I only have to find Hollow men and kill me. "<br /> If you read the book really, while the Scientist (Cane) is still a woman, she takes on a lot of troublesome mental and manipulative thoughts. Inside the movie, Cane goes to a crowded market that tears her to women and goes down. Sad
