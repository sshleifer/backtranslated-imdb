As for the script stage, and with that story of true life that was really fascinated, I was very pleased to go on this movie, but they got the good story that they had to overcome. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> THE BAD - I am a fan of Robert Duvall and he has played many characters, but here his role is as dull as insurance researcher. <br /> <br /> The rugged conversation and Kathryn Harrold is pretty. it's a real junk mouth. Since I read it, there were many directors in this movie, which is a bad thing. The thing is not saying that the story is OK. I can not even "implicate" with the portrait of Williams at Cooper's Cooper. It should be wonderful, but it was not in this movie. A guy who does a crime is also a sad commentary on "folk hero", but I also admit that he encourages the guy to promote it. <br /> <br /> Everything was not disappointed. I can not complain of landscapes, from the green and green forests of Oregon to the desert of Arizona. <br /> <br /> I'd like to make this movie again and better. a single story.
