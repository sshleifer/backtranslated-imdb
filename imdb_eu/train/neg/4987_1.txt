This movie is so bad and every imagination is worse. It's not about playing poverty and being a screenwriter, it's not a bad and bad time. This film that puts me in my shame makes it a bit like a fight in which the writers and producers of the film are trying to make it fun. He is the oldest actress representing Jean Reno and has learned the lesson in the first film, adding a new girlfriend. Some original releases and gag come back, but this time I want to clean my eyes out of my holes, because it's a perfect film. Any scene in this movie, the constant clipping of the camera and the torture of the shots, can lead to violent agitation of the audience. This second film takes on a successful original that drags him out of his coffin and defines himself in a public space in the square, and his original idea and legacy, but also our intellect, degrade them in a degraded way. Unlike Spruce Goose, this movie was not flying, because it did not return to the plot "collar" in the principles. Scripture is not written and added to the appearance of the everyday. Without attention to the camera or shots. Bad lighting and special effects for this. This movie would not even be a movie for a movie student. No one can tell how to get this pile up. The investment was lost and it seemed that no one had the power to extract this cruel exploitation in our miseries. This movie has a large part ... its END! This movie is in # 1 for all my films, "Howard The Duck" is no longer goose.
