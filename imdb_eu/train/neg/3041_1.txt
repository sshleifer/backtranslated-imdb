Yes, I rated this movie as a horrible star. Still, from now on I will turn Christmas movies. That is really so good. K.Gordon Murray is another production (read: it buys the Mexican movie really cheap / bad, it spends money in English and publishes it in the mid 60's at kiddie matin√©es). As I live, "mood swings" would make the experience a better one. I will reiterate many of the other reviewers with Merlin, Devil, Snowflakes and a Christmas movie with some of the most upset children. I plan to run during the holidays with Kelsey Grammar's "A Christmas Carol". A truly holiday experience in hell. Now I've only found the album "To AA Goodnight To (Aly Slayride)" I could not beat a triple feature. You need to watch this movie, so it moves slowly so you can quickly touch the front button, especially for two dancers. You think expensive, to enjoy the wonderful experience. Feliz Navidad amigos!
