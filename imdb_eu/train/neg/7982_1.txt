It's hard to tell that Noonan and Marshall try to make Abbott and Costello, Martin and Lewis, Curley & Larry or other comedies, but they did not want to imitate anyone. The stupid image is just a laughed laugh. Noonan (contributing to the supposed "script") and Marshall have no chemistry; Marshall seems to be a kind of freshman-perhaps-care-dear Dean Martin, but does not even approach him remotely. God knows what he was doing at Noon, but being sure was not. It seems that you tighten a lot of arms and legs and look at all of us with bad looks, and everything is on the screen comedy height; Maybe it's for him, but not for the audience. I remember this when I watched theaters. Under Jeff Chandler's western three-year double bill ("Columns of Heaven") it was pretty good and Short Three Stooges ("Unspeakable Bulls", that's not it), and about 20 minutes, all the public's boys rolled on the screen; It was so different that he did not even measure the worst three short Stooges movies. I stayed around (I did not want to, but my friends did not receive the movie until I had finished), and when this mess was over, I was the only one in the theater. . One night I saw about 15 or thirty again in a night, and it was as bad as I remembered seeing it was stuck around. It was worse. Julie Newmar, who was just as hot as always, was the only one. It's not entirely advisable for himself. They both play Japanese soldiers and Jerry Lewis is a thick loop of Japanese characters, a buck-toothed, and a good look at innocuous mind failures. Marshall organized "Hollywood Squares," and Noonan's hands continued to try to make movies, but most were just as bad. Not quite, however, they are not as bad as that. Full skewer of the film. Do not waste your time.
