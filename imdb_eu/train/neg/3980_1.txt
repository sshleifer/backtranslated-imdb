No, I'm not joking. If they ever propose film ideas, they will come out in the studio. I'm serious. All their films are the same, and they only travel to places abroad, with a problem that can easily be solved, getting popular and getting new friends. Think about it If you have watched a movie featuring a different plot, contact me and tell us your name. These "films" are a dire excuse for TV and other countries. There is no reason to go to the theaters. I'm very young and O.K. Films, studio managers have purchased all the rights they have been for 15 years or something, so now, what, 17, they can make films in other countries when they want to make money in the studio. Let me give you advice, come from MARY KATE and ASHLEY! YOUR TASTE SITUATION!
