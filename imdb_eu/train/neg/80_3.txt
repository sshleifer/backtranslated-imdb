I have to be impressed by the great ratings of this movie. It seemed very stupid. Does the mother have "conception" when she touches some things or people? And he touched on something twice that could continue his vision ... Just seemed ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful, I thought. He was very angry. The girl who played Lori had a good job, so she had the most support of what they had to do. I love LMN and I'm very open in cinema but the movie seems ridiculous for a plot and top-level and it's just for me.
