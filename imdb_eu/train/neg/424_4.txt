It was the Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the US and in other countries, and I saw the whole version of Disney's "Earth" movie. I think that, as a car manufacturer, Disney is trying to persuade the planet to look after it. Maybe they take care of the planet, I do not know, but I do not think it's a special unit that has the word "nature". I know my younger daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who am I a year old to tell my personal feelings about Disney? <br /> <br /> Excepting an incredible movie light, Disney's usual shame has been for me. Twelve midnight Disney cartoons were immersed in a Disney song ("life circle", "falling style"), excessive music, recycled footage (Disney's "40% footage"). What's more, I began to think that James Earl Jones's narration was a bit boring. I like James Earl Jones, but his work begins with each narration for Disney and Morgan Freeman Warner Brothers. I think that Disney bought some of the nature photographs, when it was so spectacular that they thought they could sell orchestral music and sounds. <br /> <br /> And what is Disney's obsession with showing predators who kill and kill animals? There were half a dozen of those seats, they were ripped off to form young youth. I think that Disney is about to close the life of the animals and make life and death a better life, and that the parents of films go to their parents directed at action-oriented teenage films. Similarly, Disney meant that it had nothing to do with climate change. Are they so afraid that the minority minority natives still believe they are controversial? <br /> <br /> I recommend this and hire a Blue Planet DVD for Netflix. Nature's film seems to be the best in Britain at this time.
