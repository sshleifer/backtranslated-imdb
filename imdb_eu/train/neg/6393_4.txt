I agree that they do not give much to this movie. At first I decided that this was not my type of movie. <br /> <br /> In most cases, it looks great in terms of its cinematography. The Manhattan scene of the 70s seems very good as well as the main actor. The black and white one is very clean, the film is almost neglected and feels cool. However, other film-makers made films that play in the film. The live edition is at the end of the 60's, between surrealism and the new wave. The story is also based on a very specific time, between free love of idealism and artistic experimentation. <br /> <br /> The film continues a young girl around town looking for a man with an anonymous phone. with sex As he knows other curious characters, he reveals his thoughts and they reveal themselves. It seems that the movie is an external comedy, but it feels like a vanguard. If you like Andy Warhol movies, I would be very excited to find a Phone Book. <br /> <br /> I have had some problems: at the end of the movie, it tells a story that lasts a character. for more than twelve minutes ... - to be seated by savages. Likewise, the animation sequence is very explicit, which serves as a helicopter for the movie. I laughed four or five times loudly, and I liked the end (without disgusting the animation). And when the movie was changed to the last sequence of the last night's cell phone cabinet, I really liked the way I liked it. It happened to me as if I liked it, it was one of those experiences I felt as if it were different. But this is what the filmmakers gave us. Left, striped and left, but none of them are recommended. I did not have the sole or creator to be compelled and apparent.
