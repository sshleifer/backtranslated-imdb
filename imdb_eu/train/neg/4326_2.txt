In the 80's John Hughes wrote great comedies. "European holidays" is not one of them. Hughes's "Vacation" (1983) is a continuation of the first great success as it is predictable, as it is unfreezing and annoying - you love Clark and Ellen Griswold (Chase and D'Angelo Chase and D'Angelo), even if you love it. ). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I liked the "Holidays" and the third "Christmas Holiday" in 1989, but it is a must-have trip to Griswold in Europe. Perhaps Hughes's first attempt was that he did not get it, but it is really doubtful that his stories are "empty and inadequate." Not through the story: Griswold's "little pig" has won the game show and is spinning across Europe in England, France, Germany and Italy. The first brand is a great mood, too, because Amy Heckerling is the blame for the director. The director of "Fast Times Ridgemont High" is fully considering this. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was because Hughes shot it out because it was cheap. "European Holidays" takes great pride when the Americans are upset (they recall that they have watched small pigs that won), especially the tourists representing Griswold's family. Also, behind the back, "Griswolds with us, something is always included because our father is an idiot." After that, almost fashionable comics are finished in honor of America and Griswolds is grateful to return to a better country. If Hughes was looking for a satire and wanted to do it like a bad movie, I would have to reward it with 8/10 stars. <br /> <br /> It is not only unmistakable, but it has "European holidays". The two worst actors to play children Rusty and Audrey (Jason Lively and Dana Hill). Both are annoying and evil, with the unknown Audrey and his mouth, thanks to the boy who has almost completely filmed the movie. Hughes also warns of losing his mind as he sees a huge bratwurst. Tasty In a word, breasts shine in two different scenes, without reason (except by commenting on Americans' comments about love affairs in their comedies). <br /> <br /> I will give the movie one of its stars. Thanks to Eric Idle of the Monty Python group, it is the funniest part about the repetition of the lines of "Holy Grail" in several points. If Hughes wanted to find him as a single American non-American actor, he gave him another tip of the hat that opened under the Hollywood comedy of the 80s. However, would he hurt to be entertaining for that?
