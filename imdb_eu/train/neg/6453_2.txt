There is hardly anything to recommend this film. Chase Masterson is always nice to look at and really act, even though his task is in the trash. Unfortunately, the other casts are wrong and medium. Many such films will shine through the material and make you look forward to making a reference. There's no luck here. Unique monkey-on-loose-loose "unknown" creatures fall behind one another. The monster is a man with rubber worn back in the days of Paul Blaisdell. That's a pretty good thing! The show is so bad that it is bad. He would like a little more mood, but everybody plays deadly stuff deadly. In the end, it's one or two turns, but then you will not worry.
