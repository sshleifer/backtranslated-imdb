The nation's most successful Lampoon is "Animal House" and is reasonably successful. It was fun, compelling and good. <br /> <br /> The opposite of all other Lampoon national films. "Class Reunion" included. <br /> <br /> Please do not be fooled by the introduction of "Animal House" by Stephen Furst ("Flounder"). Or John Hughes wrote in a troubled mess. This meeting is as horny as the root channel and it is twice as painful. <br /> <br /> A star, which is generous. Again, I always thought that most of my old classmates were devils, vampires and serial killer.
