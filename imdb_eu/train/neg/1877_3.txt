I have not seen "Henry Fool", but I do not want to see "Fay Grim". Hartley wants to be the director of "thriller anti-thriller". Based on the official description --- that the woman finds her husband's manuscripts a material threat to national security --- I expected a tough geopolitical drama. Instead, I found a weak structured, goofy conversation, flabby characterization, a striped plot, and this "tone" that changed so often Hartley Hartley's script changed its mood at any time. I can hang on for a long time to follow the sharpest and most difficult plot (for example, "Duplication"), the loose ends seem to me to end up joining. Even if they do not, or when they do it, but they leave doubts (for example, "Duality"), sharp writing and acting may be of interest to you. But through the "Fay Grim" I was halfway through --- I do not know what happened, and I did not care. Bad, I really like Parker Posey, I was indifferent here, indifferent to my foreign wife and indifference, and my unmindful motherless stranger. There is also a bad casting. Jeff Goldblum can be very good, but is not able to overcome the confusion of the CIA as an operative. It seems almost uncomfortable in the role I was watching him. His CIA worker is worse; It seems like a refugee from the "American Idol" quarter (young CIA agents have large hair licks covered on eyebrows?). Then the question of age of the characters is blind. Goldblum was 54 years old when he made "Fay Grim"; Thomas Jay Ryan plays "Henry Fool", 44 years old. There was no appearance or appearance older than their real age. However, the key point in the story has been serving as a CIA agent in Nicaragua in the "70s." Goldblumen's nature would be thirty years later; Henry Fool would be a teenager. Was Hartley "curious" or lazy? Problems are too many to list ...
