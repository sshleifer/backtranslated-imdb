It is in the early 80's. There is an age group of older guys. And he is approaching. Yes, this is Slasherville. <br /> <br /> This movie is called Pranks. Why is Pranks called? I have not the least idea. If you're not the idea of ​​a great duckman eating somebody with a touch of baseball - especially, it's not a big joke; In reality, landfill is quite simple. But you can go. <br /> <br /> The film corresponds to a group of teenagers who are responsible for cleaning up the worried room. They know that psychopaths are loose. To cope with this development, they go through darkness. It ends with a weeping cry. <br /> <br /> Pranks is a slasher-made movie. I saw the DVD version was a Vipco. Violence seems to cuts a bit. As a result, the DVD is even more sensible, let's take a look at it, it is a waste of a violent slip. Only slasher and accessory wizard videos.
