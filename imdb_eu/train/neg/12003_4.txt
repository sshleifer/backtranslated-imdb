Six different pairs. Six different love stories. Six different angles of love. Ninety-one audience at the cinema hall. Looking at the eighty different pieces of the silver screen. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting somewhere in the cinema to find out what's going on in the movie. All stories have no connection with each other, but somewhere under Nikhil Advani's attempt to show their relationship. I want to know some lines that can be written as a review, but I did not write anything at the end of 3 hours and 15 minutes. The movie is a bad copy of the LOBE Hollywood LOBE. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. Do not watch the movie if you want to see a nice movie.
