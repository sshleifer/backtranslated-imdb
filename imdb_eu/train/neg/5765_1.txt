Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea at the beginning. The latest film was a mediocre effort. Next to this charge, it is a classic comedy. While the second half was full of dated moods and full-fledged play, it was fun at least. There's nothing funny about humor. Jokes, templates and visuals should be fun in nature. Tired jokes on the head of the audience is not cool. The humor of this film is directed to the extreme humble people who laugh at everything. When they responded to the high school crowd, they made sense of self-respect from the window. Ring parodies are not fun. Since 1998, I've watched comedies. Michael Jackson's jokes are not good either. It is even worse to have fun with two diversions: they were "interpreter", because the best days were never there. <br /> <br /> The death of American cinema has been slow. Such movies are nails that want to insert the coffin. What happened with real humor? I have never heard laughing at the movie theater. They clean too bad movies. Do you like proof? Go to the local chain store for mega-videos and see what's in the shelves. This movie is bad. Do not believe hype. I'd rather watch Scary Movie 2 continuously than just having a bad excuse over a comedy. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it is not recommended (unless the brain is in a handful of cells).
