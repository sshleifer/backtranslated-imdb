<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven finally bombed him. He became a joke about himself. Once again, we have a lot of controversy between sex and violence, immorality, women, and characters and peat bogs. <br /> <br /> It's nothing. This film is no action. It breaks all the established pieces. All actors show their Verhoeven film. In other words, more than just acting at all levels. Starship Troopers fled, because there was a Machu world that lived in these characters. Scientists work the same way. I'm sorry Paul, but Soldiers and scientists are not really the same mindset. <br /> <br /> It was an important mistake in the plot to make a night for the evil things after the character of Kevin Bacons returned to science after the science returns returned to science. In the laboratory, we have already spent enough time watching the animated costumes (except Elizabeth Shue) to walk and talk. Why not show the size of the character in the outer world. How could he track him if he had been anywhere? Think of all the things that can be done with this concept, both in the story and characterization. Check out what the film does and make the project really well done and well understood. <br /> <br /> More DVD insults is Doco, where everyone says that Verhoeven is MAd Genius. Well, neither one is bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has no great comments. As the title says. <br /> <br /> Empty!
