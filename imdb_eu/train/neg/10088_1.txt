I'm an actress, producer, director, and I would say what will happen. This project was the shortest in the history of film. Producer and director and the editing of this movie called is a joke and I mean a big joke. Why did Blockbuster release such a nasty? My work is very serious and this film is the result of my profession. Did the director want to make a bad movie? I do not think so. I've seen bad movie Zombie, but it's all about Coffie cake and table. SHORT BREAK HERE! I really hate talking to other filmmakers because I am myself a bad guy, but consider doing a different profession. I respect that you have finished the movie, but I have to ask you "RETURN YOUR COOK", your girls, scary zombies, what do you think was the make-up. If I had voted for Zero for the whole nation, I would. LONG-TERM FILM HISTORY!
