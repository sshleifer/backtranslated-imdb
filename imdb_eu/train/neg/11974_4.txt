You realize that you are viewing EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years, right? I was able to understand the first curiosity on the island for a coexistence, but you would think that seeing an egg that falls from one bush to another with heroes who are sneaking with an egg in the middle of the decade. You need to commit a little more original (and interesting). <br /> <br /> And I am not discussing the controversial debates in the debate. It is very difficult to stop the rat's "Bushy Bill" from stopping rat eating, when all the groups of producers and cameras are in a climate-controlled machine, a frozen mochcinno with moxy. <br /> <br /> What is the appeal here? I do not care about these people or their bizarre ways. I do not know. But if you think that you are captivated by hairy and hairless people, I recommend you take a TV and go to a local bus stop to see that people live in EGIA. They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE and, for free, you can sit down and scratch cigar waste to get plenty of garbage dump, which is what you call "dirt paid" and Dr. Frankenstein generating home cancer. -stalk, asking for a change of food, the "aroma of Aqua Velva" is enough to suggest otherwise. And the best? As a survivor, a member of the tribe a week leaves the "island" when they do not send it to the local organization when they put the whole situation of schizophrenia into a terrifying situation! Now that's entertainment!
