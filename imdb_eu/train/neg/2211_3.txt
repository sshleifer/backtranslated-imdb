Hahahaha !!!!!! It's fun to summarize this movie in one word. Why was this "thing" crap, because it could possibly kill the movie word !?!?! Director, writer and I hope. This producer does not mean that it's okay, I'm sure it's not !!! A scientist turns his son into a shark shark and kills a bunch of shadows inviting scientists on the island !!! Oh my dudoodddd !!!! I hate so much this film that I laughed when I was watching the most serious, so devout and non-professional part I laughed ... and they could not have been a more realistic shark, even though there was a little bit more budget than most "budgeted" little things. I have to say that this movie looks like a bad performance and a movie that looks a bit stingy, but you expect a good movie if you expect it. I will be very disappointed.
