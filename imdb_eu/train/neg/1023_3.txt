LL Cool J much better in this movie I expected! In a "Renegade" policeman he made a wonderful job in the "Renegade" section. From the beginning, seeing the audience's empathy is a great job to face up to the nature and complexity. It's like a huge "giant" giant: anyone who is strangely out of the way is afraid of anyone. Right from the beginning - and it does a wonderful job. He was clearly the best character of the movie. <br /> <br /> This was definitely a performance that was not won by Morgan Freeman. After participating in powerhouse films like Shawshank Redemption, this film took a step. Edison's role was simply not to show his true talents as an actor - and as regards the conglomeration of the characters, he turned his back to the burner. There are several ways in which his character (Moses Ashford) is essential. That was not disappointing and true. I could see more about this movie. <br /> <br /> Timberlake was in the music industry. A portrait of a young journalist was not bad. This movie is a short film (at least LA was corrupted at the beginning of police affairs). In addition to being an action movie, he plays scenes, blood and trips. These scenes are usually not realistic and predictable. There is little suspicion about what happens at the end of the beginning of the movie: the bad police / police think about what you would expect from the conflict and the police filing has a little REAL similarity. -out <br /> <br /> In most cases, Timberlake's character was a shooting scenes. He uses guns and does not use them. Then, as he finally uses to get one, he fights as if he had thrown a pile in his life. Then he depletes the bullets and does not have any pistons - and 30 seconds later, without moving or not doing anything - suddenly 2 fully charged guns and extra ammo! Some plot bug like this really ruined me the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a fictional fantasy world where everything is working, surely the movie you love. Personally, I do not care what the film's KIND is realistic about. Think the story is true. This story was so fictional, I felt so happy about it.
