In short: this is a romantic comedy that wants to be something more. Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, wants to be a graduate. She wants to be human and deep. It has interesting cameras, lighting, music and interesting editions. All this gives the feeling of a great movie. The conversation is intelligent - sometimes. There are some moments of "laughing moments". <br /> <br /> But here's what makes the night-time cable, the flight, the only time killer. <br /> </ p> <p> 1. David Schwimmer - how many times Joe feels sad dog canine dog breeding can start crashing into his space when he sticks his stick up before he gets angry? Maybe some flowers would help. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow - it's really flat and not just chest. Its mission is to be a cheerful, friendly and caring situation that continues to go down in a bad state, it's very mixed up, and that's why a sad loser like Schwimmer has a chance. Gwenneth, but it's very sad. Combine this with the drool face of the dog puppy (top) and little chemistry to take care of. <br /> <br /> (This role seems like someone else, for example, Kate Hudson.) <Br /> <br /> 3. Script and drawing - things that are basically not true; All problems are eventually linked to emoticon, as the whistle seems to be and the writers "oops, catch up, catch the train!" So they released the book of the Hollywood book, the kutxa abandoned and went home.
