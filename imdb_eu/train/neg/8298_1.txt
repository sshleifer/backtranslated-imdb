This movie was not very entertaining, definitely NOT as a good or original Christmas story. The characters (except younger) try to emulate previous actors and fail. The people of Mendixka do not get anywhere because they did not participate in the first film. Really sneaking, it might have been good for the original cast, and again it might not be because the story is so weak. Jump.
