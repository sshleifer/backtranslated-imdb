There is no reason to understand why this film has ever been made. <br /> <br /> Why should Hollywood continue to get a great update on another classic? (Reasons in these cases: Mr. Magoo, The Avengers - Awesome!) <br /> <br /> I usually enjoy Christopher Lloyd, I enjoyed myself in such a misunderstood role. The manly portrayal of his beloved "Uncle Martin" is so badly untimely as to be almost criminal. His differences, gymnastics, foolishness and histrionism are not given as a cartoon character without reason for his character's preservation. <br /> <br /> The director needs to think of fast movements, conversation grimaces and "need to be taken". "It seemed like a slapstick comedy. It seems that all the actors were wearing pants on their cheeks. <br /> <br /> It should be a guilty fake handwriting. I think the writers" Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World "writers have a comedy script as he used as a classical 1963 classic, which is much more important than this claptrap - which is a sudden appearance that is pretty good. <br /> <br /> It seems to be the most sad thing about this movie It's been necessary for me to get to the children. I do not know what their children were. Certainly, I do not know children who have no card I know! <br /> <br /> If they need to redo my "favorite martyr", why Did not they add time to the original classic charm? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com can not "read" the readers' only "zero" factors, that is, the only assessment that we describe in that opinion. <br /> <br /> Good to come from this movie That was a thing, I thought the actors and the crew paid me - I think.
