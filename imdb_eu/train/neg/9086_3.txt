The rohmers' wonders were what they thought to be similar to old filmmakers, and normal viewers considered them as artistic defeats (like Renoir or Chaplin's latest films, but their "politique des auteurs" also has its dark side.) With the "Les Amours d'Astrée et de Céladon", Rohmer wanted the final movie he wanted to endanger the tradition of great directors, he made the latest movie, adapting "L'astrée" by Urfé. ", with hilarious aesthetics, as witches as the parody of the latest films by Rosselin (for the television of Descartes or Marx's life). <br /> <br /> In" Perceval ", Rohmer denied him, shot in true landscapes, transcribing classical representation of semi-medieval things The director apparently changed in the seventeenth century, and films, dressed as a farmer in 1600, recounted similar old texts surrounded by trees and contemporary landscapes, but they are seen to be the most horny thing as Luchini and his false trees. , but the way Rohmer mixes naturalism with artisans, so baby and amateurism seems to be unintentionally bad (and I'm not even talking about the strong pronunciation of the actor.)

At the beginning of the film, Rohmer teaches us that the original French region of the tale nowadays imbalances modernity, and that is why he had to shoot "L'Astrée" in other parts of the country. However, I am sure that the movie would be more modern and more interesting if Rohmer shot the same story in an innovative field, with the same narrative code and artistic decisions. This movie is interesting to some historians, but most of the movies can laugh at the last and sad Rohmer movie.
