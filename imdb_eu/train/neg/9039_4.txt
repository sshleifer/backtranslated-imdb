I think a noble effort, but at last poor. Before seeing this movie, it seemed to me that "Bartleby, Scrivener" did not seem to me. After watching, I still do it. Unfortunately, I think those who read the story only understand what happens and they will face the unexpected of the film (from 1850 to 1970, moving from New York to London). The brilliant talent of Paul Scofield can not seem like good but good sense of Melville's classic metaphysical shooting.
