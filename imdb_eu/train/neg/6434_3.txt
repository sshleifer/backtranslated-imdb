I always like to see how many people are different and how to get them almost everywhere. The people who think of the movie and the best person they think. <br /> <br /> Stigmas would never be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's there. First sound Producers spent more time in the edition. When it was so sound that the soundtrack was playing and nobody spoke, and then, when Patrica spoke of a monotonous voice, it was almost impossible to listen. I love Patrica and Gaberial, but they were both. flat in this movie Patrica had essentially 3 emotions. He has a restless, painful, or really angry stigma. The first one prevailed, the second was screaming, the third raising the voice. Three moments and no emotions were distiguished that echoes. <br /> <br /> Maybe I've missed out on all the deep meanings and infrastructure, or maybe I was focusing on giant care and MTV style. When you watch a video of 3 minutes, you need fast cuts and slow motion to transmit a fast story in a 2-hour movie, it's nuts. I do not see women crossing this woman and the meaning of dropping the child. And it's not Pittsburgh that often does not rain! <br /> <br /> I think maybe a real story, it might be something to say, but the whole budget was spent on buying music and being at a slow pace. She dropped the plans and rented the gorga apartment Ms. Ms Arquett told the story of the mother boy.
