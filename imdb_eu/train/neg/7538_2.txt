I saw this movie, like Nicolas Cage, and it seemed to me well, strange and totally insignificant ... so I decided to poke around a bit and I got a 70s copy of my hands. Wow what a difference The original was better. I wanted to know that he originally made a statement, he had an objective existence. The public Christian was actually a fear of paganism. If you go into the depths, it makes comments about life, but I do not want to make any details, just put it, if you are disappointed and would like it to look like it would look like it. In the 70s, a little dated, but much better.
