As I refer to Malice as a movie, I do not like masterpieces such as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or Maltese Maltese (Falcon Falcon), nor by Becker's director Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. I just registered a protest against the darkness that comes from the beginning to the end of the film, you can only write about what happens in most times. Night scenes I understand darkness, but this film has been dark all day long, why I am not understanding why. Anyway, however, there would not be much difference, the director Becker shot in the dark.
