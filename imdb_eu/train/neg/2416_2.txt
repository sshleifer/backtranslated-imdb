I'm 2 star and generous. (Small disasters) Look, this is roughly zombie movie gangland set in Oakland. According to the soil, a scientist wants to rescue his dead brother after he died in the unit. <br /> <br /> The main problem in this movie: what zombies ?! All "zombies" make the move (a frightening remoteless sound) and the red blood comes from the mouth in a fake! It is not afraid, people run coughlessly, pathetically shaking and stupidity. <br /> <br /> The cover is also misleading. There are no more than 6 zombies in the film, so there is no "hood" full of zombies or nothing, there are only a few, and it's not a long time. <br /> <br /> The effect is really so bad that it is horny. No one can act on the film (except a member of the gang) and it seems that they have decided to gather a bunch of friends, to cast their family and make a movie during a weekend. <br /> <br /> Last note: When doctors do champions? Skip this, please!
