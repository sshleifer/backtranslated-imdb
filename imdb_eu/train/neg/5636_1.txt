This movie has been the worst ever I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It does not seem like a plot, but you realize that you're far away from the beginning of the movie, so you have to close it for a long time the director is impossible, the Sloth that plays the tampon chick in the movie, and we do not have the movie Willem Dafoe Believe it, it's a clone, as we know it's a real Dafoe "now apocalypse" and "holy boon docks", they would never have agreed to this script. <br /> <br /> Duh, (Da) wrote the bill that the enemy had reduced his baby thirty years ago. This film begins with the credits of the two main characters, Dafoe and Colagrande, then two writers Dafoe and Colagrande, and later the director, Colagrande. <br /> <br /> Bottomline (story); The widow meets the guy, the widow with his widow, the widow breaks the windshield with a senseless one. <br /> <br /> Dutch title; Black widow (different title, same lie). <br /> <br /> DO NOT USE THIS VIDEO !!! Total waist time !!!
