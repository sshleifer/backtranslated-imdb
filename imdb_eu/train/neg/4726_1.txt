It is about a tortured, proud, deceitful, and destructive character. <br /> <br /> I am not wrong because I am very deactivated. the main wall of the main character, which has a very destructive nature. In front of what I object to, this means that the guy is very little. Why did this man hate himself and the world? After writing the script, maybe they gave sympathy to him. In fact, the hateful nature, unpleasant, not tragic, just hates. <br /> <br /> Kindly think that the guy is a guy and an anti-semitic and his fate is as dark as possible to make the writer a happy ending ... <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but good fighting is coming! Man! Do not waste your time.
