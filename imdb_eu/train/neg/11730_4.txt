Darren McGavin, researcher reporter (Carl Kolchak) has returned; This time, after "The Night Strangler". Again, police officers and other journalists do not believe or want to cover, the supernatural angle. Dan Curtis, the producer's director, presents the same basic story as "The Night", in an understandable success. <br /> <br /> Mr. Curtis brings together a fun cast about fun, and George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis are among the "Dark Shadows" alumni. Jo Ann Pflug (like Louise Harper) directs a sexy belly dancer collection. And, even though I've never even seen it, in the first scene that Roger Davis McGavin had to be in his role as assistant, there was no credibility about the existence of vampires! <br /> <br /> **** The Strangler Night (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
