This show has been a huge 30-minute DVR hard disk space. I did not expect much, and I really did get less. I hope in the second section I think it should be canceled. I can not believe that Geiko will definitely try to campaign for the campaign of the human being's bride. I would give it a night because of the sharp sharpness of watching my daughter's hair sharp. I wonder what happened to the ABC exhibition, to enter the autumn 2007 schedule, perhaps an AFLAC daze's hospital / crime / documentary reality show? Unless my opinion about this show is blank, I must say clearly that it is not very good.
