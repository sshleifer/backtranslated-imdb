I can see how they applauded this movie about the home audience. Outside, no interest, it makes no sense. The Germans were incompetent and the Russian were portrayed as heroes. The unexpectedly romantic angle was useless and distracted. It was nonsense how a young woman could look at the lieutenant's love. How could he get it, as mentioned in the end of the film, he never married any more than fascination over me? I said that the Germans had been photographed as they were fuzzy, and as it was, he entered into the marshland. Several hundred German troops advanced and the Russians went into the marshes. So the Russians were hiding and the Germans stopped at the edge of the marsh, listening to them. I think they do not want to dump their boots, but I'm sure the officer ordered 20 or 30 men to look for their water in the water. But the story would end. Likewise, the Germans rolled into the barn where the Russians hid in the attic and did not burn the roof. In most cases, a soldier would drop a grenade to the chamber and did not look up to climb a staircase. <br /> <br /> At last, I saw some reviewers who said what they said recently. Why? You knew that this little group would be lost and there was not such a heart.
