According to the director, it's difficult to find a distributor in the U.S., because most people do not seem to be conflicts with Christianity and American evil. In any case, it is amazing what anyone who views this religious film. Is it that the minister of a mission turns homeless people or "Godspeed" into someone who wants to become a "Christian" movie? It could be interpreted that religion really makes a mistake "Throughout the country" with all its excessive material, the best organized function can be done to offer a soup to a bible and a verse. Maybe unhappy or ill-treatment? Homeless wasteless in vain? What is the Vietnamese psychopathic number? Did we survive the prestigious "pink" agent of the "Whole Territory" of the patriotic paranoid Americans? Maybe we have a lot of psychiatric patients? Without a doubt, we do not have a lot of people worried about Palestinian politics based on telephone conversations in the movie. Of course, if you have worked in a homestead in Germany, the unhappy ones would be far more concerned about remote lands than with their personal survival, as the world knows about the "European continent" sophistication. </ B> <br /> <br /> I truly agreed that the title is ultimately meant by the United States as a "Whole Territory", and in this particular case it means plenty of scripts, amusing plays and directed films. Life is short and one, even American, does not "see" many times to see this piece.
