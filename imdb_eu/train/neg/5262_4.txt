We had to go to an appointment, so we started the DVR. After finishing, I looked at my husband and said: "Do you have a clue?" He shook his head. I said: "So I saw the end of this movie and I did not know what happened." He did not do 'me', but you know. <br /> <br /> The body of the film was pretty good. There was a lot of suspicion. He asks you. Then the end came. It was over ... it's just finished. You would not stay or why it happened. I thought something that explained to credit was going to appear to me, but it's never been done. So I came here to expect someone to figure it out and I did not pay attention. Laguia. Four years later, I was as annoying as Tom Sawyer. <br /> <br /> I still do not know what happened. I'm glad I did not spend $ to buy, I'm sure I would be crazy. OHHHHH! I understand! The end of the movie disappeared! ROFL
