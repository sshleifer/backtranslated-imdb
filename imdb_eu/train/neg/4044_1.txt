From land and movement perspective, the movie was horrible. I was looking at the clock in the theater, I found the hope that would rest after 80 minutes. In essence, five characters appear in the movie: A Son & Father, the boy's girlfriend, and the two male men of the age of the son appear and disappear without context or explanation. Movies and scenes seemed to suggest men's eroticism, but nothing happened in one way or another. There were some great scenes. At the beginning of the film, her son's maid appears outside his room and carries extravagant conversations. The photography and the performance allowed them to captivate the relationship with both institutions, confirming that they were "older". The end of this story.
