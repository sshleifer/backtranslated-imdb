This movie does not live well. Perhaps the impact and characterization of what we have seen with The Sopranos is that of acting and directing, but I saw Prizzi's Honor for the first time only on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The experience seen 24 years ago had to be very different with the audience, but I must say, I was surprised at the end. It is not that violence, but only the idea that it would come to a certain extent. <br /> <br /> I enjoy a good wolf, but it seemed such a thing ... Also, when it was moved. Would you like to set it up? All the cars of the 1960s seemed to be, and yet the World Trade Center towers (built in 1973) were clearly visible in scenes of urban landscapes. <br /> <br /> The movie is a different way of playing badly. A mere idea of ​​a person traveling by a passenger on the seaside on his person. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1980s, the audience discovered a fascinating and entertaining film. In the mid-sixties, greetings are later filled: you can only live.
