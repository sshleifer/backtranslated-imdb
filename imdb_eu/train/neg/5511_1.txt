I have to agree with the first commentator: this movie is very hard and very hard. Despite the fact that the B-list is very large, the cover of this movie (one of the ones that are not watching Comedy Central on a week-end, it will probably be the only exposure that this film will ever achieve) brings Dangerfield's fault to just the reward for all comedians of the 80's da. Randy Quaid? Check Ed Begley, Jr? Check Lisa Simpson's voice? Maximum Overdrive could not say his only great movie: double check. And many others, many others. <br /> <br /> The sadest thing about this color, we can say with the jokes already mentioned. There is nothing about this movie. You better see dry paint. The direct video clip of the bottom film of the barrel that still believe in the old video clip is filled: an old star on the cover and throw away money. . Due to the fact that the days of renting videos have changed, consider one of the last examples of garbage removal. <br /> <br /> You are only when you are not having trouble using this movie. You will reach it.
