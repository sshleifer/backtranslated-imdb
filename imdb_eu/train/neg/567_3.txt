This movie is one of the awesome movies ever made. How to play Jon Bon Jovi? It's an actress, not a singer, what? Does the vampire kill his guitar? And with a terrifying plot? Oh, my God, the movie is really awful. Arly Jover (Blade) is a queen of vampires surrounded by eternal vampires, eventually surrounded by an army of vampires, but only 4 vampires remain when they come to the "fantastic" killers! What happened with another 10-15 vampires? Are they running out of the sun ??? And when the "Grand Final" Bon Bon hits a shotgun? That really is "NO." In the 100 episodes of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", there is only one vampire with A SHOTGUN ??? This is really originality!
