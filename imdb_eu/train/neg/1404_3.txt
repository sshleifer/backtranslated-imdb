Arthur Askey's great skill in comics was in his way of communicating with his audience. His youth jokes, stupid songs and dancing dances fell well because he was able to attract people from outside the wall and folk. The disadvantage of direct viewing was a remarkable disadvantage, and it was never completely comfortable in movies. His moments are in The Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, has made the most of his talents, but it must be considered by Askey interpreter. <br /> <br /> Askey's support movie is not strong, including regular co-operative Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a honeymoon couple; Linden Travers as the "mad woman". He also attends with Peter Murray-Hill, married to Phyllis Calvert, unmarried, as the main man, reading completely unknown and Miss Carol Lynne. Actress Kathleen Harrison steals the character without any effort, as a single-woman woman dressed as a papier-maker with Morris Graham's brandy.
