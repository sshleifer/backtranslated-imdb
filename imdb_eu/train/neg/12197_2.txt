Beast Wars is an investigation, excessive hyped, overpraised and overrated. Let's take a look at the characters of this bad show to be acidic so that they can try such a show. <br /> <br /> Cheetor- This boy must really have a censer bar. Why does not Taz take a viewer with the same voice as a baby? (At least Razzoff's Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc Slip & Slide) Action Blast- If you want a line of dirty show, get a show that G4 Tranceformers Cybertron has to enter. Good creative jobs (Sarcasm) Show removal and boring (Super Mario games are at least better) This show has many fans, but I think it was canceled for its benefit.
