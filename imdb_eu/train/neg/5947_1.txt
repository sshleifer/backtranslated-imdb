This is one of the hateful and cruel films I have ever seen. Unfortunately, I attacked him, because Donald Sutherland's presence was mislead because he gave him some credibility. [This is the last time it's going to happen]. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There were smart characters dead in the film. This is among the many things in this movie: "Where is justice?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why is the cable at the end of the night filling up with sassy rubbish filled with melancholic rocks? Most of these films seem to have a particular female problem, and they seem to be terrified and dying. This movie could be suspensful, without the patient and twisting process. Everything that ends up is that the viewer's stomach is insulting his illness and the intelligence of the viewer. <br /> <br /> The actress is terribly good. In my opinion, they first got SUTHERLAND ENTERED BAGGAT, and others used to use it as lemmings. <br /> <br /> I'm wasting some time, giving you this piece of garbage.
