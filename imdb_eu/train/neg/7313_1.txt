I was wasting 5.75 to see this movie movie, so I want to know some things: <br /> <br /> What was the difference between the dog and the beginning of the movie, the disease did nothing. be divided in half. <br /> <br /> What was the fact that when Karen's home was dragged on the cover, he was already completely infected with his room, he could safely block him there. > <br /> Why should the hermit walk in the woods to ask the stranger to ask for help, his husband, the flesh lady, to the hospital? <br /> <br /> Why not? All the characters help get into the village to make things bad, are they really lazy? <br /> <br /> Although Paul's guy was threatened with his jaw, he asked for help from his wife Paule, Jeff or Bert. she is a girl that she loved. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the box? <br /> <br /> Why did he go back to Jeff when he got out of the cabin and was infected by others? It was a great jerk, did he want to leave the house beforehand? <br /> <br /> The police have tried to collect children and burn them to the fire. The pit, why they threw Paul down the river, it was not, even though the land needed the water was already contaminated. <br /> <br /> Who makes the water of the river lemonade, this crap leaves dirt and mistakes. Why could not two children use fountain water as well as contaminate them, so the stupid end would still work.
