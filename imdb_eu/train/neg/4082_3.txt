Watching that movie has been painful ... it's not a dramatic way of dazzling emotions for well-developed characters in dramatic situations (as I went up the end of this sentence), but just over two hours. Now, all you can think of is not a shaky reviewer with respect to Shakespeare or a "respect for" artistic films ... well, it would be wrong in both ways. I love Shakespeare's works, most notably Romeo and Juliet's tragedy, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet, and I've seen a lot of "arthouse" movies, such as Eraserhead and Fellini's 8 1/2 surreal and well-done film. ... but Shakespeare missed in more than two words, that is, excessive nudity (in some scenes I understand some artistic scenes ... but it's not in any movie in any movie, I HAVE BEEN CLOSED AND BEEN COST, I DO NOT HAVE HISTORICAL !!!), and Basically, filmmaking is very dirty. When I had a lot of hope for this movie, I was told it was "very artistic" and it was the adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest ... but this was an extreme drop. I gave it to this movie only three because it was an active performance of Sir John Gielgud (who passed all the names of this film) and as a combination of cinematography / design combinations, they painted many scenes as a painting ... However, a great part of this film would be better With paint, underneath a textbook. Really disappointing ... maybe if he had given the chair of the Zeffirelli chair, it would be much better. But this is the opinion of the public, many of them can enjoy much more than I do. Having said that, if you can not find it at nearby video arcade stores (it's currently not on DVD), do not try to find it too far ... it's not really worth it.
