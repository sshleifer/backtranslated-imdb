Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a young woman with insurmountable intelligence, which is a confused past and gets much more than getting it, when she went to a pool party with a beautiful colleague. When the date and friends say they are "a member of a Murder Club," Maddy takes it seriously and "Level 3" goes up in a parking lot by knocking on a woman's car (removing the car ...). But does Maddy make a plastic mask and kill other members of the team or lose another? <br /> <br /> The origin of this movie (originally called MAKE 'EM BLEED) is thought to be very well. full of holes and spirals, completely uncontrolled, before finishing the game of the left field. Some conversations are not inflatable. I had no problems with Rochon's performance, but he was a great assistant. However, I managed to escape through this full version of Moon full of well-entertained. There are plenty of skin and blood and it's a good idea to sit and separate with a group of your friends. Horror fans will enjoy Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman's (Debbie as a parent) and Julie Strain (first victims). <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10
