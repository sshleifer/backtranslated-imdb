I clearly miss a series of high school "drama" (I think) an unpleasant hip-hop, breaks of dances, graffiti and kids trying to become a Roxy dj. I forgot to be honest to be honest! Music lovers also agree that this film plays a great role, and - as a drama - it has failed. We need to find this kind of childish and pleasant child. I found nervous and tedious. I really hated one that was in Ramon. He makes graffiti on the subway, which is very large. Sorry? To begin, you do not undo the ownership of public property. Likewise, these "excellent" children keep their city's electricity, they can have a great dance party in an abandoned building. Uh huh So, we find the most selective and funny group of lawmakers. <br /> <br /> I would apologize if it was a good music but I can not get hip hop. The songs were, at least, mediocre and they did not stop! They're always playing! I made a quick overhaul without the end of music numbers. (Crop music and the 30-minute movie you need to do - maybe) There are some imaginative numbers - the subway dancing fight, Santa's number very funny and the Roxy climate show. If you love hip hop, here's your movie. But you're looking for mixed drama - forget it. Also, HOW DO I get a PG rating? This has sworn.
