Elizabeth Taylor never played before her and in this film she was her usual and most annoying guy. That was so fat before taking it, but it was still very short and rough. Rock Hudson is well on Bick Benedict, but clearly, it would be a better actor like William Holden. James Dean definitely proved how to make the rumor of a movie. The movie is very slow and it's too long. The actors were very young and lightweight and one of them was not convinced by any age as a makeup. Hudson looked ridiculous, and Dean and Carroll Baker had the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
