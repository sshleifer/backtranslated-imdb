I have written some reviews of the MoH episodes, which is the worst. At the beginning, an interesting premise is completely neglected when the credits are thrown out. When people do not see life in real life, if you do not have fun ("let's look at the basement!"), This is your show. Exceptionally, it's not fun or entertaining - it's just annoying. <br /> <br /> The virus is never shown. I can not forget that it affects only men, which means that the situation is very scary. But, then, things get worse, because their father leaves the father boldly, and eventually dies in his hands. Women flee to the north, and there are a few decades. Then, there appears something spiritually or alienally or something like that (HUH things you can go to?). Or something. Then the warmth is heated. End <br /> <br /> Soul These directors send this trip.
