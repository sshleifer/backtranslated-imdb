I'm a David Lynch fan and everything on the DVD with the Hotel Room and the Twin Peaks for 2 hours. So when I heard this, I immediately caught it and ... and ... what is this? It is a series of cartoons with black and white, mouth and bass and bad. Maybe I do not know what's right, but maybe this is just a bundle of binoculars just before the people thrown out by the name of David Lynch. Let me make it clear that I was careful about the rough language, but I had to adjust the sounds that my neighbors could have. In the end, it is very unnoticed, and it is likely to be a curious curiosity that must be left untiring. I recommend that you not spend your money. 10 to 10
