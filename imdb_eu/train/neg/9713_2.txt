I first saw Cold Case as it lasted about a year in Denmark television. When it came to television, nearly three or five other American crime scenes dropped the air of the time. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I was dead, bored. The underlying actors with harmful and moral faces were suffering from behind. A premise is a very difficult premise for a group of students to solve a lot of money over the 10-20-30 years or over 60 years. <br /> <br /> Time is also a factor, with only 50. -60 min. It tells the story, which means that it takes a while to break the case and survive the family of justice, if it is still alive. This has to be the "personal problems" and "time" of the researchers that combines the relationship between researchers to prevent the show from being left empty. <br /> <br /> I end up ending with the final music. that is, the only reason for the observation ... you, of course, do not do it, that is to say, TOO lame reason for reason.
