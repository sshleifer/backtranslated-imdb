First of all, let me comment on the likes of the movies. The special effects were wonderful, and I rarely felt that I was watching a video game. There is a nice thing to say about this movie. Actually, I would also like to warn all those who read this, and I can not even remind you to remember me without writing this review. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of complaints about the movie, but I remember four major complaints. My first major complaint has to be linked to the horrible misfortune of "land plot" (as most people see far from the millennium) Loisen's 5-year-old son becomes a food. Superman's son. Crying when the super-child puts the piano in front of her mother to save her mother, I almost got up and left the theater. Singer could make Superman a much better film, apparently brittle, but ultimately from cheap skills such as super-daughing little boy. It's been 5 days since I watched the movie and I vomit it. <br /> <br /> My next big complaints are the continent that raises Superman from the cryptonite continent. It's not the Simpsons comic book that goes wrong with that. Brian Singer read how many books he has comic, but I do not know how much a supermarket has undergone a small amount of cryptonite, it's hardly a bit harder. A big island that flew from the great vulnerability of its space did not have any business related to projects related to Superman. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula film, which plays a part in the character of the title character and is still able to fly a garish spacecraft in the sun. Why do not you eat Superman cryptonite? Eat it and stain your teeth, then sleep cryptonite pajamas. This is no less sensible, without rising to the continent of the cryptonite, without penetrating the space into the atmosphere, without splashing into or falling back into the ground. <br /> <br /> My third major complaint is that Singer shook the film completely into the face of symbolism. Superman God should save the only son of Resurrection similar to Jor-el God. Jor-el was not very wise, he was just a scientist. And he did not send his son to the earth, to be a savior, he was thrown into a rocket and soon he was shot in space because his planet was exploding. I will buy allegory of Christ, as Brian Singer could show the Bible in the place where God has sent Christ to Christ, because the Earth was bursting into the Earth, God made the first weakness of Christ a radioactive source of Christ. Also, the scene of "Crucifixion," because Luthor puts Superman kipptonite with a spear, "I want to insert my face into a brick brick, until he dies without brain, it will be understood as symbolic and obvious symbolism. A steel man in the distant future. "Superman Returns: The Passion of Christ" could be renamed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And as I speak Luthoraz, my last great complaint is that of Singer's representation of Lex Luthor. Lex Luthor is a nasty and cold business tycoon that is better than trying to destroy the world for presidents (that is, comics). Man wants money and power; He wants to be in charge, not to ruin everything. However, Superman Returns (formerly Superman movies) are a great theater theater that we see, which draws bad schemes to destroy the world. If singers have the slightest loyalty to the character, instead of being superman of the previous Superman movie, this film may be a terrific passion. Perhaps Singer's next project could be a Batman movie, where Batman's 1960s television series focused on the interpretation. Zam! WHAP! POW! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Everyone has the right to vote, but if you do not hate this movie, your opinion is wrong. I encourage you to read anyone who does not read this movie yet. Do not see, do not buy when it comes to DVD, do not rent ... you will basically not make any money for that. This movie has not earned any money. Indeed, I think everyone who watches the movie, Bryan Singer needs $ 45,000 million. If you are a fan of Superman and want to watch this movie, bend and throw yourself somebody, and you will get the same experience without losing 2 hours.
