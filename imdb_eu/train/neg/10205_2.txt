So I'm wondering if I'm watching this movie, the producers of this film saved money from Sandra Bullock's wardrobe, dragging Miss Congeniality's "front" clothes down? Mrs. Bullock also slept under "ahead" under Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have already mentioned, the movie is very formulaic. Add to that, who leaves the viewer with Cassie May, Gracie Hart is darker with the background story, and it is soon repeated. <br /> <br /> Two bad guys have been killed in series killers. (and better) in other films. "The good partner is protecting his partner despite evidence" is a "good pair" seen before. Indeed, a character in the film does not go beyond two dimensions or only a few stereotypes. <br /> <br /> An ultimate appearance - using the serial killer is false advertising. Killing a person - despite being a prey killed - you do not have a serial killer. You may be a murderer, but you are not a serial killer, nor a killer challenge.
