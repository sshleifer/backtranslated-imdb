This is a light show about paranormal, although Art Bell and his career play out the attitude of Carl-Kolchak. Of course, surely, there would be no X files because this show did not really prepare this viewer. Darren McGavin is not exactly a type of super heroic, but rather credible (enough) guy to give heroic deeds. Check out his work on some of those old Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Here is the main attraction. It seems that there is no girlfriend or wife distracting. Actually there is no sex appeal to the show. Also, as I can see, the intermediate is not an ordinary suspicion. There's a great humor for this show. Sometimes it just gets its climax to the pokey. From this show, MAD MEN shows a thread that is approaching today's style. David Chas writes for Mad Men, but the people who worked under him undoubtedly emulated and inherited his tone-in-the-comic tone.
