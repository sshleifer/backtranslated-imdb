The movie was very interesting for a television "horror" movie. I was fascinated with the mystery of the story and the mystery. However, the end was completely extinct. The film made a fast pace and still began to build, however, it had a climatic look. But guess what there is no end. After nearly half an hour after the movie has begun, the audience wondered what had happened. Why did they leave an answer without a question? There is no explanation of the key points on the ground. This movie is like a murder mystery, and then it's like never knowing. Very inadequate This movie seems like producers do not run out and never finish. Real bomber!
