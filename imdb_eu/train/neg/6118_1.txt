This is not a great performance at Tarzan. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to show off beautiful wives! Bo 'Derek's' 10' movie was at least a mood and there was reason for nudity and sex. This movie is just soft pornography. If this is included, then you can go ahead and pass the rest! This movie (like Bolero) was once more a vehicle to show Bo Derek's horrible career. It's definitely a beautiful woman, but her poster is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than this; This was a little mistake! Do not waste this time on this movie ... go buy the book.
