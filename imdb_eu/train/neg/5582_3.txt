In the 60s, most people changed the time of awakening. Social agitation and unrest were commonplace when people talked about their opinion. Racial tensions, politics, war in Vietnam, sexual disorder and drug use were everyday fabric and daily news. This film has largely been successful in storing these historical aspects in a fun movie. <br /> <br /> In this film the two families follow: white, black. In the first semester of the film, the story continues according to family in family and family battles. Unfortunately, the second half of the film is almost dedicated to the white family. To be honest, there are more characters in this family, and stories are mixed with lines, but the same issues are not part of the racial aspects of this century. <br /> <br /> In general, the performance is well-done and historical. Footage blends in with color and black and white with the original foil to feel a movie document. The film is a fictional work, but the known historical clips are used to set the timeline. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie but the situations were predictable and the story was in one go.
