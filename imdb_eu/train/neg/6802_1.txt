The word can not describe this movie as bad. I can not just explain writing. You also see to yourself that a movie is really awesome. I recommend you not to do it. There are so many cries of clich√©s, mistakes (and other negative things you can imagine). To start the first technique, there is a lot of error on the aircraft. I will not list them here, but mention the color of the plane. They did not even show an airplane in the color of a fiction company, but they used 747 Boeing painted in the original book. Very bad. Plots are stupid and many times before, much better, much better. Here are so many hilarious moments, I missed counting very early. I was also next to the boys during the whole movie, so good that they were so stupid. The "executive decision" would definitely have to choose the following: "Turbulence" is also better. In fact, every other movie in the world is better than this.
