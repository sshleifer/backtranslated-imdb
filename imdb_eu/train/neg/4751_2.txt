First of all, when I saw the Wendy Wu trailer, I was happy. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls in Disney Channel, would do martial arts and I was fine ... until I saw the movie. The action was badly composed, the movie could not be heard anywhere, realistic battles were sucked ... along with the plot. If you really think that Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a descendant of other warriors, a girl wants to make her call and wants to become a queen of the house. fight against ancient evil. This idea was not the original, the movie is a waste of time.
