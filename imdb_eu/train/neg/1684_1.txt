*** spoilers *** spoilers spoilers *** spoilers <br /> <br /> There are bad movies and then there are so scary movies that make them comical love in their inability. This is what Columbia Pictures's 'The Grudge' does. This cinematic atrocity was another well-invented American movie that saw Japan's 'Ju-on' movie and the movie was inspired by the English remake. This is the virtual tsunami of the wrong decisions that circulated around the world. In February 2004, when Orlando was taken to the sea. <br /> <br /> I use the premise, and the word, a house in Tokyo is lying down. The magic ghost momma, which resembles the cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, a horrible and bad classmate, but also a disgruntled junior student. Is there less than an 8-year-old Japanese boy? Sure! Count Chocula comes to mind. With this bundle of confusion, I must add a mysterious black cat to Chim Chim, who has called me affectionately. (Remember Speed ​​Racer?) As you have already guessed, murderers were killed, and now everyone in the facility wants to kill him. You have seen, as a Japanese detective has said, when someone dies at rage, he seeks a ghost revenge for all the defining property lines defined by the curator or something that defines something like that. <br /> <br /> The story was imperative when Bill Clinton's Spanish acclaimed man came out of death. I think that Bill Pullman has achieved this job, his children were asked to travel to Tokyo to Disneyland. After that, we are subjected to a slight and interesting saga of the Yoko nurse, the "oh no joan no" is screaming at the audience, but he does not make serious warnings and prevents it as a magic feather. About 30 minutes in the film, we finally see Sarah Michelle Gellar as her American hero Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar could be the most competent actress, but I could not think of Buffy Vampire Slayer, that he paid so much attention. A movie about the adventure of six friends in New York is equivalent to being the protagonist of Jennifer Anniston. You can make the most of efforts, you just can not stop talking about another project that has been famous. But I say, Karen, the nurse is recruited instead of the original caregiver who was the original caregiver. <br /> <br /> She goes around, she knows the ghosts, coma lady dies and other things happen. Seeing the remains of the dark eyes I found the ghost and I managed to get out of his mask and reveal that he was the owner of the abandoned Gower toy! "I will also disappear with the baby and with that dog!" <br /> <br /> Takashi Shimizu, the director of Asia's Wood Ed, has made two unhappy decisions with sound. First, the soundtrack will only be used when someone is about to die. It is intended to dissolve any resurgence, which warns the audience for two minutes to prepare for another unforeseen murder. Secondly, the ghost gave them a strange guttural rumor. After the movie, when I went out of the theater I heard a lot of people, sound and laugh. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar eventually survived. And, of course, we learn to make sure the bride set to burn the house over time. However, considering the humorous reactions of the audience, they did not want to follow up, but rather to apologize. 'The Grudge' can be edited again in the commercial comedy, maybe it will be rated for the camp. That is why it will be the biggest cinematic thriller Godzilla vs. Megalon. I would like to wait until I get to the Theater of Discounts at the Film Festival, until it can receive a public merit that is so rich.
