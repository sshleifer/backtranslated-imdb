Wow! This movie is really awesome. I can not imagine someone who could read this script written and gave it a clear view. The same level of throw is the second with nearly all kinds of performances. The story is imbalanced, fragmented and incoherent. Tell, lead and predictable. There is no charm, no mood. It's not so sexy The characters remain flat as flat. In addition, there is a growing misogyny, as the film grew harder. When your lead (Carrell) gets upset and unpleasant. Even though the triumphant victory of love that will end more than victory over love, I left my stomach in bad feeling. If we go through humor and social comments, we are definitely doomed.
