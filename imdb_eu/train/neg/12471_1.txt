In the Middle East (living in Israel), I was excited when I bought my Syriana card. Watching the trailer and being in love with thriller, I expected, in the first place, to see a lively and lively movie about the relation between global politics and oil, power and corruption. Well, I almost left the movie in the middle. The rhythm was slowly slow, almost all the characters were stereotyped; The exchanged editions understood a very difficult logic, but as Steve Rhodes wrote in the review, it did not matter at all. Save your money, save time, choose another movie. <br /> <br /> Robi Chernitsky
