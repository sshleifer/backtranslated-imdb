I've never been to approaching film adaptation to the novel (especially loved ones, like Evening), but I found that the author of the book, Susan Minot, was a scriptwriter and executive producer. good fit. <br /> <br /> If you like the book, do not get this film. The distance from the book is that they both do not like it. <br /> <br /> Here, our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with Harris. She is the son of Harris. Buddy is a drunken boy, in love with Ann and / or Harris. I do not think that a single character has made it from the book to the screen; Oh, it's worse at all times. <br /> <br /> And, incidentally, we did not learn to cut the scenes of our heroes by the bridges of Madison County. "Children's growing kids do not work on the movie?" This movie is a disaster. Jump.
