We still have another interesting premise and some special effects that can be included in the trash. <br /> <br /> Direction and boring direction (beautiful Annabel Schofield, as a brunette, and surely deserving). better material, and Charlton Heston always true) they get a real stinker rating. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that Heston sees his usual pair and shows that this movie is really bad. Even though he was interested in linking me to the main film line he was interested in a subway. It was not completely resolved. It finally falls <br /> <br /> Really. Do not miss this time.
