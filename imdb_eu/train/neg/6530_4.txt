** Later captions ** <br /> <br /> Gerald Mohr, the B-movie actor, in the fifties and seventies, has a great Mars Martial expedition. Before reaching Planet Red, we are entertained by romantic changes between Mohr and Nora Hayden; Jack Kruschen, a resident doofus; and see Les Tremayne, another scientist with a goat's goat. Martian outer backgrounds and red shades are pink roses - the "cinemagical" process of ads. The authentic monster tasty are: giant amoeba, three eye insects, Venus Fly-Trap oversized and rat / bats / unforgettable spiders. It's a very fast one under the influence of hypnotic drugs that survived Hayden. THE ANGRY RED PLANET continues worsening, and probably most of her friends took her during the psychedelic decade of the 1930s.
