Scary! Scary! Scary! No, I did not like it. It was clear that the film was intended to continue with the "wheels of agents and transformers" that produce a movie. In some cases, they are people who represent themselves. I did not need a movie to say how little people are in the film industry. I think I'm guilty of really waiting for something like "Roman Holiday". <br /> <br /> I am not a film maker, nor do I even take film classes, but it seemed to me as a movie. A series of "two shots" (mainly) where the cast (!) supplied with a loose line and improvised the conversation. Henry Jaglon says that he wrote the script with Victoria Foyt, but the impression was that the actor, aware of the general director of the film, had no extinction of the conversation and was not always successful. Such a case in the line of conversation by Ron Silver (and I'm not looking for it!) He warned and Greta Scacchi laughed. Having a serious conversation because Silver's note is not a sequitur. An impression also causes an actor to try to make another actor "wrong wrong" and break his concentration. An example of this is that the producers say Silver's "% & @ # # #" documents (3 times). Silver words were literally lost. I have seen another movie like improvisational drama workshops, which was awful too! <br /> <br /> Jaglon was able to attract Greta Scacchi (not a stranger in Australia), Ron Silver, Anouk Ami and Maximilian Schell suggested "it was a slow news week." Peter Bogdanovich looked at his face at all times, and said: "Look, I am a director and screenwriter, not an actress" - this would not have meant! Faye Dunaway, his son, was interested in promoting Liam. Apart from the broadcasting of the interview, the handheld camera was angry, although it was true. The conversation was "natural" as I suspected - and they were interested in the interests of the principal. A shot that tries to penetrate the head. At least Cinema Verite approached him. So I used the mute button with the irritating French song, it could be a disappointing 90-minute overall. <br /> <br /> We do not think such films. It avoids seeing the value of a movie that considers the fundamental transcendental film to be perceived. He was not really at the forefront. An artwork was not found, but there was no documentary. I know it was a documentary, but it is a true test that is entertaining. I was tired of myself! It was useful: it said 'Cannes', which is why I gave it 3/10.
