This girl is in the woods but the woman ends at the clinic and she wants abortion. His father is away in a van and is therefore angry. The whole episode is aborted out of this clinic. I did not really choose, but I wanted to kill this section. I laughed when I saw the baby out and came in the corner. Ultra sounding was a lot fun. In this section I felt my father felt sick. She wanted to protect her daughter and did not blame her for what she did. I do not know what happened to the other guy or daughter at the end or what was waiting for him. I was laughing and I would recommend seeing "Pick me up" instead. It was not the worst episode, but it was not so great.
