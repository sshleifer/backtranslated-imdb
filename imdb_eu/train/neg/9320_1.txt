If the movie was a comedy, I'd give it 10. Oh my, when do I start? Put this way - I've seen a lot of horror movies, but this Troll 2 looks like Ryan Private Rescues. As a group of pornographic filmmakers decided to make a horror film, he decided to change the production center and make a comedy, then he was afraid, and then decided that pornography was directed. Everything about this movie is amazing: music score (someone shot the guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard), script, direction, cinematography, performance. There is nothing else to describe that. Oh wait, there are: Saints * *!
