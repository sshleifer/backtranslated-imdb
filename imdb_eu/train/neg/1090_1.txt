I had never seen any movie that was ever seen and that the actors did not care. 90% of the movie did not have any plot, I laughed so much my ribs began to hurt. When Robert Duvall caught the old man it was wonderful. At a managerial level, making a black film is not a lot of sequential sequences of many characters that do not do anything and nothing happens. It's just a thriller to create a black thriller and alienate the viewer with inconsistent scenes. Based on the "manuscript" written by John Grisham, I do not consider this one as one of his books for film adaptation, as movies like "suspech" or "rainmaker" show a dazzling and exciting look.
