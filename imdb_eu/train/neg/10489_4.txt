I do not know if the author of Phillipa Pearce or his novel does not have the work of TOM MIDNIGHT GARDEN, it would probably be very small for his books as a child. When I was a child, I was not really interested so much, if the monsters did not have soldiers with a large body number <br /> <br /> TOMS MIDNIGHT GARDEN, Pearce writes for the lower middle class protagonist Tom Long As it is prevalent, when approaching a garden-house, suddenly there is a metaphysical one. Being in your garden undoubtedly did the working class in the 50s, so I think the text underlying a certain political class is somewhere. A young girl named Hattie also has a love of love, but children of love love stories again? Perhaps the worst criticism is that there is little excitement or adventure in the narrative. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for children that looks like a source. It's harmless, but I'm shocked by IMDB voters. I wonder how many grades would be given to the 10-year-olds who only saw the Lord of the Trilogy trilogy?
