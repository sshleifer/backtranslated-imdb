Hiya people, <br /> <br /> Well, this movie really has come true. Think "Love Actually" vice versa. Nothing fits well, nothing consistent, and definitely nothing makes you laugh. Love is strange in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a total flop. However, as noted, there are three points about this compact potential of a movie: <br /> <br /> A) with a star with Jennifer Love Hewitt, it will be a horde to see it. Just catch a Hewitt petite fit with a fitting outfit. Now, guys ... there is a certain hope scene ... but eye candy is very weak. Here the "options" will be watered here. However, I saw everything that was tempted according to the next title ... the creator! <br /> <br /> B) It's ending and romantic. On the contrary and "above" is important ... yet it has still been a positive point for me. <br /> <br /> C) Dougly Scott plays a friendly friend ........ refreshing! THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> 2/5, it's not worth your 10 or a few dollars. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the 2/3 route, I am sure that Jennifer Love Hewitt has become the next softcore legend. Now, I'll take it so much ... it tightens a lot of the following film. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the sisters are stupid. Her husband is a stupid way ... and what the hell is, stupid. <br /> <br /> Next. Can not wait for the next love with JLH!
