This movie is very bad, I almost feel sick. So far, the rest of the parts had at least one good thing about it. Section 1 was suspensful and gory. In the second half it was profitable and entertaining. Part 3 was interesting with great effects. Part 4 featured excellent music, special effects and entertaining Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than I have seen before. Alice, a much prettier blonde, in the fourth half, is back with her partner, Dan. In Parts section, Elm Street Square is supposedly a soap for the day. The newer character seems tough, and this sweetness also has a shoulder chip. Freddy seems totally out of place. He seems tired and does not seem proud. Because its liners are far from different and different, it could be quite funny in Section 4. Leslie Bohemen's story never gets out of the way, and Stephen Hopkins's direction is so bad that my grandmother looks good! The whole argument of this movie is ridiculous and realistic. It's also confusing and pretty stupid. Avoid part 5.
