The end of this movie was very awesome and I laughed at my film aesthetic classes. Now the rest of the movie is fine. Little by little the scene was fun, but it had some good shots of true camera and editing. Bai Alderich is an excellent director, such as Flight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened To Baby Jane. The problem is not directing, acting or technical. The movie is just about to be destroyed during the third year. Why? All Nuclear MATERIALS were created by murders, crushes, turns, and all the characters? What the hell was this writer doing? The way out of nothing is the greatest Deus Ex Machina in history. Due to the complaints made by Burton of the Planet of the Apes, David Gale or Notorious has life this is the worst end. What to leave
