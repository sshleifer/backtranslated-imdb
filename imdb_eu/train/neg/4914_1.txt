I love the history of the love story (and I am a boy), but when I rented the "Love Story", I prayed as soon as possible and painless, and vice versa, by the nature of Ali McGraw. <br /> <br> Ali McGraw Jenny alienated and horrified me in the first 15 minutes. When we were diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, I could not ask, I wonder if Oliver's death can be dreaded or if anyone cares about watching that movie. He did not die, he probably threw his grid identity on the edge of Oliver and eventually landed them in the divorce court. <br /> <br /> People love this movie, but it is one of the worst in the 70s.
