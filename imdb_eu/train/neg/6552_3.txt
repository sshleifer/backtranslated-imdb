Money (now played by Khrystyne Hage in Angelina Jolie) has gone to a post-apocalypse desert (after protesting his eldest son, Elijah Koteas said he was a real actress who was a protector) and now finds that people scour the scrap The debris that seeks cyborgs to make metal and cash trading. He directs a redesigned cyborg team (including human scientist William Katt, Evan Lurie, and Zach Galligan) against Richard Lynch's bounty hunter. Malcolm McDowell has a two-minute screen watch for Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 is better than two other tickets, but it's still very sad. This time, the problem with potential ideas that are not well-used, sequences of actions are common, and names like McDowell, Katt and Galligan are not doing much. Haje is, in fact, a buzzing hero and Lynch is too much (as usual) and the movie is lacking inspiration or ambition, it must be fun and bad because it's ridiculous. (With Van Damme, the second one is sad). Likewise, the angle of the science fiction is desperate, and it faces almost a challenge to good ideas. The action is in the form of a movie, it's a routine, and according to B-movie numbers, and it's done correctly, the only thing I can say can be positive. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 4- (Poor))
