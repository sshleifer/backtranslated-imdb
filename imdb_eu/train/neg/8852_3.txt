Honestly, I did not see any "understanding" already, but I saw that the first fear of these scenes was a great movie. so great that it was necessary to make seven seasons tremendous. They started "Howling II: Your Sister Is A Werewolf". I received this film for my son-in-law as a VHS, when he purchased some of Atari's old movies when he was at the new Atari. I saw last night, and it was not really bad, it was strange. I mean, Sybil Danning would go with three directions in three directions, it was completely disturbing and disturbing (but hot), Christopher Lee, as if it were a vampire ... really this movie is really Dracula and Lost Boys It was like a mish-mash, except Christopher Lee (who played the same Dracula), all because he was telling him about the wolves, because they dumped a vampire movie (at stake). He has to die in the heart, garlic, night creature, and the poor man's king lives in TRANSLVANIA. It's not for the play, but it's the worst part of Annie McEnroe. I swear, at some point in the movie, we found the men hanging on hunger, because this sore throat should always say something. However, the plot is quite absurd and topical, so it's not really a matter of saying it, just read it around you. By the way, I'm confused about nauseating about this movie. It's an original film of all seventh episodes that is related to the original (without telling Howling IV (1988)). the original, that is, a sequel based on the same novel). so do not watch this movie. There is no real fear, there were almost no massive men and incredible fx specials. 3/10
