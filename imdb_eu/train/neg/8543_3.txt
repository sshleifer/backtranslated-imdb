I agree, that I had to transfer quickly through that DVD for about 30 minutes - it did NOT happen and everyone has already described the "plot". But nobody mentioned the initial scene - the butcher's knife is played through a perkle and is on the front yard in herbs! I think he's a bratty kid, he's never been told. Truly trippy opening. <br /> <br /> I would like this film to be better written or more thought-out, because a movie that is absurd and a movie that is absurd is not "clear". It's just a badly executed movie. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a clean version and if I have the missing footage, I would like to see it. Otherwise, this is a curious short film, if it is redirected quickly!
