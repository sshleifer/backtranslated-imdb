Now, first of all, I confess that it says something that can be evil or unfair, so I'd like to apologize in advance for how much I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Adds it to that. I do not like this movie. More specifically, I liked the concept of this movie. Cinematography was good. It was good mood And the performance was rewarding. <br /> <br /> However, the story is wonderful, correct and misleading. It is also offensive. <br /> <br /> I'm in the Indian Cree quarter and I suggest for some reason, personally, according to Whitaker's character. First, it's a black man. And this is not a racist comment, I swear. The idea that the black, white, Hispanic, or American American katana on the roof damages everything that indicates this katana. Samana expresses the soul of a samurai that is part of the Samaritan souls. Ghost Dog can also use pistols instead of Katana to crack down on cracks and souls, and wherever he got a katana? Samurai caste must be one of those replicas. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ghost Dog also has no honor to show. Near the end of the film, he shoots a guard on his back, through a window, and then kills a man on his face with a facial faucet. Not only cowardly way of killing the enemy, ninjas are more than one way; murderers silent; There is a group that denies samurai, but hatred does not hate it. <br /> <br /> Then he tries to try to kill his boss when he learns that his boss is evil. Do you know what a real samurai does when he learns that his master is bad or dishonorable? He dies, to try to kill him rather than to lower his master's degree. <br /> <br /> Everything about the character was a contradiction to be a contradiction with the true code for all Samurai: Bushidoa. <br /> <br /> So we have a great cinematography, a good atmosphere and a satirical plot and a premise (which is the most important part of it), which makes it a very unknown film and one. The indulgence of all the enthusiastic bushi (samurai) insults. <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10 Bleah
