I remembered I saw it several years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival. I really enjoyed it. I've been saying that most people are blasting this movie because the movie was mixed together (just like the filmmaker's approval, in the official site) as it was "cut off". <br /> <br /> But still, it was a lively comedy. I think many people try to read too much at a comedy. Everything you need to do is laugh, that's all. When I showed that, I got it at that level. Just my 2 Cents Anyway.
