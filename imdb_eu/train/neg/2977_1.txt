Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /> <br /> Directors: Mostly Lucio Fulci, but Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei <br /> Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin < br /> <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> To review this color and get a good background, I must start from the beginning. And this is the beginning of George Romeros's Dawn of the Dead. After leaving Dawn in the 79's, Lucio Fulci decided to go on a crossroad and was called Zombie 2. This movie is known as Zombie Plain. You know the area that fights with the shark! Ok, so after this film (called Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and made a lot of money, the Italians decided, heck. Let's take some zombie movies! These things are getting into the dough! Zombie 3 was born so. Still Mixed? A story about this is just another story that we've seen in many American movie zombies that we've seen before. The best part of it is Living Dead of Return. Let's see ... the government experiences people with a specific toxic gas that turns into zombies. The cloak releases the general population and the fear! We get a lot of zombies who like human flesh. A bunch of people start to run away from the zombie and end up in an abandoned old hotel. Zombies must fight for survival. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of problems in filming this movie. First of all, the dear goddess Gore Fulci Italian was ill. So he could not finish the movie. Later, Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasso (4) gave him the smallest director. He was very fond of a movie. Fulci himself did not really see his heart and soul in this movie. He was unmoved. He gave films directed to producers and, above all, said: "You want to do what you want!" God loves them, they have done so. <br /> <br /> And that's why we have a zombie film, we love and gifted by women and men, as recognized by Fulci. In my opinion, the main problem is that it is a nonsensical agitation! There is no substance! After some first few terrorists steal toxic gases and accidentally release them, the rest of the films are not na√Øve to mere characters, without any personality from zombies. In some cases, this can be fun; Because # 1 is zombie and zombies can be good and fun, and # 2 there are lots of gore and trip. <br /> <br /> We do not get here. ! Well, there are a few moments of inspiration, for example, when some eagles are infected with gas and when people start attacking. That was it. There is also a scene with a zombie head wing (incidentally, deviating all logic and explanations) and shaking zombies and poor girl girls in the abandoned hotel pool. But apart from that ... the rest of the movies fall into the ass. <br /> <br /> The never-ending scenes that are not moving in an unfinished plot are endless. That's my main movie. The sets are unfinished and there is hardly any art director. I hate everything looks so finished! I like my b-movies, but that's just it's going below! It's closer to a Z-level gesture, if you ask. <br /> <br /> Is zombie formed? Pure pure Zonburuak are Asian actors (they have filmed the film in the Philippines) looking for Asian zombies. But this is not a big problem in filmmaking on the islands where Filipinos were set on the island. It's really awesome to look like zombies. The same reasons were killed for some reason. For those who pass through Zombies, there is a bunch of black faces that make up a face (like the drawings). One or two zombies have been more complex, but it is still not enough to impress. The actress in her faces was not just a bunch of surprising scent. So, this movie is not only gently walking, but it sounds like zombies. They must be dead! Anyhows, who are not waiting for the usual coolness of Fulci's film, is not there because we expect it, especially the movie of someone else. And those who participated (Mattei and Fragasso) did not really put their hearts and souls. In fact, when you watch Extras on the DVD, you will see what your memories and feelings are about when asked about Fragasso when it's a flick, it does not take it seriously. You're ashamed and often says "they had to do a job and they did it." And my friends, this is the latest nail of this film. There is no love, and it's not a heart to make this movie. That's why you get half and a half zombie movie. <br /> <br /> They will be able to complete or view people who want to see it. The rest do not disturb others! Rating: 5 out of 5
