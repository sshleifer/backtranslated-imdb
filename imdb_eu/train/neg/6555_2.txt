So I decided to watch Tales of Hollywood Hollywood tonight: Natica Jackson. Or Power, Passion, In the case of murder in the Netherlands. When I bought the movie, Michelle Pfeiffer was the star and I thought I had something to say about quality. Unfortunately, that's not it. <br /> <br /> 1) The movie line is very confusing. During the film, two lines are running simultaneously. They only have nothing in common. The plot I expected from these two story lines throughout the movie was clear to me. But he still has not. <br /> <br /> 2) The movie title will be a movie about Natica Jackson. Well, sometimes. As has been said, there are two different stories in the film and the shortest work in Natica Jackson. So the title of this movie would not be the wrong choice. <br /> <br /> To finish my story, where I really am, nobody can see it, I suggest you leave this movie. was it If you do this, you have not lost 90 minutes of your life as I have done.
