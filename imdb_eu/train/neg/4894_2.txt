Redundant and eternal films, no drawings, no scenes in this movie. In other words, it was technically poor for me. Music bits are corrected (sometimes synchronization was not danced, poorly synchronized, actors occasionally bad and obvious improvisation, etc.). <br /> <br /> It's a long and boring movie. In the end, it makes few points and much less. <br /> <br /> Although there are good ideas. Some comic elements are really effective, especially the opening scene. However, the movie becomes worse and worse, knowing that it is unbearable and impossible at the end. <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer was very dynamic, this is not the truth in the movie. This is the disagreement between the trailer and the actual movie, which is very far away.
