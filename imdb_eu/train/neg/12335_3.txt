Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are one of those classical actors who are interested in watching me. I have almost always found Mrs. Ryan as a charming and beautiful actress in almost all its roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I say it almost "almost" and "almost". this movie <br /> <br /> First and foremost, Meg Ryan does not play a nice character, after passing anger credits he does not give up giving up the nerves. a few days later. That's right, Kevin Klin's character is even more annoying and enjoyable. So, usually if you like these two actors, I recommend you to go through this movie.
