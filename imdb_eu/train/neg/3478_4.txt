Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) Christmas has decided not to be lonely. Not only Drew is the millionaire; but also because it is innocent and horrible. Drew grew up in the house and offers a family of 250,000 dollars to his family, Valco. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) is nonsense, but Drew's offer is hard enough to take. She does not have to say about Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara), but she's learning to be around Drew ... Alicia (Christina Applegate) has the same feeling as her daughter, but that can also change. Drewen Missy (Jennifer Morrison) wants to keep track of Drew and talk to friends about her friends. Real fun is wonderful Noel makes fun and nightmare nightmare. Other members that are cast: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is comical, though it's strange.
