Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes work on the basketball court. Okay, that's fine. It leaves a lot of space for good comedy and good story. But it is not an event in the dreadful minutes after this pathetic attempt of this film. This movie was redundant, delayed and ridiculous in the first twenty seconds. Woody Harrelson was my favorite. Characters, Cheys from Woody, and I expected to see the movie. But after seeing his "interpreting play", I conclude that the dumb countries should continue to play in mutually playing bands. It was as sad and bad as the movie. Another act of this unreal real is Rosie Perez. I liked the movie with Perez earlier, but I decided to have a lot of lines to talk about ("Do the Right Thing"). But White Men Can not Jump's current character was the main character in many lines; Thus, the viewer must give his voice a very annoying and whispering voice. So, after listening to this film (a little used word) and hearing much more than listening to Rosie Perez, I can say that I am a white man and I'm ready to jump. . . a twenty-floor apartment building.
