This is the kind of movie I see all my enemies all the time, but it's not bloody the truth. Sometimes I see it once, to make sure it is as bad as I think myself. <br /> <br /> Some types of monster kidnap Boeing 747. (This is at least an improvement. Boeing has kidnapped a large part of the Pentagon.) The plane descends into Bermuda's triangle and is dispersed to the bottom, a post-facto submarine. <br /> <br /> It has one of these bright stars. The stars fall or they are hardly above the horizon. <br /> <br /> "We are our own!", says Jack Lemon. Okay George Kennedy except. It's in every disaster movie. <br /> <br /> See another movie. Oh, not the original "airport". That's not good. Instead, watch a blind airliner packing like "Phoenix of the Flight".
