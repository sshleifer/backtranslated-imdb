Awesome without a doubt. I've seen some movies very well. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow use striking film, graphic, and futuristic designs to create something that is historically known to create a fresh world. It seems time to be in the 1930s or 40s. The film reports new attacks on New York, robbing them with machineries and the like, for some incomprehensible reasons. Additionally, the mysterious disappearances of important scientific minds coincide. Who can stop and save the world? Well, it's no great faith Sky Captain himself knows that his girlfriend reporter is always warmed up with his maid, and with his trusty company on the flanks. Sky Captain has no story and characterization in the atmosphere and graphics. The plot of this movie is ridiculous. In other words, he is looking for a sensation of cinematic film series. The stories were quite far away and there were bad performances; But I did not even have one of them, and I did not even have one of them, a quote and great names. The two Academy Award Winners and Jude Law could save a movie, it might be thought, but Sky Captain grows enormously. Despite being a horrible dark eye, I ended up finishing film and I can continue with my life. I had little interest in a story that generated little interest. I do not care about one of the glibrate portraits. Paltrow was terrifying. Jolie was a joke almost without substance. Law can not carry the liner's individual tradition on its narrow shoulders. I mean, no, Will Smith, Mel Gibson or Wesley Snipes. Something sad about Sky Captain was, at least, that he had so much promise. I was bored with the movie for ten minutes - I was waiting for something to match my interest and it never came.
