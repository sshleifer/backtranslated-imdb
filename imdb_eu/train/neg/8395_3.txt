- A group of films shoot a horror movie in an old house that is supposedly damned, where seven people died mysteriously over the years. One of the crew finds an old freedom book that seems to be perfect for use in some of the scenes of their film rituals. The release of the book is written better than the script that is being used better. As the book reads, the cemetery comes from abroad. Now, cast and crew are facing real danger. <br /> - The IMDb shows a 90 minute duration. In the first 60 of these minutes nothing happens. The movie is spent too much time in the movie. Do we scare our horror movie? We know that the movie is not "real." These fears do not work. <br /> <br /> - There are few things to enjoy at the Zazpi Gorpuen Etxea. The performance is atrocious. Most of these "actors" should have trouble playing at the elementary school. The score is horrible. It reminds the TV series in the 70s and does not give a twist. Talking about the environment, even if it's not just moments at the end of the movie, there's no word. The character's logic does not exist. In a movie, you expect the characters to play in a certain way. Here, I do not think a character likes to remember a scene that chooses no good way. And lastly, the first 60 minutes of the movie I have just mentioned. Do you know it is boring? <br /> <br /> - I do not see the seven corpses still smaller because of the instantly operating movie (probably accidentally). My favorite two are the beginning and the end. The opening title presents the deaths of the seven owners of the sequence and the film can be remarkable. And, because the end of the massive stage scenes are like threatening zombies (how are you opening up). In general, these moments are not enough to make a good movie.
