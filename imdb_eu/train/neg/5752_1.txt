I usually do not comment, but there are some things to say. Where to start ... <br /> <br /> Jeremy London's performance was awesome! I did not think it could be so bad. The land could be good, it was well-aimed, and it was a good result for the main actor. Unfortunately, you are one of those movies that you read and you think you have a great potential to entertain, but disappointed at the start. <br /> <br /> Well, I got at least some good laughs. I did not lose your time.
