What happened The strong and credible premise that we have here is a decent and talented duo, but somewhere it loses the movie. Actually, never got it done. There was a small illusion that Angie was really pregnant and then she knew, after all, that was it. Steve Martin, who is very talented and usually brings a lot of movies, was horrible and his entire character was not even more important than the movie. I would really like to see more interactions between major characters, Kate and Angie, and may not try a pure comedy, but unfortunately it was not, but it could be a drama with comedy elements. If this movie was made, it would be very fun, because the two actors were playing in a fun way and I could think of many insults here.
