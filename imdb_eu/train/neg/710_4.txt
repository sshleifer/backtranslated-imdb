I read the interest in the novel Rice, and I became very passionate about the characters and the accidental story based on historical truths. <br /> <br /> However, I only took it because of this disastrous adaptation. The casting was based solely on the physical appearance, and not the talented actress (except Peter Gallagher, who was not glittering or even able to leave a paper bag). The attempts to cause a Castilian accent were shameless and incoherent, but not fun. I found that I was going through mixed trips and melodramatic music, and I was amazed until I reached the end. <br /> <br /> Announcement for the novel lovers: you can stay away from this.
