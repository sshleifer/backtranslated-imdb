I could not laugh ... This movie is really fun and stupid! But no matter, it's very entertaining! In this movie, you do not have to worry about anything! The play is the same - LAME! The dinosaurs are the same - RUGS (Oh, I saw a stick with a T-Rex head for a moment). The predators are the same as Carnosaur 2, it's the same as T-Rex, but ... some scenes seem to be full of looks and some kind of failure seems like a kindergarten. It's a fast action, sometimes faster, I'm really quick to edit, I've edited so fast, so we could not see the rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! until late, they're rubber! Well, the only thing here is interesting to see Rick Dean in this sequel. <br /> <br /> What can I say ... do not rent ... watch on TV, with friends, it's much more. entertaining!
