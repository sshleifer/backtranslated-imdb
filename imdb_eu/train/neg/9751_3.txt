The movie that gives me less than 3 movies is not the only reason Manos: It's like a movie like The Hands of Fate. The biggest crime in the film is that it's a tricky and boring mind, and the British is incredibly unspeakable. The premise of this film is promising, the whole concept of telecommunication, but the direction it went with was completely interesting. The research was more about finance film and projected lasers. The actors were wood, emotional and scarce. It was the relationship between the two scientists, which was not very interesting. I never told you what the attraction was that there was no chemistry among them. I did not even understand why he decided to kill every man who had a stiff face knowing everything. At least I now know that someone would give me a direct listening before I'm going to cut off scholarships, because they do not do it, they do it, they kill me with my worried gestures.
