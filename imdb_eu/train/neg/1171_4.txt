I can not believe that this huge and sharp movie that belies thanks to other films by a filmmaker. The experience of suffering THE LADY AND THE DUKE (and a "permanent" no other word), made me annoyed, only when reading commentary on Ali-112's commentary was alleviated. In fact, Rohmer's eighteenth century He has tried to successfully view the world through the genre of the French genre of the century, but, in any case, he has revealed the effects of both consciences and the consequences of class consciousness. The revolution was inspired by the eyes of an elitist woman of her time. The director is unlikely to get something wrong, but I doubt whether he was worth the effort or the bad results of his work.
