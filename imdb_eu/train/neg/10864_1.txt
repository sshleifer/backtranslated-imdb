I wanted to try and understand the Indian cinema that I had the opportunity to survive for 2 hours of my life (35 minutes only). Everything I saw was the oldest S.Ray movies. <br /> <br /> I have found the ones that I navigated through the IMDb and after seeing a rating of 8.7 points, I concluded that they will open the unknown doors. and bring artistic enjoyment. Oh, what was wrong! The only logical explanation of 8.7 scores is that only 970 of the majority Indian people who voted, and those that were outside of Bolliwood production were Adam Sandler. IMDb on Citizen Cane, a list of the best 250 feature films above the Goodfellas of Psycho. Actually, I do not want to remember or criticize this painful experience I want to remember because there is nothing worthwhile to remember. My only hope is Hindu as I will find the movie I like - stupid, kitsx and cheesy music.
