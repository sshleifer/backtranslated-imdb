For many years I've been hiding around these tables because of the lack of intelligence that communicates through regular reviews of this film. This movie underwent film courtesy of the New York Asian Film Festival (this year we had great exquisite films, see, the June serpent, CHA NO AJI, Survival style), and every day I regretted releasing a scene of this movie behind my head and a lively remembrance it becomes <br /> <br /> I am sure that you can read a short list of the Metro Film Festival, which is probably why I made the mistake. dragging my friend to the movie. The description was a kind of horror movie that I eagerly awaited a bit, apart from fear of terror. P was, in fact, different. He uses cheap lace. <br /> <br /> An annoying announcer described this movie: "Lesbians are grouped together to fight monsters." Completely false There is a subset that appears in this movie to look like a girl and a relationship between Pookie. More lies. This film "Are the fear of the dark?" It looks like the short film. The story is ridiculous and only helped the audience get laughter and confusion, as they eventually dismissed the movie as serious as the seriousness, and tried to forget $ 9 at the door. I want to get Paul Spurrier to the audience, I almost laughed and asked me why he lost 5 years in Thailand to make a horror movie horror of the species channel. family schizophrenia and a generation-based film festival. The only inconvenience caused by this was a bottom-gurgle of the intestines, because he could not get out of it. In any case, I hope that I will remove the serious mistake that this film saw, I was actually one of my 3 worst movies to number 2.
