Are we talking about the same movie? This movie is absolutely ridiculous, the plot is very pleasing and not completely logical. A straight-line DVD / TV is a typical straight-line movie that includes all the necessary elements of a horrible movie experience: theater actors, unplanned plot, GIRL SHOTS HER T * ts (why, god), why?), People do not react to reality in real life just like I will not even confuse it with details, it would take him all night. Well, okay, the only one: when two people were killed in front of you when you were down the street, one of the victims dies almost in your arms, you throw your blood out of your head, it would be your first concern; "Oh, he left the world and saw my last face angry!" My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost career.
