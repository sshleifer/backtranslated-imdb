It is interesting to act out; It was not bad, it just is not enough. It was a bit of a hassle, it was a blame for the special effects and lines that failed. Standing alone, they were not terribly bad, but moving together was tragic. The spectacle featured long and slow winds with special effects designed to advance the movies, but failed completely. <br /> <br /> Many of the blame for this disaster was put on special effects. Do not believe it. they were nice. Appleby was not the best choice for that. Although it may be that they have been chosen among them as a fan. An experienced actor would bring something, unlike Apple. Scfi generates great original movies, it's very bad to fail so completely.
