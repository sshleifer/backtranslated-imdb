The film does not catch all the mysteries and intrigues that the book offers. The main points of the book, ideas, are hardly touching, asks the viewer why they're all about why they're doing and why they've been ready to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> The character development is not good. No background or personal development informs the audience that they really do not happen, so that action sequences blur. <br /> <br /> The search for manuscripts is abruptly terminated and has no real explanation and no satisfaction with any sense of the search. <br /> <br /> I'm one of the worst adaptations of a book I've ever seen. It's horrible and time-consuming. If you have not read the book, jump in and read the movie. If you have read the book, jump in the movie and read it again. <br /> <br /> Almost the movie book is like the book's confiscation point, which is so badly done and ridiculous. It's a shame, it was a good success, and it was probably a good screenwriter and good actors. <br /> <br /> Please, give up your time lost, READ THE BOOK !!!
