I'd like to think myself myself quite open and it's a lot needed (!) If I do not like a movie, but this is definitely one of the most demanding movies I've ever seen. <Br /> <br /> I do not know what is wrong with people who gave them a good rating here (imdb are usually quite reliable in terms of valuations) ... The only thing they can imagine is that people have to vote. in one or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. Although they are eliminated or stoned by their minds 2. They have been hard pressed in polls 3. Under artillery <br /> <br /> I can not believe in my whole life I have wasted 1 hour 45 minutes. The excuse for a movie.
