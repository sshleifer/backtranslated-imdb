I think that this movie was supposedly made with a budget of $ 70 million and I was totally uninhabited. Storyline and amateur conversation are beyond. The character tells things a real person would never say, and reacted almost never before. Nobody seems to be based in the real world. The director's performance is fine, the writing is not so good ... but the role of actors in the roles drags down production. The hair of the hero must surely have his own credit, it seemed so strange that he did not mention it, he gave one of the best performances. Finally, the giant reptiles for a movie about L.A., this film is boring. What a shame! If you see that, you will always be in the race, take the SFX scene and think about ways that could be built on them. Unfortunately, it would not take much.
