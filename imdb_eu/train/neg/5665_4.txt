This bizarre deliberate adaptation of Borges' story is Cox. His strong visual sense, as usual, has been undermined by the extraordinary half-hearted performance. The movie is undoubtedly a surrealist tradition in the Mexican era of Bunuel and will take Lars Von Trier's Crime Elementary Poor. Cox is a soloist, jumps and surrounds the sound of the film against the efficiency of the film. It's worth a look, but at last disappointing.
