Gene Hackman goes out of prison, a nongovernmental organization that kills him. It's known that Hackman is proficient in knowingly. <br /> <br /> Nobody says anything, because the viewer gives them extra information. That must be suspensful, but rather annoying and boring. <br /> <br /> Hackman continues with the mission, but the getaway is misunderstood and at the top of this mysterious entity he can tell the guy to the deceased. So all the cast die and, finally, you do not really care. <br /> <br /> One of the other reviewers stressed that the movie was originally longer, almost three hours, and split quite a bit. Maybe something was lost in translation, but I think it's compassion for the audience. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark, Candice Berg, Mickey Rooney, and Eli Wallach were a talented cast. , and Edward Albert is so badly damaged here crime. <br /> <br /> And we do not know what the federal agency does to everything, FBI, CIA, DEA or even IRS.
