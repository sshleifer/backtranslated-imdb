Fred Olen Ray is an evil director, even though B director films go, but 'Haunting Fear' is probably one of his best films. Yes, the story of Poe's "Premature Murder" is a great story, but it's very wrong and different, but it's entertaining. Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual, she wants to look for her beautiful and fragile housewife, and her husband, Jay Richardson, because she needs money from a gangster (Robert Quarry plays). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of soft-core movies in the early 90's, actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty lady. On the other hand, you can also enjoy the minor roles played as a psychic Karen Black, as one of Robert Clarke's doctor and Michael Berryman as one of the best plays. The end does not make sense!
