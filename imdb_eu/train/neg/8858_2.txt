Ben is an outsider who wants to kill his sisters brutally and wants to make his murderer justice, but Stefan came up with his sister as a victim of wolves. So Ben, the best friend of his sister, and Stefan travel to Transylvania to end the evil. <br /> <br /> This B-level thing is horrible and I asked how to release it. Original "Howling" looks like a masterpiece. What was Christopher Lee thinking about, that is, because I owe the worst performance I saw. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of real short film coming from Annie and Woodpecker. McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not forgotten Lee), cheesy fashion (these sunnies), cheap and lame special effects, bad use of lighting, humor ..., trashy music in the 80s (some of the movie's unknown band sometimes centered), to see the man's wolf has his own orgy, and a tiring story with a flat and annoying conversation. If I thought it was bad, it would be fun, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The location and settings of the movie have been very positive, but that's why ... Actually, Sybil Danning will add a short scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While the final credits group works on a strange stage in his film Crap-house songs, why do I explain this question? <br /> <br /> Tremendous mix, however, is at least not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
