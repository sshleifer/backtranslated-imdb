This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life !! It was stupid that there was no plot and the special effects were ridiculous! And I never saw my bad performance! The boys were very good about the film (especially Drew Fuller). I do not know what people thought of when they made this movie! I did not even want to finish the whole thing, because the guy arrives at this point of the film that touches his bed. I mean kiddy sick and twisted like a kind of porn! I would advise anyone who heard this movie and would like to see it, forget it and watch another movie! I was very disappointed! The whole movie took a long time to think.
