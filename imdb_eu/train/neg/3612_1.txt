The mosquito cases are about to kill college students, new teachers can crazy? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Believe me, you will not like it. Collect this movie is just art. But worse than Splatter University it is not right to have fun. Splatter is so badly done - the story is out of bounds, the characters are thrown out, and the whole movie is lacking in the essence of the imagination. Needless to say, there is no suspense, no atmosphere or no fear. This operation has not dared to unleash (to get the cheapest emotion of all). Therefore, there is nothing about entertainment around this faulty slasher (laughter, even cheap), and it just becomes a whole bore. The bottom of the Kupel people - Slasher fans will also want to think twice before they see it, and much less pay the money to pay. <br /> <br /> BOMB ****
