This is a classic stinker with a great cast, especially the elders who have had their prime and this bedtime well in the past. <br /> <br /> This is pretty pretty disappointing when you think that movie. You are left on the ground and you will face the disease and, finally, your death will appear. <br /> <br /> Gwen Verndon still danced. Very bad film film did not concentrate on that. Maureen Stapleton, rough, still appears at the steps of the Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom, when she dropped 10 years earlier. <br /> <br /> This film is not encouraging in the elderly. suicide at Jim Jones. How can anyone like this idiot and think about it? <br /> <br /> Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this nonsense? <br /> <br /> The elderly people did the wonderful thing in the end, why did you encourage the young man to get out of the boat? Why Steve Guttenberg also jumped the boat? In the end, he found his love for lovers. <br /> <br /> This would be a nice movie if the elderly found and found a young man on the ground. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, except for Wilford Brimley, this writing, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and Mr. who know who else is gone. Writers had to take on the screenplay and also put it with this group.
