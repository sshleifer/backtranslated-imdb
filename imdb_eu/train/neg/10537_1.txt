Well, what can you say about Barbara Cartland's adaptation? <br /> <br /> There are some stunning actors (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) but they are clearly making money. <br /> <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in another evolution of karting, with Anthony Hugh Grant (ashamed enough) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see Cartland's "welcome" adaptation, it's a Bonham Carter ("A Hazard of Hearts" - what a title!). Gilbert's link is weak, but Bonham Carter is pretty good and, of course, it really works, and plays the rest in the cheeks of language (Edward Fox and Diana Rigg).
