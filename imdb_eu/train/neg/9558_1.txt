I thought that it was a certain part of the game, and it wanted to be an original since 1983. But a sequel does not take it into the original plot and destroy it. <br /> <br /> I had very little hope for this movie, but I lost 95 minutes. There is no suspense. Actually, I am sensitive, bad performance, and therefore full of technical defects, so I could not believe it as a computer mum. A war movie genre and a mixture of 24 hours. But that's not a bad budget movie too. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie, that is, the whole loss of time. Instead, get the original. The subject is still valid. Do not leave a lot of power in a machine. And the play and the plot is coming out and it's more credible.
