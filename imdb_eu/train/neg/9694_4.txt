Otto Preminger directs the light story. Jean Seberg Bohemian and David Niven, the widow of the same party, in the south of France, with a holiday with Mylène Demongeot. Things are fine until the family friend Deborah Kerr appears. Nivens, a degenerate woman, finds Kerr's hard conquest. She is very well with Seberg, as long as Niven loves it and leaves it (because she has done all the past women ... including Demongeot). Becoming a second plateau in Niven's life, Seberg has taken Kerr's revenge. Preminger tells the story of flashbacks from Seberg's perspective, combining black and white white colors. Georges Périnal's filmography is amazing. Preminger's film is the least heavyweight, but the first few do it, but it's hard to know the actors really feel. Arthur Laurents wrote the script and has rigid conversations and amusing scenes (especially Democheot's birdie). Seberg takes it pretty well, but Niven is attractive ... and does not show chemistry with Seberg or Kerr. Preminger has really direct steps with this casting. It's a tailor made role for Charles Boyer. Along with Geoffrey Horne, Seberg's hope and Martita Hunt were her children. Juliette Gréco plays the title song in a Parisian nightclub. Saul Bass's regular Preminger titles are superb.
