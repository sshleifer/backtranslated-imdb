Stephen King's adaptation (King himself scriptwriter) acquires a small family, new to rural houses, who knows the pet cemetery near his home. He meets the burial ground of Micmac over the cemetery shell with powers to revive his father (Dale Midkiff). Obviously nothing is buried in the burial ground. <br /> <br /> Average "horror" picture below. It starts with the evil, the insulting and the inevitable, and this continues for a while, the worst absolute element being the bad value of Midkiffen. At the end he gets a little better at the end, really disturbing. In fact, the whole movie is really disturbing, so I can not completely discard it, at least to be memorable. Fred Gwynne, as a former neighbors, and Brad Greenquist, helping Victor Pascow with the help of disfigured spirits, are not enough to free movies. <br /> <br /> The Kingk has a typical T-shirt with the Minister. <br /> Then, it's a successor to a film directed by Mary Lambert (is not it surprising that there is no short film at all?). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
