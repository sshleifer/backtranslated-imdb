There seems to be little in the Central Olympiad Conference. He likes it, honors his honesty, his liberal point of view and his delightful performance; otherwise, he loves his obvious propaganda, medium dialogue, cardboard characters and a general tendency. I fell into the last category, and I found the movie and the performance - about war activities during the war in Washington in the European refugee camps - it was boring, especially for performing, and even temporarily. The author of Lillian Hellman does not matter to the angels. His plays were written for people who shared their point of view, and the author and the viewer had no idea of ​​their ideas, but the "other difference" is enormous. With a hundred per cent agreement I say, even as Rhine also says, I still do not understand. His characters are unrealistic, and, according to the ear of the conversation, people show their way of speaking, but they do not have a horrible horror. He really did not say anything new. Now, I agree, a few years before, until the death of Mary McCarthy's Hellman reputation. For those who think that theater is dead or extreme, I begged at that time that Rhin on the Peer, like Angels in America, was just one foot of the theater. The grave was sixty years ago.
