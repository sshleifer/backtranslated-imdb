The bottom receiver, but read or never know the misfortune waiting for the "Rodentz" rent. <br /> <br /> On the night of the moon, in a remote research laboratory, there is an important medical breakthrough. deadly results. A chemical compound for the production of cancer cells for "destruction and crash" was introduced into the basement of the building to eliminate disposal of hazardous waste. Now, the rodents involved in the laboratory experiment are not the only root of the installation that will become a species. Professor Schultz, the main bio-researcher, has decided to add a new enzyme to regenerate its "hunting and destruction" formulas that will allow time to neutralize cancer cancer tumors. When the three different degrees of the new mixture are divided into three different rats and the rest of the "Dangerous Waste" sinks, the shocking effects of the side cause the night ... directly ..... <br> /> <br /> Seriously, that is, surely, the worst movie I've ever seen this year. All this is "a little budget!" He shouts from the horrible performances, the worst thing I've ever seen. There are slogans of chiseling characters that play stupid and unforeseeable ways: they only walk through dark corridors, looking for cat, going out and falling, so that "rats" can be found with them in a small room ... <br> <br> <br> /> While some little movies are created, the movie really cuts the cake. All possible corners are cut, from reusing the foreground to increasing the shooting of "Lab" crosspieces from different angles (this reminds me - why in this two massive building TWO boys only worked in this huge building?!?!?!), For children for music and special effects that can be made in a workshop computer. <br /> <br /> That brings me the worst aspect of this steam stack - special effects. Just terribly. Rats created by computers are so fake and stand out in every scene, even the most honest movie makers are computer-created. And that giant rat garment - OH MY GOD !!!!!!!! Seriously, do you think we think it's such a huge baby that it's a monster? Just pitiful ........ Compared to the better, some gore looks pretty cool, especially considering the budget. <br /> <br /> All the actors suck. He was not involved with production, and he did not know what they were doing. I have lost enough time with the review, take advice, it's garbage. 1/10. <br /> <br /> About the DVD: the transfer is sucked, the audio is appropriate and there is a commentary from the director and its two-person album, saying they did not have anything to do with it. Doing a movie, but there were questions and comments. Three of these fundamental human sub-human beings are so stupid to be able to institutionalize themselves or others. I do not want to miss the readers' time or mine, I started to remember more about this movie ... DVD Rating: 1/10.
