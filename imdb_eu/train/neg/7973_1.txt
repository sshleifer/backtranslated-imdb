I go to a lot of movies, I often bring my 5-year-old son. I'm glad I did not take it. There are many references to sex and a dull fall scene. However, this is not why I did not have the first reason. The rector thinks he is a comedy; However, almost all fun moments are in previews. I continued to wait interesting, funny or serious; However, I was sleepy by dragging the story without a plot. I understand that it can be a great dog company. In other words, the whole story was aimed at a dog that did not play properly because the owners did not have enough training. A human caused damage and prohibited this prohibition. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson, the waste of his talent. This movie is the best way to sum up, the couple gets a sloppy dog, the pair falls in love with the dog, the dog dies, the dull couple. End
