Okay, when I joined the board in this movie, I really wanted to laugh at people. I was surprised to have liked people over 7 years old. I enjoyed the movie ... but I alone and my little sister (who is, indeed, 10) laughed completely. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Jordan, but that was scary. You know, the movie directs you to the bathroom when it can not lead. And he did not even free a good book or plot. I also thought that Pamela's character was very smooth ... the pathetic boundary line. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I thought I thought they were good actors, such as beautiful Spencer, Hollywood, for example. and Ronnie. Still, it's not enough to free the movie. <br /> <br /> I can not overcome two things about this movie: <br /> <br /> 1.) Spencer's man fell on his side. Well, eww. I have looked at dates and, in reality, it is older than four years old, the "Joan Im√°gen" difference seemed much more. Jordan is a pretty girl, but GF was feeling like 10 or 12 ... she seemed a little boy! Jake Abel (Spencer) seemed like a college student. 2.) It was what Kristi Yamaguchi would come up with when she would come up with a girl. I mean, I know Katelin is good and everything, but it still seems to be very difficult for Christ to go to a boarding school that did not have scholarships or schools could have a skating rink. . <br /> <br /> Everyone who says ... is the worst film ever known, but it was not very good in terms of DCOM standards, I think it's very small.
