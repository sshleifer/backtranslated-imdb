Despite the admirable castings of this film, especially the quality of writing by Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott was so bad that any actor or director would be unable to observe that movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Perhaps we might have "waiting" the message that would eventually be apparent, and we could gather some meaning from that endeavor. Unfortunately, that did not happen. <br /> <br /> Of course, maybe the viewers may have "meaning" in the face of this glowing tale to make sense of the foolishness of the brain's ingenuity. Writers, however, do not make sense to facilitate this original need. <br /> <br /> It was clear that the participants only had their own craft movements, and their own passion. Characters or story is secondary or not. <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that TV movies have become over the years. While communicating a message with the viewer, it may be the main interest of the writers in the past, it seems that today's writers and producers are miserable to their audience, especially trying to manipulate the "solution". The only reason, Surrender, to make movies like Dorothy.
