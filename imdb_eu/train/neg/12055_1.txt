Do not waste your money or your film in this wonderful piece of film that looks like your own time. Every third word is devoted to malignant language and there is no real plot, and there is also a cast of ancient actors that still play. Old past performances and undeveloped in their career, can be said a lot. When Benicio del Toro won the best, I expected something better. The vision that others may have of Puertorrique√±os, as unheard of as Maldeamors, will be immeasurable. At a certain time in a movie, inappropriate words can be used to emphasize a particular perspective and may be funny or sad (see Elsa and Fred for example) but it should not cross the plot. The film is totally insolent and nothing about it was funny or beautiful about this movie.
