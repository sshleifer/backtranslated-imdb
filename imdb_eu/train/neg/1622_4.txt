That's why I recall the only reason that Nigel Kneal showed what the brightest series of QUATERMASS was after the week after. The hallmark emphasized the fact that Victor Caroon, who hoped to ride through the streets of London, was waiting for Victor Caroon. <br /> <br /> It's not such lucky because THE RACING GAME is just a thriller, a hero who has a hero who is getting into the bottom of the corrupted races of horse racing. If you're a Dickport enthusiast, you can enjoy it, but by the end of the 70s THE SWEENEY ended and PROFESSIONALS still underway, something in RACING GAME is missing. If a trailer took a car in another way, if the trailer of THE SWEENEY were there, Jack Regan will see more than a car and take a slip. He would have overtaken a car and expelled the internal terrorists. I think what is wrong with the series
