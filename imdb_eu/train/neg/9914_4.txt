This movie treats children's kidnapping from a point of view of a mother (Lisa Hartman Black), a man who acts like a thriller. Unlike other film-makers, here's a continuation of her husband's mother hating her son. She receives help from her lawyer. <br /> <br /> In the end, before they meet their son, there will be some strange things. Father tries to take a child as a play to a local theater theater with children's children. She catches it and then realizes that her son is not. Only a lot of people are waiting for trial in the Inner Mental area or a few months in jail. However, after a couple of hours in this movie, the mother is released because they feel the parents of the victim. Shortly afterwards, the mother will enter her mother-in-law, and then they arrive at the police station and run her gun but they let her escape because they confess (and feel it?). <br /> <br /> At the moment of the story, they find a baby, but when the police arrive at the house, they leave the back door and enter the river, apparently only kept in the river. such as emergency escape! Mother takes her to a hose and although she takes some time (in a real world), she and lawyer boys, and the police are catching them at the other bank fairly quickly and it's just down the water for landing. He does not want to get out of Ammylus, but thinks he's drowned out of the boy and goes into the water when he sees his jacket. Of course, he can not swim and emit like a rock. He keeps the lawyer, but they are random at random. Mom was told at one point that he was killed in a Mexican clinic. He goes forward and goes wherever he stays, nobody knows! Somehow, this movie exploits the kidnapping of children and is not very positive. On the other hand, seeing a woman is a fun (or funny) woman who likes crazy men in these types of films.
