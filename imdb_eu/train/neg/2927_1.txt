Somewhere, outdoors, every movie must have a gay gay gay movie list. Large shots of stars' camera that are sitting in space and unthinkable, or where they go to one of the long kittens that eats spaghetti. The image of the disease of the movement is the story of a boy and a boy, who live and love and swim and are stuck in caves, one of whom has a mother born and another does not have a mother and they talk and swim and swim and get drunk and Then it breaks and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then goes out and goes back and forth quickly and much longer without looking at space or sitting and doing anything. I think that filming is a great technique, or maybe it's a movie that is so bad that it has to be full of movies and vouchers, otherwise it will be about 14 minutes based on the plot or the story. Do not go wrong, it's about thirty-six months of gay film that I've seen, and some of them (most) have been very formulative, predictable, and boring, but this is really a waste. So far, "Beautiful Thing" was the best, so I saw this and I opened it after the first opening, "O, no, it will be sinny creator" but I thought. and when I finished watching it I threw the DVD into the trash. I'm sorry I did not like it, and I appreciate it if I did it.
