I do not know who the idea was that the orcas kill people and take vengeance and destruction, but my god is absurd. Certainly, the orcs are not the cold killers that make this movie ... stupid. Orcas are very intelligent, I'm not misunderstood, but I'm sure they know and I understand a concept such as revenge. So I mean everything I got from this movie, it was absurd to be entertainment. So at least I had fun with that. Personally, I'd recommend watching Jaws, if you want to watch a Kind of Animal-Killing-Humans movie. But if you are like me and want something to laugh at realism, I could say so. : D
