Even though the first Mulva was better than "Mulva" (which is not at all what I would say, I'd prefer a dry paint) it still sucks. Get yourself one step away and avoid the kids from the Low Budget Tray. I bought some DVD dancers for some Indy filmmakers and guys. Some people have not officially "released" (they are not bought by their filmmakers) and I can not list them all. Avoid Teen Ape or Bonejack as they appear in other indy little movies that they're in for. If you are friends of these guys, do you think you were in the movies and have fun? But what should they see? In no case. Bad video, bad audio, bad performance, bad plot ... and so on. These are also not fun. I gave this only 2 to Debbie Rochon and that's why. It may not prove that a star worthy of 2. to prove a little better than the first one (that is to say, it could be negatively evaluated). If you do not want a decent budget movie, go to LBP "friends" like "Freak Productions", something like "Marty Jenkins" or even more. These are really decent.
