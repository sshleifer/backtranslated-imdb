CHRONIC ZOMBIES <br /> <br /> Weekly ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> While you are looking (literal) The Ghost Town is in the middle of nothing, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) perceives a grizzled hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells his stories. Loss of time ABSOLUTA, from the beginning Haggerty's high emotional performance is essential. Even worse, the two stories that comprise the most part of the running of the bulls are completely routine, because Brad Sykes does not have a bad performance and, in the first place, is responsible for the theater of Camp BLOOD (1999). This is not a "funny" film by Ed Wood's "fun" (at least, what he did and despite his talents in his efforts); Sykes' home movies are really outrageous, boring, and virtually valuable, and most of the audiences feel angry and deceive themselves as unthinkable evil. The 3-D format is completely lost here.
