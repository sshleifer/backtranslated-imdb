The disappointing movie <br /> <br /> The story is our protagonist, Chrissy, "young", but rather a great man who scrolls down, does not do much. Actually, it is very little to change the narrative, so it did not surprise me when paying attention to my family. It's a pity, though, Chrissy looks like an interesting character. <br /> <br /> The story was predictable and sometimes quite formulated. So the question is: when will we see the basics of Campions, Jacksons and Tamahori, stories that tell them compelling and story-telling, instead of entertaining a two-hour toll? <br /> <br /> Technically, a disgusting movie.
