Although it does not include extras, it is not true. They took many liberties to restore incidents, using groups that do not meet people outside and their lives. In the gang Bonnie, Clyde and W.D. They were more than just in number, and people were very much in touch with those events. Buck and Blanche Clyde were persuaded to go straight ahead of the shooter and, in fact, they went back to the crime. Some day-by-day events happened at night. Bonner's wound was more serious and he had never healed. It was so bad that someone had to take him to heal until he was healed, and he was hard on his feet. Clyde was still lying in wait, while cutting a big toe in his pocket. I know it, I like it and it's been a TV movie, but even without the factual story of the "TRUE", the movie moves faster than the event and event and finds more than a few of his life's photos. Instead of being a cohesive story, I would recommend <br /> <br /> reading a book or watching a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.
