Why did so many people meet Roberto Moreira's "Up Against Them All" on the night of "Contra Todos" at the San Francisco Film Festival? "It is an intention," said my friends. "Well ... and it's Brazil," I added. Beautiful multicolored people, tropical weather, rhythmic pain and a hip-gangster plot? Without a doubt, great listening. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to mention a little bit: this film is very bad, it's really awful, and it's very bad to see it unpleasant. <br /> <br /> So, how was "Contra Todos" created in Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, smaller local festivals and today's rituals in San Francisco? It seems that promotional process and film festivals for the operation of the circuit. First, he won the first prize at the Rio de Janeiro Festival, the best Brazilian film of the year. He had to be a bad year; They have been much better. Then, in the catalogs, fast synopses and imaginary rumors have caused the audience to be crowded and - because the movie is not anywhere and it avoids sharp criticism - the rounds continue. <br /> <br /> The festival is aimed at blurbs. Promotion is sometimes similar. A Chicago Festival called "Festival Contra Todos" filmed directly in the Brazilian camp "and" Claudi's boyfriend referred to as "neighborhood-like neighborhood." Soninha "Teodoro's nymph, the teenage daughter of sexuality that grew up." The film "is often engraved with the need for a hand-made camera," and the director focuses on "the real and palpable frustration of domestic despair and decay". The effect is "passionately crunchy and honest", and the film concludes as a "consequence of life as a result of a painless conclusion". It's not the best writing, but it surely blurs the viewer's potential. <br /> <br /> "Contra Todos" hit a hit with a man, really hit two men and his wife and daughter and was born a Christian. It has been shot - a digital video that is not talented behind the camera, especially ugly, in a seemingly poor neighborhood, "favelas" or in a popular Brazilian urban shack where wonderful movies "Orfeo Beltza", "Pixote" and "God of the City "They were made, and not this time in Rio, but Sao Paulo. <br /> <br /> Men with problems with family are Teodoro (Giulio Lopez) and their family problems. A drug problem is partner Waldomiro (Ailtan Graça). Both actors have a little TV show, Clonudia (Leona Cavalli) and her daughter, Silvia Lorenço Soninha, and the wife of Theodore's daughter, who plays with the toy. These actors would go through the backs of some soap operas. Who knows? - In a directed movie, it might be good. Apart from some of them, there are some young men clutching by Teordoro, or, when busy, band thugs. Principles do not create much presence, even though the camera increases pores. <br /> <br /> Some observers, one at the Berlin Film Festival and another in London, watched the movie gaps but that! Web buried in the interior. Henry Sheehan stated that Berlin "films" (its quotes) was "the worst video work". "It seems the filmmaker chose the video because he is a cheap alternative to the movies," wrote Sheehan, "and does not create the creative use of the new medium" - and, he added, creating something else. </ B> <br /> Sheehan emphasized the first great mistake of the movie: "It begins like a home drama that is like a domestic drama, then an hour later, Moreira reveals that his father and his friend are a professional success. Waiting for thirty minutes adds nothing to the movie, it seems that it is arbitrary, and at least it's time to lose it. But the zipper is a bigger thing that Everyira never does, they get a tool kit. Birthdays and rhymes, motives or abilities Without it. "Destructive, but true. <br /> <br /> Writing about the 2004 Kamera.com Festival in London, Metin Alsanjak wanted to analyze the positive side, but even though he was performing his performances "when they were simple in the movie, the best feature." Yes, very easy , everything else is so bad. Alsanjak admitted: "Unsuccessful, violent and bad lawsuits in Sao Paulo have acknowledged that there is no liking and hopeless nature, it is very dark and cynical to be a significant account of human condition." It's not a bad subtitle ... "Alsanjak's Contra Todos is connecting with" Dogme "and Mike Leigh does not care. <br /> <br /> The first half-hour is nonsensical, we do not do anything. When the first acts of violence are bored by our wait, they "just do without the rhyming, without reason, or without skill" - Moreira is clumsy when he wants to free himself from his latest quarrel, following the end of an ironic exaggeration scene, the characters are married Without a doubt, the director wanted to show the "evil" of men in the classrooms of the working class, but he can not see that the characters that he sees in general will survive. And the film's structure also shows that he can not edit his material. /> <br /> (was seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 28, 2005).
