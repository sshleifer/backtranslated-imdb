I've seen it recently, and the basics of the story I had to say touched me. However, the movie "Holly" did not work quite well. I expected to see the documentaries produced by the producers who organized the project, but I believe that this movie would be much more workable than that. <br /> <br /> The international cast B- was made up. class actors, but their performance was appropriate, and I had to give a special mention to the young actress Holly. This was his first movie role and he did a very nice job, due to his most responsible part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was good enough, but Patrick was very smart to keep Holly "Holly", but Chris Penn was very successful. Unfortunately, despite the favorable opinion of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, these two actors were unforgettable and they did not do their best in this film. <br /> <br /> I think the message and intention of the film, but I have to be fair, so I value "Holly" 3 stars based on the lack of the movie. However, I think that this issue should be taken into account, and I am happy that the people behind this film have made a documentary and I expect to debut in the BBC and other television networks.
