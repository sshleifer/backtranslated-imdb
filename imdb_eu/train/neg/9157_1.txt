The movie is part of your first idea that they shot the video, not in the movie. The story is confusing and production is wonderful. Note, for example, when the title pair comes out on Vermont landing plane, where they have gone to a civil partnership event to celebrate their relationship, the aircraft will be displayed in an airport with palm trees. Their event - Vermont - is made in the tropical garden, including palm trees; In New England the climate will not last for five minutes. After another trip to the plane, the set-off is taking off a FedEx merchant aircraft. They were not supposed to pay for the trip alone. As for the plot, this movie believes that Victor, the divine Christian brother Arturo, who came out of his church, will learn that his congregation is gay. Not only this, but the shepherd eventually knocked Victor with Ben and Arthur had killed "the soul of sins". Apparently, in this church nobody has ever heard ten orders. It was not as if Jamie Brett Gabel, whether it was as effective as Arthur, this movie would not be of any quality affection.
