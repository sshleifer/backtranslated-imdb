He watched me watching this movie constantly; why do they make a problem from some broken brakes? There are millions of cars to reduce your car! Speed ​​movie writers thought at least a good reason not to think of the car ... <br /> <br /> There's no good thing about this movie; all the usual narrative clicks have appeared, the actors are very bad, the story is like a sieve, etc. This movie loses time and money. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
