Jack Frost, no children, is not a hot family movie about a father who is dead. It's about a sadistic murderer named Jack Frost, who spills liquid acids and makes a killer snow. I caught a copy of this movie, so I could sit down and enjoy myself. Is it a murky snow? Ha, it's like a perfect comedy / horror movie! I was wrong, very wrong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It's a snowy night, and the new government bundle with DNA bumps. Jack runs away to kill it by acid and until it becomes a snowman. He returns to Snowmonton, a little sheriff of time. Here he is ready to die again, just like snow with cooler powers. It can condense water, ice cycles can shoot like a spear and grow a killer fang. The only question is who can stop Frost? This movie is under the typical B-Movie. The films begin to cheer, but when Jack burns acid, it goes down below the cheesecloth and goes flat. A concert is awesome! Here, we have a full performance of non-acting actors, they can act, but they do not make sense, or here it's just about. The only good actor is Scott MacDonald, Jackena. Richard Kiel is linked to the young Frankenstein. Unfortunately, his appearance is only reduced to three minutes and everything we have ever seen is the new form of the snow man and his crisp voice. Also, his wise people have fun. Groaning, stupid, and bad. <br /> <br /> The plot is horrible! Throughout history there have been several killers. A murderer in a hockey mask, a generous wizard, a wizard-type motorbike, San Bernard fast, but now we will fall down with the snowman? Come on! And the way to enter the characters is horrible. I would like to kill the sheriff's son, Jack, I mean, did I mean that his father owes ice cream by not freezing them? All characters are dumb and meaningless and deaths are cartoons. Christmas lights broke into a box with a styled woman and a head, and a girl is dying (where is the carrot that is so dirty?). <br /> <br /> And this horrible movie above is a special effect. The first special effect he has received is Jack's softening of snow and his boyfriend. I mean 60's fashion design, PU! Jack is also a false appearance. It seems like a person covered with a male skin. Every blood and gore is cheesy and the movie never comes out, but goes down to the lower levels. <br /> <br /> Never made the worst movie ever made by Jack Frost. I thought it would be a rebellion, but not! It's not trying to be fun and it's trying to be really scary. Jack Frost scored 10 out of 4, made me laugh at least. Do not worry about the trash. Jack Frost = D +
