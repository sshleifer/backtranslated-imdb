Seriously - Avoid this movie at any cost. I had never seen the first time I ever saw, and I did not pay the money to go back, but only 15 minutes after filming. What is already 2 people discuss whether or not to let my friends go. The first time I got EVER films. Some have experienced the worst. <br /> <br /> This is a duplicate film (and so bad), although it will appear in the original language. The oldest, easiest and cheapest jokes on the book. About the military ("What do we do when we get to the battlefield?" - "You get the car out and you're dying," it's really fun to read here as it was in the movie), about drugs (the guy drinks some "space cookie", it really fiddles and he loses his or her marriage, or has to live so much, very badly written and dramatic), about the women of the army ("Why do we just get trumpets, pistols!" - "That's the way it will be") ... Argh. Okay, it's really fun to find you, but in that case you're scared me. <br /> <br /> I also play better in European night-time TV programs in Europe. So jokes were lame (wrongly delivered), beyond average interpretation, lack of pace, poorly duplicated and edited? It just does not work. At least, at any level used as a movie frame. <br /> <br /> I would be very brave if this film proves that people can be so much fun. And if you want to say something stereotypes. (However, it's nice to play with them. However, if someone does not think the computer is enough.) <br /> <br /> Instead of viewing this movie, do something useful. Try to teach crocheting with the prawns, coloring your pen shoes really irritating color, disassemble your bike, change some bulbs, try to understand Einstein's theories, return to another religion and back - let's go and listen to "Last Christmas" Wham! endless repetition Anything, but do not watch this film horrible.
