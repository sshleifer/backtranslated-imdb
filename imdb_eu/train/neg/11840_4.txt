Everything that's interesting in this material sinks for a few seconds, we can not know the facts that we'll answer, and "This is usually the rumor", most often the most sensational "Hollywood" mysteries. <br /> <br /> < > Well, so we do not get anything new (and E! -In "Mystery and Scandal" this gives you the basics of the most special incident ... and that's not a big assertion.) What do we get? <br /> <br /> It's a nest of nest and decadent Hollywood viper, there's not much news, and we'll learn more about what the director's cleanse is about to recover the power position in the entertainment industry or political establishment. Peter Bogdanovich speaks of his own experience through these characters. The storyline is cynical and ugly and confusing. We feel guilty as a witness to the hooey storyline. <br /> <br /> The movie tone is of some quality xia du. It's harder than fun. We are not with any empathy. And the "Citizen Kane" highlights the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a much more convincing manner. Within "The Cat's Meow", we're never sure to be with Davies at Hearst. As soon as one thing is told, the other one is doing it. <br /> <br /> And do we believe that Davies was the love of the chapel's life? Or one of America's most powerful and seemingly rattling citizens is trying to make cockolds. The movie never makes it clear. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are credible. There is a great entertainment for the boat and the costumes of the time. I began to study the construction of the lapels of men's jackets, according to a story released by many of Hollywood's most popular characters. No one will remember that the script is a mere fiction. The disapproval of the film is made more rigorous and not satisfied. <br /> <br /> Interpreters can not fail, Meg Tilly goes ahead of the parody. Kirsten Dunst never deviates. The marvelous chewing landscape in a sea gives the most sincere reality. Joanna Lumley only rises above the material, but it is so much that she is moving away from the business, rather than telling her more. One of its first lines is "I'm not here!" And I'm sure he did not want to. <br /> <br /> This is not a sad, so bad, good Bogdanovich "Last Love Last". It is trying to do something serious, but it is questioning, and it falls chiefly because it affects the "beast" of Hollywood. "National Enquirer" is a movie theater. And it is not only the names of those who put Filida in the film on this weekend, but it also gets them quite dirty.
