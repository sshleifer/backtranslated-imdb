Dietrich Bonhoff's essay has been a great influence on my life in the Christian world, and I was hoping to see this movie and learn more about his life. Words just to say my dismay. This movie was not unified ... did not tell about his life, or about the historical context, and he did not give anything about his great writings (unless the film initially made a friend's short "Show cost" short). Instead, we enjoy jazz ( apparently in the State) and cools with his friends before returning to Germany. Apparently, to show his human side. Ok, I'm ready for a dramatic part. The part that defends his faith. Instead of emphasizing that, he was very wrong with a 17-year escort. Whether it really happened or not, it should not be a big part of the movie. Now ... still waiting for the narrative that is still a dramatic part or of what his writings are ... or something to know about the magnitude of this man. drum ... waiting ... waiting ... ZIP. Nothing This is the type of movie that gives the bad name "Christian Films". Everything they needed to do was to set up a structure that would continue with the movie, with some backgrounds ... as well as in some voicemails, or the flashbacks that he preached among his works ... who was and where he had been. . But no ... we got that. Almost a hero of the believers.
