Wow I do not think I have ever watched a movie that is so active in a movie that I have ever seen. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the only small actress in a movie that starring Edison's role in a feature-starring role. <br /> <br /> <br /> His performance was painful to observe. The story was good and all other characters played a great deal by professional actors, although it was good for LL Cool J, because they had small parts to cut their teeth. How do Timberlake decided to play the role of director and film company, there is no way of understanding. <br /> <br /> His character destroys all the experience, every time you run the police on the screen. to feel his butt, and be a hero ... I have not lost money in theater or video. FOR USE OF HBO AND OTHERS AT 2 HOURS. If you need to drink 2:00 at Saturday 2:00 a.m., you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> Watching Timberlake was like watching this human being "Kermit". Frog works in a Hollywood blockbuster, it just does not work.
