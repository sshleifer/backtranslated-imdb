Mona, a vagrant, lives in the borders of French society in a life without meaning, purpose or direction. <br /> <br /> I saw this from all star reviews, but I'm afraid they've lost something. Mona has little or no personality but, thanks to the rhythm of life, people are sensible and not added to anyone's life. It's not interesting or exciting. It's useless. <br /> <br /> I see some of these people and I know them: those who are doing can not be secret. They are just lies. I would not want Mona to be close to me, because she tends to steal everything she does not break a nail and let her friends get bored. He is surely enigmatic, because he has nothing. The junkies, winos and bum I've seen are very enigmatic; I would not like to see the movie around them. <br /> <br /> It may have missed something. Otherwise, I assume all the opinions of the French director of French art.
