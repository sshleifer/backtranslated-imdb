I can not believe in 34 previous comments, no one mentioned that this movie is the last born. A man has hired him to bring him a blond who falls into the demands of a gangster. They always fall in love and happy with contracted guns and hairstyles. It's a gangster. But Born Yesterday was a smart treatment, which is so much fluff. It is transferable to the Technicolor DVD. Natalie Kalmus escaped her grave. Check paperboya Confess? But it's historically interesting to see roots of Rock 'n Roll. It is interesting to introduce a new format at the European stage in Ewell.
