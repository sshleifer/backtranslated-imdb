With Bigfoot, there have been many films, most of which are not good, but they have at least some extravagant charms. Sasquatch Hunters does not do that. <br /> <br /> Sasquatch Hunters is a paleontologist that is part of a remote part of a paleontologist, primatologist, and hermitages. In this region, the bones of a great primacy have been found in this region and are not natural North America, it begins to reach a scientific expedition. Surely, they will soon find the ruins of such huge giant creatures. I think we all know what happens to the people who perceive it in ancient funerals. <br /> <br /> In the first half of the film, there are interesting and interchangeable characters, assembling their gear, walking in the woods, and resting. , to walk further in the woods, trying to pause, investigate, and debate on some paths, even when traveling through the woods, looking for a missing member, in the woods, dangling through dirt. Theory to do and debate around a camp to discuss little about that day. When Sasquatch finally appears, people are gazing around in the darkness that people are gathering at once (one gesture and lost fashion and the camera shades). All this is very boring. <br /> <br /> The film is to be taken seriously and the director tries to try to build a suspense, but there is no discovery. That's why we have dull and drawn scenes. People walking around the woods and trying to walk through the woods dreadfully overnight. I would lie I say I do not use the advancement button freely to speed up these scenes. <br /> <br /> Sasquatch himself, like all the other characters in the film, does not do much and has a different personality. It's like a shaggy version of King Kong, which is not so bad except for CGI, instead of a man in Bigfoot costume, which is clearly evident in the monster scenes of the day. My part can not be helped, but I feel that using computer effects is a sacrilege to bring Bigfoot to life. I think that if there is a single monster movie that would bring life only, Bigfoot is. <br /> <br /> This is not so much because one of these films is premised. . That's actually the people who participated in it extended their feature-length feature to make a feature-length movie without trying to add all the ingredients.
