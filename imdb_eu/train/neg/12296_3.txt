A really bad movie, with very good moments or qualities. <br /> <br /> Linda Blair begins with a pregnant woman, with monsters or holes running towards some corridors. not sure She jumps across a window and wakes up and sees that she is very pregnant. The pregnant level is very high throughout the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I thought the boy was an annoying boy and perhaps a retarded boy to travel to an abandoned hotel on the island. Italian horror directors find the hottest boys to be the toughest! On the island, there are already David Hasselhoff and his German German virgin (they claim that the Germans love Hasselhoff). He takes pictures and thinks he translates the German esoteric book about witches. <br /> <br /> <br /> It is also a pair of traveling to the island and a real estate agent and I thought I was a woman. She was her daughter. Certainly, it was an architect, and Linda Blair and the boy are the oldest children. I think they traveled with all the islands, but Linda and the boys seemed to be different from each other (perhaps they might have shot them). <br /> <br /> The appearance of the hotel seems to be a good appearance, but it does not use much effect. A bad makeup and a black woman will show up to an old boy, and sometimes he sings something in German. Finally, it records on Sesame Street recorder. <br /> <br /> People die, dream, or hell or something sucked. There are some of these Gore scenes, but it's not enough to recommend the movie. Although I saw that the copy is not on the cover of the box, it seems that the death of a character that explodes has been cut. The scene is showing a lot more the reaction plans of another character, because we do not see ourselves. The most amazing scene is a man or devil, who seems to be a really wound in his mouth, someone rapes. It was particularly rude. Linda Blair's scene is calm and painful. If I'd like to throw a horror movie, I'd like to make some of its original role and leave it behind the Exorcist (except horror agreements). <br /> <br /> Jewelry, largely an Italian, is a tradition that is a continuation of something unrelated, this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. This is supposedly the home of 3 episodes - Ghosthouse, La (1988) - is not (that's it (that's not it) a better movie than this one). La Casa 1 and 2 The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987), unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 (and much better than them). La Casa 5, La (1990), AKA House 5, La Casa serie falsa and House: House (1986), House II: The Second Story (1987), who wants to be the sequel to The Horror Show. (1989) AKA House III, and House IV (1992). How horror is Showa? It's not really saying that it's a sequel, so it's necessary to number the same series of actual series, less confusion (or more) to affect it. Oddly enough, The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House, and La Casa 5 AKA Horror House 2. Do you hurt yourself?
