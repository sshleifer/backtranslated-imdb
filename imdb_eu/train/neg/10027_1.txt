The action of this film defeats Sunny Bhai Gadar. Akshay Kumar Leonidus had 300 superpowers along with Neo Matrix Spiderman and Superman. It's horny Unlike typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comics, I can not see anything positive in the movie. According to the story, he writes that the writer wrote his 10-year-old son. Films are so real that the director is the smallest mistake that Anil Kapoors can shoot with a shotgun. Tashan's director is not in Tashan except for this film. Unfortunately I lost my money in this movie and I would not recommend it to anyone. It is the minimum number that I can give on the 10/10 IMDb and zero.
