This movie reminds me of watching Josh Kornbluthen's "action" with my classmate's television production class. There was no 'fun' to prove that he was not really authentic! Consider when I try to write this comedy. The jokes are secondary and they are telegraphed. Delivery is painful. Ouch !!!!!!! The writing is just dorkish. Bob Saget is similar to the show. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is very painful for an hour and a half. Saturday night afternoon Live Skit (Belushi). <br /> <br /> I hate this movie and I want to get my money back !!!
