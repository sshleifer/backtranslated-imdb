This movie is due to 1 value, not zero selection options. With a drawing of thrills with Thunderbirds, special episodes with special effects and actors, Thunderbirds, it is surprising that Widmark did not kill the director by placing this black mark on his curriculum. According to the 1950 standards, special effects are atrocious, except for a couple underwater submarine seams. If possible, I can not assume that it has been selected for the best special effects, with 20,000 caves under the sea, and for them!, No one is doing anything. Certainly this Disney competition would not have been the only competition in that year. I would not recommend the movie, as well as underwater movie makers, because the underwater realistic seabed could be seen dribbling over the rising periscope of the sea. The sub-films that you can enjoy at this time, much better, like 20,000 Leagues or Torpedo Run.
