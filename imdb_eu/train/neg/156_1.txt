Zu Warriors, definitely, should be an animated series, because the movie is like old acid, it's like watching an old anime. The movie starts from nowhere and people just flee with metal wings and other stupid ones. her lover in a cloud or something. This princess is a god or an angel for me, but soon this senseless bad breath will come in and she dies while a man with a razor wings battles mystical God / Demon / Wizard. The ground line is not there or it is very hard to continue, you have to be smart to get that film. The Earth soon finds out that this god is going to fight bad guys with a bad princess and dying soon. Uwe Boll's choreography is very bad in a mountain or a terrible battle-like scene like a fight-fight scene. Although we can say that weird images are stunning and colorful, but I'm going to say they are vague and like acid travel (yes, it's a word!). I saw it through duplicate and subtitles and they were both very bad and hard to understand ... I'm joking and I did not understand. In the 1980s, I watched 30 episodes of anime and started to tell the story, or I asked him to read the fourth comic series, where from where he started from where he was going to go ... Over the whole time. I can really say that Inu-Yasha 134 was one of the worst experiences in the film he never saw drunk. You do not know exactly what a hell happens. trying to figure that brain.
