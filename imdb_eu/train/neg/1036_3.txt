Ho-annoying. The deadly biological weapon of the inventor (Horst Buchholz) is in danger of falling into the wrong hands. Undoubtedly, he is working with his son (Luke Perry). The CIA agent Olivia d'Abo enters and cat and mouse start with the claws and pulls of the cars. They are also in a cast: Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and aging Roger Moore. Moor seems confusing to move this mistake, definitely not one of his greatest efforts. Perry fans will accept it. Abo is bad for rola, but it's nice to look.
