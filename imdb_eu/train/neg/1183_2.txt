And Immoral Tales, both of them left me bad taste. Borowczyk seems to be tired of sex, and these two films are a warning story about what will happen to a sexual nature. As a movie, it's not very well done - one of the performances is epic really bad (for example, an "American woman" with a French accent). As the young woman suddenly thought of the flip flops on the interest of marriage (as could be the case), and the sudden existence of the young aunt would not make sense. It's not clear at all. Also, I do not like how her daughter's relationship with a black man presented her family's perversity or predictability as a sign of bestiality. This "sexy beast" in the woods, the idea of ​​the main idea that lives in the woods, could be the basis of a nasty but entertaining story, but instead it is used as a basis for a wrong sex. negative, morality game.
