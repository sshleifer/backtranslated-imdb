Cast I've recently watched this movie about TCM, so I'm looking for a curious jewelry, I see many films from the 30s. This is not a weird one, nor a semi-prized one. Anachronistic clothing and the Rolls Royce Limo of 1930 hit you directly. The casting is strange too. But, above all, there are too many unnecessary devices on the plot and devices. This film promises good ingredients and basic plots, but the ingredients are not mixed according to the right recipe. Simply it does not meet correctly. And it's shameful. Despite the slight but minor visual changes, this movie could be very good. <br /> <br /> The movie is about an American showgirl who is looking for a wealthy American rich, better from the nobility. She meets Franchot Tone and her friends in Rolls Royce's friend's employer's rapt. Harlow is supposedly the owner of Tone Rolls, and he sets his eyes on him. The first part of the film is a light comedy without real distinction. <br /> <br /> However, Ton tells us, in some way, that his employer is truly the fifth German columnist on the WWI eve, and that's when the movie tone changes completely and when it falls. Tone and Harlow are married, but as he begins his honeymoon, a type of Mata Hari (Benita Hume) has died, and Harlow escapes the scene, an audience denounces the murder of Tone. (In fact, Tone is recovered from wounds.) <br /> <br /> Harlow fled to France. He falls in love again, this time with a wealthy French (Cary Grant). The tone, now in the army and Harlow, unexpectedly bring them to the Grant hospital room, after an airplane crash. In the next scene, Toni Harlow blames him to leave because he is essentially a gold receiver. Harlow does not witness witnessing 'murder and his panic!' This is one of the revolutionary peaks in the storytelling. <br /> <br /> Then Tone also gets in touch with the woman (Hume). Granted, his friend, Grant, tries to test the new airplane that Toni has given to England. Hugely, Hume and Tone both know each other well, but they just can not get anywhere! Well, so Tone shot and almost died; Maybe his memory is a bit out of it. But how many men did Hume forget about his brand? (It seems that the memory does not expire.) <br /> <br /> This is incomprehensible and not necessary. Hume had to admit it absolutely, but it was shocked that Tone did not put it. The treatment of this problem would be much better. <br /> <br /> Finally, he is very happy. The film tells Tone and Harlow how to do it to save the good reputation of Grant, as a hero that will bring about his infamous burials. Then Harlow and Tone walk away. It's honest to defend the perception of the French national hero warfare, but it is not very fulfilled as a love story! <br /> <br /> It's what the movie is asking for: Harlow will explain that his face has escaped accusations of murder on his face; The tone forgives him and rescues his love for himself; He then holds a flashlight for himself, and helps the crash site to protect Grant's reputation. Meanwhile, Harlow eventually conceded Grant to cad. Then Tone saw that he was a brave and noble man, Harlow himself resurrected for himself. At the end of the film, both unite together and work together to prepare Grant's death. After the burial of the hero of Grant, we see her kissing and kissing as she blurs. That would make a nice little movie. For Cary Grant's lovers, it would be better if the Frenchman Tone died and Grant's long-lasting husband, if he had been associated with Harlow. <br /> <br /> It's unbelievable that Franchot Tone was thrown out. Irishman living in England, while Cary Grant was cast as French. This movie would be much better if the roles were reversed. This could also be a direct film ...
