I'm a fan of the Nightmare series, but this is horrible. Deaths are so fashionable. You should see 20 years later that the whole nintendo scene is outdated. I liked flashbacks. However, I think that when I was still alive I should make a prequel. That would be more interesting. This is a movie you can take or leave. How long depends on leisure time.
