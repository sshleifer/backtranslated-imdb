OK, this layout would be the back of the F-movie (under B-movie standards) and that's why I thought: "The man could use a good laugh, so let's see some fellows die." Well, wherever I've got in the "toy of love" store could be found. Random lesbian scenes, very little fighting, no plots. <br /> <br /> For example, I remember a scene in general (only for its stupidity, I'd better watch porn at ABC). The characters (I can not remember their unknown names ... the beautiful movie, right?) Above all they drive, and the driver was tired and stopped: <br /> <br /> the driver: "Let's go, I'm tired Do you want to take it? "Travelers:" Surely, I drive for a little while ". (After throwing it off, the driver begins to take the ends of the passengers) Passenger: "What are you doing? I'm not like that!" Driver: "Okay, everybody does it sometime". Passenger: "it's ok". (Continue to take off the shirts, fondle, kiss and complete fellatio) <br /> <br /> Now, the last time I saw them, horror movies were not part of the Hollywood video section (unless you enter S & M, then you should not) go elsewhere, and it should definitely be in the major Blockbuster videos. Do not get bad; I do not doubt the people who hate pornography, but I can see it when it's right and I definitely do not want to watch movie movies when I'm looking for a movie, just as I rented one of the two merchants (and surely the other one I went on and when I looked). <br /> <br /> The worst film ever has to be rented, and it should only be purchased for the public ceremony for smoking. If I can give it to 0, I would like it, but I'll give it only 10.
