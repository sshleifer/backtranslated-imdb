The line is more fun in England, where Vixen! Outside of the original America, the word "fanny" has a very new meaning. Unfortunately, this terrific comedy is not the only laugh you're ever having in this great comedy <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It's a nymphoma. He is the descendant of his brother, but refuses to deny his black friend with comments on watermelons. He asks for revenge as he goes to Shetland's horse. It also refers to "monkeys".
