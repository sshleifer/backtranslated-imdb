I have never seen one of the worst films, but the shelter is much worse. This movie is more fun and ridiculous than scary. I laughed the most time when I saw it. Low quality effects (you'll understand what I'm talking about and how low it is), bad actors (for the first time), and it seems that an amateur shot it. camera (so it seems like a TV program, rather than a movie). But, at least, I was patient to see it until it's over. Do you like comedy? Check it out. Want to panic? Go to see Ju-On: The Grudge or another horror movie. <br /> <br /> If I talk about Diablo's story, I do not know how to classify a horror genre. They are just a few budgets. <br /> <br /> I value 3 out of 3
