This film focuses on a family of Genoa, moving to Italy, about the death of her mother / wife. axis. The film only includes scenes from everyday life in the family, such as swimming, piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of these scenes are redundant and laborious so they can not emotionally engage the viewer. The endless one is very disappointing, because it is not impressive, emotional or emotional. I can say that "Genova" is disappointed and bored. The only good thing about the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genova. "Genova" may be an extended tourist ad in the city, but it's not a movie to be enjoyed.
