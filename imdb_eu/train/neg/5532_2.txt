The riot of Zombies has never been the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is far from the list. When an expedition is sent to the Cambodia to find the trick to make zombies after World War II, a member decides to use his evil knowledge. And at least initially attained. Triangles of love complicates some stories. <br /> <br /> This was really a boring film, it was a great performance, and who was zombie and who did not know. There was little dialogue and the plot was incredible (it's not the part of its area, but parts that are related to "love". And although I'm not a skilled or experienced cinematographer, the camera's work does not seem to help much in the movie. <br /> <br /> Although I've seen some wrong movies, it's hard to enjoy it. Anyone is bad and it's NOT a bad-that-is-good-for-nothing.
