Spoilers <br /> <br /> First of all, nothing happened in this movie, inexplicably bleeding other than a woman. Second, it was not terrifying. Thirdly, the worst soundtrack of any movie ever. Let me practice Did the sound edit Beavis or Butthead? I do not know how to go with Beavis. The movie becomes increasingly silent and people cheat and murmur, forcing the volume back (I saw it at home). Then, Beavis has some loud sounds that have awesome and awesome images that will help you to lower the volume again. This is often the case until the movie is finished. Beavis seems to laugh at the heart mirror, until the test team arrives from afar. If you have children and you prefer to watch horror movies, this is a great mistake. However, it's a bit wrong anyway. Here's a thought? If you want to make a horror movie, at least a pretty girl of 19 years old, cry out on the upper part of the lungs, who can take someone's wall shade. who was still alive from the camera's camera, is throwing a camera to scare the camera to the audience, with a smile, or love-earrings, or a monster-like hand covered with aluminum foil (a la TV in Lost in Space). These people did not even feel scared. They wanted me to hurt my ears.
