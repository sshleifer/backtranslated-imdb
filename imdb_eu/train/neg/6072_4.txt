DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites. I love GOOD sports movies (not so much baseball, but its sports movies, right?). I expected so much for this movie. It seems to be a good start: DeNiro is what I expect, Snipes (who I do not like) is very good as a ruined star. Barkin's role was good for me. He's a good actor but he was not there. For me, it always seemed to run the scenes and then dragged it into places a bit. It seemed so different! Playing in the play and the plot, it could be much better. I rated "4" and I was generous ~ I am a tough number!
