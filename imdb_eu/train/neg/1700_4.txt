In cinemas, I feel that it should be more than art. I think that this should be more than just telling a story on the screen. David Lynch's story tells a story but not much. I thought it was funny but funny that it was a comedy. It's a good movie, but it's really not something else. As I said before, I'm a fan of David Lynch, but I'm frustrating some of his works, because there's no need to watch it. This is undoubtedly the favorite thing I have done so far, but I know that I still have a lot of talent and what I can see in the store in the future. If you like Lynch, look at this, but do not want to be surprised.
