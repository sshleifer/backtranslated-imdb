I rented a huge movie. The worst I think I've ever seen. I think a first class class can do a better job. I've seen the worst and most awesome movie I've ever seen. I did not rent anything scary at 1.50 and it was 1.49. The play is awful, the characters are worse and the movie is just trash. The slave scene in the home is a small budget, like B's Oscar nominee. If you want to miss a good night, I can say everything I want to rent a little money. I'd rather see seeing murderer clowns in space while sitting down in a seated bucket with this flop
