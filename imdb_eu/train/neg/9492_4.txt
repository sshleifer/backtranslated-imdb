A star on the "plot". A star of the play An American dubbing dubbing star. Five stars, Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow, for the removal of all the clothes. And from Ten to Emmanuelle Béart, two years ago, he made the name of 'Manon des sources'. Béart also twice dissolves, but also a full-fledged presence, to make this film more visible. Be careful about the scene that tells a little girl about her "first time" about her. Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau are much more erotic than the "choreographed" scene, but it's a lot more erotic. By the way, cinematography is not great; Closing credit frames are a good example of what David Hamilton can do.
