I really wanted to love this show. Really, to tell the truth, I did. <br /> <br /> For the first time, gay audiences get their own version of "The Bachelor". Her necessarily "hag", with help from Andrew, James, looks good, well, thirty things to love, as mentioned by 15 suitors (or "friends" show). Half of them is the only problem directly and James does not know that. If you choose a gay James, they will travel to New Zealand and choose a straight line, the live man will get $ 25,000. How's this fun? Take your hand, leave your walk: <br /> <br /> The worst problem in this show is the same degree. James is your most successful young man, with a pleasant smile and body, we will probably give you two glimpses at your local bar before pasturing for pasture. Why was James the chief man to be chosen for me? God knows that other homosexual men who are on television are much warmer. <br /> <br /> Although it's obviously a matter of physical appearance, James is just as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk. However, he has an arrogant and rational aura about him. However, James stood up against the white and white walls. I can not honestly recall James or something interesting or remarkable within the show. It is boring and unforgettable. In fact, one of the friends suggested that he did not feel connected. I thought the best part of the show. James also speaks of annoying evils. Female sound or masculine sound, but you do not have a tone phrase in the middle of the phrase ... so painful. I hated so much in the whole show, "Let's keep the correct choice and humiliate and look for your unhappy" <br /> <br /> Then we have the bride. There seems to be a bunch of men who do not care about what's happening. It also seems to be effective, it seems that the guy does not distinguish himself from what he says, "This kind of hell stands out, or it has curly hair." Although drafting the draft roles, it would be much more entertaining to see these amorphous drones. However, in all of their vacancies James still (still not difficult to do all this) to manage the upstage, that's a bit. You know you have a problem that some prejudices are really better and more interesting than the main man. And thinkers think they're fun with the older man ABOVE? Very sad <br /> <br /> Also, I thought it was something that I thought was true in the message boards I think: straight men are warmer than gay men. <br /> <br /> I will not be bad, I did not say that all gay boys were ugly and boring, some of which I found very slowly. In general, they were BLAH only in shows like Tila Tequila or A Bachelorette, as you would see with A Shot At Love. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many times I've made this quick show. I can admire the character that is as interesting as a cartoon box, I had fairies and caretakers, but please entertain me a little for the love of God. There is no luck. <br /> <br /> If you're drama, intrigue, feeling or excitement, you'll be disappointed. One of the most important "drama" is that it's a boyfriend from New York (how scandalous!). This is what I can guarantee, that is, the only thing that seems to be the confrontation of any show at a distance. <br /> <br /> You are sure to have a tour, but if you have something like Gaydar, you can easily understand who it is (it was not hard, I only once was wrong). This show puts up its chips a lot where it does not deliver anywhere else. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We can see exciting activities such as James & Co plod, such as the western step learning to dance, shopping for gifts, visiting a petting zoo and gay karaoke. Yawn You're definitely topless dancing from time to time, but who cares for everyone when it's boring. This is one of the main problems of the show: NO ONE seems to be enjoying: they're trying hard to get past the move. And you can not blame yourself because the events are incredibly imaginative and generous. <br /> <br /> In the end, there is no physical aspect. No curious, no mime, no kiss (!), Without any hurt. Just, "Ok that was a boring date, I will be back to my ugly and sharp Sydney Operahouse house (fast back lips) CYA." This show is cautious, it's ridiculous. I can understand that they do not want to play a part of non-homosexual men, but they will come. People who watch television shows want more than hugs and dumb kisses. This show does not refuse to commit. <br /> <br /> Sorry, it's been a long time since, but I felt the issues that were to be addressed. I recommend Bravo, first of all, to introduce a spectacle of this nature, but how this show has been managed differently and we have found it incapable. To summarize my three points: Boring + Boring + Boring = Going something else. You will be happier to have an appointment at a doctor's office, with at least magazines of interest.
