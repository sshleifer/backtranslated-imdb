Why is this movie so bad? Well, if having a reason is annoying and annoying, this is the movie. Corky Roman is the perfect character in the best and most disturbing case. Gag can be predicted, but that's not bad. The jokes planned for your unsuspecting friends are lame. <br /> <br /> Corky Romano is a good veterinarian, but it's so bad. A relaxed loop of life is thrown once the family of the crisis is forced into the FBI to destroy the remains of family crime. However, it is not easy for Corkyri FBI to be a super agent and thinks he relies on the duty of spying his family. Disadvantages and causes continue, but it's really not a comic as a kid. Corky is in love with a beautiful FBI partner, and the FBI and his family must establish a direct record for a peaceful life. <br /> <br /> I think what this movie does. It is an irritant protagonist and supposed jokes. Chris Kattan reveals his disturbing movements, as well as the actor here also notes that the slapstick routine falls 10 minutes into 10 films. The movie is completely full of humor. Will Ferrel, a member of Kattan SNL, seems to have made a complete outing. The only difference between Kattan and Ferrele is that Ferrele knows how to tone up and tell him a joke in other ways. In Kattan's habits there is no diversity. It's hard to hear the joke twice, but for a movie that's just torture. <br /> <br /> The other movie problem was the original joke and FUNNY lack. Mafia's homosexual siblings, awesome fonts, and lots of other jokes to forget are not fun, before laughing first. It seems screenwriters have a little more time to write than they are. The jokes that have been filmed with talented comedy (Chris Penn, Peter Falk) have begun. There is also no chemical. This movie was, of course, a booklet for actors. There was no body to look after or even try. It's a horrible thing, Chris Kattan said no body.
