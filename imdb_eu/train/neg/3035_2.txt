We have served - a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Okay, I accept, because I am puzzled and I do not have any practical experience "step-by-step in the competitive world," I might not. Have authority over this type of cinema. On the other hand, I know when I see a bad film picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And, boy, I just saw. <br /> <br /> Shot on Low-Budget-Vision. Directed by Ian Iqubal Rashid ("A Touch of Pink"), "How She Move" tells the story of dreams to follow, even though the dreams that surround the dreams of loud and violent hip-hop music, the average person would not have understood if he had an international translator. <br /> <br /> I will give you a brief "underground" summary. First, there are two actors such as LL Cool J, who work in a Cool Cooler in Toronto, but they still have time to practice daytime dance. <br /> <br /> There is another crew in this "crew", a guy who looks like "Malcolm X" in Denzel Washington. There are two women in the movie - it's similar to Serena Williams and the other looks like Geraldine from the "Flip Wilson Show". One of these ladies was taken out of a private university because their parents spent their teaching, they were a drug addict in a brother. The member of Salt N Pepa is definitely not good. There is another guy who resembles Eddie Murphy's Buckwheat, but Huggy Bear's tread is also an actor. These guys are step-by-step. Clearly, this activity is very harsh in the breeze, and everyone makes a "Step Monster" marigame in Detroit. <br /> <br /> I could not understand the 90 percent of the interview. maybe some subtitles would be useful, like the Bergman movie or Snow music video clip), it's hard to explain what happens if there is much talk, Serena Williams's girl (never smiling). Stepper becomes freelance (it moves from one group to another), there are a few steps and a lot of hip-hop hip hop music. <br /> <br /> It's a story of typical riches of cloth; A bad soundtrack like "Rocky", behind the annoying "Rudy" rap rap, "Cry Freedom" without laughter. <br /> <br /> But why a movie - which blacks may have a great impact on the audience - should be a drug addiction, a bad parent and a bachelor's degree, the first student saying that the phrase "moves"? <br /> <br /> This movie was "moved" anyway. The theater came as soon as possible.
