This is, apparently, a movie about multiple pain. That is why it must move the viewer and become the empathy of being the character of the main character. However, his own postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. The camera constantly changes between scene from one personal crisis to another, creating a disturbed and unbalanced effect. Most of the characters do not live in a live and unstructured way through their professional engagements. (It also extends credibility, simply, a man who is likely to be sentenced to death will be happy to simply stop being sexually motivated by a woman he has met.) Language (if there's a story) is hard to keep going. In summary, the overall effect is pure. However, the performance is generally good and some scenes are quite powerful.
