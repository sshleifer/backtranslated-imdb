This movie is the worst film ever. Lars plays a guy who needs to create a heavy film, rather than making heavy film. I must say I saw Leprechaun in space 6 times before I saw the movie POS for this trailer. Adam Sandler should not be prohibited in any of the subsequent movies of his disappointment. Watching this movie with Cher and listening to your dick in a blender. Anyone with half the brain cells will realize that this movie is not worth anything. If I had to spend extra dollars and spend it, I would give it to Lorraina Bobbitt Foundation before buying this movie.
