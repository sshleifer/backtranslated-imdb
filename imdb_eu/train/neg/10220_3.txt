First of all, this film can be divided into three segments. A great opening, attack by some Cheyenne cavalry. Subsequently, it can be described as a dreadful section of the middle, with Candice Berg and the "Soldier Blue" being completely misguided, traveling together to get the security of a garrison of the Navy. When Mrs. Bergen drops her mouth, Miss Bergen deviates from her four good lyrics and, apparently, in the 1970s Jack Nicholson was out of the movie. I mean, it keeps zero interest, without belief. The third and final parts involve a completely free donation to an Indian village. This is, of course, an overdone war on anti-propaganda, which is just as long, indigning and guessing it comes. It is not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comments above) Here's an idea. Why do not you really watch the movie you're talking to, instead of getting rid of your nonsense folks? This is not a political site for reviewing films. - MERK
