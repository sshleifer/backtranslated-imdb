To become a fan of Buster Keaton, your heart has broken regularly. Most of us for the first time found Keaton in one of his long-standing feature films of independent production: 'The General', 'The Navigator', 'Sherlock Jnr'. Film is the biggest figure in the history of comedy and we want to see more of his films. Here the heart begins. After the 'Steamboat Bill Jnr', he signed a contract with Keaton MGM under Keaton's Joseph Schenck's Keaton MGM. Keaton made another lease for an actor, interpreting someone else's scripts. He later worsened his alcoholism. After 'Steamboat Bill Jnr', Keaton did not make the first movie again. A couple of sources described Keaton's comedy about the masterpiece that MGM had to make: it's a parody of "Grand Hotel". Biography by Tom Dardis proves Keaton's evidence of this story. <br /> <br /> He is heartfelt in Keaton's long, steady decline, because he has come across a short film from time to time ... The Grand Slam Opera short comedy. With Speat Tracy, I'm continuing to look for the drama of the dramatic scene of Keaton, called "Mad Mad World", which includes Tracy's temperate police officer and an old retired Kreton (Keaton) phone and is looking for help stealing money from Smile Grogan. . This message has almost disappeared forever, but I still look. <br /> <br /> 'Talking easily', oh, one of Keaton's films is his decline from the beginning. MGM tried Jimmy Durante (ie, Smiler Grogan played three decades later) as a new comedy star. Unfortunately, MGM was trying to win, with Keaton and his style of comedy. Throughout his tour, Durante was the scene-stealer of blame: commendably, he knew he was being built Keaton's expense, and Keaton was the only protagonist of the ever attempted upstage session ever. . <br /> <br /> Often Keaton was a victim of cruel machining. Speak Easily called Post (Midwestern college) is a teacher and humorous teacher (as wood as one) and receives a letter that has inherited 750,000 dollars and must go to New York. Does it make a phone call to check? Even if the stamp has been marked? No, he saves his life from the bank and goes to New York. As soon as it is released, Post-Server acknowledges that he has written (false) a letter from the teacher to get Post out of his career! <br /> <br /> Post, who believes that it is 3/4 million, crosses the path with Jimmy. Dodge (During) is trying to produce a music version, but it does not have any money. The characters that play the great comic strip on the screen fail. Keaton is playing one of these playwrights (like Mister Logic as 'Viz'), everything that is intellectualized. It is one of those annoying behaviors, because it does not make any expression as a script, because it always says saying the script. No dialogue scene is painful and inadequate, Durant tries to try to talk about money with Keaton, but - instead of coming directly with him, he has to use more and more revolutions such as "kale", "kart" and so on. Keaton, of course, does not know what he's about in Durant. I'll give Keaton credits: his handsome, dusty voice in his troupe, a flat Kansas accent, is perfect for the character playing here. <br /> <br /> Sidney Toler is much smoother and more beautiful than here. It would be a year later because it corrects the honest monetary revised by Post Post. Henry Armetta, I've never found fun, it's less fun than usual here, he runs with a stupid win. Thelma Todd touched me here, in a weird version of "Horse Feathers" (in a much more entertaining movie). Edward Brophy, one of my favorite characters, is wasted. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem with 'Speak Easily' is that the characters behave in a completely appropriate way. In Keaton's lawsuit chronology, Keaton is shown with an urgent message ... but this is not why the lawyer will find Keaton's personal business. (Sutea lawyer, Buster!) In another scene, the teacher, Post-music, that captures the wallet, who enter the choirs on the girls' tent, and every girl in the choir immediately impresss and covers it. I know that the true choirs will never react to the modern mode, and I doubt that in 1932 girls of chorus acted like that ... they certainly did not respond to the angel of control of "angel" shows. > <br /> SPOILERS COMING. About half an hour, "Speak Easily", Jimmy Perzaltzaile hangs on the piano, smiles at the camera and shakes a little bit on his head. At this time, I thought at the time I wanted to fix the movie. Oh, no. The most annoying thing is the ending of this film, which uses the single, most bacterial, single-word, horned and infamous comedy: a stunning star that is absolutely not to be a comedy star. (Keaton should play one of the clicks in the 1955 'Screen Directors Playhouse' section, Chaplin used it already in 'The Circus'. <br /> <br /> I almost cried with anger and sadness - Missed options 'Easily talk'. Mostly, with respect to Keaton, Durante, Toler, Brophy and Miss Todd, I scored 10 points out of 10. <br /> <br />
