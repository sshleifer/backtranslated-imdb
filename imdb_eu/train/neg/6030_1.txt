It's okay. Now, I know that millions of Americans who believe in Rapture: Everyone who is born again in God will get bored with God and all the rest of mankind will be left on the ground to kill pests and fire. And psoriasis is a heart heart while the Antichrist fights against Jesus (especially in war). And I know that books are the best sellers. . . But among the believers. And that does not mean any respect. <br /> <br /> But I must say that they put this movie into a sack and they beat Suck Stick. <br /> <br /> I am sure the books are much better. Really <br /> <br /> The plot does not require repetition. If you have seen this movie, you read the book. It might be that he saw only the people of the earth, it was moving only for pure experience, and I was not disappointed. Kirk Cameron, especially the small gremlin called "Growing Pains", came to this show, found Christ, and SHOW decided to reflect on his Christian values. Kirk, your career has gone to dogs, but now you can be happy that the word of God is spreading so bad films, they never reach the theater book. Well, that's not true: I think it was the only DVD movie made in the FIRST DVD; When he released movie cards for watching movies! I still have a bonus! How many people did you show? I do not know for you, but never came to my city. Of course, I live in NYC, where God's liberals use the books to make them sit and sit together. So you do not go. In fact, I will bet about three million people from the Manhattan island, I will not steal anyone. <br /> <br /> Check additional DVD accessories, where you see the scenes behind you. Among these films. . . CAST and CREW must all be mental religions. They do not go out and they say it, but listen to what the filmmakers say. Pod Group has gathered a bunch of people to make a pod movie. How is this creepazoid? Honestly, he predicts those who convert this thing, right? Have you ever imagined that anyone who subscribes to subscribing to this apocalypse when he plays the eyebrow and "HOLY HOOVER DAM! I better keep it hurried!" Anyway, I'm hooked. I need to see the Christian fiasco of the rest of these films, especially with Gary Busey, that is TRIBULATIONS. At least Busey has an excuse to take part ... He broke his head on a pavement when he knocked on that motorcycle. <br /> <br /> O. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. What happens to all the innocent and poor dog whistles, crying crafted on the ground, because their owners call it heaven? What is that with? We assume a bad feeling about dogs, and if we do, what should we do to God? Is not IRK the best man with no celestial people? Foo. <br /> <br /> This is why I am more agnostic. Good night and good luck.
