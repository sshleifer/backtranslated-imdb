If anyone tells you, in cinema circles there is no longer a "possession" word, for example, "what do you have in film in this movie?" Religion has nothing to do with it, but it makes sense. That is, if you are clear about yourself and want to try it. <br /> <br /> I tried to rationalize the level I wanted to entertain this movie on several levels ... or, above all, to the consumer. Star? Story A unique idea? A movie that kids would love to have with a dinosaur and a black woman? Oh, my God! I'm sure it was an "idea", it was very good. But in the course of development ... someone should point out that this idea could not be seen or paid to pay for an exercise ... unless it is subject to alcohol or drug abuse. and the rest did not see something to see. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the mess is full. Badly, mess - sin and mess. <br /> <br /> Who is responsible for the plot (what plot?) Et al. Whoopie got a paycheck, but I would be ashamed. I am sure that he has released his agent / manager / publicist during the career movement. Of course, no, he made more bad movies. And more bad movies. Sad
