My children have the right to be forced to see at least 10 times in the final Christmas, so it is enough to decide on this version of the classic story of Dr. Seuss, well ... it's not very good. First, after a classic event similar to that of Chuck Jones's animated television theater, it will be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so heavy and full. I admit that there is a handful of some gags inspired, but in general, films get calculated as a collection, while avoiding Christmas marketing. Jim Carrey is usually at the top, but that's totally different from Grinch's character. As Boris Karloff described, slow burning was; methodical and wonderful. There's no way Carrey's madness, and that's just an obvious mistake. The talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are totally lost here. Why, Universal, why? I mean, the role that Tony Hopkins has to offer, such as Michael Caine, as his citizen, but this must be presented in the "Films Not Required Films" section. This does not work well at Hat in the Cat, Universal is preparing for Christmas. In my opinion, I think they will make the same recommendation: skip this, and read a special look at the book or TV. You never have to go back for 2 hours.
