As I work in a video store, I have had the most sincere duty to talk about the worst films I've ever seen and warn my friends and colleagues. One of the worst movie debates especially for a day, my friends B.T.K. The murderer, even if he saw the entire film and said that my previous choice was never a movie, would then be seen. I lost it. In my opinion, even though I did high-grade videos at high school, there were no great geniuses at a high school level. This film lacked something like productive value (it seems to have filmed a camera camera in a wrong, though it is surprisingly clear), but also in the workplace (wood, hollow and pathetic do not break the surface). Also, only the bad feeling of the movie. I remember the scene of the glass smash I suddenly reminded them of high school plays (I know I often refer to school here, but it seems that the movie is very young), but it seems that the set is very fake, but reads the script by reading people He did not know for sure what was happening. My review is not directed at this film, I do not describe how the time I see is terribly terrifying. It is almost ironic to make a pathetic work describing a preposterous excuse for a movie.
