This, in the end, was a great despair. Far away, the worst adaptation of my favorite novels. The conversation was terribly clumsy; I can feel the words indicated by the characters. The lines were quickly delivered and they did not feel like it. Similarly, states were mentioned. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York did not exist, and seeing an American Rochester was strange. He wanted to make a British accent at least. Like George C. Scott as an actor, but that just works. Jane Eyre, the main pieces of the story were randomly picked up, I stressed that it was not the story's emptiness. The landscapes and music were very nice, but they did not feel passion and love between Jane and Rochester, and the movie left me completely rested. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good version of Jane Eyre, we recommend you to watch the 1983 BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton with the 1997 version. Nowadays, there are two excellent adaptations.
