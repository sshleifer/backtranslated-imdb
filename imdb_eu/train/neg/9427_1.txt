When I rented "Unhinged", I waited for a gore movie. Kutxa also said that violent movie scenes were being cut off from the versions of the theater (now I have serious doubts in the theater). After finishing the movie, I asked him how I could get a release note. <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows: by car, three young women on a trip collide with a car on a tree. These women, in other words, have a sexist woman. Outside of this point, the film is a long-lived no-brainer movie that is wasted. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the things that make it horrible. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, seems to be reading her lines. The others are bad, but not bad. Another thing that is bad for this movie is camera technique. Plans have been taken from the ceiling mounted cameras. This is very annoying as the film progresses. Above all, there is very little crown, which is a very deceptive box. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this time. My rating: from 10 onwards
