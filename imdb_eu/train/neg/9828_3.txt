I rented this wrong. After looking at the box, I thought it was a journey-time / science-fiction story. Instead, it's a "Christian" story, and I suppose it's quite a typical example. If you sell it with the message, you will probably forget the malignancy of the plot / performance, but it has been quite painful. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I am worried about the history rewriting in this story. In the 1890s, it turned into a paradise of family values ​​and morals (a terrible horror character that spells divorce by 5%!), But the very unpleasant aspects of the "very moral" society (race, sex and rigidity). social discrimination was very widespread, for example). At one point, the heroine is complaining about the owner of a clothing store, a complaint about different things about women's attire (in a recent WSJ) complaints about some of Iran's leaders. <br /> <br /> In general, I thought, I suppose, if you like things like that, you would like things, and it's healthy ...
