Is this a joke? Is it a comedy? Certainly not a thriller? There is no suggestion that there are no suggestions for humor, but sometimes enough plays, bad guides and dramatic screenwriters laughed aloud at the cinema. The plot is acceptable - a mistake that kills a killer to kill a hopeful young artist waiting for him. The murderer sees the portfolio of young artists and decides to go to an exhibition of his work. In the exhibition the murderers know the dead sister of the artists and fall in love. It's all very predictable and the end is no one to guess, as it is handwritten. The film is mainly based around Vienna and Austria, and shows what a beautiful city is. Do not waste it in this movie, if you are studying how to play a movie, direct it or do NOT prompts the script.
