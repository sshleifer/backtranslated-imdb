Since the beginning of the film, the director gives a feeling of trying to portray something, what I mean, the dictating story of the movie style has gone by instead of the opposite, the type of movement he wanted to be and wrote a story. And he failed very badly. I think he was planning to make a great movie. In any case, I believe that this movie takes time and effort to break completely. The director thinks he's working on the media, what I want to say is that he has seen more films than this one. Here at least the director knows how to keep the movie up to date. And the actors have earned a decent performance.
