After hearing and enjoying the comments of Harvey Bernhard's Omen II, I was surprised to find out that it was behind the garbage. It's like a bad TV movie in the middle of the day in the middle of the flu, and you feel very bad to get away. I think Michael Lerner faces the Les Miserables only as a high school cast, my mouth was open credibly. And then his mouth went up and down, as he laughed so much. Dire. I do not know why I have to write at least ten lines, I shorten my point, there is nothing modern.
