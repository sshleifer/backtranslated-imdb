What can I say about this movie rather than "ignore it". I waited and waited and waited for (or something) to happen and it did not come. Take a look at the amazingly unique movie while walking two people walking. What are they doing? Do they fix my mystery? Do they collect clues? Maybe, it's hard to tell. After finishing the movie, after decoding a lot of radio signals (clearly, in a PET monitor), this guy gives some lectures, the argument is finally revealed and as soon as possible. Some foreigners want to return their home utopia and are happy to throw them there (I think they do not share wealth). They finished finishing with my intention and they watched 35-minute work or art (garbage!) And decided that the editing team decided to make a 88-minute feature. Look at your risk, it's not fun because it's not so bad, it's bad.
