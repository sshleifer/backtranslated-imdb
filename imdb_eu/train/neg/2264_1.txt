For the preface to this review, I must say that it was a bit curious about this movie. However, I would probably not have seen a little twisted arm. <br /> <br /> Here is my opinion, this film shows how depraved men can be. From my eyes, the worst thing about the whole phenomenon of Springer is not the type of people that "Jerry Springer Show" plays like themselves (it's self-indisputable), but many people are so curious and excited to see them. and hear about their lives (yes, I suppose that's what I am ... it is true anyway). If this type of behavior is not glorified (as some people say), at least we make our minds and / or ourselves to this type of behavior. <br /> <br /> But enough soapbox (sort). Here is the skinny: the movie has the R rating, and that's just worth it (I looked at some looks for some scenes, so I'm not completely sure), NC-17 (I feel like a hat tip. Another reviewer may also be appropriate for sex- It was a great excuse to show the great story of cynicism on the big screen - the story of a totally dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks that appear in different Springer shows, which ultimately leaves the film with a resolution and the Springer rhetoric tells us the need to see the real world (seen by the show). I agree: it's important to know how the world really is, we can make a positive change, let's say, I'm telling you that it's a bad news or a bad news in the world to see it. We do not give money to the sensationalisms that springers give us and perhaps to the type of formulation.
