I can not vote this because people would not see litter. I got my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore I did not happen again. In my view, civic duty is to help people move away from the trash. Go to the forums in this movie and read about how movie cast members are trying to play for the first time. A man responds to himself ... using the same name! Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane are just as good as they are in the forum ... They do not even know (in any way). If it's a second movie of the company, it would be better than the first. This means that Film 3 will be much better. No, so I saw it. Everything I want to know is how you distribute the same names. Playing with your friends and having a movie on the weekends is fine ... but do not try to sell litter!
