Devin Hamilton is probably known as the name of the legendary Full Moon entertainment. Unfortunately, when his independent studio arrived, the budget and production values ​​occurred during the smallest years. However, in his short career Hamilton has set as creative director for his inventions and original stories. Now, this does not mean that movies are good, but at least it's different from the horror genre. <br /> <br /> "Bleed" debut, the creation of Hamilton. slasher sub-genre. Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a young woman who gets her dream job. Not only this, but it seems that Shaun (Danny Wolske) has found a boyfriend, it seems that at last Maddy lives to smile after many sad events. With a party with Shaun's friends, they have created a "club" to kill their partners. <br /> <br /> Of course, they're joking, but Maddy desperately wants to get in, that's why someone really kills. After this event, someone kills "club" individually. As for Maddy, it's a question of knowing what happens when a person is a murderer. The genre's tour is very interesting because the main actor is part of the suspects. The concept is so original and Rochon's performance is so good, it is shameful that Hamilton did not develop the whole story better. Sometimes the movie feels pretty slow and, overall, feeling is a good idea to lose feeling in the worst film. <br /> <br /> The rest of the work is strange because all wives are very good. while male work is hard. Danny Wolske is incredibly woody and his work is stereotyped as a yuppie. Julie Strain, Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman feature small cameos that are very good in their small roles. Likewise, there are a lot of nudity (both men and women) and the cast is very good, so it really is more. <br /> <br /> A small budget puts the movie in the effects section. There are very few gory scenes and they are not really graphics (probably because they would look bad); However, considering the budget, the movie looks good at all. <br /> <br /> The latest efforts by Hamilton to "Delta Delta Die!" The exploitation of sex exploitation is better worked and fun. Although this is not as bad as one of the most popular films, it still has a lot of flaws and it is only interesting for Debbie Rochon fans and non-budget independent movie enthusiasts. 4/10
