I have always been interested in something about Bigfoot, so I was renting while looking for a movie, he looked at this. I've spent more than $ 4.50 a day and I want to get my money back! Please do not miss out on that! I was one of the cheapest films I've ever seen. The whole movie was very boring and I found myself rolling a lot of my eyes, and I did not see it in full. I ate well. The play was awful, the effects were awful, everything was really bad and it was a taste. In any case, a very bad, boring movie and a waste of time and money. I hope that one day they will make a good movie about Sasquatch, but I'll be doing so many inexpensive tables to date to find a true masterpiece.
