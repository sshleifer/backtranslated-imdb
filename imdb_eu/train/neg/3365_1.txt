This poor review of the classical 1963s starts fairly reasonably, and then it confuses the special effects with confused and absurdities. For example, in the original, one of the most awesome moments is when Nelle and Theo twins are standing next to the bed, when they hear fear outside their room. Nell leaves Theo in his hand because he has pain. Then Nell looks at Theo, which is a few meters away, and realizes that Theo was not holding his hand. In the latest version, Nell is lying in bed, suddenly dives and slides across the floor. When we take notice of the strength they see, they stop realizing what has happened. And someone can say what the final word in Nell means: "Regarding family, is it always about the family"? <br /> <br /> This is the performance of Lili Taylor, but she can not save the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones again demonstrates that there is little depth in the exterior. Originally, Claire Bloom suggested subtly to her lesbian persuasion. Zeta Jones must write, for example, asking if he has a Nell boyfriend or girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Immediately a simple remake should be sent temporarily.
