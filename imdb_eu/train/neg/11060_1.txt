One of the most famous of the American series killer may be a wonderful look, but unfortunately it does not come close. Awesome edition, direction, performance. This movie literally stretched out about 10 plots around 100. The only quality of recovery is Bruce Davidson's father, but this is not nearly enough to save this stinker. 10 out of 10.
