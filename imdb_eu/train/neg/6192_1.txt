Robert Carmichael's Great Ecstasy is a bad movie. The script, the rough rhythm, the depth of any character, the sub-plot, the terrifying performance, when it is finished, is the worst film ever seen. No pleasant, pleasant or intellectually stimulating way was found. I think that filmmakers think they are going to make something light and dark, with its changing lighting, long silence, and classic soundtrack. If so, they completely failed. I get bored, and I would never see it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
