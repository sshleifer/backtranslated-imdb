I can enjoy the guilty of foolish pleasures, but that's a bad thing. And it's not bad to see MST3K as fun. It's just a bad thing, as you can not find anything about it, you can try it. I will really regret the loss of precious 2-day life. You can say that they did not see anyone asking for it, and everyone knew that movies would only bury their careers. It seems that "Walking Tall" has earned relatively good earnings that someone might decide to invest. If it's not the worst movie I've not seen, it's so bad that my movie's memory has been eliminated.
