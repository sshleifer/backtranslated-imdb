Unfortunately, this original movie is not credited. Nicholas Cage, as it is wood in the actors, shows a wide range of abilities on the screen, which are not top-down. The support works are no better. <br /> <br /> The Earth is similar to the scene progression, but it is worse. There is not enough detail to access the seller. As a result, it is inadequate. Credibility can not be interrupted, nor can it be in doubt. The only savings in this movie is that it is very useful, as it requires support, and someone who is looking for a location would be advised. <br /> <br /> The audience had a lot of laughter and several boos, literally, here at the end. <br /> <br /> Damaged! Wait for the original on television, throwing and whiskey.
