Here are the matches. . . (adv. = advantage) <br /> <br /> Warriors (Ultimate Warrior, Texas Tornado and Doom Legion) v Perfect Team (Mr. Perfect, Ax, Smash and Crush of Demolition): Ax the first in seconds, Warrior pines (4 -3 adv. Warriors) when he threw him. I knew Ax was not a healthy man, but why could he worry about this card? This is his latest PPV. In the end, the Legion of the Two Legions and the Demolition is cheaper by means of double disability (2-1 adv. Warriors). The perfect Plex perfect will be applied to Texas Tornadon for pineapples. After that, Warrior will try to make the same, but it is sold by Warrior and is thrown. Warrior turns the rumor to Perfect and has become the only survivor. 5/10 <br /> <br /> The Dream Team (Dusty Rhodes, Koko B Ware and The Hart Foundation, Million Dollar Team (Ted Dibiase, Mystery Partner and Rhythm and Blues): The mysterious partner The Undertaker and, debut , Coconut immediately took an influence on Tombstone (Monsoon still has a direct heights, weight and finish movement is not known). He said that he was doing the 4/3 division of the Dibiase group. Niedhart power-slams. Honky pin (3-3) and his career He has finished with WWF. Soon afterwards, Niedhart becomes the victim of Dibiase with the help of Virgil (3-2 adv. Dibiase's team). -I'm up from the top, but you do not have to let Brother Love attack. Undertaker is behind Dusty Although he is not a legal man (2-1 adv. Dibiase's team), Hart is trying to block four-legged figure and Hart-Dibia is after a few minutes of signals and fights, Bret Dibias has crosses the cross for pine trees. Divias survives da da. At least Hart is used. 6/10 <br /> <br /> Vipera (Jake 'Snake' Roberts, 'Superfly' Jimmy Snuka and Rockers) and Visionaries (Rick 'Model' Martel, Warlord and Power and Glory): After a little while in the ring, Marty Jannetty gives Warlord power, while leaving the rope that goes from the pin (4-3 ab. Visionaries). Snukas settles Martel in seconds, reversing the body's cross (4-2 adv. Visionaries). Michaels has caught on Power Plex and Roma is hit (4-1 adv. Visionaries). Three years ago, his attempt to survive with Roberts has been working against four men. Although with Warlord DDT, Roberts has hit Martel. The audience live in the first group of the Survivor Series. There's not much honest here to see as in a hurry to psychology. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Hulkmans (Hulk Hogan, 'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan, Bigbossman and Remorcador) v Natural disasters (Lurrikara, Dino Bravo, Barbarian and Haku): A bomeman who throws Slam out of Haku (early). 4-3 adv. Hulkamaniacs). Duggan got 4th quarter after losing Lurrikarak (3-3). Shortly afterwards, Bravo committed suicide by linking Hogan (3-2 adv. Hulkamaniacs). Earthquake manages Bossman after losing the elbow after pin (2-2). Hogan struck and finally Tugboat gets a tag (who knew he was right now), he fights for about 30 seconds before calculating an Earthquake. Only Hogan and Barbarian remained. Barbarian puts on a nice crime, but inevitably catches him on a leg and leg that is in his pin. Hogan is alive. 4/10 <br /> <br /> Alliance (Nikolai Volkoff, Tito Santana and Bushwhackers) and mercenaries (Sgt. Slaughter, Boris Zhukov and Orient Express): All Mercanaries wore their camouflage face. Lightning pin fast here, with Santana Zhukov, following his latest PPV (Alliance 4-3). There was no challenge for volunteering. Bushwhackers hit Sato with The Battering Ram, though Tanaka was a legal man (4-2 Adv. Alliance) and WWF PPV's latest occurrence when The Orient Express was re-assembled. Tanakak Sato follows Santana Santxo attacking his face (4-1 alliance). Although Slaughter is a ring against four men, Volkoff (who is after completing his career) eliminates Butch and Luke in that order relatively. Santana eventually surpasses Slaughter when General Adnan hit the Iraqi flag. In the end, some interesting bookstores are a great match. Santana survives and survives the best time in the last minute. 3/10 <br /> <br /> She covers the eggs, and Hector Guerrerro is in a stupid dress. Dancing with Gene Okerlund and people are encouraging people, while Piper and Monsoon enjoy themselves. <br /> <br /> Survival: Ultimate Warrior, Hulk Hogan and Tito Santana Warlord, Power and Glory, Rick 'Model' Martel and 'Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase: Santana pin is just another catalog for removal of Warlord. Seconds, with the previous forearm at least revenging the previous Summerslam defeat (4-3 adv. Dibiase groups). Then Dibias will surprise Santana with the gun (4-2 AD. Dibiase team). Hogan jumps into The Power Plex and starts off with a Roma outfit, removing power from the Power and Glory (3-2 adv. Dibiase team). Hogan eliminates Martel's counting and Dibiase pin (2-1 Hogan team adv.). In the end, at last, Warrior lets her go back to the usual Hercules maid. Very predictable to the previous point of infirmity. 2/10 <br /> <br /> In general, too many parties and very little time had an adverse effect, when the fighters waited almost on a belt belt. Most of the tricks were split into Warrior and Hogan, which is a bad way to manage a large number of fighters.
