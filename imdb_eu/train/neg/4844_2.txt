I'm definitely a minor opinion about this. "The Hurt Locker" has won more "Picture Picture" awards than any other movie this year. However, I do not like it, I did not like to sit down. <br /> <br /> We develop fewer plots and little characters. They divert bombs, disarm them and fight bombs. That's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But, the worst part, the camera is not stopping and constantly trembling. It has been the latest fashion in cinematographic cinema and seems to be a bit like a cheap document look. The camera was so shivering as it was nausous to look at the screen. <br /> <br /> Normally I do not have war movies and "Hurt Locker" is no exception. But you do not have to take my word because they love critics.
