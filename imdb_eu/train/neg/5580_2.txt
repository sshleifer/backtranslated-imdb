I like a lot of actors / actors involved in this project, so movie infections were worse than those used by unknown people. The main problem was the concept that was created to attract the baby boomers clearly. 20 or 20 30 years ago Nbc probably will make a movie in the early 90's. I know now a black family where kids take part in rioting and white families who are uprooted and grunge rock music. Soundtrack Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden etc. That way, it will be as sharp as the 60's and NBC will do it. See the greatest number of times when you buy the networks purchased during a certain period of time that you are not thinking about living. It was fashionable in the 60's or any decade at that time. The next person is doing something like that, he should put more weight there on that project
