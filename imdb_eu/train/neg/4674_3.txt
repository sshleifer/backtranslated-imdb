I do not know who is to blame, Miss Leigh or her director, but her performance as Catherine is almost impossible to see. Ben Chaplin, on the other hand, works better, as I am worried. Its character is very pleasant and attractive. But definitely not showing enough greedy, Leigh to face character stupidity. Chaplin feels like Leigh's shame and graceful debility. It has to be an element of credibility to its own interests, but it is understandable as it is in practice. Screenings are not released. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are, of course, very pleased with their efforts. Helping to work is nice. Even a shame, they do not lead to work together, because it is beautiful for production.
