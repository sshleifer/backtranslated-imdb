Before spoilers, but does it really matter? Can you read some questions in a movie review? Is that the case? Why was an ancient civilization buried in the whole world? Why is not this question answered? Why open open text incoherent? Why a monster (surely nice!) 20 would be delivered to the orphan's madman? Has gold pain been always in the middle of the city of Vancouver? Why did you leave the gold yard of an orphan's front yard? Why is Tara Reid's character appearing in Christian Slater's sex apartment? (Or do I only answer my question?) Why are not bangs with archaeologists also open a valuable gold bullet that can be opened? Why would modern computers continue to show the traces of vintage objects of the Tron, made up of small "bleps"? Should all film explosives be digital screens? Why does not this movie?
