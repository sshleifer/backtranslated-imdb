Devil Hunter stands out for DPP's 'Video Nasty' list, but it does not really have to be. For many reasons why we are listening to God's (and DPP) list of reasons, that is, even though this is not a bundle of tamest; There's not much forbidding here ... it's shameful, I never would have been sitting by it because it's in the "shopping list". The plot is based on a decent basis - or at least a more decent base than cannibal films - and continues in the Amazon kidnapping and dragging the Amazon jungle. He then picks up a hunter for him, but he has to nurture the natives on the way, a man called "Devil" (thus, the title). In essence, the film walks ninety five minutes and there is not much interest. It is really shameful for Jess Franco to finish such films, with the clear talent of the man; The movies like Diabolical Dr Z, Venus, Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good films are just gems, and Devil Hunter is far from mere. I only saw this movie in the DPP list, which I saw all (I have only two more), and I think that they have seen what they've seen. But if you're not looking at Nasties; It's really not so much to worry about.
