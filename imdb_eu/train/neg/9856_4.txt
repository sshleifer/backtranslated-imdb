In the early autobiographical story, "Romulus, My Father," Eric Bana, known as "Munich", is a German emigrant struggling to grow his son, Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee) in the 1960s. The main obstacle to family stability and happiness, his wife, Christina (Franka Potente), violates his allegiance to other men who violate their promises of marriage. Despite his unusual behavior, Romulus refused his divorce, and he is tortured by masochism, hoping that he will be in vain to return one day to him. Unfortunately, Raimond is a happy and good man who has to be witnessed by this civil agitation and is the basis of his book (Raimond Gaita later became an author). <br /> <br /> Even though I'm trying to admire "Romulus, My Father", I can not say I've enjoyed honestly because the movie has some beautiful performances and serious intentions. These are just not enough to face a story line and a funeral walk, because the viewers are disappointed and depressed by the people on the screen. The drama of life is a serious line, but adulteries, madness and many variants (or even less than those who take their heads off their heads) is a mere overload.
