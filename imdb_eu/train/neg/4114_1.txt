There are great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when I die? AND WHY WE USE A SOME FILM ... The premise is absurd. It's a three-dimensional activity. Special effects are overdone. And the film is one of the films that have never been produced in Hollywood, among other things. However, if there were good shots, everyone was dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movies. The bad thing has not happened. The hope of extending it several times, I was stuck to see how bad it would be. I made it happy (SPOILER?) The last line is full dopey, bad scenario, stupidity. There is also a second feature that deserves a season off-in third rate. Apart from the general nature of the film, I am concerned about the impact their young audiences have on them. Americans turn around such rubbish and then wonder why Columbine's events take place. Brobdingnagian is a trivial movie on a scale!
