We should congratulate Uwe Boll. It's unbelievable. You may be the only director of the 100 films in the IMDb for two films! It's like a live cockroach. It does not matter that his talent has little, and whatever movies are evil, he will continue to do them. I know, he finances them all through a strange German fund, but even though his ability to make his films is a constant failure, he is one of the great mysteries of the universe. <br /> <br /> It would not be so bad that video game developers give the best properties of that guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series games. The new Final Nightmare has also been good for some hours of the game. Edward Carnby's adventures were a good movie, but that's not it. Now, Uwe Boll has received Bloodrayne and Hunter hands: The Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom I can not imagine that guy will stop cutting it through game adaptations. Someone needs to get rid of their credit line, or video game publishers should be aware of it and realize that a bad game that kills French movies when the franchise dies, no one is ever interested in that title. <Br /> <br /> Think, House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark is the title of the game more viable? In no case. The House of the Dead comes up with a new game from X-Box and nobody cares. The title is dead, because all Uwe Boll is. So if one of you works with the publisher of the game, or if the game publisher knows or has access to a publisher game ... please alert me. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth reviewing. I can not distinguish you from this dirt bike. Literally, everything sucks. Writing, theater, music, CG effects, edition. Waiting until I came to the DVD and I hoped to rent it with low expectations, I would not be disappointed. Boy, I was wrong. Never miss the power of Uwe to take a big pile of BOLL sh * t.
