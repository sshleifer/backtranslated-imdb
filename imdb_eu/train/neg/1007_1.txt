I saw a great difficulty in seeing the movie 5 minutes from the start. I got an stomach for 45-50 minutes before turning it off and seeing it in Monster House (that is, it's basically fun). <br /> <br /> The story has huge holes. The land line is terribly stark and sad, the play is horrible, especially Justin TImberlake, who has to go through it (singing and singing like castor). Morgan Freeman was very uncomfortable, especially when he was forced to dance around rock music, through the film, and Timberlake's performance. Freeman and Timberlake's characters seem to be kind of a type of kinship, or something similar, that is simply not evident; Despite the fact that Freeman's character has not been despised by Timberlake's ignorant and stupid character, he stops at less times to find a totally ridiculous cover. <br /> <br /> It would take some credible breaks to work on the incredible story, that is to say, the absurdity and proportion of any credit that is completely crushed. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie, it's a waste of time.
