It is a film of the 50s. It is very surprising that the American Film Institute chose this 100-minute movie for the best American. I've seen almost all the movies in this list, which is far from one of them. Music numbers (and many of them, many of them) are very contemporary and boring, and they have no absolute connection to the story. At the end of the film, the long ballet has a very long sequence, and, of course, the story of the film does not have any connection. It must be admitted that it is well done, music is well and dance is performed with the highest professional standard - but there is no real reason for the movie sequences. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is very popular and difficult and acts in a very intense way. He is about 14 years old. If you want to see a good piece of music in "golden age", see "Rain Sing."
