In the first three seasons, quite odd parents were as sweets as candy, bright and delicious and dependency. Pepto-Bismol is now tasty. And unfortunately Pepto-Bismol is after seeing recent episodes, what you need to do without laughing all the insults and violence. Cosmo, one of Nick's most daunting characters, became a malicious crime against Family Guy who did not want to know. Timmy Bart Simpson has become a selfish person with joy (and giving Timmy's snottiness, which would be a lot of stinging). And Wanda, the poor ... true charm that becomes her husband and child's victim, has now been called "nag" to take responsibility for others' well-being. In addition, Cosmo's stupidity causes pain to others, but never punishes or even learns lessons. But he adds to his attitude towards Butch Hartman: they are raw, most common and not very clear. Thank you, this goddess, along with Danny Phantom Butch Hartman, has canceled this risky one. At least Butch got it well-deserved - unlike Cosmo.
