I would like to write about the story, but it was not there. I'd like to mention a couple of hard-talking dialogues, but "hinglish" is only fun for about 5 minutes. I would like to disassemble the "suspense of continuous inventions", but it was predictable ... um mm, Yash raj film (?). I'd like to talk about the action of the seat, but I do not like cartoons. <br /> <br /> * Sigh * <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is perfect: 1. People who try to commit suicide - I promise you to push them on the edge. - This film is more effective than the Silas wire that plays Silas Da Vinci. 3. People investigating alternative ways of extending terrorism - It seems that filmmakers go out of the room as it seems to kill someone. 4. Piraters movie: more power to them. Any movie is worth the money if the audience does not want to spend money, that is. 5. Buckles, plankton types and green algae. Almost all living things would need an IQ factor that is more than the movie. Reflection: The director of the movie is, of course, his kind. (And I hope that the god is his only type ... it's enough) <br /> <br /> Things that could make a better film: 1. A story 2. A choreographer 3. A writer's script 4. A stunt coordinator 5. A story (Did I already say that?) 6. A director, better not a mentally challenged (although he could have made a better job) Bubony plague - Avoid with all costs. 8. A legal notice. - "Watching Yash Raj movies is the health of your head that is harmful?" "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" titles become English - "My heart is a gap," "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya" becomes "Im a flirt, Im a lover, Im a vagabond" ... priceless. /> <br /> In short, Tashan for me is the opposite of a Rubriken cube - Cubes suppose the player increases the number of players. ! Woot! <br /> <br /> * Sigh *. But that's just for me. I was wrong, though, you warned me.
