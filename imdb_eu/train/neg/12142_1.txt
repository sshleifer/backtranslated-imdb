Please, ignore God's love. Now, I know what you're thinking, can not this be bad? If everyone says they say it, I have to see it! Do not do that! It will look at a terrific accident with small babies and gas stations. You will frustrate life ... the image will never leave! I saw an average hour before I became a violent ill. The play is the worst thing I've ever seen and I've seen Barbwire !!! If you want to rent your movie with eyes straight and you want to rent ... I do not warn you! The skin and the story are a trap !! Zombies? Satire? The Shaun of the Dead was great! This movie must be the same ... right? NO !! Writing = crap directing = junk joking = no play. You still do not persuade? Then your soul will endure forever!
