In Christina Galbo, 60 minutes have gone away to escape the isolated boarding school that initiates the film. Do you see the horrible destiny, a monster, a horror killer or a supernatural evil? No, a group of bullies is listening. For the next 40 minutes, several characters walk through the school in candlelight in the dark, and worried or disturbed, this does not mean much, in fact, they might have been great movies, but for this reason Characters walking through the corridors and stairs, it's better to be Alain Resnais or better Do you know that staircase with glittering red and bright apples and purple like Mario Bava? We know that the murderer is using the perimeter of the school, but his body's countenance is wonderful and profound, and if we are not afraid of the flutter we hope to find in the sky, we have no secret mysteries behind a fairytale / behind a fa√ßade. and La Residencia is a type of movie, but he does not know how to do it. We know something is gone, because girls are missing, but we never realize the mysterious atmosphere, "something is wrong here, man." When Serrador tries to make comments on female sexual assault on female students, Hysterics quickly mixes with the eyes of the eyes, splits the lips, "touches" the music, peeling in the back. Here there is no beauty in the PIETN portal of PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK. It's totally clumsy and correct, it does not make sense in the urgent direction. Many people are presented as suspects, but there is no reason why the murderer who warns the characters inside this film. I like to kill him first, the worried faces of the victim on the back of the image of a sheet of coated barrel on the back, but the rest is not very important for me. Do I have to say that Serrator has done much better to kill children and paranoia than to sunlake RIGHTS?
