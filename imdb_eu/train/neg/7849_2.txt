The film is featured on the latest version of the last year, when the military creates electronic surveillance equipment in the desert when attacks on the first film occurred. A crew member of a training crew will not find anyone. You can fill out the rest. <br /> <br /> It's a salary image all the time. It seems that in the interpretations of anyone there is no passion nor behind the camera. It's a movie made for money and anything else. They should work on some levels. However, with Southern Comfort they could be terribly frightening (national carers were swallowing crowds in the swamps), but there were not many. In a great part, the script directed by Wes Craven is a blame, which repeatedly overtakes old goals. Add the mess because the direction is dull and the sequence set does not shine, to eliminate any tension of any scene. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad, but bad and dull. . Please leave my feelings in context: I watched this movie because the local multiplex was buzzing and this movie was running, because I wanted to see the latest movies by Mimzy and I wanted to see what I wanted (so many movies). with sarcasm I'm sure this movie is afraid of the likes of the latest Mimzy.
