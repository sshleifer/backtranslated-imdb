The Invisible Man is a wonderful movie since 1933, it's a leading movie to rest on a man that was really visible. Look forward, look at the movie, that you were amazed at in 1933, it was the first true special effects movie. Since 2000, special effects on computer support seem like a child's play, the viewers are not expelled from special effects, but they are not disappointed. The special effects of Hollow Man, updating the story of HG Wells, are fine, but it's not the main problem of Paul Verhoeven's film, which he would remember with Showgirls and Total Recall. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist who is tasting a world of bio-invisibilation (yes, I know this is not a word), but, of course, there are struggles that threaten the elimination of group financing. So, as the film-makers of the film-making process tends to make the final sacrifice, it becomes the British Cobaya for invisibility (yes, I know, the word I have not used again). The process has serious consequences, not Cain does not die, but becomes a ridiculous and abusive nature. As it is invisible, Cain attends a sexy couple, a coworker, a girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue), and a man who refuses her financing. When things happened, Cain transforms a supernatural creature into "a thing that does not die." Cain laughed before laughing at all things, Cain casts himself in the face and face of death, because that creature is dying, dragging the end of the movie. The movie is stupid, stupid, and at times suffocating is that realism is sometimes used, sometimes not. There are good options for Hollow Man, but of course, it's not exploring any of them. To get an invisible creature look more interesting, prepare for the restoration of black and white cinema and see the Invisible Man of 1933. Kevin Bacon will be invisible when he returns, probably still living under the volcano.
