In the end, I saw INCUBUS after seeing 20 years, and it's definitely not worth the wait to watch it all the time. THE INCUBUS horror movie is wonderful: the invisible killer / monsters are raped and killed by a small town. <br /> <br /> The movie goes like this: the movie dies; then blah blah blah; blah blah blah more; then another murder; are blah blah blah more; to continue with blah blah blah; Another murder (astonishing, right?); blah blah blah, etc ... <br /> <br /> The film is completely predictable from the beginning to the end. The reddish giant "giant" used all over the film did not persuade him to be 5 years old. And when I saw the character that I knew the secret identity of the hood, so "surprising" when the surprise came to an end, I was not surprised or shocked. In fact, the day I saw the movie was so funny, I continued to have fun. So stupid! <br /> <br /> In any case, so many films count that "rock band" sequence is one of the few moments of this brilliant film. It's a stand-out scene, because it's not necessarily good but it's so fun and useless: the movie that plays on the big screen shows a momentous video-like rock with a man with a black leather trousers, which is considered to be a long-haired hair. This has been edited by the incubus of a girl who is attacking the bathroom in a bathroom toilet. The best thing to say about this movie is cinematography, I really liked it. But apart from that, there is nothing worthwhile about INCUBUS, except it is necessarily ridiculous.
