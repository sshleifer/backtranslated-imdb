The actors may say they will make a movie, but this clearly proves that this is wrong. Most of the characters in this movie do not support anything. Cardboard cut sections face up and move in an interesting way. The story is very easy. It can be summarized in some words, but if anyone who reads wants to watch this movie, I'll go back. <br /> <br /> The parts that Jack showed me had to move forward. eating hard I would say that 70% of the movie is cooking, eating or eating. Actually, I prefer not to spend time in Jack's mouth openly looking noisy. Personally, without reference to the shoes I could make without referring to the shoes of the first half of the first film. <br /> <br /> My personal dementia outside, the movie did not have time to deserve something. Several scenes and camera shots were dragged. Something happens when the reactions of the characters are fuzzy and dry. <br /> <br /> Let's not let this look better.
