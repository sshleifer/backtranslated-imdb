In 2005, George W. Bushe began his second period with the United States President; North Korea has announced that it has nuclear weapons in Korea. Joan Paulo II died after a long illness; and the movie Into the Blue appeared. The existence of this movie is not as bad as all other things of the year, but the film itself was pathetic and perhaps the worst of that year. In 2009, the United States has another president, there is another holy father, new Korean weapons ... and the movie Into the Blue 2: The Reef is better than the original ... but to say: "get your fingers" Cut this yourself It's better than cutting it. "This sequel is a very bad movie, very bored and disinterested in me. Into the Blue 2 cast: The Reef is a perfect showcase for actors who have absolutely no credibility and dramatic significance. Chris Carmack (OC) David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring bad and boring performances. Stephen Herek (Critters and Bil.) I liked the previous film director and Ted's Excellent Adventure in particular), but this movie can not create a minimum level of tension, emotion or entertainment. The characters in this film are not only misunderstood, but they are bad, I want them all. The cinematography of this movie is not at all like it, and it seems that the promotion of Hawaiian hotels made by a technical team that makes videos. Blue 2: The Reef is better than an original movie The movie is horrible, but that's not the same, as I said before. Thankfully this movie is empty.
