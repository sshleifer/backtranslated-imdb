I've been catching a few months in the Family Channel, and I decided to have my children's TV shows reminded of my 4-year-old daughter. Some psychedelic mushrooms would go with it, it's just strange! Not only is the musical unforgettable music annoying, but rather the style conditions and the cameo styles of past class stars. Someone seems to have been a good acid travel. Talk to the flute, British children who are too old for that ... Krusty Klown's words "uuuuuugggghhhhh! What was it?" If you are a fan of Sid and Marty Krofft's work, go; If you do not want to see it before, far away, far away, you can stay away.
