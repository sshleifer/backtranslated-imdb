First of all, I would say that I enter comics, anime, animation and such things. It's true everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me in this movie. I will be the goal. The story starts - it's ok. I keep the story of comics as far as I know. But the animation ... Well, it's not really terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be much better if he did not try to imitate the anime style and stick with comic style original drawings. If we do not see strange effects such as fire and lightning, films over ten years ago and even more are seen. In 1985, it is like Vampire Hunter D. Check out Heavy Metal for FAKK 2000, for example. 4 years ago they made a good movie, much better! In addition, voice talents do not emphasize anything, music is not unique. So completely - the atmosphere is lacking. I saw it, but I can not say I really enjoyed it. You just catch him. There are many blood and violence, but that does not imprint on any one. It may be moving to anyone who never watches more animation that has never seen and encouraged for the first time (is it around someone?), But I do not think the audience of this movie. So they could add a little nuisance and spice. Lucifer's chicks were very tasty, and hell, Lady Death himself! It looks like some sexy looks, but it's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music, I think it was better to look like a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. In the end, the movie is not bad, but if you want something better, you should take the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Ralph Bakshi Fire and Ice or Wizards. And, of course, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
