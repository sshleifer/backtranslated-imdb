An awkward and shocking movie for me. With a cast of A-List, especially three directors and expert director, Spike Lee, I expected much more and finally I felt that the book did not add to the movie sub-genre. First of all, I did not like the movie's career, I began with the prestigious piece directed by Clive Owen's camera, which seemed repeatedly useless and then misleading in the conversations of the place, in seemingly unrealistic conversations. Then, you would have started to jump into the scene earlier. Of course, the camera's work is very fluid, constantly moving and hands-on shots, but Lee's director does not give emotions or suspensors, not essentially the main characters of the movie. Denzel Washington shook out the clothes and costumes that he has spoken about thirty-five years ago of a "Shaft" movie, even though "nobody knows him but his wife," he's "hot." Girlfriend, with Willem Defoe (almost part) "Cling Owens" plays his character with a decisive English accent, despite his belief in the Arab gang, as well as the 90% of the film with a mask on his face Jodie Foster has published another little girl who has patented her narrow eyes, the underlying Clarice Starling, turns the well-connected huntsman into a well-meaning, small effect. In general, the movie is a real mish-mash, In the end, it's a clear but clear twist, which gives the title from the beginning, spoiler enthusiasts. Worst scene (among many) Washington It's a witness-witness, with an eight-year-old boy. That's why the conversation with the same Owen's daughter speaks of a lot of bets. Throughout the film joke references are classic characters, such as "Serpico" and "Dog Day Afternoon" classic heist movies, but it's not honored by self-praise. Like "The Hot Rock," instead ... and that was also good to make some laugh.
