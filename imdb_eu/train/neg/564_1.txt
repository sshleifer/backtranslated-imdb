The producers made great mistakes with Mark Lester, could not play or sing in the title role. In addition to the "interpretations", Lester's song had to double a girl. I do not know why he was thrown out, because there were so many boys who would play the role infinitely better and even sing him. Shani Wallis was too old to play with Nancy, she was just 16 years old. The current West End version is much better than the movie. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time, and Jack Wild looks much better than ever. It was politically clear that this award was made to the Oscars restored in 1968.
