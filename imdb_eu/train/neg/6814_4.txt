Jean Rollin, the French director, is not known for many films, and is a confusing mix. One of the most disturbing things about this production is the title. A well-known director for erotic films about lesbian vampires; You would expect a movie called "naked" to be especially unprotected; But the truth is, there's a lot of nudity here. Without clothing, instead of lesbian erotic vampires; We have a heavy plot about a man who wants to unlock the secret of immortality, a young woman who has a wrench and suicide worship that makes her much less. The film begins constantly with a sequence that leads a young girl with a mysterious mask, under the care of a young Frenchman, who is also a son of a very important man. Through his research, he soon realizes that this woman is not a normal lady, and deep into the depths of worship; he can not kill bullets, drink blood and see who he does not go out day by day ... I think it's a clear vampirism case for me. <br /> <br /> Jean Rollin maintains a fantasy atmosphere, but it is not interesting because the plot is so badly executed. What's happening is possible, but there are many other films that follow such plots. The director seems to have confused that concept, the highest point is basically an excuse to explain the movie to the viewer. At the end there is also a tour; But the movie would be better without it. I think that Jean Rollin was an attempt to be a little original, but it is a similar attempt, rather than logical tracking of the story. Cinematography is fairly clear, since many sites are built in the right Gothic location. The girls in the tables make up a beautiful picture and Rollin's films lack logic and coherence. They took part in the defense of the film in 1969; This explains some kind of explanations, but I can not recommend this movie, because it does not have to be much aware of it.
