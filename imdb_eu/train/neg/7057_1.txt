This is one of the most absurd movies I ever had. Every time it began to appear good, more flashbacks of sepio shades followed, then paranoid clarity, as a social comment. Maddox's main character is a rebellious manipulator, seemingly parental and without responsibility. The cast of support is much more pleasant and more interesting, but unfortunately they are never developing. We also never understand, however, that John Stanton's character Maddox's influence has been suspected of rioting actions. At some point, I thought, "Aha! Maddox is just nuts and all the communications from the sick person in the Stanton headache are secretly done! We're getting something right now!" but, of course, this is not the case, and the whole movie is not a problem, either from Maddox's point of view or from the perspective of the viewer. Where do we need Ferris Bueller?
