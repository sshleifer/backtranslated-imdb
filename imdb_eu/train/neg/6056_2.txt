Honestly, this movie is one of many other despair ... Most of these horror masters are a great deal of research on their sub-parasitic effects and abusive stories ... Not only Ron. Perlman, everyone in this movie can not save their life ... someone who played the shooter was playing a boom mike or something under the bop, and they looked realistic ... In general, this movie is awesome Home Only ... good masters Sigarro Burns, Jennifer and maybe Pelts ... I do not know how managers can sleep at night because they knew they knew they were genuinely understood. .
