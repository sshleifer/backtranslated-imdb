Christopher Lambert is annoyed and disappointed in GIDEON's portrait. This film was born in Lambert by Tom Forget, or Dustin Hoffman by Raymond Babbitt (RAIN MAN), or by Sean Penn Sam Dawson (I AM SAM). Because the story is significant to us, Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters have been a great help. 3 10.
