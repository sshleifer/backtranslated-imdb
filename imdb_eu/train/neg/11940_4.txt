Well, I could tell if Spiderman or Batman could easily oppose the movie. However, it was more attractive to me for moral value. When I first bought VHS, my son was about 2 years old and he soon became his favorite. My wife and I have been in favor of Robert Townsend and we've been using credit card to fund the first "Hollywood Shuffle" movie. True, it is necessary to take advantage of the talent and knowledge of technical advisors so that films can be more credible, but their films are still fun. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man has a hero who feels a sense of contemporary city. I have always felt that if the superhero were not the same scenes as comics. Meteor Man is a real problem, a real problem: in the car, a bad neighborhood, the distribution of local drug gangs, and so on. The scope of their mission was quite clear in the community. <br /> <br /> What did I do? James responded to the power of the newly discovered neighborhood, which was discovered outside the "eternal" outcome of James Earl Jones. He did not have a long time to complete his entire schedule, without any input, of course. They were frightened to listen to giving their families extended to other communities that lived. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot was weak, the movie was predictable, the performance was bad and the continuity was dying, but with my children # 1. Robert Townsend works to bring "home" movies to some extent. Certainly, they will admit that they are going to recognize themselves as a talented actor / producer / director, but there are always and will be those who love him for his efforts. <br /> <br /> Think about a point. The movie is funny: in the fight against Simon, nobody wants to call the police? Also, do you know what mother and father do you know that his son will fight for a window? My mother was there, excluded by my side, my toe. Father would load his gun. lol <br /> <br /> Rent and look. Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane's fans deserve more than once, and so on. Great work with Robert cameos Robert!
