First of all, I agree with a pinch of Mr. Chomsky's mouth. An interesting counterpoint is successful at a university circuit. It will find exciting, insolent and pragmatic. It does not respond to today's political style (unbelievable participation) and sets its left-hand direction, as well as the distance, both think and good reason. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie itself is wonderful. Actually, I would not call a documentary, but just a collection of lectures. Seeing "Rebel Without Pause" is no different than watching CSPAN's recorded segment at 3:00 a.m. No camera movement, no changes, no stylists. No story, no narrative. <br /> <br /> Technically speaking, production is strictly amateur. Audio is awesome; Sometimes we can not hear anything from Noam, at other times we can not listen to the questions they pose. When Noam rarely speaks, she allows us to see the reactions of the audience, when she watches her wives with pride and pride in all their beams, when we see each other quickly when we see a quick shot. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this film and I would say, in other words, to check in cassettes or CD recorded conversations to listen to the car. <br /> <br /> From 10 stars to 4 ... and Today is generous.
