Actually, I mean very seriously, when I began to see the show I thought it was good. The plot has deteriorated. The story was very annoying or predictable. George is not always fun, sometimes stupid. His jokes go far beyond that. His mother is a great spectacle. How can this mother be treated like this? If they were both mother-in-law, but this was her son. This show gives you 4/10 even though some of the first shows are fun. Actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha make a great job. I do not know how to play these shows for so long. <br /> <br /> If you're as frightened as you are and do not have to watch it, you should see this.
