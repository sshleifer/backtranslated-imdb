Oh, I think I could have been the only movie I've ever seen. I'm serious, this is one of the latest b-movies. The first proof is not $ 5 DVD. Oh no, that's why it's over. I got this in VHS, from a drawer full of ex-rental video in my exotic video store. <br /> <br /> If I could mention it earlier: "In the seventeenth century Japan, a samurai lived. Early on, it was called Mayeda and traveled all over the world to obtain an epic trip in Spain for 5,000 mushrooms. A stormy storm in the sea bought weapons and almost cherished gold comes to life, and Mayeda must fight the destiny of the beloved Japan. He then says "a millions of dollars action epic adventure across the three continents" <br /> <br /> I have to watch another movie. This was not epic, and there was definitely nothing of a million million dollars. No, "Shogun Mayeda" is just mad madness of the Mayeda talk (Sho Kosugi). It's not really a Shogun but it's not important. It is important that John Cleese repeats the burdens of a castle in "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", and reveals the ability of samurai to emerge from serious scenes. Awesome <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie is the sharp accent of Sho Kosugi. The movie is missing a good movie, but it never fails to solve one of the most beautiful lines, given the most fascinating accent ever made. Honestly, do you want something else? You can back "Shogun Mayeda" at the end and you can play the last line of Kosugs repeatedly. This ribbon is likely to be tired of that line. Awesome <br /> <br /> 2/10 - So very curious.
