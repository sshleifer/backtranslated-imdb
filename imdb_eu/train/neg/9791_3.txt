Basically, it is about a couple who want to take a second child. In the adoption agency they find a mouse (Stuart) and decide to take it. If you think that's a fool, keep it, because it's worse. <br /> <br /> Stuart returns to his home where he is treated as a child. (Rescued!) The rest is a regular topic, about family problems, the oldest "brother" is jealous and eventually solves all problems and "happy family." It is as boring and cumbersome as this, it is also shown in a dense and simplified way. <br /> <br /> I do not know that the director believes in introducing a mouse so that he is creatively creative. or he just wanted to fill in a few minutes, but he only renewed the clue and the bloody bloody. <br /> <br /> So why did I give him 3 and not a ZERO? For the family cat, who loves Stuart's "brother". And for some amusing accounts, where Stuart uses her small size. <br /> <br /> In general, I think the movie would work quite well: a. Stuart was a PET and not a "brother." b. He kept up with amusing accounts, as he tried to steal Stuart's cats, and left some boring topics that do not match other things.
