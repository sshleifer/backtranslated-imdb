The guy catches somehow. You will be shown live by shooting that other man himself. He has some bodyguards and he takes away the murderer, but a reporter is interested. He went to the hospital and took it that guy. He walks inside and has a bodyguard, but he does not want to talk. I do not know why. No one is interested. There is only one reporter. In any case, his editor starts this lame story. But he does it anyway. She sees the murderer's mother and mother. After a few minutes, they take a long time. Someone throws their trailer, a giant fire. He then looks for the hospital's body custodian. He finds hunger in his box, but a minute later he is sucking an underwater scuba diving on a boulder, trying to get rid of three guys (and the boat is spit on a large fire). The two men who are trying to kill the reporter and the body watchman. <br /> <br /> The next hour, another man crosses the street, some of them have rumors with a shoot, some cars waste and death, false suicides, etc. whirlwinds, carnivals. <br /> <br /> The great things, but the journalists and body guards can not imagine: why he considered the original. What is the motivation? Of course, we may know why the reporter is interested. Almost everything is the only story reporter. Nobody in any media. Not even great firefighters and dead. Actually, the original fonts were not a celebrity. His work was a bit dull. It was just the President. Yes, who lives in the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is an agent of Secrets of Service. <br /> <br /> Is that a spoiler? <br /> <br /> It should be. After all, there are no television cameras, other printers, no bloggers ... one of the most crime-killing police officers ... <br /> <br /> So what is a spoiler? <br /> <br /> Lemme think ... <br /> <br /> No! Wait! Spoiler has made his wife! Yes ... First. He was misled about the President. And he fled with him. Really strict, right? But what could hell be that? Why would you be responsible? In the end, he is also interested in a single reporter. <br /> <br /> I give this movement "1". I saw so dumb. And more demanding! That's really a spoiler! But I told you, you must believe that!
