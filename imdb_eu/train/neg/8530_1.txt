"Her Cardboard Lover" is the latest film by Norma Shear. He left the film and I think he joined the MGM Board of Directors. That was a good move. His "cartoon lover" was split up and boring. It was evident that there were not a few actors talking about, so they had to talk a lot about the turkey. <br /> <br /> It was a good idea of ​​the story that a man of a wealthy woman (Norma Shearer) contracted (Robert Taylor) to make jealous of her play (George Sanders) jealous. I'm surprised that the director George Cukor does not have Mrs. Shearer and Mr. Taylor cut a lot of seats. Mr. Cukor, Mrs. Shearer, provided her well in the "Women" section, but not in this film. <br /> <br /> The best performance of the film was given by Robert Taylor. During Taylor's career, he bestowed the roles of comedy in this movie and "When Ladies Meet" in 1941. In 1942, he gave his best comedy show "Her Cardboard Lover" and then his best dramatic performance. In "Johnny Eager". He had a busy year. I think of all MGM actors, Mr. Taylor has worked with the smallest and smallest actors. MGM also gave all kinds of films to Taylor - most of which were successful. That's why it has kept MGM 25 years old. <br /> <br /> Mr. George Sanders was very good as a social heel. Eight years later, he had a similar role in the movie "All About Eve", winning an Oscar as an assistant. Regarding Mrs. Shearer, this was one of her worst shows, this comedy was not fun and dramatic. It is strange to make a comedy "Women" in 1939, and gave her the best performance. It was clear that it was too old to be "his cardinals lover" in search of younger young men. Besides, she did not help her clothes look like it was horrible. <br /> <br /> It was very bad for Taylor and Mr. They did not make another dramatic movie like the latest movie, "Escape." Comments on this movie may be referred to by Taylor as a "Personal Property", made in 1937 by Jean Harlow. Talky was too, it was boring, and looked at an old actress. Mrs. Harlow had a bad look at the movie and said no one in Hollywood would go to the doctor, so that he was 26 years old at the age of 1937. He became a good actor and got better roles.
