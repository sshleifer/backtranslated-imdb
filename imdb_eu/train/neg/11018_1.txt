This video I bought a relatively inexpensive rental, thinking the cover was quite nice. And it was nice, but the movie is in the trash. I can handle B-grade. Sometimes I also enjoy the good of B (that is, the 'Nazi Surfing Must Die' is a classic example of the entertaining genre), but this was just a bland bland. The bizarre scenes were dramatically broken by cheap and good pornography and dreams of entertaining horror sequences. This film has very little deals.
