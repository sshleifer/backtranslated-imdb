I'm sorry to make the producers of this mess so much more painful and ridiculous than ever made in the West. The word "PAINFUL" is the best word to describe. <br /> <br /> Color photography and beautiful Rhonda Fleming and you speak well. My sympathy goes with Jacques Aubuchon (like the one who played the sick), he necessarily played an annoying role, because he was not writing that the actress could give him a pleasant performance. The production values ​​were very good; That's why there was a great story and screenplay. <br /> <br /> I hated things: Stewart Granger was as small as the western image, with a British accent, with elegant attire. his neck naked, his neck, always white. Citizens and their son, Granger, was constantly tired and insulted, and never responded or responded. I know that I interrupt credibility and suppose Western morals play me as a theater of morality, but it broke with the unrealistic and predictable reflection of writing, at the end it is worst that Granger overcomes it, sooner and later it will pass through the canyon, and Granger puts it in perfect spot so he can dynamize the distance from the distance, to create rock slides and cattle and bad to bury the guys, as they seem to be destroying them, save the two main wicked. The next worst is all about the plot, which is filled with the soap operas. The movie was not something incredible for me: I could not believe what the whole conflict was. The wicked guy led the way through the market and the cattle wanted to make some herbs on the way; I do not know why something could not be worked on. Do you need conflicting property for this purpose? Do not worry.
