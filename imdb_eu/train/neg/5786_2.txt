Now when you're listening and listening to all the language here, it's amazing that this was called "PG", but it's a system for you in the 70's. Peter Falk has forgotten the name of the Lord six times only in the first ten minutes of this film! However, there are few people considered offensive and, definitely, are not the people who make films, nor the people who "value" it. <br /> <br /> This is the mark of what can be the film: Falk, Peter Boyle. Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not "The Sound Of Music." Do not have actors in the section. <br /> <br /> <br /> Heist films and directors like me a lot of movies. William Friedkin, but this script does not deliver and "Sleazy in the 70's" feels too much, visually and audibly. For those who love "Columbo" for Falk television, it's a great deal of excitement to use it as briefly as he could hear. That is not the only case.
