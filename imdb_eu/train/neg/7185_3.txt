I was watching this movie because I was watching this movie and watching horror. <br /> <br /> For my despair, comedy became more than horror. The film's performance, dialogue and flow made it very bad. It makes no sense. For example, it's about a party of around 30 people and people are terrified of being in a secret location, because all young adults and healthy adults threaten to laugh. I continued to think, maybe it was a parody of a movie like Scary Movie, but they tried hard to make it look great - highlighting the essay. <br /> <br /> Blood and gore are also wrong. I have seen Halloween costumes more believable than this. A man who had been cut off by his head cleared it: signs, flesh, blood, and head were empty. There should be something to come down in a body with a sharp downward stomach ... it seems that the types of sticks seem to be sticking around with an ax. <br /> <br /> Which main master was supposed to be plaited? , but contradict the other parts of the story. What happened to the man to get out of this way? If there were a tour, you should have at least one building, adding mystery and suspense.
