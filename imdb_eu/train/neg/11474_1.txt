This relic of a short film starts with a young man trying to get a driver's license. It becomes quick in all matters related to cars. Foreign buggies, drag races, personalized paintings and auto shows are discussed. He often tries to be humorous, but the film is dull, sometimes drawn and even sexist. Not everyone in the movie listens. However, everything is in narration and in voices. Sorry, I can not accept that. <br /> <br /> Nothing educator or interesting "Father, can I not borrow a mail car?" "Wonderful Disney" is another time in the television show. 1/10
