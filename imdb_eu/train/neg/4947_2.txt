Dieter Bohlen, a famous German composer and a well-known producer of "Pop Heart, You're my own soul," felt the need to tell his story - and he decided to hire a writer of passion. The result was a fun book about his life. Well, more or less a blurry of his. He did not deny that he was a kidney kidney, but the whole story was full of self-image. Without a doubt, he beat his ex-wife and ended the hospital. However, it was written in a fun style and was very successful as a member of the "American Idol" (jury version) jury, especially unforgettable comments. <br /> <br /> It should be the end of this story - really. According to the television series "" Idol "" called "Deutschland sucht den Superstar", someone has had a great idea to make a book. The result is "Dieter - Film". <br /> <br /> I have rarely seen such a movie that wants to be so fun and fails so completely. A gag does not make a point. The voices and conversations of Naddel, I immediately had nerves, even if Verona's voice was made. Gag clearly shows babies, predictions and lengths, destroying motivation in a few minutes to watch this movie. The movie's content is a sloppy sloppy adaptation of a ghostwriter based on an incorrect idealized memory by Bohlen. This freedom can be used to do almost everything. They thought it was a satire, but they failed. The story is very uninteresting and the voice of the bottom Bohl himself assures that the whole film is not satirical. <br /> <br /> It's not surprising that it was considered bad for a movie publishing. In some archives the probability of rotating this thing was quite high until recently when DSDS was successful. The "BILD" with the help of the "bigger" German bigger press and the desperate state program for RTL TV is still perfect "Wetten dass ...?" Channel 2 is finally running on the TV - sadly. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a waste of time - no doubt, there are better cartoons, much more fun and worth a story. /> <br /> So: 2/10
