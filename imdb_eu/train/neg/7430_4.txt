It is interesting to see Pierce Brosnan's career before reaching Bond's stage. In this "circuit" thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays Patrick's smooth, leading ghetto kids "trust courses". A woman highlights the fact that she is one of the girls in the mid-nineties, the flagship of the nineties, in the mid-90s. His wife's husbands will be drunk soon and she starts seating with Pierce. <br /> <br /> At one point Pierce makes "vegeburgers" innocent. The husband enters. Pierce makes vegeburgers. Then the husband attacks Pierce. Little pieces of veggaged wounded half-eaten fall into Pierce's mouth. The battle suddenly ends without showing the result. It's as good as this movie gets. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
