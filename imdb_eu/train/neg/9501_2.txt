This is the page "House of Exorcism", but most people have mixed up this movie with Mario Bava's "Lisa & the Devil" masterpiece, that is, the "exorcism's home" high score. At the beginning of the 70's, "Lisa & the Devil" was shown at the festivals, the success was critical. The viewers responded well to this beautiful Gothic horror film. Unfortunately, it took some time to go, and it was not very common, and not just commercial. Distributor should not buy. For this reason, he decided to publish the producer "Lisa", Alfredo Leone, apparently with a chainsaw; He almost eliminated half the original movie and shot two more, after shooting for two years after the original product! It is important to bear in mind that Bava has nothing to do with such horrible versions; So technically "House Exorcism" is not a Bava movie. The original product is slow, dreamy and stylish. For a few minutes in the movie, the viewer dreams of being out of this world. Suddenly, we see Lisa (two years older and very old hair cut) starting on the ground, making guttural sounds and crisp epitafus. "suck my cooperation", etc. subtle, right? And the movie continues like this, jumping and forth between a beautiful feature film and an off-off "Exorcist" Z. Leone was trying to break into these scenes, keeping the story intact. It failed When the selection was made to destroy "Lisa and the devil", Bava refused to say that he was very nice to cut his film. He was right, and he must be very sad that the artist destroyed all his work and washed it in the bathroom. A lot of years went by when he saw the original "Lisa and the Devil" again, the night-time television resurrection. I saw "Lisa" much earlier than I saw this new version, and it was very worrying to see one of my favorite movies. It is only for the sake of curiosity. Otherwise, to avoid this malicious catastrophe such as plague.
