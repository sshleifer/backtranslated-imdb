Well, I must admit that this was one of my favorites, when I saw myself as a super-8 coil in the home projector. Nowadays, it is not recommended much more than the external value of actors 'horrified' replicas of human redhead. Special effects are quite absurd, especially with skulls with wires and "ghost" images. <br /> <br /> But something must be said about the sets. Does the palatial mansion happen to be terribly awesome, especially since there is no treasure (probably because of budget reasons?). <br /> <br /> It inspires more and more cries than cries. Simply, try not to overwhelm your wife wife (much more than a screaming quota) when entering the greenhouse and facing the ghost of her first husband.
