Over the years I looked at the Wrestleman's match card, so I did not control myself and I was full of excitement. <br /> <br /> Start and end. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting there, because I wanted to get the money back to hell. I mean that if you watch Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites), you'll get the same as the classic one, and you'll get the same amount of waste from time to time. It ruined me when it was released by HBK at the show! At the same time, HBK lost with JOHN CENA !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is a loser / poser. I almost ruined Wrestlemania when he beat TRIPLE H! I have not watched WWE on Wrestlemania 23. I see it again and again (fortunately). Wrestlemania was just a classic after Wrestlemania after 24 WWE I believe again after Wrestlemania 24. Certainly, it was a 'Mania 23' and a memorable moment. <br /> <br /> Like Wrestleman, who has become a hobby (Wrestlemania 20 turned on) if you have seen one of Wrestlemanias. In a fan, please ignore this and I made the same mistake and leave behind the WWE. And if you see it and get angry, you'll see it again and see Wrestlemania 24, it's totally classical.
