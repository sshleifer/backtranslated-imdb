I'm trying to decide everything right now, the worst film ever I've ever seen - this movie is a very worrying problem if true scientists interview, but their footage is edited if they accept ideas ideas. Many BSs that populate this movie. The rate of conversations The BS signal is ten thousand, in the end it seems that the interviewees say: "We want nonsense", but they are also lazy to investigate things they claim. as an act. <br /> <br /> If you feel open and want to spread your awareness, it will be enough to read some books about quantum theory: "Einstein's Universe", by Nigel Calder (Heinz Pagels, "The Cosmic Code"), volume light, not a challenge If you are not able to read a book, do not complain about being "open" to writers. <br /> <br /> Summary, this film is very compelling. <br /> </ p> What is a good movie that challenges the nature of reality? "Thirteenth floor", directed by Roland Emmerich, with Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio. Smart, sexy, thought.
