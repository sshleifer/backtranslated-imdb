Well, what was fun ... except for fun. <br /> <br /> My second favorite is up to now, although I thought it's worse than "Lazarus" and "Ghost in the Machine". <Br> /> <br /> Start with good. The suggestion was very well made and emotional. I am an excellent animal lover, it was very fun to see so much beautiful animal in this episode. <br /> <br /> But then it's bad, and believe me there is a lot. Was it so sensible, therefore, that the foreigners abducted the animals and did not give them up? whaaa ??? The conversation was quite horrible. The line was one or two quotes. <br /> <br /> And the worst, all the animals were almost completely unpleasant. In the end ... what is it? Everyone was killed. We did not learn anything, we were not entertained, and I could not find Sophia's sad death ... it's just very frustrating. <br /> <br /> * star. It was a shame that season 2 was doing well.
