Richard Dreyfus is not here a star. There are about 20 second cameos and what does Gene Barry do about this movie? I do not know, probably, that the director was a brother! It's a movie that's not meaningless. Inappropriate writers / conductors (the same guy), the talent of everyone was horrible. I got a cent to DVD, so I can not complain! But it's strange! And you make a terrible feeling and not in a good way. It was in the 70's and the director came up with a bad acid on a trip and would like everyone to feel the way they felt. The concept is quite interesting and polemical, but as a record that has been violated, it soon lacks. It has an "acid family Manson". <br /> <br /> I do not know how to get the other reviewer from everything from this movie? Maybe they worked back? In any case, be prepared to never lose more than 80+ minutes of your life. Yes, that's awesome!
