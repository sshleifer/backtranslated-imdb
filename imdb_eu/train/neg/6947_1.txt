Undoubtedly, the worst movie I have ever seen in recent years. The stories stole four women who stole banks, somehow liked the pity. It's hard to sympathize with the folks who continue to make stupid decisions. Oh, no, the police are with us, we know who we are, what we do ... we rob a bank, and we'll go out! What !? Each character is a stereotype and knowing that it will be finally dead.
