Battling scenes are like slow-motion Jackie Chan, and experiments are pathetic (it's now the biggest punishment: "Guess what? I've heard this time"). The stars are pairs of partners: Brandon Lee, despite the huge lines that must be mentioned, really shows signs of charisma and screen charm - completely free of Dolph Lundg (that is, at least in this movie). Note to the director: in the future, please be love scenes, especially your main actor will not nudity and you have to be confident in double body. (* 1/2)
