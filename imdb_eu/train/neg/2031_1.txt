That William Shater always seems to smile to me, (and especially Denny Crane as Boston Law), this show is about dance and dance for girls and jumping up and down. <Br /> <br /> The mind of the millionaire is not in any Deal or No Deal. <br /> <br /> This show shows the dancing and stupid things to be done all the time. > <br /> I saw it obviously. I saw it in more than 45 minutes and then I had to turn it off. <br /> <br /> William Shatner was the best dancer on stage. It's Hoot! unfortunately, this show is not made. <br /> <br /> That's it
