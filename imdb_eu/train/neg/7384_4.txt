STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is assigned to a French recognition mission. together with the newly recruited three strike groups, after disobeying a direct injunction. However, during the night that they should strike, the killers are murderers, seemingly embarrassed. With the French police dumminged alongside his research, he is looking for himself, only to find a troubling factor that militates the deadly drug that changes a new person, that is, someone is changing DNA and frightening new force. > <br /> Bad coverage. Bad title Incorrect postproduction. Bad trailer Bad movie But, I must say, I do not think that Attack Force is strong. I know most of the reviewers here have no known (but not Steveday!), But I believe that many criticisms are bad news before the movie and its true quality. <br /> I should say that there was no duplication or any edit, as I have believed. There were no duplications (Martin Sheen sounded like a bullshit)! It was very awful and it was quite common, but it was not as big as the movie segment I used to think. The plot was quite smooth, even when the original film "Harvester" was finished. As another reviewer has pointed out, the film has a Gothic look, a new touch for a sea movie. <br /> <br /> The ultimate low killer, exciting action, was a complete and complete foul. Without just off-the-scenes fight scenes. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest, however, I should again see Fur of Flight, Today You Die or Kill for a Kill. **
