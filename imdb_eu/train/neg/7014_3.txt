What waste! This movie could really be something decent, but writing is mostly empty, and the main characters are pretty skinny and interesting. Mike Meyers was good, and the historical description of the late 70's was fine, but overall, the movie lost a lot of time. Instead, it's great to watch movies with similar themes and the same basic time frame as the great BOOGIE NIGHTS.
