A few days ago I saw a documentary called THE FIFTY WORST MOVIES OF TIME ALL all year long and that's where I heard THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN. Apart from being a lover of the film Schlocky, I try to find some of the documentary films. NOT INCLUDING THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN. Actually, the first bad film I've ever seen is "MELTING MAN" and I have to say it's a disappointment. Although it's a bad movie, it's not in any way getting close to that list. <br /> <br /> Before I watched the documentary, I enjoyed the "bad movies" from the book "since I read it." Fewer fifty movies of all time "by Harry Medved. Although the title is the same, the book came out long since the documentary and the Medved documentary did not have the concept. From the Medved book, I have watched over 35 of the 50 films, but I've got an impasse - no other movies they had it available on VHS or DVD, so I thought I would try the same movie. <br /> <br /> THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN was disappointed that there were good movie components. First of all, the special melted effects were incredibly fresh and bad It is clear that a professional (the famous Rich Baker) was to make a realistic look, but I would also point out that there were more than a few cheap and nervous effects - for example, hiding a plastic floating head and a monstrous hiding around the building. under the clothes! "As for the story, it's just a fool. A group of astronauts, miraculously, they enter Saturn's rings without crushing them. Next, they say the sun is beautiful, because we see the roots of it. It's funny because Saturn is so far away - it does NOT look like that - it should be a great deal. However, we immediately say that the scene changes and we are talking about the surviving astronauts hospital. What happened to the last scene and between it? Yes, nobody thinks it. Afterwards, he survives and escapes and melts all his body. <br /> <br /> <br /> Now you think you look like a pituitary that melts a psychologist. Try to find and stop all stops, right? Wrong A general leads one teacher to find him! No army, no policeman, is just a doctor. Even if the body starts to accumulate, the doctor or general does not do anything to make a significant search or back up. <br /> <br /> Now, as a result of the stupidity of the film, you should not be surprised to find the following: <br /> <br /> When it comes to getting sick, the doctor will give him a strong sedation and leave him at home. <br /> <br /> An old couple is driving late at night, they remain in a natural fruit, pick fruit and die. <br /> <br /> If the woman sees a dune, she protects the door to protect herself. This would be smart, if it had no back door next to the house! She only waits for her to leave home and escape. <br /> <br /> When a photographer and his model take pictures, the guy ties his assistant and connects them to the top. Why? Well, let the audience give them a cheap emotion and give R flick a title. <br /> <br /> Finally, when the dude is in the fusion and the sheriff has a clear shot, the doctor stops it - although nowadays the monsters killed about a dozen and a half. <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, it has many stupid movie elements. It's a very bad movie. However, as it was occasionally a special effect, I was not expecting a horrible film. Surely, it's a laugh, but there's no malicious space out of PLAN 9 and nobody would ever come into the cinema.
