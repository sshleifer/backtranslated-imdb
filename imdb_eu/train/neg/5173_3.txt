When I saw it in a store, I thought it was very good and original. Like Wolfs Creek, it is a type of Texas-type massacre that means that it will cost only three quotas (about $ 6). To be honest, I do not think that's worth it. <br /> <br /> It seems that "butchers' brothers" could not decide whether to make a horror art or slasher penetrating. horror Half-timed and fifteen minutes were the characters that were exchanged for a single dimension, and they did not care less for those who did not care, but the effort to keep the audience looking at the characters eventually added a monologue to the end. and the beginning of the film of being honest was not necessary. <br /> <br /> I did not really break the good part of the base. But that was the only part of "good". <br /> <br /> In general, a nonsense clock. It felt like a two-hour movie, but it was just 75 minutes. If you want artificial film, do not worry. If you want a Slasher movie - do not worry - the movie moves so slowly that nothing happens.
