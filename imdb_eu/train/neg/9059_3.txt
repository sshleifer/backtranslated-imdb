I will be just about my fraudulent comments. The plots that can be conserved in this movie are just pre-ruined. <br /> <br /> This movie extracts some ideas from a classic South, To Kill A mockingbird. I think maybe the TKOM has got some ideas for some sources ... However, after seeing this, you will say, "Oh, that's a ripoff." <br /> <br /> I truly think that the fun thing about these McMovies after identifying the item of a plot afterwards is whether or not they stick with the original, or try to rotate it. This is not a rhythm.
