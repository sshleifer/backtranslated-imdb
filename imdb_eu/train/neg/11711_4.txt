A good movie, with a good headmaster, but a wonderful man. Stephan Jenkins, husband, is a really bad actor. On the other hand, Joyce Hyser is the saving of the film. It's the best actress of the series. <br /> <br /> The first comment to the WARNING * movie (and, according to IMDB.com, wrote an ONE review - and invented the movie?), of course, is a plant. While the movie is filming well, it's not at all fine or great, or any other hypobolic describing descriptions. <br /> <br /> "Art Vicegas" is a fair movie, but it's very hard. It offers all sorts of sexual situations, but it never happens. It's like watching Skinx's Skin Flick, but "bit bits" have been released. <br /> <br /> The movie, in general, is somewhat disrupted and ends, and the third part of the third event, that is. really a mess. Obviously, we all seem to have to finish the tour of all films today. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10 <br /> <br /> <br />
