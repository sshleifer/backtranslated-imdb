Nobody goes like a movie, such as The Hills Have Eyes 2 and Citizen Kane is expected to come second. The same is true of most of the movie stars of low-wage horror, especially Roger Ebert's "Dead Teenager Movies". The Hills Have Eyes 2 is definitely named Dead Teenager Movie, here alone, teenagers have looked like a military trainee. <br /> <br /> Some will argue that "it's just a movie" when the lines are questioned. They are created in a movie review, but I always believe that all fantasy fantasies must be rooted in reality to be effective. In The Hills Have Eyes 2, we believe that the principal characters in a training exercise are military, but they look and speak in the desert for upper school children. The conversation is horrible and is often overwhelming. Although the films are hardly comparable, I continued to be "Platoon" and "sharpened" by the soldiers. <br /> <br /> Very little about the characters remembering rifles and unhealthy soldiers: radio transmissions are made in adolescents telephone conversations; Colonel addresses a private "hey, asshole". And no one has any idea what to do or what makes sense of command structure when things go wrong. I think of James Cameron's Aliens soldiers, a fantasy movie, and how these futuristic marines were true soldiers as well as their fantastic situations. Real fantasy in reality. <br /> <br /> I'm watching the movie on the 5th, 10th scale, from where the strengths and weaknesses go. Concessions must be granted to the material; Star Wars is not as good as the movie like The Godfather. But both are excellent examples of these types. <br /> <br /> In this sense, Hills Have Eyes 2 is a great exercise for amateurs and immature, but only worse than the typical Dead Teenager. Movie In the technical aspect, the film seems to be a productive value, and this view is quite well done. The purpose of expelling or the purpose of remembering urgently or suspecting is generally in operation. So while watching The Hills Have Eyes 2, worse than death, horror films are much worse in circulation. <br /> <br /> A note worthy of those who enjoy such things. The usual fanboy luggage, or those that do not see, is the best ever or worst. If you are not afraid, especially the Dead Teenager variety, you will not have fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
