I watched this movie in the Soviet Union and released the erotic scenes from the census committee. In 2000, I saw it all over Poland. And what? The land is very wise - 2 men are survivors of genetic disaster and women are powerful, straightforward and serious. Men are trying to fight now and then follow the whole range of rare topics - the sex drive, the constant desire for masculine sex, feminists who show themselves as stupidity (you can agree with them or not, but the idiots are not sure), and so on. Jerzy Stuhr is also starring in stars and is surprisingly worse: he frees his faces and repeats when he says: "I'm on the lift with a nude chick and I did not do anything!" But he wanted to be a comedy, it was a horrible panic of rumors, with the jokes he had anticipated and the bells of the lower half. Do not miss this time - this is bad.
