In First Howling, we are entering a world that is rough and inorganic. The plot of this movie was meaningless; A TV journalist is investigating and wants to clarify the truth. He will kill many of them, who becomes his boyfriend. Afterwards, he shows that there are still some television live broadcasts in the world. In the first film, special effects were eager and they did not get any better. They are bad graphics that show transformations or bad puppets or superpowers. <br /> <br /> The plot line is not so bad; The boss of nonsense must die for some reason. This does not destroy all the rude men and really does not end the endings of the men's men ... they just want to kill him. I think that the reason was faded, but the movie really is lost. <br /> <br /> We only saw a 10-minute video, "just after we've finished watching" the movies, and it's just another scene where the female males head rattles off while revealing their big breasts, a Devo-esquire team It plays for people like rough people. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is still visible on this movie is Christopher Lee.
