I've seen all the parts of this spin off. The first season was a decent effort considering the success of the success of Gray's Anatomy. I keep that way. I am afraid of charm, chemistry and, more importantly, theatrical drama of the Gray's Anatomy season. Relationships arise and theater is so. The script does not touch the intelligence and comedy seen on GA. There is a formulaic but does not feel formulaic and artificial, unfortunately PP is not so. I loved Kate Walsh's presence at GA. I'm afraid the life of Kate Walsh's LA is not interesting.
