Unfortunately, realism is boring. I thought this movie was about to end, it would be better if all the characters were in the first five minutes. Where's the Blade you need? Although COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM DREAM and BOISE MOI are just as beautiful as the nightmare, DEAD CREATURES is not as entertaining as the first cunning movies mentioned. Free cannibalisms Jeffery Dalmers would heart be heartier, but RAVENOUS was not as interesting. Actually, I found it as interesting as night-time innovations, as exciting as the trip to the dentist. If you reinforce the masochistic features, you can suffer it, otherwise, for anyone. I was surprised that the people of Brain Damage did not do it, it was the quality of the dead creatures.
