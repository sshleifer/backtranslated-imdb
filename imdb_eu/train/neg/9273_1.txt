After seeing this rubbish, the first question we have asked is: Who can give the ground on behalf of those idiots the right to use the name of Omen? It's a shame and embarrassment to take the courage to take the courage. When the movie starts, it seems that the music slider that directly raised Bugs Bunny Cartoon sounds like, since then the movie is worse! I do not know who wrote the script, but I bet they got E - that's why they returned to show the teacher! It's a bit of a bit complicated for me to say that it's a comedy, what's wrong with what it's so funny and so kind to do with Omen. The effect is not horny, especially from Miss Ms. Faye Grant. Has he started drawing crazy faces or is it difficult to laugh? It's hard to tell. The worst sequel I have ever witnessed in adversity. From 10 onwards
