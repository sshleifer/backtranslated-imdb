This was not to be seen. I bought this DVD and I was hard pressed under the movie and I turned it off for a moment. <br /> <br /> I did not like it here: <br /> <br /> 1 They were shooting. Dad <br /> <br /> 2 Tribes were very annoying <br /> <br /> 3 lied (especially) dinosaurs <br /> <br /> <br /> 4 The bad scientist really disgusted. <br /> <br /> 5 The image quality of the DVD was very bad <br /> <br /> What I liked: <br /> <br /> 1 Jerry Goldsmith's music. This music is very big. I have the soundtrack for this movie. Unfortunately, the sound quality is not good, but its time is fine. <br /> <br /> 2 We'll see for the first time that dinosaurs create a sting. <br /> <br /> 3 The baby is nice when it's cute and it's playing <br /> <br /> 4 A fun scene with a tent. <br /> <br /> Children who see this movie happily learn that evil is always lost.
