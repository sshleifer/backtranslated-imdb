"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is just a bad movie; He has no heart, no deep idea, nothing special. Yes, CGI's interesting origins are interesting, but all this results in a soft and annoying focus. Additionally, the movie uses music, such as "Gilligan's Island" or the cartoonist Scooby-Doo: it's NEVER STOP. Terrible, simply horrible. There are no fresh ideas, duplicators, and even fragments of older movies from older movies. There is no door driver, it seems that the movie only exists. Save your money and your time. It's not entertaining
