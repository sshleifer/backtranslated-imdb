I recently saw Manufactured Landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival. As a photographer he was attracted to me, but I'm famous and I'm a fan of Burtynsky's work. I think the movie works so well that the message is being sent, but I could not feel that Burtynsky's picture and the whole book was a reflection. Of course, one reason is that there are still a wide range of zoom and pail photos. Even though the economically-used effect is good, 75% of the film felt that they only had books from Burtynsky's book (I still know). This is probably an abuse, but I felt that way. If you are the owner of the book or know your work, you can get the most out of it.
