I watched this movie and the other. The Trinity is my name and this is worse than the first one. I do not know why they made another movie, they said they were all stupid and useless feelings. Sometimes I sat and I would still play for 5 minutes. I like Terence Hill and I like Bud Spencer, but this movie pulled me over the wall. If you could have had another story or at least one plot and more comedies, it's possible to estimate 5 dollars that I've bought and spent five movies. But you make mistakes to save money and do not save me or that movie.
