Dr. Hackenstein is able to bring his sponge cake again, confirming that he has regained the life of the dead ... Three years later, "Dean Slesinger (Michael Ensign)" is a dinner party. Dean Slesinger and Dr. Dr. Hackenstein talks about Dean Slesinger's experiments that have always been the case, Dr Hackenstein's Dean Slesinger Laboratory at her attic shows Sheila's wife's boss Sylvia Lee Baker. In an unhappy "accident" and telepathically speaking (apparently, Christy Botkin Sheila's voice appears). Dr. Hackenstein also reveals that Dean Slesinger has a chicken hanging in a cage and explains how Sheila will resume her process. The dean has a crisis and apparently kills him. In the meantime, her sisters are driving alongside Wendy (Bambi Darro Dyanne DiRossario) and Leslie Trilling (Catherine Davis Cox) and her brother Alex (John Alexis) and her cousin Melanie Victor (Stacey Travis) near Hackenstein's house, when they crash, seek shelter and help They have it. and reach Hackenstein's door.

Dr Hackenstein decides to be a terrific decision that he has not missed the possibility of having a good three young beautiful specimens and "n" pieces begin to borrow "Sheila" ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Richard Written and directed by Clark. Dr. Hackenstein was surprised. Right now I will explain that the fascination of the imagination is not, but I really liked it. It moves at a reasonable pace even though it is slightly dragged in half while things are in the middle. Script tries to crawl the mixed slapstick humor, trying to adhere to Melanie Melvin's Hackenstein, trying to make Yolanda Simpson (Catherine Cahn) care for her wizard, and apparently will not forget Yolanda's back. to know what is happening, but I would say that Dr. Hackenstein is more than a comedy rather than conception and feeling. There are some toys and sexual withdrawals, which are always laughable, as Dr. Hackenstein as an example of Wendy's "see my tools". Likewise, Trilling (Phyllis Diller) thought of the scene that tells Olin (William Schreiner) the lost daughter of the evil detective. The circle was exciting because the sequence was quite fun. He said why the cell has no prisoner and does not worry about finding a cousin. There is no laughing anywhere, but I must admit that I feel at some time smiling and that this film was so complete that it was so fun. There is not a lot of gore on the screen, a few branches, shaved Sheila's, some healthy ones and those fake paths. Dr. Hackenstein also liked the characters, because he was surprised. The operation is not excellent, but everyone has made an effort to make credit, it means that there is a lot of excessive emotional movements and serious abuses, and Dr. Hackenstein is the best of three birds. Technically, too, the movie is fine. Once again, he has not won the Oscars, but I have to give it to at least filmmakers trying to get a century-old setting. It does not always work; clothes are often unfriendly; Girls look like they were from England, while boys seem to be in the West. Like all home cinema filmmakers, it seems like they can take away the modern picture of the room and some candles! It's a bit hard to find, but it's really not a bad movie, considering it. It could be made without musical comedy. In general, I enjoyed much more than I thought Dr. Hackenstein would have liked, although that is not a recommendation. Without a doubt, it has never been the best comedy horror movie, and definitely not the worst. Enjoyable quality piece of work.
