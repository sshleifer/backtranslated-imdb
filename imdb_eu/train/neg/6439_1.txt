Honestly, this is the worst film I've ever seen 5 first. Being part of it, because it takes it so seriously, because it takes on regular regular regular trash movies, you want to be emotionally involved, to feel the characters and preserve the supposed conspiracy. That never happens. <br /> <br /> **** GELDIA MILD ****** <br /> <br /> There are three main reasons why this movie is very awesome: 1.) Incoherent and totally unpopular land -consciously 2.) Style-annoying substances "MTV" camera works. 3.) Marathon morons and line holes. <br /> <br /> Leave me to practice. <br /> <br /> 1.) It seems that, when they were doing these films, they could not decide to do it. story about the conspiracy, stigmata or ownership of the church. So what did you guess? They were combined! A dead man always knew the break-up to show the church's conspiracy. He never explains, nor even discusses, how ordinary people are able to overcome death and how another human being is through his rosary. Now, instead of saying what he means, he gives them stigmas. Why? Why does not it spit? Instead, we analyze screaming voices, cryptic messages, scrolls, and messages on the walls. Apparently, this priest was a violent man, because the young people, who had been dressed in the game, also dressed in characters, talked with that "voice" and "possessed" voice, that we had heard many times. This begins to connect with my second complaint, because when young people get stigmatized, gravity laws allow them to enter into the air and take away everything that is on the ground and their surroundings. Why is this happening? Who knows!?! I think the director seemed "cool". 2.) This film has a series of shots, slow movement, of course, birds that are born from nowhere and fly and, more annoyingly, the drip of water. The apartment of this woman always breaks the water! TOGETHER! Logically, the place would probably fail with many holes. By summarizing this complaint, and without a reason, the camera cuts off rugged water, at a stroke, vice versa! Why!?! I do not know! It does not matter anymore, and I bet that the director thinks it's "fresh". <br /> <br /> 3. He explained that one of the leading figures has become a priest. holes in science This does not make sense for me. I think it would be enough for me to go to church, but not for everything that comes to being a priest. I do not buy Second, there are lots of plots, some of which I will explain. For beginners, getting stigmata first, the scene ends with the unconscious ending, bleeding. Then he is in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? Another is when the aforementioned "scientific priest" talks about the spirit of the girl's owner. He said: "Take me as your messenger!" There is no word to say, but you get the idea. His answer? "You have no faith, no doubt!" So, therefore, there is an ethology! An aitheist has no belief, much less a scientific priest! And then, the purpose of the conspiracy of this movie is available in bookstores, Gospel Garaia (San Tom√°s, I think). The characters are ready to kill you to get rid of this document, but you can go and buy it at a bookstore. Maybe this is supposed to happen in a spare history, where it is not very popular, but the film never tries to explain this or insist on the occurrence of that document. <br /> </ p> <p> Finally, the movie is terribly terrific. It's my arch-Nemesis, I feel the need for all the opportunities I have achieved. I hate. Last grade: F
