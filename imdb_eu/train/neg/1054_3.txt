The drama of the rural family corresponds to a young boy with "brave people" - who is attacking his old brother. Despite the flexible issues on the subject (director Christopher Cain had been mistreated), there are some dynamics in this sad story worthy of exploring. Unfortunately, the adolescent of adult-minded people with an environment of agriculture and the film makes a rough experience. With Robert Duvall, along with Glenn Close and Wilford Brimley, the movie is almost a small meeting for "The Natural". It was a shame that this project did not make the talents needed behind the camera to be a memorable and memorable image. * 1/2 ****
