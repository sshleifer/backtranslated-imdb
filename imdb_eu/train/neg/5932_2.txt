What does a documentary about a musician fail to incorporate the artist into a single track? Unlike "Ray" or unlike other music-related films, half of the theater's (or soffit) fun revival plays. Here, all the tracks are not the characters of the characters that are interesting, and these interpretations remain in Cohen's jazz style. More often, covers are popularly-sung folk versions. Yuck <br /> <br /> The interviews are made with other musicians and images, than Cohen himself. Approximately, the movie Cohen reads his work (he never sings) - letters, poems, etc. Like movies He did not really capture the story of the artist's life, or over the years his development. Great despair for Cohen fan.
