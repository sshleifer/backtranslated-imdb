I was very excited about this movie and, therefore, I saw a lot of hope; Basically because it is Kamal Hassan. He is an amazing actress who has stepped foot on his feet forever. But this movie proved to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. After seeing this, orange and black watermelon is much better than wildness and violence. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, Raghavan, is a very courageous policeman. Who is investigating the brutal murder series? They encounter a thread that effectively connects in this case, and they can be killed and psychoanalysts will place two psychologically disturbed but radiant medical students behind bars, but they escape and die again. He eventually murders Raghavan after both innocent lives. <br /> <br /> Two psycho killers are the audience to go to the theater. Murder, sexual harassment and violence are explained in a very explicit way, as the film could last. <br /> <br /> Teenagers and children are not even imagined to watch this movie on the theater and imagine what they are to be painted in their head. Director Gautham should also realize that he has a certain duty to society and his audiences. Certainly, I will never go to the cinema with the name of the production list of Gautham.
