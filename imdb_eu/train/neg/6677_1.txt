After reading the first 5 reviews on the IMDb, I was very pleased about this movie. It's a really awesome movie, the total amount of time you watch for a foreigner is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is a suspense that is cheap), the story is the best in the story, oh boy, what's the story? <br /> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> they caught him?). Then the girlfriend, who is acting on the top, wants to keep away from this guilt, and then he suddenly did not, and then he did it again and then he did not. Afterwards, they concluded that killing foreigners would kill the entire human race (and remember, not all of those years live in definitely foreigners) and what do they do? They torture and blow up a series of aliens. <br /> <br /> This is my first review on the IMDb, I am not lazy at the time of writing, so I heard my warning: this movement is not worth your time, do not watch the movie.
