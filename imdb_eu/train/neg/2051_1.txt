There is nothing wrong with acting, etc. The section entry is far from the ghosts or ghosts of this series. A waste of 42 minutes was to see the Martian man hunter. You should know that what happens in the mid-6 series is not true and it brings nothing to the series story if the martian hunter joins again and does not waste about 30 minutes. Far too badly written on the television of Smallville. I really like the show, but especially for castles and good 3 episodes of each year, those who work or work in these soaps need canned foods. That is far, the worst. In the first four minutes you know what's wrong, and in the event Clark is a dream-based incident, it is caused by a horrible character, and when he wakes up and does not have Blah Blah Blah writers. It is enough to create a criminal who will carry out this story. He will also add another criminals when he was hunted by the March man who will be killed during the last episode, and he will come back again or come back and Clark has forgotten his sunglasses in this section and was called one day.
