I respect this very well-known conception. However, Robert Altman's simplicity, ridiculous and innovative aspect of the classic 1970s, was probably not roughly aimed at this show ... Although it lasted 11 years, this is not necessarily the case. any good This show was a very complete part of my childhood (every night it was run again and what parents saw and laughed), but I do not remember one. And now I've seen the movie, I can give a detailed critique of this series. Only, there is not much "2 to 10" bad. However, the characters in this show are not similar to the movie. Some of them are technically identical, but similar to the same name. For example, when Alan Alda is something like Donald Sutherland? His humor is completely different, as well as his characterization and vision. New characters are not very exquisite; You will lose those that are substitutes. The same is true with new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only one to be transferred to the series is Radar (although it still plays the same actor), it's just a pale imitation of the original. What else? Yes Yes. With a laugh (it did not matter if surgery was used in the scene), it's great to see what happens in other settings. It lasted four times as much as the Korean war, it takes a temporary rift that works outside the cartoon world. I have never liked this show, and I will never be.
