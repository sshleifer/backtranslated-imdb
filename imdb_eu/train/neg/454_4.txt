Generally, a powerful movie and a clear dialogue with songs by Dean Martin. The problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between Cher and her, and they are the main love story. Cher almost responds to Cee's changing accents and uncontrollable body language reactions. Cag never consolidates its role. He tries everything he thinks, and only finds himself as a actress as a reality, and this is necessary in a love story. Cage assumes that Jimmy Stewart's character has more features that need more. Cage continues to play roles, maybe he likes to like them, but his energy as an actress is not in their hands, but has been improved by repeated attempts. This type of role would have promised to be interesting films with less actors, and would give him more roles and films that could have spent a lot of energy and talent.
