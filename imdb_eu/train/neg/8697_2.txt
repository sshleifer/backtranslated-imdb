Carnosaur 3: Primal Species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terri J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why worry this movie? Another stupid dinosaur movie where military secrets find dead people who are dying of prehistoric people who are dying of dead secrets (and full looks). The original was bad enough, the battle was even worse. That is to say, although it is not related to one of the previous films of CARNOSAUR. RATE: 10 to 10. R rated for graphic violence and gore, wonderful and ugly images.
