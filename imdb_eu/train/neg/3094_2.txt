**** CROSS SPOILERS *** As we know the film, I've seen hundreds of bad movies and "Hobgoblins" differentiate them all in a special way. "Nasty classics like The Creeping Terror", "The Mighty Gorga" and "Manos" are uniformly bad from start to finish. On the other hand, "Hobgoblins" begins to go wrong and it is getting worse. When I saw the scene of my fight against rash, I thought that this film was really bad. I found out that this movie offered us the best I had seen. The movie is rumbling in hell celluloid in hell, filled with a disgraceful sequence of "Club Scum", is another definitive chain of jokes. Only this film, the director Rick Sloane has proven to be worthy of it, along with Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane, as the worst director of all time. What a bad movie can be? Watch "Hobgoblins" and do not ask anymore.
