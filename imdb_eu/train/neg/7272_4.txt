The movie is not boring. It's mostly silent film. The story, due to a different voice. While making such a silent movie, it is not so bad idea, that is, lack of dialogue and repetitive first scenes, one of these films is boring. You never understand the reason for the tide in the picture, and then it's too late. The first 40-minute movie is a slow, slow-moving Mexican non-minded soft. Later in the film, the style of the first 40 minutes is sensible, but it is too late, when the audience loses. Nice location at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I've often wondered why more movies are not filmed. The campus is built on the banks of the lava area, which gives the world a feeling of a very different world. The main problem of the movie is the way in which the director / writer has watched the movie, as he would like to see in a story that a viewer does not know. When you tell a story, you can not ignore the audience.
