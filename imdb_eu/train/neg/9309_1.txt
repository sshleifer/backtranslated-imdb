Hey, everybody ... <br /> <br /> There's really a lot to say about that movie. On a basic plot, a guy (Brandon) will travel a few friends in the woods to work on his weekend vacation to travel to his booth. Having received a girl on the way, they are all wrong at all. <br /> <br /> Only the story (which I think is the actress with Brandon, I would be wrong here too). difficult and convincing, and according to which it is played. "The Clown's Killer" is a sad excuse for a psychotic murderer. However, because the dark, mysterious, but not intelligent predators, we offer a rather rhythmic and melancholy rhyming nursery. The only thing that justified this commentary was that it was a gore for the sex scene and the movie (the quality of the film gave me the opportunity to enjoy it). <br /> <br /> In short, this film has dropped below all the established standards. Certainly, when I was alert, I was sharing some beers as I saw this, so we have been able to collect a relative value for recreation from this film, and that's why it's just mentioned. However, in reality (and retrospectively) the star rating is more than just a legitimate score for this film. <br /> <br /> Ten stars.
