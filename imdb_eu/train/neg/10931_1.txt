I watched this movie as pretty as I was expecting, it seemed to me that it would be a nice piece of fluff. Unfortunately, that was not the same. It was almost impossible to go through the movie without it. I went with my two children (from 10 to 13 years old) and even asked: "How much longer?" After that, he asked me to accept that script. Trustworthy Fred Willard was not able to keep the interview guy, the joke of the states and save the trivial land. Anyone who has written and directed this film (I'm using it for a long time) would have to take a line-up screen class or leave it to a local movie school for a movie class. At least, management, screen writing, and movies teach something about structure, plot, conversation, and roaming.
