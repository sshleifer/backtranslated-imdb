Under the dense green graphics of computers, the art and skill of Ichikawa Somegoro was delighted. Alas: he has lost all the goo. The scenes of Old Edo - with the cortijo, in Sumida, Nakamura-za's rehearsals and dramatisations were exciting and inspiring, and you came back to an interesting and wealthy era. The action taken in the Kabuki phase, which makes Somegoro's exquisite and illusion, was richer than any of the treasures that followed. Skills, audience power, the colors of the sets were very pleased with all the nonsense about the plot and performance. What a missed opportunity! One of the best actors in Kabuki is alive, and dreck will be lost.
