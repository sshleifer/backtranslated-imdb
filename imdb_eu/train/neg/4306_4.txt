There's a good thing in this movie: Lola Glaudini's ass! I'm sorry I'm so happy, but it's true. It was bad he did not do naked. At least this disorder would be acceptable. We see other chicken boobs but Lola is not anywhere. And man, Armand Assante is old or what? It seems that you are a man! The "conclusion" expected was B's usual movie. He had a potential story. They had good ideas, but they did not know how to run. Cinematography is strange. Ugly! The director is not inspired and the final result confuses the actress with many thriller. Lola Gaudini is as good as a portfolio, in a small and comfortable way, but it does not save the "Conclusion" from the trash and not a trash.
