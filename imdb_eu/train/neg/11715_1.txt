haha! You have to smile and make a smile you've really done through this movie. I think what I say to myself. The same film was created, I think of a psychological test, or like a similar drug, to take it to where it never was. When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical work, Tratcus (sp?) Said that he was meaningless and useless, but if you read it, afterwards, he would take you to a new level, like a staircase, then throw away the work and see things clearly and truly with understanding. I think this movie is the same. <br /> <br /> As a movie, it's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen for a long time. First, snipes. This dirty shot guy saw me in several movies. and I suffered some weak ones. However, even though you know how to suck the movie, you would never have thought it could be really bad. that's fun I mean, this is snipes. You know it's good, but it'll be fine, right? smile <br /> <br /> So, at all levels, this thing is a mere boredom, a peculiarity. A reference to the professional is dead and obvious, but as bad as comedian. There is a character in this film that is interesting, at least. And to make the whole thing surrealistic, they have a soundtrack that sounds like soundtracks of different types of identity Bourne. In fact, the action movie seems to be close to the back of the music, which happens as if it were fantastically surprising. <br /> <br /> Then, wherever the black scene is, where honestly, because the characters are so flat, you do not really care about it, but after you've done it, and just after someone's death, you just said: I had to see that? what else How it looks like the blinking gesture with the sparkling scene seems to be a long rhythm to endure for a long time. surely let's throw that out. When you are filtering and your eyes do not play anymore, do some of them in the dark, where it does not really happen. and on it you do not care. The path that was bored from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I went into it several times and where I went, but I almost grabbed this whole movie. and it becomes something that you see, without something that you think of at any level, so it becomes an efficient way to divide it, and you begin to think about your life, where it will go, where we are, what we are. <br /> <br /> and that ... this movie is a real magic.
