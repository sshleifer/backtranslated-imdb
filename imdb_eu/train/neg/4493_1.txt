I tried to remove any thing that is considered as a spoiler. I have also seen the first movie or at least know the general idea, so if you do not have any of them, it makes sense. <br /> <br /> Argument: This film wins the audience with some philosophical attempts by the philosopher, in order to achieve the theme. We repeatedly bombard our destiny and fate, and we ask questions they choose, and they have had to endure long and tortured sessions of plates. <br /> <br /> Neo, the latest film from a dream. Now it begins the time it takes place around its existence. There are many revelations in this movie, which is why I do not seem very trace. <br /> <br /> * Still fuzzy references still worried will ruin the movie. read below in the paragraph. * <br /> <br /> The strength and weakness of faith are revealed. The strengths and weaknesses of love and the nature of life are also revealed. The mutual dependence on human beings and technology and technology faith are also revealed. The importance of selection and experience is explained. Finding out more about things would be too detailed, so I do not say (I'm asking you to write a comment). Btw, I mean "revealed", pounded in our ears and eyes as nails. <br /> <br /> Storyline: So how does Neo and the gang get the latest film at the beginning of the next end? In short, they keep faith and use very stylized action and momentum and take advantage of the style of abuse (and after that, I learn a little bit more about learning about film makers and makers and originality.) More about it later. To make matters worse, I will only say the promotional material that has already been made: Neo Matrix is ​​trying to make every effort and seeks answers while trying to save humans while the evil Sions work with him. and its members. He has taken the place where the last movie leaves. <br /> <br /> Action: While the parts of the martial arts and pistol theater were alike the same, this movie focuses much more on martial arts than swords. , sais, etc. mixer The special effects on the face of the audience are so commonly used and they make it really laborious. I have also discussed this movie with friends and colleagues, and almost everyone has found some sequence of action - especially if everyone who heard "Smith fight" would be a movie - it must be too long and boring. It's a great red flag for action lovers, because the end of an action sequence wants a bit more or just enough to be surprising in the past. <br /> <br /> These battles scenes do not. Stylized wooden sequences are over and are not inspired. The first movie, about some of the desperate actions, was a sense of survival in the struggle, not only to look good (I do not think that, however, they are managed by Reloaden), blacks and skins. Go ahead with the drunken master or Iron Monkey to remind you of good movie sequences. You will not regret it. In addition, "Matrix abilities" is not consistent with people in Reloaded, and what they really do is not consistent. The first film was his incongruities here, but they were not too glaring - unlike Reloaded. <br /> <br /> They are special effects and are thrown on and on. Every little thing that someone makes, jump, toss, rotate, and in many cases, they are slow, bullet-time, or excessive accents as any destruction. It is evident that W Bros had a lot of money to throw it into this movie, and the boys were thrown away, without any real limitations. Strict publishers could really help, but the first movie was a success, of course, because it was given a free royalty, which will lead us. . . <br /> <br /> Character and conversation: I said that conversation was filled with fatigue and philosophical distribution. The actors can not bring a lot of depth to their character, script and direction when it throws the face of the progress of the character or neglected. The public is in no way giving nuances and substances to the same character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Keanen's interpretation is a tough performance. Keanu confuses and is the one who makes this film. He tries to show his passion for neon and Trinity, but he falls flat. <br /> <br /> Morpheus tries to make everything from Henry V to Henry, and he is as fresh as a cat. With the script that it gives, it makes a noble attempt, but it's also flat. <br /> <br /> Moss is not too credible. Her concern is identical, it's similar to Keanu, and chemistry is not there, even though it's quite well on her physical scenery. <br /> <br /> Hugo once again brought a strange sense of being. An agent program, but also under the script. I will truly find the most interesting nature of the bunch, but instead of the development they make a representative, to make a huge battle scene. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie is awesome. If you had good expectations and, in itself, as an autonomous movie (that is, how should it not be taken), it is horrible. I do not see it as deeply as the Matrix, but at least there are a lot of symbolism, at least interesting ideas, good actions, some fun lines and some fun lines, and a bit of a bit of symbolism. Reloaded fails all these numbers and I really hope that W Bros will have a better experience in the quarter. After that, I do not have much hope for this film.
