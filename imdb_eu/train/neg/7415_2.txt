What do you think of a horror story without fear and no story? <br /> <br /> The biggest thing in the movie is that the writers never decided what the movie really decided! Another thing to know is that you give instructions to the audience and it's not completely revealed, but here, you guess the guides do not know, the characters in the movie do not know and the audience knows nobody! (Remember "Cube"?) Even though the movie is more knowledgeable about it. But there are many important things left. We do not really know about the characters. The empty lines continue to repeat repeatedly. The story is not really developing - it's not free at all. Acting in B is horrible in these types of horror films, but there is a lot of acting in the script. We do not like about the characters. There's nothing to remember. There is also a cheesy humor or unnecessary sex. And, most importantly, there is no excitement, no frost. <br /> <br /> You get only some of the usual elements of the horror movie genre. They show Lordi monsters one by one, but their characters do not bring anything to the story. <br /> <br /> Really, I think that the story, the character's development, and the minimal amount of crew that might be. and equipment. Yes, film directors, 20 years ago, and more ...! I felt the public shame shared when the movie was over. Really bad
