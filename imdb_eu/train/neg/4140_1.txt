As you may or may not have heard, there is no fight between vampires or zombies in this movie. Then it might be asked why the title was proposed, but it's really good to have no sense about this movie. There was no story or plot, things were happening. The plays were very bad, they were worse than bad ads. <br /> <br /> There was no battle between vampires and zombies, but I think there was not a single scene with zombies. Their clothes seemed like an 8-year-old girl applied. The scene was totally random and was not in place, and it was a character that was struggling against the zombies in the area (I'm not joking) but they used the sound effects of the motorbikes. <br /> <br /> This, definitely, was poorer. I've ever seen the movie. All the makers of producing this movie I did not totally ridicule the only situation I learned from the 11 year oldest youngest. <br /> <br /> Really, though I have all the critics offered here, I would suggest that this movie only depends on the movie being the worst, and that's why it's pretty comical. You just need to keep the error counts.
