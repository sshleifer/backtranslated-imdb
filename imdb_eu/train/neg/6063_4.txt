"Masters of Horror" has shown a "badge of message" and Joe Dante's term "Screwfly Solution" (one of the best times in the series). It has been a heavy and indispensable vitamin (there is nothing more to discover than a horror soapbox). And 'Pro-Life' is just a reactionary fusion of ultra-violent views; While young Angelica (Caitlin Wachs) walks through the woods, she practically promotes almost 2 doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) to work in a local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelique's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a cold stone and his right hand, to his right, to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion. Simply, 'Pro-Life' has accumulated a rumor of its controversial problem, but John Carpenter takes on this indifference: he is even less interested in making a movie than the script itself (that is, it is poor); Sluggish stalking does not create tension, and simply crawls scary land. When Dwayne and her children are attacked by the clinic, the weapon switched on is an amazing event; Later, when a doctor tortures 'male abortion', the scene is free and useless, the effort to get underwritten. Bad performances (Perlman here unfortunately is wasted) has become the result of the script, and Carpenter's direction runs out, as if "Pro-Life" was his next hot meal. When the spider corridors created with a human head and latex monster suit spend time, you should ask what they think about this disorder ...
