You may not compare them, but Wild Style and Style Wars are the original hip hop. Beat Street has a lot of original artists of Hip Hop at the beginning, but they have made it clear that this may be a great rest for many, and that's nice. If you see the Hip Hop Culture originally, you're wrong. It has an overload and a Hollywood sauce. I looked at the first two films. They convey the garment that comes with the life of Ghetor. Yes, the rating of this movie is very low, but the reviews are positive or even extravagant. This is probably the story, the performance, the interview and the direction that is awful, but it is the music and dance that people love. Me, I love dancing, but I thought that at that time I had to kill the electron Hip Hop (I was so happy that I had a new generation of classical artists of the Hip Hop 86, such as Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, and some Bizmarkie) , and I still do not like the rhythms of this movie, which is why it does not work for me. I mean, Wild Style does not have much of a story, but it's beautiful and authentic music. Of course, the tastes do not match and that's fine. But as I am worried, this movie exits some trash dance and music, so I can not value it more than ten.
