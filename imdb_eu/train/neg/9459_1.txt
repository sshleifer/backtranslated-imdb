Bad Bad Bad These three lines summarize this short film that captures small films and parents only to the cinema. and her ... # 1 movie in America! What does this country think? Mike Myers resembles Michael Jackson. Some Chinese women who sleep in 3 minutes. Plots with dirty whistles. Grotesque and horrible. Green-Eggs and Ham I'll be happy in 2005! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan are likely to lose two images, trying to find the Lost Eggs and Ham. Sam-I-Am tries to pursue and calm down the guy. (I hope the classic book does not get damaged). Do not waste your time and money.
