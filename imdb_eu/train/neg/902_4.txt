I think that this film is very important since Sofia Loren was the first movie. When he was 19 years old when he was shot in 1953. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie, Sofia Sofia Loren, to see some of my first works. I was surprised when he entered the camera, painted the skin in a brown makeup that resembles the Ethiopian princess. Surely today, this was seen as a sight and it is necessary to avoid filming. It was annoying to watch the entire film throughout the film with Mrs. Loren. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie would be better if the true singer of the opera made this film. Then, the real songs and the actual gestures of true artists would be evident. I describe other people's comments about whether real opera singers are bigger or not. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Loren was at the age of 19 and is still present, although the movies could be better understood as they were on stage. In the end, we will not see on stage the beautiful young people in the background of "old opera singers", singing behind the curtain! Do not describe successful opera singers. The commercial television without an artistic production of J. G. Wentworth Company has to be referenced, praising professional singers with the praise of the company's productions. It's one of the best and most entertaining TV adverts ever created. <br /> <br /> The quality of the movie print quality is also lower. Color ink is much blurred and that can not be helped. <br /> <br /> This movie, a DVD enhancement producer, has to add English subtitles, which we do not speak Italian so we can get acquainted with the lyrics lyrics. you are saying The story was helpful and the narrator would teach more than 30 seconds to enter the scene. <br /> <br /> Do not see this film because it is a story of the Aid, it's not an opera. In spite of Mrs. Sofia Loren, her role is not one of the writer's knowledge and remembrance. Instead, see if you are a fan of Loren at the movie, and you're 19 years old - no matter what production there is. <br /> <br /> Illinois Illinois
