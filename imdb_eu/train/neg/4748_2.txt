I thought that the film (especially on the plot) needed a lot of work. The films are western and not accurate to try to create an Eastern feeling in the film. I will give three of the three mistakes in the movie: <br /> <br /> First, when Shen told Wendy that he would help him to study Chinese history, I was glad that some viewers would receive them. Chinese history information; But the movie was not that Wendy showed to study Chinese history; However, the film only shows Wendy's method of remembering what he learned, frustrated and frustrated. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it really worried me, the characters cited lunar cakes. - The moon makes this cake and the moon cake and what a good taste. However, they did not mention their real importance. The only talkers of the importance of the moonlight was the Autumn Festival, which did not explain or profoundly explain. They mentioned the myth related to the moon of the moon's moon. The myth begins as ten suns existed and each one rises, but one day ten suns rose when the sun rises and the earth rises; So Hou Yi Divine Archer shot ten sunshine in nine, leaving only one sunshine (there are different versions of Hou Hou that shot eight sunshine in eight). For his heroic contribution, he was given an immortality pill, as if for eternal life, ten rising sun again, but his wife, Chang-Ok, stole it. After robbing, he fled to the moon when he met a hare. He then took an idea and told the herb to break the pill, allowing him to spread the pill on the ground, giving immortality. (There are some changes to this story, but throughout my childhood, I've heard about this version for a long time). Such details would be the focus on the plot culturally Chinese. <br /> <br /> I would like to highlight the latest battle scene in the film. Prosecutors who took over the monks went along with the idea of ​​the importance of the Chinese fighters on the ground fighters (similar to the life of the soldiers). Terracta Warrors serves as a connection to the past of China and was very western (where the evil had to be possible anyway). The monks were ready to destroy this connection. It would be understandable if Wendy, due to the fact that he is Chinese-American, does not have full Chinese knowledge, would have no problem destroying these priceless objects. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was a western one, as all the monks seemed. and Shen wants to do the fight ... I mean, TVPG is a result of violence, thinking about Confucius in harmony and harmony. In fact, the monks try to avoid violence and try to do things in a peaceful way before being loyal to violence. <br /> <br /> All, all or producers, writers or directors. He did not do any research, and instead he made the work unmistakeable and unimpeded. I would suggest that the film stops the air or shoots again for more accurate information; However, I would give them the credits (2 stars) to eliminate an Asian and Asian American stereotype to be intelligent and calm.
