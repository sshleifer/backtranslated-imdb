In 1979, I watched the dollar's movie theater with a friend (when his friends sold $ 1). This is the only film I've ever been with (with my friend, while the screen "Laser Bra 2000" was on the screen. Clearly, my friend and my friend's movie was a regular movie. I did not find an offensive film (18 years or so), but Ed Wood I think it's a foolish and insolent mum that does not want to watch movies, this is a real reason NBC refuses to air, instead of failing to understand Mr Mike's "focus" (of course, unless his focus is to defeat the failure of the movie) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It's definitely mine. You've been warned.
