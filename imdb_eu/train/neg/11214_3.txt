I also watched this movie about a year ago. First of all, I'm glad to say it. Cassella is a great talent and an excellent director. The movie could look good. I would not call it a horror movie. Drawing up some shots of ghosts does not turn into a horror movie. There is no mystery, there is no suspense, you know who it was all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. Both parties know the whole movie. The performance is fine, I think, but there is nothing special. <br /> <br /> And gestures, "Revenge can be deadly ... .... really? ... Should you check how many hundred horror / thriller movies you have the exact same writing? <br /> <br /> It's very difficult to say a piece of it, but I know a lot of people who have worked in this movie, and I know they do not want people to blow their heads, so I give them my sincere opinion.
