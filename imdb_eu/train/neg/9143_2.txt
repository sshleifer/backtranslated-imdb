I'm very fond of independent films as an actor, but this is, to a large extent, amateur. <br /> <br /> The boys go to Vermona for a public service, but when the airplane flies over the ground, more than one tree flies. Are not palms in Vermont? Pine trees - palm trees not. And the same thing happens with the marriage service - a nice palm tree. <br /> <br /> When the boys leave for VT, apparently they could not get a ticket to the most important airline company, because it is a Federal plane. Did they ship their night there? Come on with this little detail like girls, which distinguishes an independent American movie. <br /> <br /> The Christian brother is much more expensive than Arturo with his hairy hair and tribal band. Both roles should be changed. <br /> <br /> The small characters are irregular and they reveal something horrible. <br /> <br /> Applause for management to make a gay film, but pay attention to your location and the subsequent casting
