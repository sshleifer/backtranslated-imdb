This movie was bad. This movie was awesome. The performance was bad. The setting was realistic. The story was absurd: once comic appears to appear on a comet one night. Most of the world's inhabitants decided to see this comet. Next, the next morning, only a few people are converted into a comet via radiation. The clothes are still intact, there are still living plants, but the people become dusty. There is no bone, nothing. That's ridiculous. How did the radiation say to people, but leave clothes and other biological substances intact? <br /> <br /> Even more, some comets have been converted into some extreme zombies who ate monsters. Their make-up would not be a terrific appearance for a newly born son. Insane Clown Possek frightens me more ... and it seems stupid. <br /> <br /> Then they survived. The people surrounded by steel were killed by zombie death and death. How can steel make mercury's radiation block the suspected people in their careers? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the 1960s horror music casts parts of the film or 80s rock slabs. You want to shoot the movie and your TV. <br /> <br /> The stupid part of the movie, however, are the stars: Star Trek: Valley Girls and Chakotay: Voyager. These three characters were totally realistic. Where would he go on a day with a prey after the apocalypse with the mutants who eat meat? A 4-minute horror horror scene lasting 5 minutes, and most were dreams. Among these scenes is not a sophisticated conversation, it seems South Park seems to be. The silence between basic conversation was painful. I made a movie with four monkeys and a Cheetos bag. Never watch this movie.
