I saw Iowa in the week, I saw the Art School Confidential. In it, a pretentious student makes a film and can not decide whether it has been art or a violent exploitation. Iowa could be that movie. I can see Iowa's best film items. However, in addition to articulation, these two films have a good character development and coherent story lines. Iowa. This movie is endless. I must admit that I have consistency. This movie is bad from the beginning to the end, and in no way worse or better. All actors did everything they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves it. It shows a very talented, very funny and very sexy character. But why should the ball show?
