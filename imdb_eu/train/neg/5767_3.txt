As you say before, the visual effects are amazing. They are excellent. I personally use Blender and such graphics are not very easy. But that's all this movie. Plots are confusing, but the general conflict is unclear. For example, the first scene, Proog and Emo are trying to escape what they know. Conflict seems to be between man and nature. Then, when they enter the bottomless hole, Proog explains "step by step and (you're dead)." Here is a more exact conflict between nonsense men and nature. As the film progresses, there is clearly a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly there is a conflict between men and men, Proog, from nowhere, Emo's murders. Proog quickly changes a caregiver who has lost a child who is "sick". It betrays us Not only is it depressing, but it does not matter that the thoughts and actions of the character are not developing. It's not the story of someone, through the struggle, that is getting stronger. It is sad and does not point to the world that reflects on any human being, no great truth or a great theater. In my opinion, the film is very well developed in every aspect. However, graphics are amazing, but the film is much more than eye candy. There is no truth, no fight and no bad surprise. In the end, an undeveloped movie without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
