I could name a lot of fun movies. There are comedies for fun and there are. Some films, like Gymkata, for example, try to be serious, but it's fun. The Ladies Man is a movie that wants to be fun, but it's not so fun about a man who has scored a lot of chickens in the midst of a waste of nuclear power. It's fun to be anti-fun. <br /> <br /> I do not think that I laughed at anything that made me laugh at this movie. It's undeniable. It's boring, stupid, inane, annoying, bad, but not funny. I do not like Tim Meadows or this SNL character, but I expected it better than that. <br /> <br /> The movie is completely logical or meaningless. As soon as the writer wrote down he had a bag, he could not see which key he pressed. They say "Ladies Man", but they do not play a motivation among their strange performances, such as still acting in the seventies. The movie tries to get humor when he tries to get the man who likes a beautiful porn, when he tried to hang himself. This is a comedy? I like to consider myself a sense of humor (I spend a lot of time writing comedy), but I may not have enough light for this movie. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, Mary Something About Tucker is just as funny as here's a bad thing. He could wait for me in my mind. <br /> <br /> At the end I was knocking on my chair, I reduced my breath, and if the movie was longer, I could commit suicide. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but I'm the first movie I came across. <br /> <br />
