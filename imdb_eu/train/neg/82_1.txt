This movie sucked. My life was lost. The play was atrocious, the plot was totally impossible. It's a long and long story, these people are "horrified" by this pathetic "murderer killer", but they completely fail to fight back. And after swimming in a campsite, they appear in a camp, already mounted and dressed and with daisies headphones. Moreover, after the disappearance of the ship, they are afraid of being in the woods, but their daughters' daughters appear and seem to think they never walk in the woods as they just arrived. As I said, the movie is sucked. Full joke Do not let your girlfriend talk to see.
