Now do not get bad. You need a thorough summary of what happened in the history of human civilization and it is also a great way to get a brighter future of humanity. If you need a healthy dose of sound and sound, as in the case of religion, it must be said that it is useful, and then turn it over to Sagan or Dawkins, not according to the God (?) Mass. That is, in itself, a good point. Maher rejects our past religion as a neurological disorder, knowing how to root his whole society, art, and science. <br /> <br /> This film focuses on the skills of his irony and cynicism. He was trying to appear honest and wise to make his point. Unfortunately, his mind is not for this purpose. <br /> <br /> Maher laughs at us, but clearly it is not the brightest in the box. As an example, responding to a interviewer (and I do not use the meaning clearly, as were all "ambushees"), this statement is that Jesus' existence is a historical fact that "No, it is not" is a consequence of a long time. convey contempt for the naivety of the subject (this film is used too badly). The problem is that he was correct because Maher was dead, that is, Jesus refers to the belief that he is historically suspicious of the gospel. I think Mr. Maher has not read the current historian Joseus. <br /> <br /> But when the people, like other intellectual giants like Michael Moore perform fictional works, mass groups will appear in this pseudo-documentary. and rumor (I surely showed them). <br /> <br /> No doubt, the greatest doublets and mando-like ones occur about 70% of the film's film. While the anti-pulling Christian was absolutely silent among the audience, he criticized the peace self-described religion as he was silent for about 10%. Hmmm. Islam's criticisms are out of bounds outside of the public and are lazy or laughed. Very significant, in a way.
