In my opinion, this bad movie is about, I was sitting around 102 minutes. It fails at all levels; It's a great cast, the performance - at best, and the plot does not go deep, without a challenge that I feel with force as a result of a screwdriver. <br /> <br /> The plane B has no charm. This genre is a field of transmitting and some of my common physical writing habits are everywhere, anywhere in the comedy. <br /> <br /> A good bond noise is covered with the film.
