I would give this movie a bit lower or lower, which is unfortunately deserving. Honestly, I never got out of the movie, but this was so terrifying that I could not stand another minute. Please, please, for the sake of humanity ... skip this movie. If you want a really hot lesbian movie that is really immersive, this is not. <br /> <br /> Attractive, unlucky, structured dialogue and ridiculous conversation, and not convincing in every possible way. . On a basic level, it fails. Everything about "Mango Kiss" is so much the scene, I AM INTRODUCTION TO THE LANGUAGE OF ANY STUDENT. <br /> <br /> If that was not enough, the whole movie is based on a constant voice (and I mean CONSTANT). more than narration. The scriptwriter can also write a novel, because they insist on asking for everything. Now we assume that Lou and Sassafras are our best friends and we assume that we have a special connection, even though this is not the development that characterizes. This film also continues to enter the new characters of the first five minutes, not naturally, but with names framed in the screen on an frozen frame. No entry, no development of characters. We really do not know one of them. <br /> <br /> This is the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I am a gay woman, with my screenplay, my roommate rooms (another gay woman) and both films believe that it is a depressing representation of the cinema knight. I am beginning to think that lesbian and gay movies are similar to Christian rock - it does not matter how terribly it feels, people will still meet and they will be champions, despite bad quality. Please do not rent this one! Instead of encouraging the production of quality gay and lesbian films, we rent "But I'm a Cheerleader" or "Fire" or "Heavenly Creatures". That's why instead of swallowing any giant trips, they focus on gay community (that is, Queer Folk). .
