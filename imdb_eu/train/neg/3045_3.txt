Believe it or not, I've bought a copy of the "DVD" of my "movie" that I bought for my very own bill of dollars at Walgreens. I still do not know if the dollar was well spent or it was a dollar that is being wasted. <br /> <br /> Beautiful sets and amazing outfits. Apparently, many thoughts and efforts were made. The design designs are very Mexican styling. I liked it a lot. And Santa is spectacular. Santas's most exciting moviedom. <br /> <br /> The original purpose and purpose of this film was to have a cutting edge and cheerful audience for children's audiences. But, to some extent, it's quite horrible. In fact, I'm surprised how often. <br /> <br /> Maybe English dubbing seems so strange and curious. One of the reasons why movies prefer to experience experiences in the original language and the duplication of duplicate English subtitles is not often disturbed. The voices of the children were doubled with the minor children's voices, which are very rare for children, but very curious. <br /> <br /> Did you know that the devils spend their free time doing ballet time in their longjohns? Are not you Also, I did not see the movie until I saw it. Every day he learns something new. <br /> <br /> Is it really worth watching the movie? Now that's a tossup. I can not recommend it to anyone in good conscience, because it is disturbingly curious. However, his unintended misery is what it is worth watching. You decide what to do. I do not know ... I felt myself uncomfortable, I saw the demons doing ballet movements that are constantly moving. Now it's wrong ...
