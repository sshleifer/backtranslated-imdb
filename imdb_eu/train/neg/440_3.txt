** THERE'S KNOWLEDGE ** <br /> <br /> Recovery: Mia (Helin) returns from Stockholm to the capital city of Rhodes and celebrates its 70th anniversary celebration with her parents. He is a son until a long time and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrén). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik and Gunilla divorces and has moved away from a town. Mia is still the only one and she is based on her career. There is a lot of jealousy and the animosity between siblings and conflicts occurs almost in the face of each other, and each one has difficulties in managing personal problems. As the parties progress (and alcohol), more and more secrets are growing and more and more conflicts are emerging ... <br /> <br /> Comments: This was a great movie for a writer / conductor to watch this movie Swedish to continue the same routes that follow ancient comedies / ancient ancient drama. There are no new elements or ideas. This film is divided into three basic areas. 1) Shame humor is based solely on those who mislead the characters themselves. 2) Sadness and 3) Anxiety. This movement has a last-minute focus, it's hardly forgotten that the first movie goes. There is no loss, the humor there is not fun. Cast's performances are good. I think that all the seriousness is lost and soon forgotten. I expected that there would be new ideas and influences, but they were not one. Finally, there is a better way to watch video. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3/10
