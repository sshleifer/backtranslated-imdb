It was clear that this movie was designed to reach Chick Flick audience, and some of them were quite comfortable and I liked it most. Heather Graham's next big challenge in Heather Graham was in the coming years. His performance was forgotten and evident, as compared to colleagues who were quiet in their duties. This movie could have been more, because budget settings were good for actors, actors and a decent story line. My wife and I agreed that this was "Muck" at length, because the movie was finished in a painful shame! Better luck later, Miss Graham adapts to the kind of film that takes her from Hell.
