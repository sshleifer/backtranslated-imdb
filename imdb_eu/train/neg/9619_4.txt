If you believe, another * age group * returns * another * lake shore * after another three years * * one of these fatal accidents claimed a number. Small and lightweight, a psycho dressed in a hockey mask (a cheaper role around it) suddenly loses them. On Friday, the 13th, this mechanical one was one of the first features of the digital background, but there remains an interesting event and everything that remains is a pre-assembled production, sub-par shows and a repetitive micro-microphone. hindrance The last two turns to lift a little spirits, and something like "Memorial Day" to forget about the best and most glamorous in a lake. One for slasher collectors only.
