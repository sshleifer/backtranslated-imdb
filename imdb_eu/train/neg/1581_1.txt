This is a 75-minute loss of my life. The play was awkward and the plot was ridiculous. A wealthy, unmarried woman is living around a nasty lesbian who gets sex with her and then earns money. One of the victims is a DA candidate, who creates trouble with his wife. Another is a plastic surgeon, too, and an evil lesbian boy will seduce his wife! Meanwhile, the girlfriend of the lesbian wick does not really like sleeping around her. It ends in a happy ending, where everything is forgiven. Women are also naked, especially in situations that prolong reality. bad bad
