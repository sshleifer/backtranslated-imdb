It is considered fashionable to overcome the general social evil of the patriarchy and the superiority of men, yet this logic can not be fashionable in logic. However, within the story and theme of the film, there is no gray area and an antagonist of the movie is the "evil" story. In no case could he justify it. Sexuality in women is just in this case and has nothing to do with reality. It's a last treason. The man spent his resources and spent time on collecting the children's waste. Finally, the arguments raised by three 'liberate' women are the weakest ones. The sexual needs of a woman are not an excuse to commit adultery and constantly complain about her husband and, worse, there is no other child. So, essentially, his life has been wasted. In some of the areas where justice is still prevalent, these situations lead to improper execution.
