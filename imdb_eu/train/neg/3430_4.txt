A bloody tendency of cannibalism rages a woman. They have been shot by two policemen and then rises from the tomb due to the ritual of the satanic ceremony made by an evil hereditary. This is a zombie demon who is hunting for women. The sacrifice baby comes back from the tomb and wants to kill Maniac again, but only with the help of the police ... <br /> <br /> 65-minute mess of the bloody ... Horny zombies, doll -Babies, S & M, the wrong and twisted police In spite of the deaths of those who seek refuge in front of Jesus Christ and at the end of the film, three text screens reveal what happened to the police (yes, we have to know!) ... Two decent disinvestment plans can not save. I saw the worst film of horror, but this was also bad. Recommended only for fans of genre.
