The film begins in Japan in 1840, where a man kills his wife and his lover and suicides. Sequence is very bloody. Then, the current jumps ... In 1982, precisely. Ted (Edward Albert), Laura (Susan George), their mother and their babies will go to Japan to travel to Japan. They rent a house and - shocked! amazed - the only thing that happened to the murder happened! They are ghosts about the three dead (a hysterically bad makeup) and they give life to their hell family. <br /> <br /> It looks like it's ok but it's really empty. Bloody is opening and finishing, and nothing happens. Attack of giant crabs is horny! As they seem so fake - I swore that chains have seen a pull and mutant! For the first 20 minutes there is no sexual sequence (probably to show George), another 40 minutes later (but it was necessary in the plot) and really stupidity at the end of the exorcism. The scene between Albert and Doug McClure must be believed. <br /> <br /> In regards to the operation, Albert agreed that his husband and McClure were as good friends as his family. But George - as always - is a wonderful movie. This movie provides a necessary lift, but it can not be saved. I will give this only 2, its opening and closing penetration. Aside, this is a very boring movie.
