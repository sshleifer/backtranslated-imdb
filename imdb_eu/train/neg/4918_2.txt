The rich Harvard dude falls to a poor Radcliffe with his abusive father Ray Milland. That's why it's a confrontation with the "classes", which is particularly tasty and, above all, a sappy story. When Ryan O'Neal leads the rich child to a bookstore, he will scatter his parents snobbish. Ali MacGraw is a social dirty mouth, John Marley is his father, a Catholic goddess, but not surprised by O'Neal himself as a portrait of Harvard's yuppie champion. <br /> <br /> Below 8 (!) A year later, 'Oliver's Story'.
