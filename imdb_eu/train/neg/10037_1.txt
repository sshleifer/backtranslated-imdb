I never thought that the standard of the Yashraj film would ever degrade! The film has no interest in the story of nonsense. <br /> <br /> Saif passed Kareena has improved her image, but it's not a good actress. Akshay is good. It's always good. I can say that the mission is not good. <br /> <br /> We meet good flights. The lost was supposed to be part of the movie "comedy". About the latest films, Yashraj films should do this kind of garbage? It has so many good movies. <br /> <br /> In general, I was totally disappointed with the movie.
