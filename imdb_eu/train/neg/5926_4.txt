Another weak entry for the third season, "Is there no truth beauty?" However, it has at least one essential plot, it is very different and, as Spock says, fascinating. The main character is a foreigner who has to move to a black box because the appearance is so terrible, because it is a bad man. It is very bad that the episode can not be predicted with this immense premise. Obviously, it was a mistake to say that the foreigner was never "shown", because, in any case, his actual appearance would not have the builder approaching; Everything we get is Star Trek used for all things used in psychedelic light screens, usually when the boat passes through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any case, Mr Kollos may have at least Mr. Spock is tolerated, and then Spock has a special viewer. (I thought the name of the foreigner was "Carlos" for a long time, I found it funny, but I'm digressive.) Spock needs a connection with Kollos for a moment to help foreigners drive to the Enterprise. This is achieved, but when Spock / Kollos returns to the end of the melancholy, Spock forgets his viewer. Uh oh He goes wrong, but eventually Kollos's assistant rescues himself with the help of a blind woman with psychic power. This may be a really bizarre and magnificent episode, but it is badly directed and in the last season 'series will find a bad show run.
