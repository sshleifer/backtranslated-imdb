This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Robin Williams, on the other hand, was a rhinoceros, as he would fit into a pipe, however, his performance was wretched. Kurt Russell was more believable but horrible. The Earth wanted to leave a lot and the rest of the plays were awful too. The only thing that was the movie was the trailer, when I lost 90 minutes of my life, I could spend it on the back of my head. <br /> <br /> Make yourself please play if you record this movie. Otherwise, you're not happy.
