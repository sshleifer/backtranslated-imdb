Actually, everyone in this movie seems to want it elsewhere! Not surprisingly, the foundry is not left with the left hand, but not. I have not seen something worse than Natascha McElhone like an agent, carrying a gun. You do not use the disaster's urban appearance in this way. The worst thing you can think of is Doris Day, a prostitute. The other parts are also awful, probably just like Hurt, sometimes you try to see it, but suffering. Oh, did I mention that the story is completely insane? Do you want to see your family divorced because many people put their lives at risk? Well, is it because the guy (Weller) is German? <br /> <br /> 2/10, because photography may be worse.
