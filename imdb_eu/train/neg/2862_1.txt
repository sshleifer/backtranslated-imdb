Someone should send this guy Uli Lommel to MOVIE SCHOOL. Who told you how to make a movie? Anyone can do movies these days? In the past, talent was always needed before someone made the movie. After seeing the horror of BTK, I've seen some of the others that have made it, it seems incredibly sane as I am doing the business as a businessman. Actually, I think they can do even better movies than Uli LAME-ALL. This film has nothing to do with BTK Killer, except the name of the victims and the killer. THAT'S IT. Where did the man get all the dirt that BTK had with rodents and other dirt in the film? This is a classic example of someone who can watch the movie "BTK" based on the reputation they have achieved. Absolutely wretched WORSE serial killer movie is a unique "DAHMER" movie. That baby so much cigar I was nauseous. Those who have done it must shoot.
