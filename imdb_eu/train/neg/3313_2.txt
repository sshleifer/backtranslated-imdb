How can we say this movie is comedy? If I had not finished with my end, I would sleep and I would ask for my money again. I loved Gwen Paltrow, but it was like it was in the wrong set. I like most chick flicks, but I hate this. This is so much time to see and I have not switched on. These clothes were exchanged in too many ways. No one speaks like that and I do not even think about it. The dance part was awful. Later he told me my ex ... "Are not you such a part? Did not you think it was sensible?" Yes, I only said to save the feelings. Now I know why we do not get married. This is one of the worst films ever I've ever seen.
