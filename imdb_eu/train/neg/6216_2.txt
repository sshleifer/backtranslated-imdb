The 9-month-old movie that I've been waiting for was disappointing. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the lack of stories and the development of rare nature. All wonderful sequential action in the world are not the only symphatic characters. <br /> <br /> The jewelery that was almost completely scattered in secret seats was not just a place, they were furious. The story is about robots and scientists ... why it suddenly becomes a necronomicon that turns wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines, instead of responding to the horror devices of the story? > How, what, when, why ... care about one of the questions you put into question and you become less and less as you leave the theater. <br /> <br /> That movie is going to be frustrated due to lack of depth ... I would like to see this movie drawn to this story. The filmmakers have secured CGI wizardry and Tim Burtons to draw on people. Which ... this is drawn to me but my respect has failed. <br /> <br /> 9 could be horrible ... with some rewriting and a bit of respect for its creators.
