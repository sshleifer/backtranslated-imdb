ADOS. I think television show is pretty and always has a lot lesson. So I decided to label them when my children decided to watch this movie. I stayed at my house and watched the TV show. <br /> <br /> They are senseless and original humor and the least problems of this movie. The Earth does not exist next, the characters look empty and, finally, Gadget does not give any lessons. Apparently, Inspector Gadget took everything that Disney worked on and they dropped it all. To be reasonable, my younger child (8 years old) liked the movie, but the older one (10 years old) was stupid (youth was too much humor but was more youthful for mood). <br /> In general, I like Disney movies, but this is a mile away. The age group is very narrow (for example, from 7 to 9), but it is essential for everybody else.
