This movie I saw in the History Channel (2006). First of all, I realize that it is not a documentary, it's a drama. But it is expected that critical "events" that activate stories may be based on real events. They shot in Reagan and the other characters were real people. He got that straight movie. From now on, the confidence in facts is rapidly disappearing. I had never heard before watching the movie. After being a television reporter for these events, I was surprised, I heard nothing about the behavior of the Secretary-General Haub described by Richard Dreyfuss. I heard the entire town "under control ...", but Dreufussen Haig is pursuing a secret and uncontrollable cabinet. After watching the movie, I started researching the subject on the Internet and I found real audio tapes and transcripts for conversations about the new situation that this movie looks like. It is terribly wrong to be the "event" of the entire House of Chaos, the Secret Service, and so forth, in which the leadership of the nation is acting irrationally and driving the world near the nuclear war. They did not happen! There is an internal conflict, surely. I'm doing wrong, their press room performances will historically regret and "difficult". But there is no scene in the movie scene. There are too many bugs in the list, but the correct comparison between the recorded and written record and the fantasy of this film asks the producers to try to get it really done. Enlighten To inform? Rocky I think they failed in all three fronts. It is difficult to motivate others, but it was questioned behind that insolvent invention. And, in my channel Channel's "Reel to Real" dear documentary follower, there is hardly any main focus of the movie, that is, the events of Administration on filming. Therefore, they have been left to the audience without much help from the network - if any -.
