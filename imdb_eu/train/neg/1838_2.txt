"Invidia" is bad for several reasons. Yes, there are unknown characters. That's not the problem. It is impossible and we do not have their care. "The War of the Roses" had irrevocable characters but, at the very least, we were interested in their destiny, while at the very least, "Invidia" was a small entry, the characters are never credible and the plot is getting worse. . <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller confuses his role and most of all I'm a fan of his work. Stiller campaigned to publish the video directly and now I see why. The film proposes "best friends" with Jack Black, but in the first five minutes Stiller seems to hate Black Black. I thought that I thought it would be a kind of side-by-side ("The Cable Guy") but it never was done, because Stiller affirmed that he was "the best friend", and he loved me that I was feeling black. "poo". The plot of the movie is ridiculous, but it does not matter, because it is an excessive story of morality. Unfortunately, the mess messes out. Walken gives a good performance, but Black is off-key and it's annoying (and it's usually very funny). No, it's not a horrible film, but I do not believe Barry Levinsons ("Rain Man" "Sleepers") is responsible for it; It is not the worst film of all time, but it can certainly be much better. I would like Va-Poo-Rize to permanently eliminate this movie ...
