I recently saw the movie, although it appeared in 2001. I wanted to see a fun movie, but tell me, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. "The princess" is not very annoying, as you would notice ... Jean Claude Van Damme reminded me that I only looked at her point and then overcame opponents. Throughout the movie I waited at least to listen to confessions, he liked it, why he was struggling, who loved and trusted. I waited vain. Crappy movie. Crappy conversation. Do not watch that if you do not want to get bored! It was so bad that I finally asked him in frustration that I did not shout for 1 hour and a half. More or less. I give 4/10.
