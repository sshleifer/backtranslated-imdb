Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided that he had expanded his limits several years ago and fear dabble. The result, "Dead Above Ground", is just a garbage. Now, I determined to film his movie back, but not my glasses, and I lost it because I'm damn, I really need to take my videos for shopping. The first question would be: is the recipient of that recipient? The "scary" child is almost like a movie, but there are once again topless babes and gore and some words are thrown here and there. The main characters are so nice that anyone, anyone who sees them, wants to keep some of them with farm tools. It seems that a man shows a past, a bed and a breakfast, when the child's witch killer was living there. Certainly, the real estate agent is something that has not been mentioned. Nowadays, today, there is a little ghost girl who warns the real life girl that something bad is going to happen there. Is it true, and there are two Bubbas who owned this property when the new owner had taken it, so they also took revenge. All this stuff, with sensitivity to some Halloween cables, of course, except for things that are not suitable for small children. That's why it's not crazy, it's all mixed up. Anchor Bay, too, can make you happy and murmurous, with the usual notes, it's a new bass note. He gets the Phantasm Box Set in the UK, we get "The Tooth Fairy". It seems pretty straightforward. 10 out of 10 junk.
