This was a wild event that saw the movie of my life. I watched the break in the theater. I was totally amazed at what was bad. Such films ask you who is to make money and who is to whom it owes a good, very big difference. Special effects are a primary level because all primary school students can do it. Toy rubber bats in chains, no attempt to hide ropes, arrows that appear on the film and appear like an arrow on a street sign and an awful story. Ed Wood made masterpieces with "Conquest". All film students should see the same thing for the same definition of a wrong movie.
