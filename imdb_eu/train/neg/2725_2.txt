Chesty Gringo, Telly Savalas (like Frank Cooper) is the "Border Cop" USA-Mexico. Young immigrant Danny De La Paz serves as a father image for Benny Romero. Mr. Savalas will be the best man in his future marriage. Savalas is hard, but boss Eddie Albert (as the Moffat commander) may be harder. It's hard for everything you need to stop smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (as Chico Suarez). Alliances may vary. <br /> <br /> If you find the option to be repulsive if you listen to "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas", you should leave the "edge" aside. Otherwise, you may not have a stomach in the "realism" scene of cowbells. Although not much worth more, De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (as Leina) steal the show. <br /> <br /> ** Bordera (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
