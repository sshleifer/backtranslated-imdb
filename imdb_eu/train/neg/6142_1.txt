Gymkata is definitely one of the worst movies ever made. But not a bad film. This is so scary to see and laugh. Kurt Thomas clearly has not won a professional career. He had to go back to the gym But who can forget about the most memorable scenes, with high-quality chalk, stone pommel-horse or five-minute harassment in a slow motel on the village farmhouses. I do not think it was a bad thing, but who can say it. It's not art, but if you want something that will make a good conversation and luffy, rent a gymakta. It makes a break
