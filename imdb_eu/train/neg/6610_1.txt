This movie should not be seen as a flop. Ram Gopal Verma for the first time, "Sholay" wanted to recreate the classic Bollywood film, but after deciding to go ahead with the problems with the people in charge of the project, ... I leave all the good part of the movie (acting, script, songs, music, comedy , action, etc.) are filming, because they hired the crew. Money wastes, loss of time. After Rangeela, Satya and Company, Coppola (Padrino) threw us out; What did you think about RGV? However, it's a story, although it's hard to keep going, Old Sholay looks pretty much like that. Ajay Devgan plays Heero (Beeru, Sholay) and Ajay, a new child in the Ajay (Jay, Sholay) block. Two "bad yet funny" friends help police capture a bad guy first. Later in the film, the retired police hires personal security and protects it from a handful of Bubban's Amitabh Bachan. If you have not seen Bollywood movies, they finally win Good guys. I have saved 3 precious hours of your life!
