I'm going to give this movie in 10 out of 10 films and I can clearly say what intelligence the intellectual film looks like. The Broken is no doubt one of these films. I have to admit that I tried to think a lot of the films, and I tried to understand everything that was trying to make the effort, and despite the instructions read in the previous comments, it seemed to be a mere exaggeration in the intellectual league. people The skin photos show clearly that it is broken that the broken part of the upper part of the brain is broken. The message is clear after breaking the body part, the rest will be deformed and disturbed. So, you are waiting for the movie characters to show their defected sides and that is not obvious on any of the scenes because the movie immediately starts with the characters and without their input before life. Although his father holds the rifle, his children will try to surprise him, if he has enemies, but that is not very strong. If more traces of the film were dealt with, in fact, it would be a masterpiece. But while the movie was slow, it was empty at the same time, without a metaphorical scene. And finally, with the evil Gena, the collection of the evil Gena is a strong revelation from other comments that existential messages that others have spoken. Also, as Gena really lives in the apartment, if her brother finally tells him, then how is it evil? I can argue that any theory about this film is able to defend myself so much that I can ask so many questions: This movie is pretentious and it's time to lose it. Of course, someone shows someone who wants to get out of a nonsense mystery that serves someone. I have horror movies and especially slasher enthusiasts, some of them call popcorn movies. Horror films do not transmit deep messages! They reveal the beautiful mask of life and show the other side's most obscure side. Horror films include blood, screams, intensity, skeletons, body organs and parts. That's because it's a real horror and it's never far away from reality. I have seen almost all the horror movies and I have proved that each of them is as real as the sun. Nothing was unreal while he thought the mind. For example, "Frightening" is a horror movie whose tension and similarity are virtually identical with "shelter", and illegally sell body organs, no one is kidnapping people in foreign places. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And though we are considered to be an existential fractional message, still very poorly presented And it's more terrifying. I prefer the dependency message presented to a loved one on Requiem, which exceeds drug addiction, sex, television, security or security, etc. In order to emphasize the type of dependency, it can be so destructive and it can be scary to me. And critics of horror films that are always failing and highly commercial, they just have no fear and they do not know how they like the genre, but this does not mean that they enthrall and enthusiastically add audiences to adrenaline disorders, get, leadership lessons (believe them or No!), the most important entertainment face interview with the essence of life, as ugly and horrible as it might be, Death!
