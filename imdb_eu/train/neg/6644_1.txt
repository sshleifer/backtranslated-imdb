Yes it is! ... No, Pintilio does not disassociate and publicly show actors. Pintilie "emperor" is naked, to say that ... <br /> <br /> It's a great time for someone to express the truth. This blame is a voyeur, a siphon inserted into the body of an old man. The scene of his nakedness has no artistic legitimacy. It is 100% visual perversion: it gets mistakes by the actors who hang out and look at it voluntarily. If this happens to audiences, it might be hard to believe! Did you know that in the "Niki Ardelean" group, Coca Bloss was embarrassed by the poor, saying: "Oh Coca, how do I like you?" The lady is wonderful, very dignified and sensitive, and the shameless was shameful for her delight! And, because of the Romanian education of the audience, as a sign of a disturbing common alarm, so many people are still stupid enough to claim these visual lusts "artworks"! Anyone can have everything to check the truth?
