I saw this with my wife and her 3 year old son. He liked it much more than my wife. It's a bit of a handwriting / a Disney tour. I had a very hard time paying attention. The movie seems stunning, but the story becomes so strange and long, I hope my son would be asleep to get him out and get out. <br /> <br /> The film does not mean an interesting concept, is it so strange (bad script), especially when we know it "for the first time" with the family. I know that the families are evil, but they are supposed to be a good gentleman. However, they could shorten this sequence for about 15 minutes (apparently I did not have a good time). At that moment, in the head I gestured to find the way out.
