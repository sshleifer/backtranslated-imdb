There are so many comments on this movie, but I'm deceptive. This cutting corner is an excessive scenario, where an ordinary man becomes a criminal offender to an opposite sex without apparent reason. The boy brings together girls. A girl has a ridiculous hilarious piece of gun. The boys are fascinated. <br /> <br /> You know the driller: the antagonist is a free and free spirit instead of a sociologist ... You have some words about Alice Drummond's wisdom and you have a Love recipe. Sheedy is "crazy or does he need a hug?" Only the role of The Breakfast Club is prevalent. And it's an evil turkey from a movie that's left to us.
