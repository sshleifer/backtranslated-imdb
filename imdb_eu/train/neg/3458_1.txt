I am usually not motivated to write reviews. But this movie was so painful. I was angry at the planned plot, they laughed at some moments of hope. In fact, most of the viewers were bored, even in the "most" season of the movie. Molly Ringwald revealed the only performance deserved in torture production. In the end there was not "turn" too. I have heard that the movie is not serious; but I found little evidence about it in the movie. <br /> <br /> Cut cut into the room floor. Get yourself aside and spend your time and money in something else!
