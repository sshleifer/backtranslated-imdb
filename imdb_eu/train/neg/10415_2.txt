2 stars from 10 possible - which is very generous. <br /> <br /> I thought James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr. and with a cast of Henry Thomas. lost I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I wonder whether Sam Shepard can have medicines on weekends. I thought much about Sam S. for being nuts, this film, based on his work, has confirmed. <br /> <br /> This is art of bs.s The actors LOVE make it possible to put their teeth in, allowing them to feel constantly. However, through this waste bin without the viewer, there is nothing to love about this movie. <br /> <br /> You have not seen dysfunctional families until you see that bunch. He is crazy, Ma crazy, son is crazy and daughter is, oh yes, crazy. In addition, they will explain the words that would explode the sailor, especially her teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> In addition, as if not enough, on the plot - and that's the way. It was not easy to read - it has a hole in Alaska. <br /> <br /> It hurts the farm that exploits it. As in Pa, I'm not a real estate advisor, but the last time I checked the property owned must have both owners to sell. If one of them is the only property, the other one can not be legally sold, so it would not make sense to do so. Mr. Shepherd prefers to exclude this basic act, and therefore his plot does not work. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else that works, though. <br /> <br /> The only reason that people can see this movie is that it is totally disappointed if James Woods looks at the whole nakedness and can not imagine why he wants it.
