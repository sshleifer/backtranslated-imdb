After listening to the prophetic masterpiece of my life in George Orwell, I'm 37 years old, but I'm confused about what I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> I am very much like the very novels covered concepts, probably most of them, but only by listening and quotes. Without this limited knowledge, the movie would be a complete mystery, and I'm not even learning about the 1984 story, than I had seen before. <br /> <br /> Positively. .. / / <br /> <br /> Cinematography is amazing, Hurt & Burton offers great performances and the overall sensation of the movie is fantastic and it is destroyed. Prostituta scene was a fantasyly dark cinema structure. <br /> <br /> Now there are a lot of parties in the lower part ... <br /> <br /> War occurs (at least in terms of propaganda, but why and with whom? There is nothing in it. Some names are bandied ( Eurasia etc.), but they do not mean anything without explanation. <br /> <br /> Who's doing what Winston does? Where does it work? Why is the report changing? Why is it not the first line? Why? Does not eating food in the dining room? How much does it drink in the whole movie? Why is it so weak and ill? Why does not he clean his head like everyone else? What happens with his mother and sister? What happened to his father? It would be a bit enjoyable, I did not I do not know how to read the book for me. Without it, the artwork home cinema is quite difficult and difficult, so you can continue to guess what you are doing. <br /> <br /> An unbounded and malicious soundtrack and constant chat Big Brother screens are in the middle of conversation to find out more difficult in the tits. I admit that it may be an artistic option, but it is very annoying. <br /> <br /> Also, I know that's what they mentioned first, but why nudity? It seems completely free and it felt that there was no coverage coverage. <br /> <br /> I can not personally describe the word that the story tells in Hollywood. this word these days. We are not the cleanest head, but some steps are too far. I can only imagine that you have read the book truly, because this film is really literal because many people say it is literal, because many people say it, it would be very difficult for me to understand why he's been accused of 1984 as the classical one. <br /> <br /> It does not deny that it was anticipated before the age of the year and anticipates all the changes that have taken place in our society to date (perhaps this is a kind of bible for society). powers?), but many science-fiction novelists have done the same without losing their voices in the story. <br /> <br /> I have to do what I need to do from the beginning and I have to buy a copy, I have to do something reasonable in the book. <br /> <br /> In recent years, something to wait for a few years is very disappointed.
