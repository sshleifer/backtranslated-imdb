Directed by Sidney J. Furie, Hollow Point has created the most challenging and surprising modernist audience with a postmodern nonsense masterpiece. <br /> <br /> When Sidney J. Furie removes "motivation" and "reason" types, she asks what happens with tired traditionalist "land" and "characterization" paradigms. <br /> <br /> I mean the result, I think, I did not get a better opinion. <br /> <br /> One in one half. <br /> <br /> <br/> P.S. There is nothing in this film, the law enforcement agents are hard to beat, and organized criminals have insanity.
