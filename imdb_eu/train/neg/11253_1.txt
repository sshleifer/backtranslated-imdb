Visually interesting, but in the original section it is flat. The thug technique is thin after the initial battle. Jude Law has a charisma that burns fire, but he has one of the worst conversations I've ever seen on his screen. In fact, the script is so bad that I'm leaving the movie, and I still think about work, bills, my dogs, etc. There are many times on the Bluescreen screen. Paltrow is wood. A fast-paced, black-eyed conversation or high-level chat room. The only complaint about my technique is black and white film (I feel like my computer), Turner seems like black and white. Only a great mix of clinker. I would rather break my wife by resisting this test of resistance.
