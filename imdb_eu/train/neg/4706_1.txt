It's true, you've heard that ABOMINATION is a horrible movie. First of all, the team, who will watch or listen to the group "THE NAKED BROTHERS BAND"?!?! The name is horrible, but even musicians can not play anything! Also, the lead singer is harder than Geddy Lee, and even his voice is awful! They are very powerful musicians, but they are great actors. It's a huge movie that has been directed by a brilliant director and thin plotter. This website would allow me to drop a ZERO vote or 10 points below, which means that 1/10 is generous. <br /> <br /> I do not know that you can call this. a comedy movie When you're looking for comedy with music, go to the "Weird Al" guy Yankovic for "that's why" doing much better than a spaceless group.
