I am a fan of the best of the previous films. But this was horrible. It is not surprising that I found it so difficult. I tried 4 video rental shops until I found a copy of that movie. The play was awful, the argument was a joke, and it was a bad act. <br /> <br /> I will definitely lose Alex Grady, Travis Brigley and the first kickboxing character of this film. 2 movies. <br /> <br /> Go
