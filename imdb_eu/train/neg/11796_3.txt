Is nothing more on TV? Are you bored really? Well, then see Phat Beach. However, do not rent and definitely NOT buy. That would be a serious mistake. <br /> <br /> I saw this on TV and found myself scattered several points. I did not laugh long and I did not laugh. However, I laughed jokes and comments. If you are looking for a "fun" movie, watch it on Friday. If you are looking for a powerful emotional film (this movie ... if you like), watch hoop dreams or something like Jason's Lyric. If you are looking for a good black eye, watch a porn movie by Dominique Simone, because there is almost no nudity of the movie. However, if you do not have to do it and this is in the cable, go ahead and see it. You'll be a little bit fun. *** 3/10 ***
