In general, I am ready to be open to many people, but this was not a great deal. It has nothing to do with the British origin - he has not seen, and I'm sure. There is a lot of meanders, which leads to the lack of chemistry, and an alleged character / character for his supposed male lead (Jimmy Fallon). <br /> <br /> Fallon walks on the screen wearing clothes. and make a younger age than a 15-year-old youngster. She supposedly considered a teacher, and of course, it is known throughout the world to hire lesser moods than teachers who love to go to school. The character is very upset and irrational, it seems to me it could be any actress nice, but they could shoot old trustworthy tales such as John Cusack or Adam Sandler. Not in Fallon, it's not funny, or actress, but they seem to be both. You do not even think Fallon in the role of the movie, or do you think these two people, or they should be together. There is a scene close to the end of the movie. Barrymore tells Fallon, "Oh, but it's not quite like that, I have only one love," and that's why it's too much happening and moving. on the page. And instead of feeling the scene badly, or I feel like Fallon, you are actively encouraging, what he had to do last month ago. But, of course, this plot's mechanics will not leave that end (it's an end to the fact that a statement can be made from that confusion), and we will be able to eliminate all that rational career girl. This foolish child and deceive. Of course, it was satisfying and satisfying, but I liked everything else.
