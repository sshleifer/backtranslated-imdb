I really entered this movie. I thought it was a great potential premier and it was a good idea to make an interesting movie. I'm not bad here, I do not expect Citizen Kane. I was taking this for the B movie. That said, he still has no hope. The historical aspect of the story is glazed and it gives me a cold ending. The film was wood. In short, I will give you 4 great ideas, but the film could have a much better focus on making movies. Do you want to see it? I did not want to return for two hours, but I do not know who I would recommend to others.
