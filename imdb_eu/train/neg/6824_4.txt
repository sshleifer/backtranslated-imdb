I watched Koyaanisqatsi twice or three dozen times and I saw him in love with the second, so I had the chance to see Life In Transformation succession. It was really nice to me, because it was not nearly reached high standards. The heads with 90-sided baskets are not the idea of ​​my good movie. Philip Glass did not have the first beauty and correlation around it. Compared to Koyaanisqats, this movie seemed slow and useless. Baraka's juicy version, the same idea, but better. I really hope that the third movie in this series is not an example of that waste.
