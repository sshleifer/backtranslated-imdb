"American Nightmare" is officially linked, in my opinion, "Pat!" MOVIE MOVIE movie for all time. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (similar to the "Friends" version of K-Mart) gather in a cafe to American Nightmare to hear a pirate show. There is a bearded man This is the most exciting aspect of her show. <br /> <br /> Chandler, Monica, Joey, and ... Wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie, and all other bad-guy bad guys take the bearded guy who shows his greatest fear of the bearded DJ. They do not know, a stupid nurse / serial killer says ... <br /> <br /> The nurse begins to torture Crazy Ross and Rachel and ... wait, sorry again ... frightening fears. . These fears are amazing as "voodoo" and old dental ladies are down. <br /> <br /> No. Really <br /> <br /> This movie, in a word, was rotten. Crazy Nurse's lack of murder is lacking motivation, the viewer "jump", when the bum ends and - again - there is nothing for Voodoo <br /> <br /> if your loved ones do not mind you, rent "American Nightmare" with them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you love your loved ones - albeit a bit - go to your local blockbuster blockbuster, copy "American Nightmare" all and hide your freezer.
