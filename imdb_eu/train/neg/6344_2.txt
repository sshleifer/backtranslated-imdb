I'm good, I've been playing Woody Allen for half an hour (I know of the weakness of what I've watched in less than half an hour). Basically, at the beginning it was very obvious that we had to protect it on the screen: like a script; Hannah and Her Sisters (except for Chloe Sevigny) tried to make a cast of characters, and for that they were misguided; and sitting at the camera seat, only to be anything to shoot, and the actor that chats. Drama None; It's partially ahead, but action is not a dramatic situation. <br /> <br /> Maybe in that case I got too early, but we decided not to start with another one and a half. -Liners-Allen clones. Does the script have fun moments? Will Ferrellen trailer (trailer-hooked again, doh!) ?? I went almost completely. But it's not a bit of a rhythm. Even worse than that, there is no fluidity. This film is said to be wood, because the forest seems to be jelly: the most controversial cafe to open is abject in one case. The only thing to do with the numbers is review? 2/10.
