Do you know how sometimes you can watch a friendly movie and laugh at the movie? Well, it was beyond that. I bought the DVD in Tower Records at $ 3.00, and I heard that the movie might have laughed. It's really pathetic. The movie about 30 minutes ago, my friends asked me to shut them down. I was asked about 45 minutes. After about an hour, we risked moving faster, so we could see the solution to the conflict (and we watched Matt Walsh all the time). Seriously, do not watch the movie. The pain is beyond
