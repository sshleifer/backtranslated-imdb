I do not think this is a bad show in the right conditions. I suffered the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's actually lawyers who are not lawyers. God forbade anyone who really attended law school on these shows, and I heard that when I saw some interviews of the show. He was a little stunned by me. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, Spader and Shatner are the stars of the show, they are annoying. Although this is wonderful in some situations, here it is not. The constant pursuit of women in the show is fun at the beginning. But since literally doing it, I realized that it was as deep as the show would get. In the midst of the real show's rage, trying to avoid serious, dramatic and even tedious agitation fails when I try to enjoy the show. /> The "public service announcements" that Alan Shore out of his opinion is surprisingly surprising. Denny Crane is annoying. I felt ill because the show's writers were wearing the colonial outfit at Crane's speech. <br /> <br /> I give two stars to the moments that I thought of attempts to face the current issues of the show. they were very careful. <br /> <br /> I think the writer's writers were aware that Denny and Alank showed that sexual harassment was very angry, from the beginning to their greatest invitation. The thing is, I do not care if the show goes well with the treatment of sexual harassment, but the writer felt that I was insulted that the sex flags in the show artificially impounded my libido with future hope. get back to get more. I am not a teenager, and I think that this show is hopeful if it does not name the common denominator of the common classification. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm writing this, I realized that it would be much better than that. It's a pity I'd love one of those shows.
