This is not really the right review, since I have not seen most of the films. I stopped watching her. The films are very violent, wrong drug dealers and street punks, but this is not why I stopped watching. <br /> <br /> The problem was here: I saw enough that I had enough access to all the characters. They were not interesting. Everyone was psychologically tedious and despicable, with no personal excellence, I did not expect to be advanced. I did not know anything about the future or what happened to them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you were interested in a person, and I do not want to say a good or kind person. I mean an interesting person, I was with her. Check out what I mean by "Grace of State". In this film, Gary Oldman's character is very dark, but very interesting. Al Pacino might have worked well in Scarface, but I did not think about it.
