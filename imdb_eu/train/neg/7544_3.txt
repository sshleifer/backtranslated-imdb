First of all, this movie was not bad. It was happy ... for me, at least, all the wrong reasons. I have never seen the originals, so I can not compare them. <br /> <br /> This film reminded me of this curious film by Christopher Reeve Village of the Damned. Both films have different plots, but there are enormous feelings and unwanted comedies. <br /> <br /> Wick men think they are mysteries / thriller / men. I do not know that the whole pagan and sacrifice was a bit disconnected. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage, whose gloriously glorious head goes to a solitary island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in his long interview calligraphy. who is her daughter has been closed and hidden in the islands? <br /> <br /> Cage is a policeman and you can get a tired police in a semi-squared island, leaving no place anywhere in the real world. Ergel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He seems to be all the time elusive and tiring. Cage is left over the island because she is a daughter and she learns how fortunate a victim of sacrifice is coming to this island at the bad harvest festival. <br /> <br /> Men in this movie do not get so good. An evil demonstration of feminism? <br /> <br /> Sometimes I found a giant movie, especially when the cage was mixed with some women and it was running full of bears. I think there were too many movies in this movie. I find the whole concept of angered women hidden in an island, though it's not entertaining for men, but the way that was depicted in this movie was very strange. Most women have a joke and their anger is a kind of sex. The movie would be disgusting if the roles were reversed. You might want to watch this movie once or twice. NO thriller will be strange.
