When I saw this movie I could not believe my eyes. Where were these hilarious creatures, dumps full of sharp teeth, to be terrifying? Or they were designed to be a great laugh (I hope this really is). If you look carefully, you can also see the strings that cause them (preferably by dragging on the screen). The whole thing was so terrifying that it was terrifying, and I saw the movie as well as watching the movie, it was amazing to have a good part. It's a great starting-point joke, and I think the movie goes into a new category: it's so unbelievable that you'll laugh at the end from the beginning. (I will not comment on any comments or other things)
