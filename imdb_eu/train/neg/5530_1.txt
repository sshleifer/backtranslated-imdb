From the many problems of this film, the worst thing is continuity; and again editing the VHS college cable channel many years ago, I tried what went wrong. It seems that what actually happened was to build a longer film and then it was chopped into the standard concept of theater. How much more time? Let's fill all the holes on the ground, as it should be about three hours of storytelling and the development of the characters, especially because we take films so slow and so serious. <br /> That's amazing; What could be the trouble getting here? Their previous film, "White Zombie", was a small budget, the first monster of Universal Studios (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.), and so they were very close to the zombie mythology known in North America. magazines known. <br /> <br /> The rebellion against Zombies, on the contrary, seems to have been designed as an allegory for the politics of modern warfare. This does not open and Dean Jagger's character describes megalomania changes, but explains why zombies do not really do much in the film; We are merely allegorical soldiers, we are not many cannibalists, when we love and hate zombies. <br /> <br /> I am equal to the modern war and its politics. But I think the movie should be entertaining first, and perhaps later education. And definitely, it should be a zombie movie about zombies. <br /> <br /> One of the most curious films in Hollywood history, but I can not recommend anyone, even for historical value.
