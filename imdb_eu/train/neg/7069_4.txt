When the movie was released, it was the biggest hit and it soon won Blockbuster. Honestly, the movie is a wonderful loser, who glorifies a loser. The movie has an tag line: "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara", Love's Sweet but Sacrifice da Immortal. The film's heroine (Ganesh) sacrifices her love leader (Pooja Gandhi), although both love each other! Its justification is the meaning of the line. This movie broke the hearts of so many young people into a "Loser-like sacrifice attitude" that seemed to be very thought-provoking and that's why it became the worship of the movie. Ganesh's films are Amateurish, Crass and Childishly Foolish. It really looks funny when it comes to a song (Onda Ondu Sari ...) that looks elegant and fresh. His gaze does not help the main role too. Her hair style is made in most parts of the film. POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT. His costumes are terrific in the film and they are very different. <br /> <br /> The great part of the movie is Mano Murthy's most influential cinematography and music, really the real passion for film. Jayant Kaikini's letter is very well written. Director Yograj Bhat should like to see the songs. <br /> <br /> Anyway, except for all the songs, the movie is very ordinary !!!!!!
