The bad thing is caught ... The label line for this movie is repeated again. <br /> <br /> Home One and Two, classic movies. House Only three and four, a good movie, you are three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, it's not like it's fun. He is substituting for Alex D'Linz or something else. He is a very bland actress with dumb performances, but he is not entirely guilty of it because of fuzzy writing words and expressions. The failures are copied from the first two with different sketches, and you should be blind to think that these chickens are true. It's a good opportunity if you're a pre-school teacher, that is, on a rainy day, this movie is displayed. To make things worse, it's completely different, see if you do not believe it, but you'll regret it.
