This movie is Yawn strong, because the Americans do not take good luck. Even though they have already been written! The original movie "Hodet Over Vannet" is a great comedy movie that gave me an 8/10 score. It's not just a language translation, but some events absurd chains completely skip through stealing the original character of the movie and making it "oops where I go my pants".
