Now, I have not read the original story here to get to know all the literary points that went wrong, so I will not go down that path. <br /> <br /> But I've learned a lot of long ago I've learned that Stephen King has shot horror movies, maybe a couple of exceptions. This was not one of them. He started well, and once I did not complain about the actor, even as Fred Gwynne was the usual. Although I will also forgive parents' abilities, here they were necessary to advance the story. ... <br /> <br /> But I could not help but a consistent point, but I was annoyed. And that was very close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters performed the stupid activity. The moments we have mentioned here are: There is a small zombie around the house. You think it's under the bed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < next to the bed, before hiding the cover before raising the cover, your whole body reveals much damage to the dangerous dead months, or <br /> <br /> (b) move from one bed to the bottom of the fully open, little security to see a greater or at least horrified fear. reaction time <br /> <br /> I know, let's go. I want to dedicate myself to murder today. Bleh <br /> <br /> Even a pretty funny movie ... It's just not terrifying.
