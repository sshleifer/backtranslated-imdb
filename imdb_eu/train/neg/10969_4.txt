Perhaps I'm not known or I do not know what Electra is in the current publications ... But I read that Electra was much more manipulative and it always seems to have a plan. Normally he used others to make dirty work and was often not involved in a double cruise. When you think that you think, wool pulls your eyes and thinks it gets its way. <br /> <br /> This movie was quite weak in the interview, the performance was not particularly compelling and action. it was rough I was looking for something more in line with Frank Miller's "Electra Assassin" book. This movie is much darker than anything else. <br /> <br /> The special effect, where cool, sometimes was an interesting act, but it is often not as logical or slow as story or drawing. Tha Hand was not sufficiently threatening, and Electra was not enough ... She is a girl who loves hatred ... but in this story I do not mind heartily.
