This is the worst movie I've ever seen !!!! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say I never saw this movie worse! <br /> <br /> <br /> And I never did !!! "B" is a great hobby for horror movies. As you can see ... I have suffered some of the worst possible movies that the film industry has to offer. <br /> <br /> This movie has been taken under the title. I mean ... a real horror of horror "Vampires vs Zombies" ??? The "dead" images that are "dead" danced in my head. I thought ... "I have to see this" !!!! <br /> <br /> Well ... let's forgive ... "I would not see this". !!!!! <br /> <br /> The title of this film is at least very misleading. There was no vampire zone fighting. In fact, there's no plot !!!! You should ask me to ask about this film so I can not say honestly! <br /> <br /> There was no plot !!!! <br /> <br /> It was not the story! <br /> <br /> This movie has no sense! !! The money they put into this project, surely, do not make sense of business!
