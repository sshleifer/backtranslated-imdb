** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> This is a BAD movie. Serious Being absolutely awesome, FX is wonderful and the plot is horrible. But yes, it's so bad to watch it funny! The script is very bad, that's nice! You just need to make lines and laughter, for example "It's the same thing you call CROCTEASING." cream for women ... I mean, that's funny, that's so bad! We have fun jokes! But after a while, the movie becomes like a vacuum. I started sleeping. Trust me, however, you're laughing for a long time with a plastic croaker that tightens on the leaves and a constant leak of a cream stomach. Even though I had to say that the crocodile had a huge part in it, he made it hang on to what he did. Heh heh mindless movie must be named on MST3K!
