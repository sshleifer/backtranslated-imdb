There is nothing to compare with vampires. Zombies ... I try to judge this movie in any area of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the special effects were respiratory. When there was an explosion on the TV screen, I thought that my house would burst, and when the automatic machines were fired, I thought they were entering the ground near the shells. My friends just shocked you. <br /> <br /> But the worst case of Jack Black's soundless monologue, I almost never killed, but do not worry. Movie that overcomes the film that must be "must be high". Seriously, he did not realize that thoughts were not nonsensical, he should have "added" to justify his terrifying behavior. Well, if you want to play it if you want to get a great excuse, if you talked about writers, directors, executive producers, sponsors, you would probably get the same answer ... seriously. <br /> <br /> I was impressed with a production group "Shock-o-Branch", I did not put a hand-shot rifle in my mouth, and after a terrible excuse to play the movie I finished my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie, then you must kill it <br /> <br /> Your, <br /> <br /> General
