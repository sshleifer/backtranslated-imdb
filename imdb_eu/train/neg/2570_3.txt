"I read a son with my girl soup" with Peter Sellers. Watching the movie, I'm not surprised. Almost nothing happens in the movie. It seems that Sellers and Goldie Hawn have the same presence in the movie; It is not. The whole movie has shot at random, just like everything happened without scripting anything. I do not want everyone to watch hippie in all the middle-aged movies, but this one gives them a pretty bad name. <br /> <br /> In the end, Sellers and Hawn have starred. Much better than movies, so do not miss out on this time. Disgusted
