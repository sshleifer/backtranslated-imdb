View on 1/27/2009 05/27 - 10-4 (Dir - Harold Young): 3. The universal mummy movie is similar to the first two of the second, as the final result of the viewer's vision. The story is similar and the results are ho-hum. This time the story's location is in the U.S., because it is sending a new Mum from Egypt's priest, who plans to kill the children of our native tomb. This time, the mummy plays Lon Chaney (which does not make much difference, since she has not really asked for much more character for this character). The new priest has become a bunch in the town and sends it to the mummy to make his dirty deeds, after feeding the leaves of the tannins. Again, a little girl goes into the way, as the priest falls to a future fianc√©, and wants to, well ... she must be immortal with her (do not we hear it before?). The plan, of course, frustrates citizens while mummy hunts with linternadun boys (like Frankenstein's monster) and the burning creature ends the story ... how to get a sequel? Will you meet with the next series next? or not .....
