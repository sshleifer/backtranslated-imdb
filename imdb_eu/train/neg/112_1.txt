This movie is horrible. John Ritter is practically falling, 75% delivered by the actors were reading from Cue's cards, bad editing, huge sound mixing (a tough conversation in receiving background noise) and a real plot. do it nowhere I did not think this would have been said, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actor in this movie. At least 3 other whites are in it. Patti Hansen gives lines to Ben Stein's passion. I started wondering if I was dead. Bogdanovich's children are also awesome (the oldest is definitely reading their lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. One good thing is that Bogdanovich can not get another project until four years later. Please do not see it. If you watch it on your television charts, cancel the cable. If a friend suggests you, review your friendship. If you want to see your spouse, it is better to find another soul. I would rather shake my eyes, sit down again through this piece of rubbish. If I have a single word for this movie, this would be the word: Suckotrocity
