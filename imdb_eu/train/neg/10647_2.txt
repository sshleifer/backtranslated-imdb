The latest Tarzan is a bad look at Johnny Weissmuller (a successor to "Tarzan and Huntress" years). However, curiosities may be better to add. It is clear that RKO has tried to greet Weissmuller in a beautiful Mexican landscape with the greatest star in that country (Andrea Palma) and with the award-winning filmmaker Gabriel Figueroa and the famous composer Dimitri Tiomkin. score Although less expensive for foreigners, the RKO series is more expensive than any other movie, taking advantage of the real pyramids like Acapulco Beaches and Aquatania, and spectacular scenes related to the temple of the Balu god. especially the exterior, made in rugged rocks.) He forced Kurt Neumann as director, instead of Robert Florey, who gave him a slow pace. Neumann performed "Tarzan and Amazons", "Tarzan and Leopard Woman" and "Tarzan and the Huntress", and finished his career before directing the classic "The Fly" before his death; Florey was the television director, but he made a number of notable films. If Weissmuller is tired, Cheeta does not play as good as the others, but the worst character is Benji, listening to the cartoonist's evil (caribbean air and a shot in Mexico). ) It was boring and full of doubt, Weissmuller's Tarzan was a sad greeting.
