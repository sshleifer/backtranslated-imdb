I want to make it clear - I love Michael Vartan! This movie really leaves. His activity is still excellent, as charming as ever, and still looks good. But the same movie is a waste load! Natasha Henstridge, if I tell him pardon, he comes from a younger man ... waiting for you to escape with his best friend, his little sub-story is strange. I myself and my family (they sat with me and watched the movie with me) also changed the movie soundtrack; From time to time music was not in the scene. However, this was not the worst part of what I think is an unpleasant film. I apologized for forgiveness of the main pardon, I forgave the curious figures that were thrown into confusion, and I could not forgive what the music had helped, but that was the opportunity to cut off the entire section of the film. and jump straight to the end ??? It was finally predicted from the beginning, but the way it is achieved is undoubtedly left. If you're a fan of Michael Vartan, jump on this movie: buy yourself a poster.
