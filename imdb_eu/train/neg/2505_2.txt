I have seen enough with Little Richard in conversations and performances, and Leon, the poor in the 50s / 60s, compiled music biopics that Leon did not play this role as the best actor. Leon was the subject of David Ruffin's The Temptations, but failed to capture the essence of Little Richard in this film. <br /> <br /> The actress Miguel Núñez, in front of Richard Txiki, "Why do they fall in love with the stupid ones?" It was a better chance, because he was a powerful but effeminate musician. <br /> <br /> If there are no shows, there will be movies too. And that has happened here. They're homosexuality and voyeurism LR-shaped or lost. The group "The Temptations", which has made great progress in capturing the warts and everything, is a great mark. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the director Robert Townsend "Hollywood Shuffle" went well? It is very clever and fun, but he did not make the first effort.
