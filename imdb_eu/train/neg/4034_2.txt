Oh dear. Cast is good, but writing and editing is art and making sense and correct is a bit of a task. In order to do good comedy, you need to get the best time and moment. I did not put everything in, I laughed the parts there, but this was rarely. The main task was to listen to me freely in the conversation, some made them annoying in the film. The best sound may be when you type on scripts, but getting it done and taking the camera is another task. And the hand-made camcorder gives little energy to the film. The general management was good, but the script was not everything, but I'm sure that you're thinking that reading the script was good at the head. I'm sorry.
