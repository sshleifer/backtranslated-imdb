Sam Mraovich never touches a camera again. If so, he ought to be arrested, at least as regards deceit. Everyone who gives a waste of money to rent will have to claim and compensate. This is my "work" I first saw ... and it will be the last. Ed Wood just got a good look at me right now. <br /> <br /> Returning to the temporary video store, I will ask you to personally take it out from the shelf. Active gay film, I am very keen and annoyed, that is, being a valiant and hateful man to give me permission to distribute and pack something like that (with a nice marble cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, fortunately, nothing). Other IMDb documentation some) and on the back an interesting synopsis, used as bait, and then rented as a "movie". Believe it, there's no need to be anywhere from anywhere; Just the movie is not the sense of the word. Effective efforts to promote and protect gay films such as offensive and irresponsible bundles can be harmful (hell, in general, right-wing!) If you are tempting to rent this cover, you will be disappointed. Gabel is not terrific as the movie is on the cover, and it appears once or twice without the shirt, that is. Instead, the home of Mroavich makes us foolish and impudent. <br /> <br /> This "thing" that "collected" is the reverse side of Mraovitch. Both, he and his friend Michael Habousch (as I understand, put rare similar rubbish) is so huge. Mraovich deliberately fails all the non-talents (in all areas), disappointed with a "loser" who can pay attention to himself. He must be compassionate.
