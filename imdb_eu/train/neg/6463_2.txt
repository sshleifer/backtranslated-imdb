At night, I saw the Free Money and 90 minutes of my life. With an interesting image, I really thought it was nice to me - especially that I'm a fan of Brando. WRONG! What talent loss! Sometimes it's a shame to watch at some moments (like a farmer's scene), and so many missed options for mood configurations (why did not they show Charlie Sheen's character to remove Brando's truck?) Is a Slapstick comedy, but I did not buy that. Skip this. Only the toughest fans of Brando. <br /> <br /> I give 10 to 10, I still think that the worst film ever made was Skidoo.
