This film was a great prize, because it was so much a premise, because of the three friendship women covered by a younger man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No! I want to add it. These women are very caricatured, not very well suited to each other and conspiring from each other and bringing each other. but here they are given a dull script and they are said to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which does not work well for those who are well-known professionals of a very small town. <br /> <br /> And Smart Women spend all of their time lamenting the lack of men / sex / lack of lust. I felt a lot more decent scriptwriter and more strained, lesbian subplots were not there anymore and smoking / drinking women (all seventy-five years old) were very realistic - even baby - Turn the baby, give me a cigar! Right. <br /> <br /> As I said, the shame of a waste. 10 to 4
