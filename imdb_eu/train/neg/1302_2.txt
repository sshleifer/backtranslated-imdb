This movie is like any other Dutch film, so you enjoy movies like Turks' daughters and de Kleine Blondes. Then you can agree with that (even though both stories and actors are much better) Zomerhitte begins to be strong, but it does not have to do with the story that ends in a good scene. There are many minds (but I and others could not find this girl attractive), the conversation is dark (as we were terrified by other movie stars), and some scenes are quite random. For any more unwanted comedy than any other (an owl such as a scene that violates the owl's eye-catcher) has nothing to do with, and then it is later mentioned in a sentence, "what did you hear? I was there". The only reason I gave him 2 is because it's some of the places that are nice ... that's it. And I saw the reason that we were in front of the rumor (here in Holland we have a strange system in front of the previews, we pay less money for a conventional movie and you do not know what movie you are watching. However, it is not yet a new movie theaters. It's far from this movie, if you want to see a truly Dutch movie, temmink or zwartboek.
