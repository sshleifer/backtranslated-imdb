I'm sorry. Someone must say. This is really a sad movie. Maybe it's likely, but sad. I was almost bored when I cried. The performance is quite horrifying, drawn and predictable, with a totally standard and inaccurate score and camera work. It's one of the films that you're not allowed to be from a hate (but only those with disabilities) but I hate I suspect that almost everyone does. It's interesting that the critics have been so honest with this film. I also believe that objectivity is not allowed. This is a reward to win, that is, I remember. But it was not interesting or entertaining. I have not seen the play, so I can not compare it.
