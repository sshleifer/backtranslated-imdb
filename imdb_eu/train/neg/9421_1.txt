If you want to see it in the Mel Gibson Million Dollar Hotel, you can enjoy seeing it in a different genre of Burt Reynolds, in a never-ending movie. I can only certify the DVD version, so the VHS version is of a better quality, but the movies are dark-skinned scenes that seem to be so badly all red. I first thought that my DVD player was confused. It was not. You can keep watching, until I recommend that your television color be black and white. If you do not, you can never go through the movie. Doing this will remind you of what filmmakers who try to recover Pulp Fiction style.
