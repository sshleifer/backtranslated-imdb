The movie was sucked, it was not fun, it was not exciting. It was so bad that it was good, but it failed. and next to the thought that I would like to enjoy this movie, this movie is the only reason to succeed ... <br /> <br /> At this moment, 50% have voted for 10 since this movie seems pretty good for me, as movies make fake publicity, This vote is not realistic, it can have many reasons and should be worked on. However, it is less than the average movie that flourished in oral advertising. Success can be described as marketing miracle.
