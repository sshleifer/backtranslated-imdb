I had a bad movie The original Phantasm had a great atmosphere and mystery. Like horror films of the 70s, he produced a fabulous and unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, at the end of the 80's, pumped the action, but kept the humor funny. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is awesome. Tediously explains all the weird things happening in previous films, which is less than their power to expand. The first image of Phantasm degrades the shamelessness, like the original re-creation as cheap. There are several areas for flying in this movie, more deaths seem like death threatening orbs. Hundreds of days hang on the ceiling like the Christmas balls that are on the sketch. Would not you, the owner, the DP, the editor, the director ... warn you or take care of it so crunchy? Even worse, Phantasm III presents another well-known and unknown joke after the other. How diffused the intensity of the first movie is. The original Phantasm used humor to pay attention to death. Phantasm III uses death to create many templates on Reggie's breath: several films refer to "flying", "flying", "balls", balls. The crews might be kicking those jokes, but they are with us.
