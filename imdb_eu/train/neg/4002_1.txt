Social commentaries were reflected in that whole way and the mystery itself was built and resolved, it was completely unbelievable by some unexpected illusions. Fitz's personal life has not changed anything in the last decade, which is remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> Moreover, I could hardly understand why he complained about Australia's stay, compared to the possibility of solving mysteries in England. Can not you tell about Australian police? It is a very artificial territory that seems to be involved in crime research. <br /> <br /> The final episodes of the original series were pretty melodramatic and impossible, sometimes limiting dizziness, which takes the mantle. return to the serial axis. Sad
