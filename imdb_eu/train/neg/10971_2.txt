In my opinion, this Irish critician is so funny about this movie. Irish Irish actor rolls up the usual bands for all Irish films. Awesome recording with character needs (brown sauce). Everything in Dublin is romantic enough to make everything bad. 'Ah, attitude, mirror, but surely not the same'. Only a nonsense for public Americans (the supermarket's chief and for that reason they forced the phrase). And the coffin was nail Colm Meaney's character. A great actor had to play the role he played for a five-year-old boy. Cringeworthy things. The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and it's a bad thing to say. Well, at least he did not put on a great American accent. Warning to international audiences: be at home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. You'll have better time. The ticket is an outward route
