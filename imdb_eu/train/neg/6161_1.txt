This is probably a movie that has never been done in the fight against obstacles. This is not a sports fence but poor, but in the plot, the characters are so weak because they have to throw their sex scenes half-naked and later they dance around a scene fenced in a skier club. I think the interest of the audience is maintained. The tale of F. Murray was the talents of Abraham. Zoro on a more sharp one, you play with rugged movies like Scaramouche, because it has an evil Basil Rathbone. As a true fencer, I know it's impossible to catch a movie as a sport, but it always happens that the characters are cooler, drawn and deeply drawn.
