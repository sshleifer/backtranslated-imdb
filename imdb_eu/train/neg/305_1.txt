I'm glad I saw this movie when Mr.Sandler became famous. <br /> <br /> It's bad ... bad, bad, bad There are no plots. It's like watching the sad home movie. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy other movies ... but if you're a fan of me ... stay away. Adam can change thoughts. This movie may not be horrible ... I'd rather have time to play in the old house ...
