The confusing melodrama of William Gibson, created by John Houseman, directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark has taken on a huge rural retreat, where his wife's wife fights Lillian Gish as a self-appointed king's bee. In addition, Widmark is looking at the new Lauren Bacall employee's masterpiece. husband and son. Strict and confusing, set in an inseparable time and place, and hidden in the "love of David and Lisa" in the movie movie. Widmark and Bacall have a good chemistry together, but this script builds nothing. Within a few hours, most conversations have to be done about drapes hanging in the library (this is not symbolism, but a penetrating mystery). This image is intended to show attempts to reach people when people are working differently and think it's a good idea, but unfortunately Minnelli is not an informational, clear or entertaining story. ** ****
