I recently watched this movie because it was a friend who brought it to NYC. After 30 minutes, I said: "You must be joking. Is there a joke?" He thought it was good. I said I thought it was one of the most beautiful movies I ever made. "What should be?" I asked. "A children's propaganda movie?" Plots are stupid. The play never dominates the main ones and, in any case, look at the trips of the city, and it also has a terrific view of life, love or even life ... we need some psychiatric. help Please, if somebody wants to link this to your DVD or Video Player, consider it as a virus included in your computer ... it will not destroy your player, but it will spoil you in the afternoon. If they had made Razzies in the 40s, he won each category. (PS is also called "Stairway to Heaven").
