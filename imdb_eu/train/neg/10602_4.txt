This movie is mostly shit and it's worth seeing that movie is the star of Jean-Claud Vam Damme. In this short film, some good acts are among the best of the best films. <Br /> <br /> It's a very bad act on this movie and I'm the worst actor I've ever seen and Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White 2 actors can not play on ALL. And this movie must be between Jean. Claud Vam Dammes has made the worst film and what he saw in his brilliant movie, and you should watch the bloodstream, KickBoxer or sudden death. <br /> <br /> All this movie is crap / OK and it's over me. The score is 10 to 10.
