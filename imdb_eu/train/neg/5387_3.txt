It seemed very interesting for a moment, it never came. <br /> <br /> People go from one point to another, they really do not have any point ((if there is one very sad). There was no action, nothing or horror and the characters were quite disturbed, so they did not care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> Everything was boring with the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If it were not music, it did not annoy me as some bad films and the acting was not horrible.
