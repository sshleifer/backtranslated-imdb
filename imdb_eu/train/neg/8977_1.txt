A singer from a country called "Big T" seriously threatens his musical career and his life with a buzzing drunk who wants to be his director. Her mother committed suicide, her father is also an alcoholic and has a violent nature. You can imagine where it leads. In the meantime, there are a lot of music, Parton, who has light vocal songs, will excite the song song (at least half a dozen from Texas). Take care of this mess and look at NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS.
