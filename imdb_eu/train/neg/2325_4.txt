First scanners may not be a great movie, but at least it was original. There's no news for him. The performance is worse, in my opinion, and the story is slower and nothing special. As a conversation and special effects are not better than the original ones. This is less than what is the first movie. The only thing that matters is that it is sometimes loud and chaotic. make a good movie If it were something better and interesting, the movie could be decent. I was not really able to cross everything quickly without forwarding it from me, this is forgotten. movie, not much more. That's why movies are worse. In generosity, Scanners will give 2 and 4/10.
