The story: Young-goon has a history of her family's mental illness. He ends up in a mental institution after believing that he is a cyborg. In the organization Park knows Sun, a young man who develops a connection with him. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this, you probably know what the Chan-wook Park talent is. But "I am a cyborg ..." from the well-known territory and (unfortunately) it starts with a stronger one. I am a fan of any movie or story that is trying to do something different. God knows, we all suffer damage to our local cinemas. The main point in the movie I have to say is not to say anything about mental illness or to create the characters that matter to you. <br /> <br /> This story has to be one of the rarest things I've seen for years ... but it's not quite curious. No heart of the movies ... just surrealists and confusion. Confusion seems to be the main theme of the movie. All characters try to make reasonable attempts on their problems, but Chan-wook Park is confused.
