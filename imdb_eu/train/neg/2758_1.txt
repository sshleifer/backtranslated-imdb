I will give this movie because there are no negative numbers in the IMDb scoring system. The movie was horrible. It was very bad, the story was badly written, the action was incredible. Without a doubt, the rescue army could fight too badly. I do not write any plot, because the movie is not enough to ruin the plot. Writing comments on the plot would not be a problem. If compared to this movie, I should compare it with the Reign of Fire. However, I did not like Reign of Fire, even if it was better than that. <br /> <br /> The people of the theater stopped halfway before the movie. I had no reason, I just did not think. I expected a CGI party and mastery of fights, but this did not happen. Martial arts had a duration of 30 seconds, and this was the result of the exercise routine, which was very disappointing. CGI did not work correctly. A scene comes to mind. During one of the first deposits, the troops do nothing. Someone's animated boys forget about cinema in the streets of this movie because the street was not bad. Also, I joked the joke's voice in The Mummy movies of Imotep. The same thing happened again. (Someone said some goodies, here?) Since I mentioned the fight scene, I know that this is a spoiler, but I suppose it only for purists. <br /> <br /> Do not see, do not even buy when the DVD comes out. You have been warned
