This was the biggest fear I've ever seen. I am open minded guy and I always love a good horror movie. In fact, when I'm renting movies, I'm looking for good-looking movie horror. They always laugh, I know, I've seen a lot. But the movie was so horrible, but it did not come to mind. It was about to turn off in the first five minutes ... I probably should have been. There's nothing good about it, first of all, the camera team $ $. The inauguration was stupid as it was at the end. The effects and special effects were awful. Please ask, do not see this movie, you totally hate it.
