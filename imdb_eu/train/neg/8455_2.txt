"Arahan" is nothing positive for the Kung Fu genre. This confusing mixture is comparable to the insanity and quality inspired by Stephen Chow's films. <br /> <br /> First of all, fight scenes are nothing new. Everything presented here has been made by Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. The struggles between intelligent images of motion require logic. It seems that there are no points that cause bumps that do not cause harm to the "Matrix" sequences. <br /> <br /> So-Yi Yoon seduced an attractive female seduction, but never had to conquer the physical demands of the role. Ziyi Zhang made it so easy at the "Flying Daggers" home. Martial Arts background works well in Kung Fu movies. In these abilities, it is a serious mistake with inexperienced actors (see Aya Ueto "Asumi") as a talented director, "Arahan" proves that Seung-wan Ryoo is not.
