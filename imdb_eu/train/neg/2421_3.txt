A "cheaper than a dozen" successful ABC family attempt is a crisp conversation, plot lines, and whirlwind curses. Among the many who want to give us two good actors, this movie was disappointing. It's a Hollywood script for his bad plot. Then, because they needed a lot of actors, they would probably be more. So the performance was not five stars. The land was moving quite quickly, and the bad ones were bad and they had a great time. The connection between characters and "endings" was also very nervous and trace for me. Pay yourself and rent something better.
