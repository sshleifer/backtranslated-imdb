This movie, which was felt among the descendants of the specialties, was lower and a smaller budget. I think this was a kind of inspirational movie, but it did not matter to me. preachy.it has very clear shades of Flash Dance, but what? No excitement in this movie. The conversation was made to death and was punished. Of course, the whole movie is a 80's joke. The interpretation was less of a star, but it has a lot to do with the work provided by actors (or in this case not), at the top of which there are not enough songs, with very bad lyrics. All the participating actors have a lot of talent, but you can not tell about this movie. This is, of course, my opinion, but I must give it a Flying AKA Dream 1/10
