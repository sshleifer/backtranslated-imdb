I've seen recently the movie and have been high expectations. The director was not so much before making a movie release, but based on his work. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (protagonist of Body double, masterpiece Brian De Palma) have starred in brilliant films. It's not together, and that's not exactly why it's changed. <br /> <br /> The film is incredible, very predictable and topical. The only thing that can be exciting is to choose shot locations. In my low opinion, do not miss this time.
