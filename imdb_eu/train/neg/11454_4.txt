So, I had little expectations for this movie from the beginning, but it was impossible to meet them as well. Although there are some fun parts, even if one or two of them are scattered, this very good movie does not mean good. The most fun jokes were unexpected and very fast, leaving them seated, "WTF just happened?" Besides, there were some jokes, and again and again. I started breaking the section that was falling down the mountain. Also, the edition was really lacking. There were bad scenes of transition, but it seems that it is today's style. She laughed at me, but I would not see it again, and I'm very happy to wait for you to rent me. Choose, you can enjoy it, but do not think it's like a 40-year-old virgin or something like Superbad.
