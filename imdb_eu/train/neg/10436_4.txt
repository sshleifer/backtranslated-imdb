In the 1930s, they documented documentary films on remote spots around the world; Wild animals, exotic lands and primitive cultures have been highlighted. Although they were logistics to move a group of movies to a distant place, they later survived (with the footage of the film), these films were often much cheaper than the usual Hollywood functions. Bands, costumes or high-end movie stars. <br /> <br /> The best-known authors (artistically and economically) of these films were made by documentaries, Martin E. Johnson and Osa, as their wife. African and Asian events). Johnson's safari movies were very popular, inspiring parodies ... Wheeler & Woolsey is called "So This is Africa", where Esther Muir plays a very sexya character, Johnson-Martini, instead of Martin E. Johnson. , geddit?). Although other filmmakers produced Safari documentaries at this time, Johnsons's films were most popular in this genre, which was very much in love with humor. Viewed from the perspective of the viewpoints, Johnson's serious documentary is a mistake: there are not too many scenes. In it, people who are brown or yellow, funny little girls are stupid. White Johnson and his wife. <br /> <br /> The outstanding assets of these films are the presence of Osa Johnson. The ten year younger of his husband seems to be a young enough boy to be his daughter. Although Esther Muir is not as gentle as blonde and blonde, Osa Johnson gave her great performances on all the movies she filmed with her. <br /> <br /> 'Congorilla' probably has the best Johnson movies. The maps of the Congo are of interest and have some historical value due to the appearance of the environment in 3097. Trees and other natives are also very interesting, even though Johnsons's events can be organized in such a way. The natives make wild and strange looks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The best (and most entertaining) scene of 'Congorilla' is an improvised sequence. (It's the Dance of the Black Ground, no less ... the same dance that Bob Hope gave to celebrities given by Daisy and Violet Hilton). Jodhpurs, horseback riding and helmet, Osa Johnson begins to sings on high steps and strikes her knees when trying to teach this dance to African women. Meanwhile, they are watching over there, looking at what a mad white woman is trying to achieve. It's a very fun scene, but it has unpleasant agitation. Osa Johnson is telling the black Americans to dance - this implication seems to be that black Africans are instinctively in need of a short demonstration to do this dance (I think it's a natural rhythm) because it's in their blood or something. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give 10 points to 'Congorilla' from point 4. This film tells a little about African life in the 1930s, and in that decade it tells more about American cultural perceptions.
