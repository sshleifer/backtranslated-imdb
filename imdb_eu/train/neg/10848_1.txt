In all matters, the movie could be interesting. The filthy mighty character of Filth, as a protagonist of Dani, and as a "horror future, I expected Alex Chandon's gore party. <br /> <br /> I was there. wrong <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is dialectal or inept. The story anthology setup was made to death (and much better) in the 70s and 80s. Actually, the idea of ​​"patient room" sent my backbone, but most of the films left scriptwriting and bad plays. <br /> <br /> Chandon can not write a conversation. Every single phrase with the senior police investigator is filled with censorship and insolence (the usual 'police' edge 'funny formula, I'm sure I saw it somewhere else ...) Chandon is not you Tarantino. . Or Scorsese. It seems. Add stupidly OTT with a very dodgy casting (I'm not wrong, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician, but he is not an actor) and performances are not hilarious that goes beyond the past cringing. Bruce Campbell gave me every day. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are poor, with some CGI atrocious, gory effects (welcome, Peter Jackson ten years ago and less budget) and filter filters OVER-USE! Cradle Of Filth's misuse of use of the scores ... man, they must sue. <br /> <br /> The basic problem of fear is taken seriously, trying to create an atmosphere and create fear. the power of its audiences horror films too many in the seventies and the 80s make it much better than far more gore effects (for example: maniac, eating zombie meat, beyond, sighing etc), rendering Belief Cradle, in my head, secondary and outdated. <br /> <br /> I hope that Chandon can learn from this horrible ghost of a movie and frighten him with horror that really frightens him. <br /> <br /> Better luck next.
