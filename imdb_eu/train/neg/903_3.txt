The "Stella Dallas" 1937 with Barbara Stanwyck did not live well; Because someone would have a semi-renewed story as a puzzler. Perhaps, Bette Midler thought they might be annoying, but this script defeated him. A picture about a woman who is married to a wife of a married couple, and a few years later giving the girl a wealthy child's dad, will shoot a better life, she can not run away to escape the old trappings and feelings. Midler works better with a film director who can control his abuses, but that is not happening here; Stephen Collins is a strong man who changes life, but Trini Alvarado is the daughter of Midler. This is called "a woman's image", a rumor, but it does not gather, because at the beginning of the 1930s she was loyal. * 1/2 ****
