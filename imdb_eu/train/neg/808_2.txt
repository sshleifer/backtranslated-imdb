A very entertaining movie based on James Michener. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando's performance was even worse. Southern drawing was ridiculous. When I laughed when I talked, it seemed like he would come home from an old southern lady. Brando, so great in the previous films, was dispersed here. Tyrone Power, called "In the testimony of the accusation," should be named best actor instead of Brando. <br /> <br /> The film, about racism, attempted to prevent the US government from marrying US marriages. and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando was a rock across the movie. With the opposite of these relations between women, she finds love with an Asian woman. His emotions and conversations were difficult to protect from these new approaches. <br /> <br /> The Lord only knows why they received Red Buttons and Miyoshi the Witnesses for their Oscars for their performances. Performance was not something spectacular. The Umeki screen was a short look and did not represent something in its own right. The best performance of this film was made by Miiko Taka, as Brando's love affair. He showed great emotion as the American woman had found love with Brando. His face was engraved with the misfortune that his father and brother had lost during the War War. He realized that the dance did not go out of his life. <br /> <br /> Martha Scott, the Hebrew mother of Yobobel, "The Ten Commandments", was initially interested in Brando's love for the end of his mother. Together with Ricardo Montalban, his performance was wasted. Due to the first love of Patricia Owens Brando, she showed her profound and credible performance.
