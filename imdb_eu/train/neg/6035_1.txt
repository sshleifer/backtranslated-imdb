I really want the vote I can give negative, because I was wasting some 83 years of life, seeing the worst film of horror ever shot. The deed was immensely horrible, REALLLYYYY bad meant, the conversation was worse, as the scripts were written ... I can not say something horrible. And do you think that "away" is taking days and "inside" the days spent over the course of several days. Very well played, directed, written, etc., etc. NEVER KNOW ABOUT ALL THE COSTS. If only one grace of my grace to keep away from hell is a good deed, I do not look at the world at all. This movie has never been seriously considered by horror films.
