This movie is not programmed in Italian cinema, I have seen in the "fantafestival" exhibition. It seems incredible to me because some scenes seem chaotic and obscure music videos, the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculous and there is no suspicion. film The music story is completely out of the box and I do not have words to describe the visual effects. Looking at the first scene, I think it's interesting for the movie, but a few minutes later it becomes busy. The story is interesting, but development needs a complete review.
