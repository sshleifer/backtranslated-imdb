Greet again from darkness. What has happened to Barry Levinson? The director of both groups of "Avalon" and "Diner" directed two. He also had good films ("Rainman"), but it was always interesting ... so far. The worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is boring. "Envy" is a boring definition. It's never a big hobby of the murmur ("Dumb and Dumber"), I was surprised at how horrible this movie was. There are 2 laughter that you can do for a long time. The best part of the movie is Redbone's sound title song. If the movie song and songs were written, it would be acceptable. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actor and I know everyone wants to do comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world explains some weaknesses. The SNL member, Amy Poehler, is the most common member of his trailer park over the fact that he is the trash princess. The movie's disaster is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first works come together, but the chemical disappears as a result of a fake script. This script is like most of Jack Black's idea of ​​the character - it's not a bad thought, but there's no hope of success.
