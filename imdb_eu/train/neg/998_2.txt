The synopsis of the generic movie is more than enough information about the movie itself. I could not see the movie that I could not find in details on the "plot summary" on the movie page. I constantly protected myself to find out what I had lost sight of and what I could tell (bleep) about what was happening. Oh, it's useless that this movie can take awesome pieces of the story, if you've called a story. As they tried to think about some types of films here, it's enough to shoot the rest of the story and the rest of the imagination. Newswire for creators: I decided to make a movie. I sit at home and imagine plots and lines for free. And Rosario Dawson? I have never had enough attention to give someone a name and why I see it. He has had one of the most eminent performances I've ever seen in an A or B movie show. Aay B. I arrived right, maybe he did not want to do the job, he just got a great deal to make the movie. Enter? Wrong One of the producers was named. The next time you produce something, do not play yourself as a book. If you can really create a decent character you want to become. In addition, someone mentioned here on white / latin theme - yes, I mean, but this movie is like a vengeance act against vengeance-like men with baseball hats. Here's what the movie does to show latent characters in the film with nothing. Adrian's character seems like a jerk fool who is no better than antagonist. Regarding the Maya nature, there was no real character. However, I am ashamed that Hollywood has made this film.
