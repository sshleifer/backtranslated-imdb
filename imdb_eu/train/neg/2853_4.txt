Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is the owner of the mafia, leaving a mental organization in the gangster world. How can directors make a director with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very wonderful), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and the loss of time? This movie is not a funny comedy, it's a constellation to be cast. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Prazer em Matar-te!' ('Pleasure Please Kill!') <br /> <br />
