I did not say anything else, but it was horrible. I can not imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this mess. And if some people do not want their actors to question their sexuality, maybe they should do more for that movie. At least I had a look at the jewelry. Only my opinion. She thought of thinking about the film. SHUDDER made this film to ask what happened to the cast of the actors. Shudder led the minds of thinking process and voyeurism. As I said before, before his disgusting mess. It's not fun As Ebert told Malcolm McDowell about Caligula, it's not a good movie, no good story, and no good porn. YEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
