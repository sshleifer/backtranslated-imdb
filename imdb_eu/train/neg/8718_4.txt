In the third part of the "Carnosaur" trilogy, Keystone Kops military quality command tries to kill both Velociraptors and a T-Rex. I give four sympathy and dinosaurs from my passion. The movie is definitely the worst trilogy, it can not really be taken seriously. More importantly, however, when I watch this movie I can not help you find interesting ones like "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" trilogies. The first part of two franchises is a dark and disturbing film that has become a cult classic. Second, "Alien" is a ripoff, and the third on cheeks, almost slapstick (intentionally or not) is a movie. You laugh when you laugh at the ground. Similarly, as a "Xtro" franchise, all the films "Carnosaur" are not completely linked. They only carry the name of "Franchise", I will interest the "follow-ups". Obviously, there are two production groups "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" here, but if you have seen all three of the three movie franchises, you are playing both sideways.
