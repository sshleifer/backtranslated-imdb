The waste of my life ... the director must be ashamed. why do they feel that people need to make dirty movies do not make sense. When he was dead he laughed at me. I had to change regularly in many movies when I watched the poor performances that were shameless in the whole movie. Fortunately, the guy that played Heath has never gotten back to work. That is why I expect that the director will never get another movie and will recover his vote. {10.0
