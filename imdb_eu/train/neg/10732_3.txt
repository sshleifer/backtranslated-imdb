"4" continues the life of three (non-four) strangers who will find Russian movies one night in the local bar. It's a musician, an ice cream vendor and a call. <br /> <br /> "4", I think, is intended to showcase the nature and imbalance of post-Soviet Russia (the characters have to make stories more interesting than their lives), but the film is so inconsistent and boring It may be that I will be able to sit a whole lot of people all the way. There seems to be a suggestion over the film that the dreaded staging behind Russian dark governments - using secret cloning installations, selling frozen decades of flesh, etc. - is so uncertain and incomprehensible. Anyone can find out who is really here. <br /> <br /> Although it is a fair activity and with a fairly correct set of scenes, "4" is a two-hour long competition, because it has to be avoided at all costs.
