In the 1980s, a bad television program was released and soft-core became a porn movie. Oh, my God was bad. The plot of each character was of little importance. The plot does not mean. I think something about a stalker. Does he shoot at last? It is not clear, but somehow there is a volleyball game. And the main character (Randy) sleeps a lot around. This movie was the only reason that my friends rented me was Casper Van Dien, and they wanted to quickly explore the scenes with him. Thank you God did not spend any money, but I want the time of my life.
