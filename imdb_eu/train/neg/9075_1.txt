In this movie, Slackers are three friends of Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel, respectively), graduates of the University, even though they are sitting in an honest study to finish successfully. It continues until that is the end, as it is difficult, but Nathan (Schwartzman) represents the most pleasant film. Nathan has begun to make blackmail with a girl of her dreams, because she can not get it in ordinary conditions. The only problem when the trio begins, Dave is in love with Angela (James King) with a beautiful and good heart. Unfortunately, this is not a great genre. Schwartzman's movie is easy to see. King's performance is average, I think he's hired just around with a beautiful look. Slackers reminds American Pie with other directions. Jokes are very small at American Pie. But are they not used? This movie is intended to warn filmmakers of non-original origin. In general, some moments of smiles, but a horrible acting movie (except Schwartzman) and the subject. * outside *****
