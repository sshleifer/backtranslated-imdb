Well, how do you value such a movie? Do you also have cinema value? It's a movie that tries to approach as much as possible. Basically, the whole movie is just a bunch of torturing a young girl. It's not very attractive or even realistic. <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems that the movie has been as realistic and emotional as possible. However, the movie is false, in order to carry it out. Wrinkles and outlets are smooth and fake, as well as sounds. Often they only have to enter the ground, but rather than the little girl, of course. The manner in which they respond to all the hardships of women is quite fair. I mean that if that were true, it would probably scream. There are still more clues than one of these. <br /> <br /> The movie budget is a small budget, of course, which is something that is moving and realistic, original and powerful, with very limited resources. Do not think this movie has been much impact on the release date, although it had to do something right, since all six of these films were released. <br /> <br /> Blows and fans Gorek is likely to be disappointed with this movie, although there are still some fetishes to shoot from this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
