Like many others, I commented here before me, I have to say that this movie is bad, but I did not see the worst. Lands or sequences of movies in this comment will not be directly referenced because they hate spoilers. <br /> <br /> I had a feeling that I was watching a television show or something, wherever they held. I spent $ extra $$$ on CGI (I've seen them worse) ... In the end, the viewer's insult is quite enough, if you have knowledge about at least computer and / or technology. . I feel too comfortable with these moments of insolence, and when I'm done I find myself quickly - halfway through. In addition, there are many scenarios in "easy way", as well as a man who thinks about your intelligence as well ... <br /> <br /> This movie compares with the old "Wargames". and I think it's wrong to call a sequel. <br /> <br /> My two stars, one thing and the only thing: the performances of the actors are not half-bad. the heated noise of a script that they had to work on. However, they never signed into this movie. It's not really a career movement, but I think all of the bills we pay. <br /> <br /> This movie has a higher score ... You must have a studio paycheck or something. my only explanation. <br /> <br /> Everyone who has not seen this: by the way, see and do it yourself. But lower your expectations on the floor (and then some).
