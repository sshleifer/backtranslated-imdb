I'm a fan of the comic series, but this movie is shorter than expectations. I expected a kind of Heavy Metal 2000 ... slow, bad conversation, lots of blood ... but that was the worst thing I thought. <br /> <br /> The drawing line is just as comic, but the good points are almost there. The characters do not have the energy or spirit that they have drawn attention to the comic series. The movie only covers a small part of the comic, and the part used is the slowest and most boring later. The focus of the movie is the least incident instead of the most interesting plot of the comic book. <br /> <br /> The people who work in this project can be amazing. Unfortunately, it was not so, so there is another great film that he will see today and they will love him less. My copies will be dusty for a few years until it's finally thrown away.
