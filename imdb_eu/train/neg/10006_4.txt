I do not know who is guilty, shy writer or evil director. It was one of those films that paid so much for the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon), that there was not enough movie to make. This could be very fun, but he was not afraid, cowardly, hanging on each scene. Since he scored R, why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not Angie Harmon? Why does Sheen associate relationships with the world and the SEXUAL BIKE EVERYONE from all over the world? If you're looking for laughter, why not throw Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta? I was surprised to find it so predictable that the director did not realize he was five years old. What waste, not only for audiences, but also for actors.
