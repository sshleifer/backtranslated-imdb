Hooper is not fun, it's not rhythm, not romantic or informational. There is no real drama. You would think that the biggest stuntman in the world was a movie, but it was an attempt, but it does not seem real. There is no character study, lessons learned, but the actors really did not seem like fun, they simply tried to go well. There is no reason to see Burt and Sally wants to see it from time to time. Prancer was a beautiful horse and he was supposed to do it. This Prancer movie was the best actor. Smoky and Bandit Hooper were a fun movie. This movie was a real disappointment and loss of time
