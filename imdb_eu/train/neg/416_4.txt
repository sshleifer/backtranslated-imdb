(some spoilers) - how would you end up if it were not as if <br /> <br /> <br /> My hopes were high for HOLLOW MAN. Very good commercial, director Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, a very interesting, invisible theme. It was a premier film premise. Unfortunately, these things did not have any problems. The movie was very week-long, suspenseless and incredibly predictable. <br /> <br /> The scientist who has seen the researcher is all about it. After an animal test, Kevin Bacon decided to try himself. After being invisible, it changes completely, realizes the advantages that are not seen. There is a very fine line of murder there. <br /> <br /> Huts Man is an evil movie. Many new movies have illnesses: special effects. The challenge that a producer can take to a great deal of psychological thriller, Verhoeven will ruin everything that is solely for special effects because of the actual value of the movie. I have to admit, fx are awesome, probably the best I've seen since Matrix, but that's not enough to make a movie. Actually, it's a problem with current movies. As Verhoeven, most directors only look after spectacular scenes and nothing more. Exceptions are very limited and the Matrix is ​​probably the only film that combines fabulous factory and plot with special effects. <br /> <br /> Starship Troopers afterwards Verhoeven downsides. Instead of a big movie, HM cr * p. To see this movie, there are only 2 reasons: 1. Special effects 2. Superman and Wonder Woman jokes (I'm not going to break you right now ...) <br /> <br /> Ok, so what? Has it happened to the movie? Everything. Let's see what I can remember. <br /> <br /> --- There is no tension. It should be, but it is not. <br /> <br /> --- Predictable. You know from the beginning who will kill and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- As far as the psychological side is concerned, Verhoeven only looks after the effects. <br /> <br /> - - Many places. <br /> <br /> --- No doubt, the bad guy wakes up several times before he starts to die. <br /> <br /> --- As in all lower grades, the first rule is to differentiate the characters as much as possible. In the laboratory, only one person is the perfect victim of Bacon. <br /> <br /> --- Some holes in the ground. For example: initially, Bacon needs to scan finger in the lab. After being invisible, how can that be done? <br /> <br /> --- End: absolutely horrible. Earth. Then Shue and Brolin quietly and slowly leave without looking back. Is it normal? Then Bacon rises, attacks them, they "kill him" again. And then I heard Shue's "explosion" (it happened a minute ago), and suddenly they run. Is not this explosion heard before? <br /> <br /> --- There's a scene that can be seen on microphones that hang over the actors. Let's go, Mr Verhoeven, I expected much more from you! <br /> <br /> So he's a man. It was a great movie that was supposed to be a scam. <br /> <br /> Vote: from 10 to 10 (for special effects)
