Awesome play, awesome cast and cheap props. It would be much better if the action was set to a parody-style movie. What waste? From the movie's name. It would be better to name "The enemy" "Action Movie". (contributing to the parody effect). The police resembles a player who is 60 years old and has the same appearance on the face of this gentle girl. Until the end of the movie, they're working with him and with him to get rid of bad guys and exchange all the words, just feel a cheap line in front of a sex scene in a porn movie. Amazing. Do not waste your time.
