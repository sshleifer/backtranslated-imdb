Over the course of the years, this movie was so great that it was read, how it was set up by the French critics of Ruiz (especially the snobing Cahiers crowd), when I finally saw it a few years ago, it seemed pretty disappointing to me (but then I think the expectations were high heights. With this saturated film, this brain film (for television and an hour long) talks about a conversation between an art dealer and a screen narrator, while reflecting on paintings (they are shown in tableaux vivants) and try to find traces of a hidden political crime (Kate Beckinsale Uncovered is a horrible movie.) When I read a lot about Borgesian, Borgesian is a word, but I would say that almost any Borges story is more interesting than this.
