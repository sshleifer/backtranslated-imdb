I have not seen it, and I did not think that this movie or any other that includes Lindsay ... ... unless I see "the rich and sick little girl" stretching her life for a period of 2 years. Last arrests in July 2007. <br /> <br /> In fact, I do not know anyone who is going to watch Lindsay's latest films. I prefer that in 2007 it will be a great water mark in its artistic career until it clears its action. All of the latest advertising only hinders the trajectory of his film, if he wants more films <br /> <br /> So far, filmmakers Lindsay was actively looking for the next production. Now Lindsay tests will have to go to the province and the mission will be ANITZEKO. Its popularity is now a "poison" and it is possible to have a negative impact on the sale of ticket sales in any movie. <br /> <br /> Sooooo .... now he has to deal with Lindsay "not wanting" ..... will he be able to manage this one? <br /> <br /> I wonder, though I want to get back to Jay Leno Lindsay on her television? <br /> <br /> All of the above are just my opinion. I do not have information inside.
