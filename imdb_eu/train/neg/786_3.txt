I published this movie and I saw it 3 or 4 times more, including the last week. I'm sorry Branaghen's disagreement about performance must be. <br /> <br /> This really is a wonderful and magnificent movie, with an ambitious 4-hour drive, well shot and designed. . Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie, Kate Winslet, Richard Briers and many other good works. Then it's Kenneth Branagh. If there is a potential project of an actor, that is, Mr. Branagh does not pay Hamlet's "ham". The worst performance of Jack Lemmon's bad mistakes is about foreign businesses that make sense of "naturalness" to get his job done alone. In every literature the most famous soliloquy shouts in all the lines of others. His performance confirms that he would find himself on a better stage, but he has never been an actor. The landscaping budget can be charged to hospitality, Mr. Branagh consumes so much. His performance is an excellent example of people who watch Shakespeare - "It's not full of noise and anger, it does not mean anything." And if there is no fault in the direction, it's a camera that maintains a strong camera. <br /> <br /> In any case, people could give it to the theory of Bardor, after saying it. do, playwright The brilliance of his plays is universal and timeless. Even though theater is not a "correct" way of playing, there is a great play, good performance and bad performance. Shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of "Hamlet". I was surprised how Mr Branagh gave "mouth", but he did not listen. It's been an example of how much time he has been saying, an example of what he's going to say and what he's saying. <br /> <br /> Mr. Branagh has definitely made a wonderful job in setting up some entertaining productions. It would be wise to practice behind the camera and those who know the art of acting. His direction was always better than acting. Shakespeare still gives me great credit to revive interest in filming. He set a large template for other productions. And it would be interesting to see him on stage, about 20 rows. But I hope that you choose more and make less choice. <br /> <br /> Is it worth seeing? Without a doubt. The movie is delighted. But it's a long and long film and, in the end, it will feel less than it's been alive.
