This line starts with a sensible and boring British sci fi film. He builds a Great Vorelli telephony machine for "Devil Doll", Blanchard to cut money and cut off the male shave with the big toes of the male eye. When the experiment fails, good health learns Lembach, who is in control of world grants, will stay in London for several days. Sheila wanted to get into Blanchard's house, with the help of her great assistant lab. It must be said that something is wrong and it resembles a rat. The rest of the film, which amazes the people around London and is a good orange hair that captivates people who wear a diaper on their faces. There are more murders, some paper work, and finally, doctors disappear when the doctor disappears. Fortunately, nobody decided to make a follow-up.
