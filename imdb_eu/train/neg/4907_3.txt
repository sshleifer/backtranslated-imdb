SPOILERS THROBUTE FOR !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> I read the book "1st to die" and I watched the film go on track. He most often did There were fewer differences (for example, the scene of a violent scene), but not many, and most of the movies were true in most books. Films <br /> <br /> It may be a mistake. -I was not impressed by the book, especially with Pollen and Bellows, who drew up the movies perfectly. Or leave them back. I started to feel very surprised, gradually I was disappointed and at the end I was very happy and almost felt it. No difference with the movie. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is no "payment" in the book or movie. I have rarely read any of the thriller that came with the final resolution and I expected to change the movie a bit. <br /> <br /> The whole thing (he did, he did not), did not do one) - it was not interesting, it is not fascinated, confusing, annoying, and otherwise depressive. Add that, that the love of Lindsay's life dies at the end (heals the disease of HER and tears in his grave) ... and then he is cut to the place where he is suicide ... then he is suddenly struggling. His life was arrested by the REAL who was arrested after being cleared ... but he turns out to be with the wife ... HELLO !!! This has become a "HOSPITAL GENERAL" rather than a good old thriller. I felt the deceived and extracted books and I watched the movie (I have to admit that my attention was good, that the performance was very good for television) hoped that he would not continue to follow the book. /> <br /> I still think that the movie is visible and, for some reason, it does not allow the book to leave its bad taste (or maybe I know what it would be), but I have to say this. The story was unclear.
