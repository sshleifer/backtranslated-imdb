This early introduction to the patriotics category B slapped a handsome young Gene Tierney over ads and posters, but you have to wait a little while before watching her, riding on a Hollywoodized camel train. Previously, George Sanders and Bruce Cabot set out in the desert, they are hardly the ones who get them, but they have to face the attacks. Sanders has seen that it was so funny that it was so nice that it was a strange strange guy to watch. However, the appeal of Bruce Cabot is a mystery to me - the opposite is the most basic and silent, but I always felt, smiling, under a car, fat-covered and sixth grade education. Some people like it, like the queen gypsy queen. The action is an adventure frenzy, that is to say, as we have been to attack and warn the British against their lands as we have been able to invade the villages with the tracks, there is a battle of the last gun. good of all This feature does not pay attention to the Saturday afternoon, we need more attention, the programmer with everything that best suits him. It was almost more interesting to identify an excellent cast of support and the appearance of Dorothy Dandridge in one of his first roles. Two or two half-five stars. -MDM
