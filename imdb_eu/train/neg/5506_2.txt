We went into this movie because my husband enjoyed the original version of "My favorite martian". We were 6 years old with us. She wanted to leave her in the middle of the movie that was good for both parents! Viewed parts were occasionally humorous, especially stupid or raw. I hope this movie looks like it is for children between 9 and 12 years old. Not suitable for minors. The original series was much larger than what I heard and "surely the past" is sure to be.
