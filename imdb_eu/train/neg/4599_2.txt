The title "Saying never a book a cover" saying, they warned those who do not look at the surface below. <br /> <br /> When I saw the artwork "Ants of King", immediately HORROR! The proudly depicted aural images and faces talked about a dark vision, the synopsis ordered the murder, betrayal and payment story. Instead of what I found under this surface, it was more interesting than what you can find under your ordinary rock. <br /> <br /> "Ants of the King" is made up of Chris L. McKenna, Sean Crawley. This name in this world even means murder. If you do not care about Sean Crawley, I never feel any sympathy or sympathy for this character. Actually, it's not very difficult, but it's not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews), which makes him recite no-nonsense conversations that force him to recite. Throw Kari Wuhrer as a wicked widower apparently unconditionally confident (homeless), and not very unwise, and as George Wendt Duke, basically a simple Norma from Cheers but MEED. <br /> </ br> There are now some interesting "hallucination" in this film (the source of the cover images), but this film never immerses in that world. With no motive characters, after a bad conversation and an unlikely event, the bombing may occur. Oh Fright!
