This movie said he could be entertaining and interesting from his description. But he left me a little. It was very slow and hard to follow and see what happened. The filmmakers took on individual films and shot them in the air and bundled them in all the different ways (definitely, there was no sequential order). There was also no incident shot. I have seen several Korean films and I have noticed that a good part is well done and that some viewers are demanding the viewer's part, that is, unlike the typical Hollywood movie. But this has ended. I saw the movie second and third times and it has not yet been done for me. I still can not understand what the filmmaker meant. If he only had to show a typical daily life of a person's life, he was successful. But I looked more. Needless to say, I do not recommend this film to anyone.
