I love Zombie-Movies and I love amateur production. And Meat Market 2 starts with a classic tribute to Fulc's "Zombi". <br /> <br /> So I went back and was surprised. Okay, some makeup can not be used for this budget movie and some actors (vampirelady and chef) stand out, but there is nothing. <br /> <br /> I did not wait for Romero here, but there is no sequence in the whole movie, even if it has a little value for suspense or shock. The director knows how to make body-raffles and interesting eating habits, but now (in two parts) it's time to learn more. <br /> <br /> MeatMarket2 rhymes Gore bored. Not enough - sorry. <br /> <br /> ** outside *****
