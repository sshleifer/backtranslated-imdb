Ok, so I want to see this movie dying. He has filmed in the horror plot "Who is Who" in film ... well, my friend has rented it, brought it and we started to see it. Being a comedy ... ONCE I did not smile until the 40 minute mark. <br /> <br /> Is it related to the budget? In no case, in fact, there are films that are NOT ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT, and they are amazing (for me anyway). Also, while watching this movie, I could not notice the similarities (ie STEALING) to listen to a low budget movie called "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE", read my review (this BTW destroys this movie). <Br /> <br /> This movie ... he really made the potential. It was "the power of the star" in a stolen plot (let's get shot in the back of a movie movie ... IE ... "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" ... seriously, it overwhelms me and I think more.), ... it could be really fun . A LOT, a lot of jokes have fallen. It's good to play it. But he was dragged, he was not funny, and he was stolen in the plot. <br /> <br /> I will give this two, because SOOO AWFUL is not there, but that is the only reason.
