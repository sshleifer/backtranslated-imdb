I can not believe that I lost time with this movie. I can not even call a movie. It was so bad that it was not recommended. <br /> <br /> I like little budget movies and curious books, but I got killed. Misunderstood and bad behavior has stolen. You should ask what people thought of when they spent money on producing the movie. I wonder what I was seeing at the end. I do not recommend anyone to this movie. How did they release that? Is there an audience that likes this type of movie? It must be almost in any video store. But, why? <br /> <br /> It's unforgettable. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies, this is for you.
