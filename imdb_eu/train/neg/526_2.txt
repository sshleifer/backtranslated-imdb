It was almost as boring as reading, it is a beautiful failure produced by Evening ... until it reveals to Meryl Streep and other artists that he reflects on art. Vanessa Redgrave is amazing about her death and Claire Danes as an encryptor. Perhaps if Vanessa and Claire were to change their roles, we could see the vitality of the young Ann in the world of the story, and we could imagine that Ann's eldest died. <br /> <br /> I hope to add Michael Cunningham to his writing credits, but he would accuse him of a savvy story. He gave me a headache.
