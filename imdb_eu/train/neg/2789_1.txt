Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. Home videos are very similar to the lighting and the performance. Not only was the story and script wretched. I do not know why the movie was made. I've seen a lot of flicks in my time and I'm really angry at movies that are really annoyed. This made my blood boil. The situations were very good. If I made such a movie, it would be short. Actually, would not these wooden idiots be pictured? <br /> <br /> Do not fall over with the lid of D.V.D. I am a passionate film maker. But this movie is almost impossible. I do not care about movies filmed in D.V. But if you want to do that, the movie will be nice, not great horror movies (sans wrong tour). Do not recommend discarding the disc. This happens if you go through the store you rent. <br /> <br /> Films really annoying your anger get 1 automatic.
