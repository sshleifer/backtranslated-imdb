I saw it today, I was partially attuned to all the stars and, to a large extent, I liked so much movie. However, this should be avoided. There are dozens of clipped scenes where tracking is just a flow, like billiards challenge, for example. The local battle scenes are the same, just as you remember in Tarzan's black and white cinema. You know where you see a spear in the air and the camera is lying down dead dead. on his thigh. Is death instantaneous? There are also quite unnecessary scenes about the plot, like a girl who has been recovered as a flower collector. Watching authentic clay clocks is very painful. This movie will be featured around 5 km / h. In some ways, he will approach and give David Mccullum. As there was no time to leave the road, when the obelisk falls in the city, births take the two steps left in the world every time, but it does not scream and it falls. him I will give this Ekland 2. And why does Mccullums develop a voice stutter as the movie progresses?
