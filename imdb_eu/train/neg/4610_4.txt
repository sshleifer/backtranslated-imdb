I noticed that I saw this movie in the movie Kari Wuhrer. I have had a long theory about it, it's a talented actress, but it does not seem to prove it, since it's always a B budget short film. She is still beautiful, and she is trying to get over the unhappy stuff that I can still watch. This is not different. The film is ugly and disturbing, but that's not good. George Wendt acted against it, and it was so noisy that he acknowledged his role. Another note about Wuhrer. Breasts seem to have diminished considerably since last seen. Perhaps a reduction surgery or implant removal (probably). NO it's bad He still looks great. I would like to see it in a better movie.
