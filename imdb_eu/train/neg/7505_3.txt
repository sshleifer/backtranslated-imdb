This long-awaited film gets its impact on NYC and its impact, but it is more about drawing a group of Italian-American groups called "Guido". The problem is that "Guido" is uninteresting, regardless of the type of story or setting. There are already cartoons, so Lee only increases them, only in portraits. <br /> <br /> When someone cares for himself, they do not go home and say: "Hey, let's get your ears and nose bigger!" This has been done by Lee in this film. The most interesting characters in the film are "Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito", two of whom are "Guido" who want to escape. Collect an interesting story for the characters, especially John Leguizamo, and you'll get a nice movie that you sleep. Especially given a long run. <br /> <br /> More against a stroke: someone who names Yankees as a lover in New York, Spike Leek has to know Phil Rizzuto, that is, to write. written in the final credits
