This is a review of the non-sub-prime zombie, but this movie is worth a review. Dinocroc is a good movie in general, but unfortunately the b-movie is still obvious. Dinocroc seems to be very good, but the same film I thought I needed more with action and violence, because croc shows or stays in a fight where it is much more advanced, if the croc appears and krok die or save it because it has it runs in a repeating process. Jane Longenecker was hot, a plus and an interpretation better than average, and the most amazing thing was the crocodile flesh, cough * comodo * cough as she looked like cartoons. I enjoyed this movie that it would be more than just a movie that can be said in general in some movies to be happy. Generally it's worth 3/6 stars and a watch.
