Do I admire the 'Kissing on the Mouth' for honesty? Public hair cutting and masturbation, especially by Joe Swanberg's director and director. They were not afraid to show the authenticity of everyday "private" appearances. Unfortunately, the movie goes into the kingdom of "The Bunny Brown", but jealousy is a bit more developed. Yes, "Bunny" mirrors anything that is happening, or focusing too much film cinematography (or honestly unfocused) is not anything totally ?? Feet, hands or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I can see why the movie was released, and why people rent it: real life, the scene and full face of the sex (equal, both men and women). In addition, the loss of time was complete. We have learned a couple of college classmates who soon learned that men have the most striking feeling that they only see women as friends, while the boyfriend is accustomed to it. In addition, we are referring to the day-to-day events of boredom: it works for parents; Sexual awareness is very private that works on their computer. To do this all, the interview must be interesting and real. It does not work and it is boring to see someone driving for an hour, like "The Bunny of the Strawberry." The only feature that stands out is Kate Winterich and even makes a fiery performance. (It's worth noting that it's worth watching at the micro-front with the DVD / it's worth it.) I again admire filmmakers, especially Swanberg, because they reveal everything and they are not afraid to show themselves or their customs, but in the film as a whole. flat fall Scenes are not good narratives, conventional mistakes that cause too much boring everyday and no headache, why did you rent this one?
