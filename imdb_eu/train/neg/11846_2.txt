After watching this movie, I condemned my local cinema about the quality of the soundtrack and the sound of the movies were flawed. In the first half of the film, it's hard to understand someone scratchiness of the background music and soundtrack. Filmmaking equipment was a blame but not so much - it was the director. <br /> <br /> My complaint was that they made me a part of the movie. Music and sound were distorted to create a very disturbing impact on the film. These days, the directors will make a special film for a long time. Unfortunately, the sound score will be the same as the movie you watch or how you see it. <br /> <br /> So, apart from the historical accuracy of this movie (you can find it elsewhere) soundtrack. Distortions are a good reason for themselves to give this film a miss. You can only hear the scratchiness of the distorted sound track, and it's definitely not a meow for a cat.
