0.5 / 10. This movie does not do anything good. The worst thing I've seen plays, it's really amazing that EVERYONE is absolutely horrible, not just some, and here, everybody. Direction is a joke, a low budget is not obvious, the score is horrible, I would not say that they were editing the movie, it would be a rude phrase that would be more appropriate. It combines serial killings, voodoo and tarot cards. Dumb Dumb Dumb It's not scary, the special effects are constantly falling. laughably bad all over. It was a bad writing. Cinematography is a really cheap look and sometimes very grainy, and the camera's work is horrible. Once again, the movie is really bad for all actors. Cursi
