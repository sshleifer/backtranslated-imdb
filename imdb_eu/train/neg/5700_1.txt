The film believes in winning a score of 6.7. It's worth better than 2.0, and clearly, it must have 100 movies that fall into every 100 movie of the IMDb. National Treasure is an affair against national intelligence, and it is just another American attack on the Hollywood public. The critics told the plot they could guide 16 brooms. <br /> <br /> I love this good movie justification ... "Nicholas Cage is nice." Let's go, it's not surprising everyone around the world thinks Americans are stupid. This movie I have ever seen must be stupid and insulted. If you want to see a really decent movie this season, consider Kinsey, Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. The national treasure unfortunately had more advertising in front of these films. I do not read most of this, even though I've heard it, because some have still not been released yet. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is an excellent actor - when it's a good movie. I've seen it again and again with Cag's amazing horrific talents such as Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off. Talent is an incredible actor like Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation. <br /> <br /> The bottom line - I'd rather feed your hand to a heavy dump instead of seeing it atrocious visual.
