First of all, I'm not a fan of Rajnikant, but Baba was very disappointed. Among the terrible story, action and songs were mediocre. Storyline becomes very preaching. Instead of running in offices like NTR or MGR, Rajni Tamil Nadu seems to have run like the next big guru. My wife tells me that this film has been released, because she has sworn the film Rajni! <br /> <br /> At first we bought lucky to buy Babu (an old Sivajiganeshan) when we bought it. ... It was a wonderful movie to complete the purchase ... If the bean looks worse, if it is compared! <br /> <br /> Bryan
