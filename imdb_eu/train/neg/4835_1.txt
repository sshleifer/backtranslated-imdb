Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel to a young US corporation in Afghanistan. He is also a highly qualified surgeon and freely walks around Kabul with the work of NATO wounded soldiers. In a particularly difficult task, he detects a sniper rifle and filmed Osama bin Laden in a case from a distance of about 3000 meters. He eventually became a sergeant, but he can not decide between the sniper and the surgeon, so he left the army completely. A year later, when he was frustrated with civil life, he joined the Navy and shows the last scene with a white uniform.
