This film is another example of Eastern Curse of Asian cinema: two or more stories in one single movie. Other reviewers, of course, have received numerous citations in the "first part" and "second half". How can you have character development or a deep plot of characters and story in such a short time? I was enjoying the first part, until it suddenly stopped (it was not "finished"), which stopped being something that appeared in the middle of the story, it would replace the second part and totally incredible. Reorganize and clean the apartment of a young girl (wow!). I hope that day Wong Kar Wai will give him good script on that day!
