Although it's a 2001 movie, it has been 90 years old, the "90s" style that had been recently restored. Cutting cuts and effects on the cheese was painful. The script is decent enough, and some scenes have been fascinated by me (when it gets to the bridge at night). But her sister killed herself and how her obsession with suicide was the story line was horrible. The actor who plays Selma Blair's boyfriend is a little worried about me. I sat down all over the place, that is, you just found on TV and this kind of random movie is strange.
