Apart from all the Internet, this movie was a huge god. I hope you have more than one other fake movie. The filmmakers made serious thriller / horror movies that were completely lost. There were just a couple of goodies, and Samuel Jackson on some good lines. In addition, they were a bunch of gore and badly animated snakes. Every joke on the internet had a lot better than the actual movie. That the movie has come out really, we hope that this joke will die. Do not waste your time or money over the hybrid trash bin. If you're looking for something fun and fun, go to Snakes on a Blog.
