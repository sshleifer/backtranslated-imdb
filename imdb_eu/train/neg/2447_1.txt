After seeing KHAKEE, I'm going to watch another good movie and unfortunately Filma is joke and really tries to present Aryane while her dad is a producer of Keshu <br /> <br /> RKS spoke so much about the movie. In promotions, the film is a movie that says the movie of that time, I wonder what the movie was about. <br /> <br /> The movie is actually a typical Masala movie, all comedies, love and dexterity <br> <br> /> <br /> The ease of kidnapping children is one of the funniest pieces ever. Imagine kidnapping children kidnapped by Dawood. <br /> <br /> The whole end is a sudden chunk with a character change change. br /> <br /> RKS has given its weakest films to date, except for Bachchan's scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> it looks strange when smoking cigar. Duplication is not exactly match one time <br /> <br /> Akshay is in some minutes and repeats its action and cats <br /> <br /> Aryeman may seem out of step, but it tries too many scenes <br / > <br /> It creates a lot of Bhumikak <br /> <br /> The rest are well
