Is false landscapes a picture? You would not think it, but really for me. Hear, I have a lot of classical movies of the time and I know almost nothing except, for example, riders that drive the same cars in front of a screen. But many of these businesses have to do with actions. Fake landscapes, fake mountains, and shots after the filming of the "Brigadoon" after a while, are somewhat insulting. <br /> <br /> Regarding musical entertainment, this is always subjective. A person likes songs, another might not have to be a big part of judging a film (someone likes songs) This movie was released for the 1950's, songs, dances, love and characters, but in the 1950s many people liked things like that . The musicians performed very well in the 50s. He liked me, the 30s and 40s. In the 50s, the lid was out and this new thing, I really appreciate it. Is this movie? No It does not do much for that. <br /> <br /> Despite being a good cast, despite being a good director and a great hope, this movie has been bombarded with the box office and with me. I'd rather like to be my dreamer and be a pleasant part of this story. I am not the type of cinema and the kind people and the pleasant people feel good feelings. So why can not I connect with this movie? A part of it was also dancing. The things that represent dances of the screen do not matter. But - not - everything really gave me this staging. There was no Scottish, not a mountain range, it seemed like a hokey to look like this and it almost became from the beginning. Scoring a current realism where most of the "location" time. "
