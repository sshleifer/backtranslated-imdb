"Well, Chuck Jones has died, the soil's character allows him to add cheap explosions, draws American style and gives superpowers." "But, sir, are not we all like so many shows like this? They will not dump the original creators." "Yes! And these shows make us a bunch of money and we need more!". "But is not it all the men and women, the characters that grew up with them had less characters?" "You have reason to set it up in the future, make all the descendants of the original characters, and change all their names a bit ... but not too much, we must be able to awaken the success of the classics." <br /> <br /> Well, the only reason I can think of why it exists. Looney Toons, looking at the great desestilation of his beloved, shows well. But there is already teenage titan, it is the same bloody thing. All the characters are dressed in batman, they drive on a boat for marine criminals, they have superpowers, they are just like Looney tunes and have similar names and characteristics. <br /> <br /> This type of thing is "so amazing" in the category. Think of the movie Super Mario, and Batman and Robin. If you want to laugh at the wrong reasons, look at that. If you are the youngest generation (this is really a good thing), and executive directors can overcome shamelessness, then run and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this cartoon I do not have a problem with you, people who calculate this thing crazy. You know how to say that hacking is like stealing a car; This show is like stealing funeral. It is possible that all the people involved in the original drawing, they were thrown on the screen, dressed in pirate costumes and they were charged. This show did not appear to be the characters (which seemed to be Looney Toons) who have already made millions of studios, it would be fine. But not! Sorry for Warner brothers for embarrassment. <br /> <br /> If I saw this thing in a section of Simpsons or Family Guy, I'd love to see it as a 30-second gag. In fact, I can not believe that this has ever happened. Anyone who shows that 80% of people working in this show hate it. However, it does not really matter, the show will be forgotten in 10 years, while the originals will live forever, or at least until the end of the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> "In 2008, the Snoopy and Kakahuet team returned, and now they are terrific and invisible laser!
