I watched this movie in the early preview and I should honestly admit that I do not like so many films with Meryl Streep. This picture was the worst. Half of the theater was not half the movie after the return. I did not blame if this was not a true story, there was no need in the second part of this photo. The film has been performing for ten years before I progress, I expect myself to show credit.
