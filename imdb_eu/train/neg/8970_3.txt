The first Cube movie was an art movie. They established a world that represented the main archetypes of mankind, and they understood how to fight for the sense of an enemy world. In a non-literal level, "a cruel nature against humanity" was finally a plot that eventually represented the innocence and goodness of the individual, a victory against the new and indefinite world of human beings; A fight was not the world but peace. I valued Cube from 10 to 10, and it was never a movie that he would like to be. <br /> <br /> The second movie, Hypercube was disappointed. Some ideas were cool, but in the context of the original movie, the story and setting were meaningless and meaningless. However, I was valued 10th because of being quite funny. <br /> <br /> The third movie Cube Zero, ignoring the second, the first B-movie commercial is much smaller. sans symbolism Here there is no "tribute" or "tribute"; it is not ripped off. The same type of plot, some elements that have an idiomatic transformation (like the fact that there are letters in the first place with the first number of cubes) shows this idea clearly, that is to say nothing other than originality and nothing. br /> <br /> "What's behind the scenes" is nothing to say, the viewers are not a bad experiment, but rather a second section, which we do not pay any attention to the architects. And in this movie, those who arrive at the exit (as Kazan did at the end of the first film) die, where * bleep * in that sense?! That's just a fool. I'm glad I did not pay for seeing this. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​and Cube Zero are not bad, but the stories and ideas are so inspirational. Only 3 scores can be obtained from 10.
