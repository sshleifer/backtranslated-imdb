The RKS films have always been commercial films of the 90's, by GHAYAL and DAMINI <br /> <br /> His last films were the KHAKEE FAMILY, they were shit <br /> <br /> Film This is a decent movie, but it can not be better <br /> <br /> The problem is that it brings together a lot of ancient clich√©s and shows a lot of scenes and lengths <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan's character is very well illustrated but its It gets a stylish character to be subtle <br /> <br /> A long flashback can be avoided because it is long drawn, although playing in the second half of the street is also simplistic and is hardly a solution. The post is well posted <br /> <br /> RKS's management is decent, although it may be better. Music is ok <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks very well and is pleasing to her part. Above all, sometimes it looks bad in clear scenes. Dramatic highlighted the most significant scene in the face of Vidya's media Pankaj does not play the right role or even film. Darshan Jariwala has ham ice cream, since elderly boys are good at rest
