I hate to have 10 lines to write about atrocity. Hyung-Rae Shim is lucky that bad filming will not kill a capital crime twice or twice to write and correct disaster. I am surprised that this film had a budget of $ 75 million, but it was really happy that it was a huge flop, Shim hopefully, another movie that has never been for the rest of his life and, therefore, not waste it. more time for filmmakers. I think the actor gathered and sank. <br /> <br /> With the available resources, this budget could make the movie perfect. As usual, from scratch with the script and the horror story from the beginning. "Transformers" was a visual party with a weak script, which looks like "Citizen Kane".
