Well What can be said? First of all, this adaptation is four hours long, the complexity of the plot (or its absence). Actors try hard to make something of this movie, but there is no time available. Swayzee is not really a Quatermain character. After seeing Sway Connek's interpretation of Sean Connery's "Men's Palace League", Swayze does not score. The murmur with the Winchester recurring rifle does not require the force, tightness, trick or humor that is needed for this part, and all the doctors of witchcraft relate it from my point of view, from my point of view, to being more believable as an actor. rest cast Some views are nice, but there are strange movie faults. For example. Happy team in the middle of the desert reaches the holes in the water, their paths can be seen near the oasis, waiting for them to ride around. When mine is drawn (at the next shot), we will reach the exit, similar to the exit from the rising passages. Doug McClure was waiting for me to appear at any time. Somehow I wanted to. Quatermain, the Russian leader, is a harmful character created by stereotyped character. <br /> <br /> Swayze is doing well as a sad father, he has returned to London, who can not get his son custody. Swayze should hold that kind of thing. It is not able to get the heart of a brave gentleman, a hard life and a sense of direct play. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 barely
