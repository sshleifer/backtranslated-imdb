Peter & the Wolf's re-enacting animation is excellent, but for about 29 minutes, the movie is sleeping inducing. They should call "Peter and the Snails", because of everything, at the pace of snails. I can not sit in the movie, I had to watch it for 15 minutes and it was just torture. <br /> <br /> Save yourself 30 minutes - do not watch this movie. I will thank you. <br /> <br /> I will only be able to see it just in the first minutes appointed by the Oscar nominee committee. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner of the Best Animated Short (short) category, the voters will cross the whole thing. I'm sorry for them - and it's not possible to happen to win this movie nearer.
