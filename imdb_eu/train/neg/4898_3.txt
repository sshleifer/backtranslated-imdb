Wayward Cloud is a spectacular movie. Strict enigmatic, each shot is treated as an artwork. The composition of each image has been designed and prepared with great attention to obsession; From the first film to cinema since the 19th century. Since the beginning of mime and construction mime, the camera is almost never moving? along with colorful bands and music. The noise of the environment is at least maintained and there is only one word. This strange but efficient device forces audiences only to offer visual stimuli, as the story tells us to be immersed in the sphere of snail. Unfortunately, for me, at least, this dive starts somewhere around the hourmark. It seems that I started challenging me as I was challenging, making it more difficult to drag a few minutes, when the pure observation action became a voluntary battle. <br /> <br /> The content of this film was not as serious as sex, undoubtedly Western viewers are even more obscure. In fact, there is a lot of female nudity and an unconscious (or perhaps dead) act of sexual abuse is a woman that is so tedious; For while pornography can talk about men and women (users). and what is used, it is so good that it chooses its criterion as effectively as it does. The hardest and most tense participants of the discussion participation, obviously, seek out pornographic films for all the wrong reasons and will see the sticky finger in the remote forward fast button. <br /> <br /> For all its problems, the film is definitely left out, and the more you think about it, the sense of some aspects seems to be. Ironically, for a movie that is so small, the viewer would possibly also watch the second time or the third time. For me, however, was it enough?
