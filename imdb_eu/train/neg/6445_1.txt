A documentary that looks at conservative groups such as the ultra-wing wing of the U.S. and the conservative groups like this in the US should take into account the following. The United States of America has 270 million inhabitants and its complex history as an aspirational democracy and a desire for Human Rights and its mistakes and void. Without a doubt, it is expected that extreme right-wing groups and conservative groups are in large numbers, however, depending on the size of the population, they are completely small and isolated. Population residents, Europe, Great Britain and Australia are also similar right groups, which are much higher than the United States of America based on capital. For the above reasons it is not justifiable to annihilate and release the United States people and the level of debate, as they are very fraudulent and deceptive in United States education society as an ultra-right wing society representing the American Society. Thus, Greenstreet, necessarily chose small and isolated groups of the opposite ends of the spectrum to build a sensationalist, generous and generous image of America. This movie is clearly designed to unravel the subconscious and embody the people who hate people's lifestyle and vision pander designed under the ideological and ideological spurist idealistic left left-wing ideology. This film is not a lucrative act to promote the truth about the American Society and the Human Condition. Greenstreet deals with ultra-right wing conspiracies, a complex Military Industry, but fails to introduce an intelligent and balanced debate to alternative solutions to the failure of a vibrant democracy. The Movie Show can be seen as anti-American in the trash. SENSATIONALISM is the worst anti-ERA litter.
