I get into bad movies, but it does not do anything. Despite the above idols, it's NOT fun. I know comedy AND underground movies, but it's so boring that EVER writes / EVER writers have to ban EVER's local wired EVER access again! Loving movies and comedy is to despise this movie. Perhaps I never have this work as boring and boring. You like this movie as dirty as you are, nothing here. ZERO! If you need to compare underground movies, see "Kentucky Fried Movie" or the first John Waters. The movie begins to define the satire and I told him to show the satire. The comedy rule IS THAT ... IF YOU ARE KNOW YOU can say or can DO, but it's NOT fun if you're not satirical, you're not sharp, you're just pathetic and this movie is not fun. ZERO!
