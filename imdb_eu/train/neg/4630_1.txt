Published in 1965, but clearly shot in the early years, it has little melodrama of crime, face to face with explicit sex. As usual in the grindhouse of an old age, there is no reason to wear stiff music, sour narrations and bad dresses and clothing. The cafe scene sets footsteps on the ground, because we cut across and over the characters to really avoid their lines. All we get is the reaction shots that are the voice of the screen character! Beautiful Misty Ayers in the 50s cut French in pairs before starting the game twice before starting. He is constantly accompanying Romantic music that flows to mother-of-pearl dishes, randomly mixed, among other things, the most crystal-clear cigar caught in film areas. Check while playing the lid! Check while it touches the match! Does he come and Apaches catch? It's time to tell you The film tells the story of a man who has deceived Sally's work at the whorehouse, who has fallen into the rope and can not escape. For some reason, we're dealing with some of the most boring and boring films committed, literally nails or knitting clothes to make customers entertain. Some stupid and stupid comedies (the dreadful lady drinks unexpectedly milk! Take care!) And silent film does not help. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, although Something Weird Video is a tent. Film culture is more than an interest in film history - a very bad movie.
