Listening to the director's comments I suspected I was watching the movie: it's a man who wants to play a movie. Plots are tricky teenage girls to write something like "book / script / award-winning sitcom". There is a germ of an interesting idea inside it (probably because it's someone's movie tracking), but it's completely buried, handwritten and under-guessed. <br /> <br /> The lines are awesome, and the performances are not anyone, and I'm guilty again to the director. Apparently, it's not necessary to ask about the actors, but instead hand-written them, directing them to the camera and continuing with them. Who knows, with a little training, these actors could get better acquainted (he told me what they liked with musicians in the movie, Jon Bon Jovi was superb in Row Your Boat and acceptable to The Man Leading Man). <br /> <br /> Just like before, cast does not have chemicals. Parallel to classical sex and vampirism, the chance to use Bon Jovi's vampire blood to overtake her vampire's son is a great deal, a transfusion will be given. He would impress Please note that they were interested in each other in the whole movie. The real point of sexual tension between two women is that directors are unexpected. Originally, this silent sequence was used as a pretext for further explanations without supposed plot - so I think the finished product might be worse. But not many. <br /> <br /> In film, as the movies go, this is badly drawn, stupid and unforgettable. Going to the trash in the movies is not enough to be entertaining for a sexy or boring. It might have been a fun and bloody joke, but the director has left with more comedy for the wrong reasons.
