I really enjoyed the first half of this movie, but I should say, "stupid." This is another example that has deprecated humor. It can be very fun in 1940, but not now ... nor even close. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting to watch. I especially liked Busby Berkeley's musical appearance and a great voice when he began to change, reaching his personality and personality. <br /> <br /> It was just like "Jimmy MacDonald", but the rest played Cast's stupid characters, the chief of Maxford House Coffee Company (Raymond Walburn), when he cried all the time. He was a tough listener and he was harmful to the movies.
