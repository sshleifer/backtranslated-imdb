With such a title, you do not expect an excellent horror movie. But it was very bad, even though there were small expectations. Plots are really insulting and stupid: a criminal escaped wearing Halloween mask; So everyone in the area thinks it is someone else. This joke would work in 5 or 10 minutes, but it's not the whole movie! Actors are not so bad, but the characters are mute and the story is boring and empty. No suspense, no excitement or little gore (very cheap). Satan's companions are scared to fear (...) the comedy and thus fails. It was definitely boring, I actually saw 10 minutes before the end. It could not happen to me. Amanda Plummer was very good at Pulp Fiction but came ... she was 13 years old and then did nothing decent. So it is not surprising that he had to sink as little as a disaster. Avoid or warn ...
