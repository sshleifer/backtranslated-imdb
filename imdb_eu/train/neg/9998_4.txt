At the end of the film, I thought it was too much technique. As I stayed in the room, I felt that our Navy Navy made some sea rescues. I saw the engines have fire extinguishers. I should think beforehand, but I have never thought about it. Using a 747, to transport valuable ancient paintings that are not very safe, are odd and realistic. The performance was pretty good, especially since they are professionals who are experts, but if you happen to be so far away, it should be like fantasy, comics, etc. Everything was taken seriously. Felix Ungar had at least one movie, with Buck Rogers, with night stalkers and Dracula. The film has its faces. I understand Hollywood has a bit of drama to be overwhelming, but the quality of a movie is damaging when it gets serious. That's why I said he had to be more comical. With movies on airline travel movies, my pet is watching all of them unexpectedly moving. They drink to drink, 5 minutes later they collect and drink, if they are in a building or something, and agitation only exists. Also, I know the disaster is a movie, but the suspense does not need to enter a 30-second crash after clicking something. However, the actors and actresses have kept this inadequate screenplay in a movie that has been preserved in the first screening. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to wear a psychotic person ...
