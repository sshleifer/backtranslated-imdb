If you hear these three words you're ever listening to ... "Joe Don Baker," fear ... <br /> <br /> Final Justice is a small budget based on a sheriff from the Texas Geronimo. (As an heronimo). The character is ugly, melancholy and rude, who has captured a victim of Malta, who died in Texas. His pair really falls twice in the movie. Very bad edition. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) will finish 4 or 5 times in prison in this movie, the plot is nowhere fast. He also shoots like a Western wilderness. Nobody said that XX. It was a century. A female police officer is assigned to show herself about Malta (a look like Eline's appearance in Seainefeld), and she's the only one who comes out of her head. It must be insane! <br /> <br /> Bar strippers are the funniest characters. Their dance is shown throughout the movie and I started connecting credible women. Well, it was better than Geronimo's observation to try to get something out. At the end it was a mistake and predictable, and I was glad it was over. You will never forget the last line of Joe Don Baker. <br /> <br /> It's so hard to imagine how it was in the Three Bon films ... very strange! In any case, if you want to laugh, see MST3K. Also, I heard his other bad movie (among many), Rhino released Rhino's "Mitchell" MST3K Version on DVD. I can not wait to see that!
