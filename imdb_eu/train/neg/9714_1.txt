I hate this program: the concept itself is not only playful, but it tries to be viable ("Mudos: She Wrote"), what I "program" like "what I'm saying" is left unchecked. <br /> <br /> sigh. Why is it that writers can not get enough intelligence in intelligent programs to make a decision in court and win a proof? <br /> <br /> Forward: years after X years Unsolved cases, why are EVERYTHING EVERYTHING * EPISODIES * CONFESS * (damn!), otherwise, the murder that would be resolved? <br /> <br /> Every policeman's good bet is that they are good athletes of criminals: "Aw, shucks, official, you're bright - I think you've persuaded yourself if I did what I did, I can accept it, and facilitate it in court What can I say, a fair police officer? " <br /> <br /> We can also hear the absolute dog and any kind of insult to ourselves with enough brain IQ
