I saw the movie twice. I can not believe the painters make this fantasy film. I'm a filmmaker / theater director and I know what I'm talking about. This is not Romanian now, but I see that events have occurred since September 11. There's no story, no plot, nothing. There is no conclusion, no message, no depth, nothing hidden. Empty images <br /> <br /> Most Romans do not know, this film is for French viewers, not for us. They really think that Romania is a reality. Also for teens. Painters should stop making movies. I do not know if we can call this movie, maybe it might be a horror) And we wonder why we've got that picture in Europe. This is the reality, but it is no longer. My good friend at Brithish Embassy said: "You do not know how long the Romans walked from Ceausescu."
