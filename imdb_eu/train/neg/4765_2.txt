While the original mind titillates, this cheap remake is designed only for shock sensitivity. Instead of complicated plot knots, the so-called thriller changes instantly and apparently random stories, which are used to move away with each strange development. Worse, replacing the original, spooky dialogue has thrown four words into unnecessary words with unnecessary words, leaving behind a passionate but interesting flavor. <br /> <br /> There was a promise - an unfulfilled promise. It is very interesting that Michael Cain graduated from Patty Duke's Sullivan Patty Duke graduation. Unfortunately, this brilliant and glittering actor gets his reputation upset, first of all activating a role that plays a role in this huge screenplay and then comparing it with Jude Law's partner pair. > If you have not seen the original classic, see its image and its data. Search, watch and enjoy half a story. Regarding remake, give this original insult.
