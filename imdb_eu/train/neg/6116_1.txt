Bo Derek could have a career, because his husband, John, had not left his manager. It's really a shame, not really, in the right direction and in the right part (see "10"), Bo was fine. He did not win any prizes, even though he was the best, but it is much worse than many actors based on the past 15 years. However, he put the problem, John had begun to ride Bo in Bo's 10 years, Bo "10 perfect," "America's most beautiful woman," a sex symbol of the 80s. The problem is that in the hands of John, this wave had a terrible blow in just a few years. Perhaps he knew the limitations he had had as his actor, perhaps because of that he created the films in his body and not in the theater. It was really quick. There was no problem with John and Bo Derek's films (actually), they are really bad. Bad Edgar Rice Burrough's literary symbol, Jungle of the Lord, comes out with Tarzan of the Apes. <br /> <br /> Do you know what's worst? This movie is boring! Bark me, cry me, do not get bored. The amazing look of Bo can not be of any interest, which is why the movie has been built. Richard Harris (God blessed his soul, he and Bo were the Orca btw) gilded and at least his scenes a bit more interesting and Miles O'Keefe makes a physically impressive Tarzan. Perhaps he laughed at the end, after a hit with some critics of the film, he made a good career as a B movie for Miles, but was a million times more enjoyable than in movies. this But apart from that, it's Bo's body, and you can see so many times before you can get something out. Tarzan Ape Man is nowhere else. John Derek was a really dynamic actor, he was not the director. It should be stopped by his force. This movie takes a slow and boring pace and nothing happens in scenes. Burrough's Tarzan was about excitement and the fulfillment he wanted (as Lord Greystoke would not have been as fast, strong and good as he would not?) And fun! You do not have it here. Look and you've lost 107 minutes of your life. In the second thought, you will come up with a valuable lesson, how to manage the path of a movie that is not with someone. <br /> <br /> Bo Derek is well in my book. John stayed until his death, he has a real love of animals and nature, and he even looks back at his time with the blinking. He has also shown that there is not a female blonde who wants to be. If Tarzan and Bolero survive, he can survive. So Bo returned, everything will be forgiven. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br/> And, aside, Steve Strong plays Steve Strong himself.
