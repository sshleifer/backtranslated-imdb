When I decided to watch THE BARBARIANS, when I thought that Peter and David Paul were twins, they thought that the movie directed by Ruggero Deodato was not a bad thing. THE BARBARIANS is a terribly trashy action / adventure movie, CONAN THE BARBARIAN, and at all levels fails. The movie looks wrong. Some scenes were well-filmed, but tone and generous, the "disco" looks like clothes and haired people just like it does not make any sense, as well as a small budget like this. <br /> <br /> Richard Lynch dressed in an old woman with a hilarious outfit. It's a threat, but it's going to be like a buffalo. And it's fun for Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of MY MY CHILDREN, to appear in her first movie, skimpy leather bikini. I'm sure this dreck wants to get rid of the face of the earth! The so-called b√°rbaros twins are well-regarded as a muscle-linked hero, but it's almost impossible to build a critical criticism of their activity, like their roles in this mess, because it's really badly thought out. The twin twin double-stitched film that covers his butt, the other twin does not cover almost the butt of the muscles. I'm not joking! Do not ask me who it is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Desodate really had to be desperate to make this movie. And his disappointment is reflected in this silence. It's bad
