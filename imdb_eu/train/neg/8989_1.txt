There are good things about the movie. It's great music and filmography. Alex Wilson is hot and gives a great performance. Ryan Bauer is also hot. The production was very lucky to have thrown them up, because the production value really gave the film. Jonny Vincent (Sean) and many of the boys who do not speak are also very nice. Why is not Amy listed on credit? Brandon Alexander gives a great comedy performance like Clitarissa Pink. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie, probably, is James Townsend. He can not play It's very poor, it's not nice to look at. His arms are like spaghetti. It's tired. They do not have muscle tone. It's not surprising that he has to make his own movie and throw himself up. Nobody will give anything. <br /> <br /> James Townsend is not as gay as someone who would be incredible as a girlfriend. They should throw someone else out for the best movies. Then again, maybe he just wanted to use this movie to launch a soft-core porn career as a vehicle, it certainly is not a real performance because he took some lessons to act. Also, anyone who porn makes a blacklist in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The horny thing in the movie is probably to emit a Latina eyebrow as a mother of Devon. Sonja Fisher is not at all an actress. In short, this movie is a soft-core porn and it's better than something you'll see on Skinemax. I think, though Alex Wilson, surely, wants the best thing about this movie to be embarrassed and unwilling. There are no photos on his IMDb page and there is no other list, so Alex Wilson will surely be available. Also, I recently joined West Hollywood, and when I mentioned this movie, he turned around and left. I understand When I worked on this movie, I would be ashamed and I would not associate with that.
