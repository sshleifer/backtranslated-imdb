Cuba Gooding Jr. It is an agent of the secret service that acts against the US president's assassination, I will immediately explain that this is not the type of role that this talented actress refers to, and why this film shows us. . The news brings together a constant reporter (Angie Harmon) to uncover the conspiracy on President's death, etc., blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Even with James Woods, with Cuba Gooding Jr. Anne Archer and Angie Harmon's 'End Game' fail your attention, plain and simple; Some of the games are good, the performance is not bad, and the story, even before the topic, could lead to a fun and entertaining movie - WELL IT FREE! The writing and direction of the script surely does, in no way does it suck the story or give you the slightest thought of a character. <br /> <br /> 4/10 It is boring to be predictable and sad.
