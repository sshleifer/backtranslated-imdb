Bugs Bunny was a drawing called "Baby Buggy Bunny". The baby's face stole a Finster bank and wagon rolled out of money and Bug's rabbit fell into the hole. She wore her baby as a child to get into the Buggen holes. Looking at the bathroom mirror in the bathroom mirror, the scene of "Little Man" comes straight from the cartoon. It was a fun 5-minute drawing; not so much full movie. If you are really interested in this, buy the Bugs Bunny DVD. It was the first time original (1954). Also, you will get a lot more classic cartoon Bugs Bunny!
