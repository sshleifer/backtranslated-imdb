If you want to eat each representative of the dragon, do you know if you're doing a bad ride. <br /> <br /> I went into very, very low expectations, read other comments and read it with others and not abandoned. Unlike other, inexpensive and inexpensive films, this is not very funny (and unfortunately) very entertaining. <br /> <br /> -To follow the REMARKS <br /> <br /> First, the plot is very inconsistent. Following the mistakes, the idea that is based on the dragon that grows in 3 hours is completely confused. See, we want the movie to think dragon dragons come in space because they are the shape of meteorites and they really are dragon eggs. If this is explained, they show a horn with a farmer and the dragon appears. Later, the compulsory "mad scientist" is necessarily a rumor of the dragon over the dinosaurs. So, when apparently human beings were around dinosaurs, or just a pretty little plot here. The other important thing is that it is a "half as powerful" that is as strong as the one used in the laboratory in Hiroshima. Afterwards, the two boys are going to see everything later, and it's hardly any good! He knows another dragon, what they know. Everything is very predictable. As soon as men mentioned Clone, I thought they would clone a dragon. That means our Mr. If you think Smarty-pants would be the guy of security that he is not an intuitive and intelligent movie, he knew that this movie would be dragons. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the second worst is "special effects". Others have previously mentioned false rocks, CG helicopters and dragon. It seems a bit better than a blob, but everything that was done in reverse was left in the room, at the same time. They think that at first the dragons were flying far away (even though the whole movie in the cave may be the worst). It's fun to watch these things. There are no scenes of millions of different shots to face the same person. There are no essential statistics included in the "inputs" screen. <br /> <br /> They came close to the actors, they were not the greatest, but I think they tried at least. They seemed to be their favorite, for example, many of the players that participate in "BloodRayne", which should be given points. Although it turned out, Meredith seemed to have covered the make-up on her face, as they were lighter than all others. He looked like he was running with a white face. <br /> <br /> The script is bad and cursive. You do not really notice music, but it's not very bad at all. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to see the bottom line because you do not want to see it (eg, I did it), even though it's fun to have CG bad effects. Also, do not waste your time and money.
