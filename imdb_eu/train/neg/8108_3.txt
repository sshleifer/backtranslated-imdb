After reading the book, which had a great significance for me, the movie did not give me the feelings of the book. That's why Kaufman still asks me how much I liked this book. Yes, yes, it's just bad. The main thing is where is agility? From the first scene, music breaks most of the interviews and feelings, and continues throughout the film. I think the authors think that music is a live musical that is a bit higher than that, this story would be clear - but they have completely failed here. Music will give everything that gives the "movie" event to keep them so that everything is really hard. <br /> <br /> This adaptation is another example of how to fail. When the story line is decorated, it becomes dramatic. The film is being screened by Franz Tomas on the street, Sabina. The introduction of this meeting / passage that does not happen in the book, Tomas's story is more important than it is clear. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples where the story continues, the worst imo, however, the book that could have been done is simply not a movie, such as the Kundera style. That's why we're asking for a generous review of this site to write your own book and movie experiences just in the movie. While it's a non-film composition. For those who do not read the book, I recommend reading it. For those of you, I can say that you are wasting your time, and you are probably writing clear warnings here.
