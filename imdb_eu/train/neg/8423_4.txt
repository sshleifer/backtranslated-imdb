Forest Whitaker's performance is much more spectacular, it's worth it to be sitting by this dreck. "Historical Fiction" does not justify changing history. Nonsense begins with the imaginary character played by James McAvoy. In order to create a point of reference for the reader in the book, it is regrettable that pale people can not read a book to connect with unlucky protagonists, but at least somewhat put it. passive role Making a fake historical actress and making credit for this fiction in the world of Amin is irresponsible, lazy and stupid. His incredible or even more sincere acts of creativity are not just punishments, and he has opened the door for films that he wants to make joint with Leonardo DiCaprio. WE DO NOT LIKE YOU. The world's logic is not applied to sleep with a dictator's wife saying a Scottish movie. It does not apply to the dictator's wife who wants to sleep with a white boy and a careless white boy. For this reason, HELP is sleeping in front of the white boy, careless and proud, and Gillian Anderson plays glasses. I do not know what it is about, but I think Mr Numnen Tumnus was terribly and dirty. Kerry Washington thinks he would not have twice looked at him, so I can not believe that the wife of a dangerous dangerous man, Amin, would endanger her and lose her life. I do not believe in a doctor, and I do not see any appeals. It seems his character is much more arrogant than it makes sense, and it's just a pretense to make a cow look bad ... the word is again ... absurd. Think of it, you are turning these characters into a knot so you can see this incredible main character and never be such a guy. . Whitaker provides a great deal of magnetic performance, and he emphasized how much his incomprehensible Oscar-winning lecture did. It's hard to believe that the film did not exist.
