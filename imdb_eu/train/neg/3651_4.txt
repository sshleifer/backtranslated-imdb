I was very entertaining. Instead, I got a movie with some fun jokes, and they just worked a lot. I did not like the idea of ​​bringing Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty's descendants. It was confusing. It would be more fun if someone had just had a new one, if instead of resurrecting Moriarty. Some things were fun. Burt Kwou was always very fun. McCloud was fun at the horse. McGarrett Hawaii 5-0 was not McGarrett-like. Connie Booth is very good with accents. He is Indiana, but he played quite well English and New Yorker. Unfortunately, there was not much in the script. I expected a fun movie. Instead, I got a rather misleading movie with a wrong script. But ironic, both Booth and Cleese were together. They may have broken in the 77's.
