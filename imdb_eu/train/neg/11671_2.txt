I must say! (I gave 2 scores) <br /> <br /> See only if you suffer from insomnia. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of landscapes and it is chewing, but this film is not anywhere else. There is no silence, deep and shocking secrets are evident, there is no threat to heroic well-being. A few disagreements, about voice - that is enough. No secret can happen to anyone else. The final "secret" that is revealed in the movie can be fully predicted by that point. <br /> <br /> The land, for example, is located around a young woman named Woman. Faith (Meg Tilly), who is an artist, who is hired to paint a set of wall panels in a large hall, in a large mansion, is a very old rich, widowed older woman with a set of older and more and more mother-to-person type relationships the older he falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> His wife's daughter Cassandra is dead. You can mold the rest pieces together. <br /> <br /> Even though the scene with a mysterious man with mysterious heroes is not safe, you can safely fear security within a day or two. Why is it still that a few years after the death of Cassandra hangs. <br /> <br /> At the same time, it is the only civil servant in this vast mansion, it seems that there is a loyal retiree that makes everything ... cooking, cleaning, serving lunch, answering the door, etc. Except for the door lock appearance. In fact, a character is the only explanation of how Faith is entering into a room already. /> You do not stretch your chair's arms and take you to the edge of the seat, because there is no "tension" in this film - rare and pathetic revelations that appear from time to time. <br /> <br />
