Having small expectations, the footage of 'Husbands' five minutes earlier was a pleasant surprise. I do not say that the footage was a new grade material, but it gave me a solid foundation for a good "original" movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was collected in 1955. One day in a shooting schedule. After the new footage, Jules White decided to foil the film 'Brideless Groom', briefly, to make the story not so smooth. Jules and Felix Adler try to fix them through a new, fast new movie. Finished by the wrong ending of the boys (in this case Moe & Larry) firing on the ass. <br /> <br /> <br /> 3/10
