Well ... no trembling, the originals started in 1990 and I saw the movie quite enjoyable. However, II and III began to shake. Believe, these movies began to fall when the first one was over, butt blasters ??? Now, God alone is able to answer "why would God create a dump in a movie on behalf of God?" Tremors IV can not get into a bad movie, it can not even be considered as a epitome of a bad movie, because it lives more than that. Although I tried to sit down, I noticed that my eyes began to clear, and I expected that the little girl of the ring would come out of the TV and kill me. Did they really think they dressed in other films as if they were a western farm, would they improve the movie (the same event)? Honestly, I would never suggest buying a movie, I mean, cheaper ways to find things that smoke good.
