I totally fail to see what's funny in this movie. It seems that humor is corporeal. It's slow The story is very easy to be true. The characters do not create much sympathy, aside from some important characters. There is nothing surprising. What do writers of this writer think? "Oooo fun! Let's make an old lady on the pot! Let's make ... giggle! Let's do it ... act like little children! Oh, yes, that's absolutely brilliant and original!" br /> This film has been most annoyed by all the films I have seen over the last five years.
