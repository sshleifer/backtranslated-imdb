Störtebeker is really the worst television television on this planet. <br /> <br /> The impossibility is unbearable and history is completely absurd: there are just two examples: Visby was seen as three houses. . Instead, it was an important city today, since the best days had passed. Secondly, Hamburg would never have been watching the Baltic sea pirates. In Hamburg there was no Baltic Sea, at that time Lübeck was the main city. <br /> <br /> But it's worse than that: steering! Why is there such a guy an amateur to direct such a movie? It is impossible! There was not a single compelling scene, the fights were ridiculous and I could not laughter at most sharp scenes. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how an important television could not be.
