I can not describe this movie as enormous. Here is where I am who finds everything that has been encouraged here. Men of Rohan have 100% false fangs of their colored hair so that the actor does not match the appearance. Orcs looked great. Why is the gandalf moving bad? Why can not things say well? Saruman is not Aruman. The bad name of Tolkiens' characters was * sp * horrible. All and all are delighted to see the studio out of that secret, but rather terrible adaptations. See Hobbit's cartoon for a better cartoon Tolkiens. Hell, ROTK cartoons is also better to dribble this. 2/10
