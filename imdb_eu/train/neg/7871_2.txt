In 1993, "visitors" had a great success in France. So the sequence was inevitable and, unfortunately, this sequence is the worst ever. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that fills its promises. In fact, it should tell a single story. Jean Reno XX. He has to go through the century and have to take Christian Clavier halfway, so that time usually can follow his career. The problem is Clavier in the twentieth century. It feels comfortable throughout the century and, therefore, it can cause a return to the center. plot As a result, sometimes the movie is a shameful boss, sometimes a mess. <br /> <br /> But the film also suffers the performance of all actors. Reno and Clavier will be able to avoid the first movie, they fall into the trap: they are going through the top and become annoying. Then why did Jean-Marie Poir√©, filmmaker, Muriel Robin engage in the main role of women? He made a mistake because he feels bad and he feels guilty. The other actors are no better: Marie-Anne Chazel does not exist and Christian Bujeau, unbearable. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, the movie has good moments with gag, but they are often simple and simple. Sequences and conversations are damaged. The first movie was a success because it had been recovered because it had been recovered. So, a little girl takes up her family's relative family in Reno and asked her to take part in her weddings. <br /> <br /> Strict and disappointing monitoring. In any case, what is this interest in commercial film? <br /> <br />
