This is perhaps one of the strongest shows on Santa Claus, a book, an image or a movie that has been committed to any medium. She looks like Santa is looking at her down and helping her to defeat Merlin Satan's minions, Pitch does not do anything better. It is minimal, at least, with bad effects, even for standard 1959. If the child is watching this movie, he would have nightmares and never want to visit Santa. They would frustrate life. Imagine the baby shouting after the baby's "A Christmas Story". This will be shown if the movie is seen by children.
