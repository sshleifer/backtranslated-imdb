The murderer, the racer of the canine, has been killed by a police officer on the scene of his latest murder. In his tomb a worship was gathered to revive him, looking at the grave. Of course, this is what it works and says it takes away the dogs, and it will go back to its old murder mode with a new zombie look. Two police officers who are crazy about a rude city and a heart problem will return again. He tries to stop two killer killers from the original wreckage by resurrecing other dead people. Let them think they have been archived, but the plastic doll used in the original resurgence comes out of the tomb. It really is really confused, but it's not just litter. <br /> <br /> The operation is awesome and the police are the same man that plays a cop on the face of Dr. Vincent van Gore, which is why it is horrible. the annoying policeman of this film. The other police are struggling to get out of their dreadful lines. I'm now in a low budget movie, but this movie is awesome. I would be sleepy if my eyes were very easy and their nudes were not. There is a bit of gore, but the victims are just some of the animals that put the stomach. On the other hand, the zombie make-up is great and it is a long pedestrian that ravages the victims. There is also a half-decent scene where the murderer falls in love with a sexual doll. It's the stupid thing I've ever seen in a movie called Chipmunks. In the fishing line is just a plastic toy. <br /> <br /> The endless one is very bad. You would expect more fighting than the killer itself. God knows how they got the money to make a sequel. <br /> <br /> 4/10
