Just after seeing my eyes, I have to be honest ... I do not like it. I read so many good reviews about this film, but I did not get these reviews from where they came from. <br /> <br /> I've had a lot of time for newcomers to film, and I'm sure I'm going to do them the good guys, but they did When the budget was the main problem, the two full-length cameras (good hearts) were used, but the camera was really cheap. Another problem was the sound: all these girls are crying and crying at the same time, talking about each other, it's just that they hear what they say. <br /> <br /> It was a good idea to get it, in a short while, they go to a parked car and then drive. Shortly afterwards, a crash car crashes by a mad car, who wants to kill him, and has many opportunities. For that! ... and, on the other, girls have many opportunities to escape, but not! <br /> <br /> Very frustrating ... This I just did not disappoint!
