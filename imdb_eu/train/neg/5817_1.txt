The most difficult thing about this movie is to have something positive about it. The characters stereotyped "white trash"; The film's "plot" started from the beginning and the worst characteristic of this movie was that the nuance of the double body was so funny that it was fun. Unfortunately, the movie was a fun thing. Mrs. Jenkins would be better served in the future, the story of her life would prevent people from "entertaining". It was bad The positive side of this film (this has not been related to the mere quality of the film), my brother is thinking of spending money.
