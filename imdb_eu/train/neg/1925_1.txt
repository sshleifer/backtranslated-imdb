Has Ron Howard directed it? The 1966 cartoon is charming, with children who teach simple lessons using a simple plot. In this movie, Howard gives us a Whoville, Whoser, Whosper, a manipulator and centered on himself. Jim Carrey is horrible, but I'm sure he's not guilty of it; I imagine the script of the most imagined character, so Carrey focused on Tom Green and the magic of the movie. As Danny Devito's penguin resembles Batman Returns, Carrey's Grinch is so famous that he evaporates from his character's comedy. When we could identify the 1966 cartoons with Grinch, Carrey's Grinch is an angry and angry man who has not seen him at one time or another, parked cars, a car that is shrinking or sitting in the supermarket with small children. his cane This Grinch has no level of humanity, humor or idea, and at the end of the film he fakes his fake remarks. The whole movie is fake: Christmas lighting competition is stupid, there is an attempt to explain a mysterious mystery about a curious lengthy reflection on the child's interior and why it is extra curious. none of them In the face of the 1966 cartoon, I would imagine that the children would find this film, arduous, irritable, and contradictory. Do we really need to see Slutty Smurf, Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, he was filled with Ron Howard among his family. Get rid of jokes, templates, sexual jokes and other humorous mandatory humor of Carreyesque, and you have a movie that is far away from George W. Bush's 1966 cartoons (or books). rational and slim thinking. Thumbs down on this great turkey.
