Do you ever wonder why it seems that the Pacific islands automatically assume the American's black humor? Whether their origin is ethnic? Well, this movie will not answer the questionable question, but it will give a great deal of case study. <br /> <br /> So far, this movie is like "Old School", the Pacific Island for New Zealand fishermen. This immediately raises questions about what the task is. Keeping the stereotypes of the Pacific islands in New Zealand Socialist? Is it exploiting this potential market? The story is weak, humorous jokes and the end is expected. This movie has nothing to do with New Zealand cinema, but merely merely as an inappropriate romantic comedy.
