This movie must be in line with boring film for many years. It's not until the Harrison wood movie is saved down to the bottom. <br /> <br /> The murder of this movie is an interesting point in this movie, but it's nothing interesting. The casts are not bad, but the script is horrible, I was surprised at this movie, thinking about how to find out how to entertain all the people on earth. <br /> <br /> The producers of this film were very clear. . They made a boring movie, but they covered the actors and the best actors in their work. People will go to superproductions and probably think and think about this movie, Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe have to be good and rent this movie (boys get into a great time) <br /> <br /> Ripping this movie and If you want to rent, some people liked the movie, but I liked seeing a movie meaning
