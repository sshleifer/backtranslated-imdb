At the beginning of the 70s, a marginal film, but a great remake of what he liked. I saw the original 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20-minute movie and "double hour" must be completed or executed in any way. Cheesy storyline, by the way, is different than the original one. The main involvement of the government was far away. There is no flow from one scene to another. Originally, you can tap and keep beer or bathroom. <br /> <br /> They just made a few hours to change the waves of the pans car. It takes much more time than real life. Automobiles realize this. Likewise, a 1968 freighter and challenger of the 1970s would have to be shot with a fool or a fool who chose to take trash. They are not "self-peoples" to be so clear, and their pace is not painless. <br /> <br /> The actors did not have emotions, everything was cut and dried. A step above a monotonous one. Barmitzvah is one more exciting and energetic. <br /> <br /> In the end, but surely, the radio DJ stated that Challenger had hit 180 or 185 (??) 180 bulldozers. That's all the garbage. Did you say aerodynamics or not? Hahahaha !! This movie is a joke. Do not waste your time watching.
