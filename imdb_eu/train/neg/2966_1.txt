I can not understand all the hype about this movie. Ok, if you want a cheap splatter, you will love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors - do not miss this. Personally I liked the actors in this movie, they seem to be hired directly on the street. The interviews are flat and you know what happens next. The overall quality of this movie is a very small budget. When we watched this movie (with me and 3 other people), we all considered that some people had to make this movie, just to graduate in the film school - with the least effort. Another problem that reduces the whole experience is a bad cam (very shaking) and a bad sound. The whole movie seems to be recovering with a single microphone.
