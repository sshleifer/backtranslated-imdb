All Hype! How best to describe the movie for the most depressed people because they do not have a movie by a distributor? So they do it themselves. Otherwise, the film's fashion is not justifying film content. The story is short and it can be short. The operation is bad, but the animation and the music are pretty good. Otherwise, do not waste your time - do not believe hype! However, if you have a free movie, do this. Then you will not waste money. However, filmmakers work well in hitting their story and creating their cliffhangers with their self-indulgent cliffhangers with a mini-series. Otherwise, they are unsuccessful wonders.
