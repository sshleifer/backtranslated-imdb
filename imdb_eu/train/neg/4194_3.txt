This film has been very promising for a viewer who loses a director and a story of a blind woman who will be helping her. However, somewhere in the middle writers do not know where to go. <br /> <br /> The incredible event was next (Russia must be very small, because they are one after the other), the motivation of the female protagonist is understandable (why does she continue to take her boat?) Why does she not borrow a mobile phone? Trying to call somebody?), the side story was absolutely ridiculous (it was supposed to be a fun story with the mother and the boy? and what was the story with the younger sister?). The plot's arbitrary appearance has still been quite predictable. <br /> <br /> It was a great value. As I said, the film was a good idea, the images and the scores were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were also good. So it could be a good movie ... but it was not.
