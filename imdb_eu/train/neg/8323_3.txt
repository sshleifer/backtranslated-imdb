From the beginning, this film had little errors. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a wealthy young man who inherited the wealth and power of his father, and keeps his father's footwear and strings in the fight against the mother (and the executive). It also has a heart attack and a limb in the organ registry. It seems your first instinct is not very important, later, the most important first instinct, such as your surgeon (Terrence Howard) and a middle class (Jessica Alba) love. Creative story lines, but not bad enough to damage the movie. Real "oy vey!" For a moment Lena Olin was a character. Lilith, a pioneer woman ... subtle! <br /> <br /> Surgical scenes are not censored. As I admitted, those who met the terrific scenes of surgery would not think it. After being awake during anesthesia the horror was fine. When you see emotional agony, Christensen shouts through a crisis in the chest, and through the spread of the ripper. It's time for the iron gate to go through the anesthesia and, after a misfortune of minority, is lucky enough to help her learn to kill her surgery team. <br /> <br /> The great victory, however, is very predictable and it sends the movie to the remembrance of those little signs of the conspiracy and there, but like us, it is missing at the beginning. <br /> <br /> In the end there are two tits with a mother. Olin's gesture is horrible because of bad writing. The other is a secret to the past of the family, which seemed very sharp and insignificant. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, the drama of well-considered anesthesia is lost in a conspiracy drama. Trying to fall for an ultimate essay, which falls flat, taking away the whole movie.
