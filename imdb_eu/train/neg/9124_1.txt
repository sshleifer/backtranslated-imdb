Maybe it's never been the worst movie made by Peter Sellers (I think that laughter is "Zenda preso"), but it's probably the most depressing. Sellers, especially sans-make-up Nayland Smith, seems to suffer from chemotherapy. Like Fu Manchuk, he barely sees and passes most of the movie (which worries about the amazing scene that drives the electricity on the stream) to fall under the weight of this makeup. The assistant players also look tired and down, and Sid Caeser's offensive is "Chinks!" (A bright place: it would be a last time that a great image was so insulting by Asi ... or, on the other, not an Asian star!). The movie looks surprisingly cheap, with vortex photos and strange sets. In the end, the whisper of Elvis seems to be at the end rate. Helen Mirren's stunning, tall, thin, and nervous stitches that hurt her pants and pants give this sad life a lively life. After all, this film offers a mysterious presupposition of the death of a great comedy, and also gives a more accurate documentation of his dying.
