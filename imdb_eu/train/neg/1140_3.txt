Terrifying, but especially in the sense that it will end before 70. I saw this late in the month of 1976 and thought again. Like crackers, it's better than anything else (just). <br /> <br /> Ray Milland is terrifying because he looks like a little taxidermist looks. Yvette Mimeux seems to burn Burbank Brown beautiful city. <br /> <br /> It's a version of Rosemary's Baby's Roy Rogers. This is not a turkey that should never be made. If you have insomnia and Saturday at 1:30 p.m. and there is no hope of the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship, I assume this. But God helps you if this is your only chance of recreation.
