An old man, on the ground, on the main road, on the plot, will live one day in the woods, witnessing a man killed by the child. Soft For Digging did not seem like an image of the man who tried to convince the old man's attempts to persuade the police. However, there is a problem in the place where the police are guilty of the assassination of the murderer. Soft For Digging has a small conversation that reflects most of the movie scene, the old man who lives in the house. The old man who suddenly appeared when the baby was dead twice when I was scared during the movie. The other movie to be admitted did not commit me; The timing of the movie seemed to me to be too slow. A limited conversation was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its effects, after watching the movie, was too long. I think it could be a ghostly relationship with the baby and the old man. Only in the wood can cause doubts about yourself at night in mysterious situations, children are always terrifying as ghosts, see Dark Water.
