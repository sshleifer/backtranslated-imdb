(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian "actioner" fantasy (and I have not used that term), I try to see more than a year. I ended up finishing, and now I would not want to repeat the effort. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you the effort to save you two hours of life ... a man with a long hands to see his mother at home. Things become ugly after the mafia boy of an old girlfriend. When the girl goes home she takes revenge. The Mafia man sends his men to the revenge while the police are looking for him. <br /> <br /> Very little is said. There's no explanation (it's not an asylum where they're blocked by the girlfriend), and most of the time the screen is out of reach. The film essentially forms part of a person who does not look at Adrian Brody and does not say anything; people die (full screen, most actions are turned off on the screen). It looks good, it works fine and it's been a good thing, it could be a good movie. Hell, I'd like to have a real character sense of development or a back story (we all know that we were the guy who was selected as a baby). The movie is about two hours longer and six-way. If they did not want to tell at least the pace they could get it, it came too fast. No, however, we get the hero on a boat. In a bus hero, walking on the hero, disturbed hero.Here you seek with his girlfriend. I was really annoyed that I think this movie could be good, just to do something or say something to say something "to get this tip". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At about four hours (all attempts to see this) I will never return. Only for those who want to see the little Russian action
