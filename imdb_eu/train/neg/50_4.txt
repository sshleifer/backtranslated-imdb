The guy in a whimsical movie with "horror" in three pieces does not make the viewer "out" and, unfortunately, tells us why he tells us three stories. <br /> <br /> The first story brings a young man into an accident that confronts two psychotic cars. Both become completely predictable. However, it is quick (about 15 minutes), violent, well-done and well-done. Predictable but nice. <br /> <br /> A man running a second carries a large amount of money after stealing. He breaks his car, a dog is attacked and falls into a nearby clinic. Obviously, it's wrong and very slow. It's too long for 30 minutes. Good fit. <br /> <br /> The third is just a horror story. Beautiful and lonely woman, Mr. Right looking. It has beautiful sets, it has a nice erotic feeling and a nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not distant fear. <br /> <br /> Very stupid is over. <br /> <br /> In the end, the first thing is worth watching, but that's it. After that tune, turn off.
