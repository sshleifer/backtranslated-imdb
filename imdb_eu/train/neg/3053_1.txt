Wow Who ever said that Edward Wood Wood Jr never had any effect? The voluminous battery of donkey decoys is a perfect case; "The Violent Years" looks like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also has bad looks like Keith Richards's first-night broadcasts. I've had nightmares, you know, waking up and sweating, never approaching Santa Claus from the apparent soil of my being. However, I can imagine that this movie can be a good party. Also, if you are looking for a perfect example of the VHS movie Santa-Satan dichotomy, look no further. Do not look at this movie when the MST3K version is released when it's available. Move Satan here "Santa Claus".
