It's hard to describe this movie and try hard to avoid it quickly, because it feels you can be a perfect movie for a 12-year-old girl ... <br /> <br /> This movie has a nice concept, modern version of Sleeping Beauty, twist with one. He has lovely sketches on friendly plans and young boy's relationships with his mother and his classmates ... you can say a nice start, but then to the goal, to be very hard, to be a science. fiction, drama, a thriller, a romantic love story, a fairy tale, comedy and the sun. The result was that the viewers were quite adequate. For example, the girl (who plays Risa Goto) eventually wakes up the scene of his Yuki Kohara kiss, instead of romanticism, we will try to be terrified then laugh ... it's a cheap trick. He was trying to bet on the best half of the film and faced up with all the emotions. <br /> <br /> I do not read the original story on the basis of the movie (this is a well-known work. Osamu Tezuki's comic strip artist's story is intriguing and intricate). I wonder what all the problems of the original story they are asking or adapting to? No one who uses the "foolish logic" of these comic books in Japan will be unaffected. For example, how did the character Yuki Kohar get at the hospital for a long walk on a long bus, after seeing the Risa Goto's television camera in front of her, after having seen her live interview. TV? <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that are directly copied from other films (very creative!), and they all seem quite absurdly annoying. The famous "The Lion with the Mouth" is the "scene" of the Roman vacation "<br /> <br /> the movie wants to be everything, but it's nothing ... it's not a fairy tale and it was not enough jokes to make a comedy ... And surprisingly, some scenes also seem like some "ghost" movie. However, it has to be credited with having achieved the head of the feeling of young teens. . <br /> <br /> When watching this movie, it seems that some movies that might be appropriate only for people under 18 would be a movie. Certainly, it would be on the poster of this movie. <br /> <br />
