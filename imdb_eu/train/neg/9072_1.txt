This movie has no plot and no focus. Yes, it's a stupid comedy, but writers do not have cinema. There is no title in the movie. "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" was called or something similar. The characters are not developing and nobody says what happens! The character of the classmate of the girl (That 70's Show) was the only person worthy of watching. It was ridiculous and he stole every scene he entered. The others need to ensure that their university degrees are operational, as well as performing a career.
