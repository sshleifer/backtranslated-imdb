Spike Lee has dropped her success early and this mess does not help anything. I often saw the movie go to the movie or reach the point. Lee's first movie is disappointed with a white dealer. <br /> <br /> What is it? Italians swear and like funky sex, but not their wives? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I would go to the Scorses movie. He adds a horrible star godfather to the stereotype. <br /> <br /> I admire Lee in several films, above all, "Do the right thing." This movie is a waste of time.
