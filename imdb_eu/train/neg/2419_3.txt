Simply, I give this three to my friends and when he waited for us he fulfilled: entertaining. <br /> <br /> I was not foolish enough to rent this thought, it would be a zombie movie like Romero or Fulci, but I rented it was a laugh. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a game or if you're ashamed of a movie, if you're looking for a movie, go for it. This "junior" "Mystery Science Theater" is perfect for fans, but the only bad problem is that it is so bad, it's also fun. <br /> <br /> I personally think that it's a shame to link any other Hollywood title we know, because that movie is like a whisper, because it has its own genre.
