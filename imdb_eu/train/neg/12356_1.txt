Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to leave the movie, but I did not deny it. I do not know what Ridley Scott wanted, but I learned that in the army, women are as stupid as men. They learn to speak, to insult and fight, and this is also a waste of time (I think). And yet, what the hell was this last Lybia scene? Are they still fighting Gaddafi or is it easy to believe that people are always at risk for Islamic people?
