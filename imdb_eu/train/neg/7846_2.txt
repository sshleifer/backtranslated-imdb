You know I wanted to see "The Hills eyes 2". I really liked the original, and the remake was pretty fun. Wes Craven had more money than he did for the second time for special effects. Even though I prefer the original movie, the version was fine and it was nice for me. Bloody, intense, and great special effects. In short, the beautiful movie of Crisis, for any horror fans. <br /> <br /> "The Hills have eyes 2" brings us. Men, where do I start? Plots, or not, is paper thin. We are not breaking a new ground. The military have decided to monitor the area, and all of these people are missing. So what are we doing now? Let's go to the National Guard to investigate. In Hollywood, we have to become the stupid and worst soldiers of the world we have never seen. Well, I have never seen that premise. To make a short story short, the mutants that mutant soldiers take away graphically. Once again Nicotero's special effects are excellent, but it's in any way boring, and everyone who can be predicted dies. Honestly, it seemed to me to take that gesture fast. It was bloody and graphic, but face to face, it seemed boring and not terrifying. It would be very nice for me if this film had an original thoughts. We shared the duties of We Craven and his son, and he has participated in many of my favorite horror films, but unfortunately it is not one of them.
