I've seen this movie for a long time ... it was fortunately free. In the theater I have to be one of the twenty people who have watched this movie. I do not remember a bunch of that, but I remember being very bored, the plot did not make sense and when I came out of the theater, I only knew at least what the worst movie I ever saw. One thing I was very worried: if the sun is low enough to make people live, why not make the temperature comfortable, sweat and sweat instead? How stupid do we think?
