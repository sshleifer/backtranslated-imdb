You may have spoilers (we will not surprise this or something in this movie) <br /> <br /> Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything that has been forgotten? It's cheaper for them, but after a while, do not you think that overall quality and how people think it would not be. Villanos de la Casa, the crucifixes of cartoons are spectacular, without any sense. The signs that do not match the previous films are: The voices are not remotely joining and Iago is again bad (since?!). I know these films direct their children, but they were the time they all had. enjoy Disney movies The movie's musical number (Disney's specialty for many years). I would not recommend the movie to young people as well. I can not get a lot of all those same-caliber movie movies before a little animated studio has over Disney's quality time.
