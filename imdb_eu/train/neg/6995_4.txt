It's funny that Romero's version is that they are very young people who say that it's so much fun (according to other messages). Here we have something: tidy, full of action, gory and "Whoopee" 2-hour full MTV video. Bad edition, pop-video camera works, "cool" music blah blah blah <br /> <br /> Actually, it's not bad with the latest remakes (the Chainsaw Massacre was a total ruin) ... pretty good everything, absolutely predictable The "next deceased" stakes and the total budget that will generate a lot of revenue from the Dawn Of The Dead, so that the original fans will eliminate the curiosity ... <br /> <br /> The remake of the classics is not embarrassed? Could they not really bring something original? Why upgrade Dawn Of the Dead? The things that were original (those that believe that children in the middle segment are so boring that they think we should be slow to show you everything you do not like at all) are absolutely missing. This action is very simple and simple. The faster the better. If you go into action movies (and so the 2004 version is fine), it's quite reasonable, but for anyone who likes a little substance in their films ... you can be ready (again) ... Look at the movies In the coming years, the trendy The Godfather series, as the director of fashionable Pop will re-enact at this time, and remake of Star Wars, saying that all children say how much better a new version is. The version is slow and boring and has shot a camera for more than 5 seconds ... <br /> <br /> Not bad, but in 10 years they will discuss Romero version, not role
