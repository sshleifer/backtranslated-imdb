Slow, Slow, Slow ... There's no mystery or enthusiasm in this movie. In the first ten minutes, what is "mole" in your mind, you have to be dead in your brain. He also had to be a secret service because he had put the whole movie. There is no credible character in the film (not a movie). The pace of the movie is slow, there is no tension. The contracted killer is a great movie, if he does not want Michael Douglas to think of a large glass panel. The funniest scene in the movie is the code that ends when the president sees his wife as a wife. It's fun to laugh. At least six people got up and left the movie before. I bounded them if I had not sat in the middle of the line. I would not recommend the movie to anyone.
