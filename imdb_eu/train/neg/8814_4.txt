This movie is not interesting, except for the first ten minutes. The rhythm and editing is perfect for getting into a set of pieces better than Gosford Park. Then, inexplicably, he slows down, loses his focus and resembles a French traditional movie, eventually recovering the relationship between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve). In the middle there are too many backdrops and loops of the story; Some threads started did not end. <br /> <br /> ADVANTAGES ******* The main story is Antoine-Cécile. He has been a member for many years with his relationships, even though he is getting married again and getting married in Morocco. As a constructor, now he reconstructs his life and regains his own with the mask of Cécile's wedding. After that, he is buried under a terrible accident (literally) and becomes a comatose. Only the old image wakes up with the past and expresses their way of life together again. ******* END OF SPOILERS <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that the director wants us to see what perspective he wants us to see so many other stories here: illegal immigrants want to join Europe, there is often a radio. About the disappearance of the former regime in Iraq. Cécile's child's wife is bisexual and dog (loyalty) cools her boyfriend when she finds out that she seems to be a sick girl that lives with her (that's right?). She is a traditional Islamist sister and relates to Cécil's husband. Morocco portrays the opposite, despite all the buildings, there is a curiously colonial image that almost glorifies the past. Islam describes it as a backward and extreme tendency, sometimes it may be true, but definitely in general. In the end, it can not be described as the best color and cords. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu are superb. They are very popular with this material, which rotates something in every scene: lifting a eyebrow, body language, pride radio, wrong behavior. The film itself is disappointing and confirms its limited role in today's French film world. Of course, with notable exceptions.
