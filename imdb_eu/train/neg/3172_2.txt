This movie is very rough and is not original. Sometimes I like romantic comedies. Seeing good is like a dinner to eat ice cream. It is something to be done all the time, but it is a pleasant experience, ignorant of what is not prudent. This movie thought how stupid I was sitting to continue throughout the stay. All this was inexpensive. It seems that the films are superimposed so that they are so clean in some places. It also has CGI curses and lame sets. <br /> <br /> Writing was rough. I know you're expecting some plots in a common comedy, but they usually do not mind laughing. This movie is very unknown, it really is sitting down and asks you about a difficult behavior of coincidences and totally unbelievable. The characters in the movies were taken to the scene to make or explain the scenes. Sure, how the movies work, but you did not notice what's happening. Inelegant This is the term I needed to use. <br /> <br /> There was hardly anyone who did not like the movie. I do not care who ended someone, while everyone was far away from me, and I did not hear them talking about it anymore. Why did Paul Rudd, the only great character in the character's film, want a completely absurd control of Eva Longoria with misfortune? Likewise, almost all the involved people received a constant solution. A straight man wants to be gay for five years, to hang on with an attractive woman (and bathe)? The best time we came to you came with the best Rudd's cryptic sister, who was lying with Rudd, who was just as annoying as he was to go to the end. Women of Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive. They may find something better to appear on the right track.
