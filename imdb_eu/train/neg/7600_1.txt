This movie plays the role of acting because of the good direction that does not occur at Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually the actor, but this is the youngest. Donald Sutherland plays as an amateur. Why? Because the script is horrible, the adaptation is horrible and the actors feel bored and half-hearted. The atmosphere of the movie is bad - I thought it was only when I had finished and I turned it down halfway. The director has done a very bad job and I'm not reading the novel but it's a missed opportunity. The atmosphere that tries to remind yourself of this movie, and the message and story that never reaches the audience. In a nutshell TERRAIL is a movie.
