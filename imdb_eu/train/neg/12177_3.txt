Since the 70's, writer and producer Charles Band has been in charge of hundreds of science-fiction, fantasy and horror B films. Some of them are a wonderful example of how to maximize a small budget; Many of them are pretty bad. Trancers (1985) was one of those strange gems. <br /> <br /> Terminator style travel and action story, Trancers played Tim Thomerson Jack Deth. Whistler travels to the past that lives in the body of an ancestor. Whistler is able to control other men with their psychic powers, which obeys the obedient titles, and tries to kill the future leaders of history. Jack is following 1985, the decision to stop him. In this 1991 continuation, Jack is still living in 1985. After destroying Whistler, Leena (Helen Hunt), a young woman and a young woman. to succeed in the first film. But for Jack, things are not long, and problems appear Whistler's brother, E.D. Wardo, who is trying to build an army trancer. <br /> <br /> The Sustainable II lack the charm and simplicity of origin, and there is a great despair in thinking the original is good. This story is difficult if you have not seen the first movie (or at least not a long time), and there are few high-impression actions and special effects. The disappearance transition was so much fun; Instead of writing a cheesy flyer with some liners and a script is written. <br /> <br /> This movie is about the only reason to recommend genre fans. He has many names known to science fiction and horror movies: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch and Martine Beswicke. Unfortunately, most of them seem to have "off days", while shooting Trancers II. On the other hand, the performances are half-way. <br /> <br /> Of course, the series Trancers has its enthusiasts; Since there have been four more follow-ups. If the quality is not an imminent jump, I can not imagine being good.
