In my opinion, the favorite part of this film, which reflects the absurdity of the procedure, stupidity and forgiveness, comes to the heart of the film. DOCTOR TED NELSON and Sheriff's husband's wife have finally squeezed Melting Man on landing on some stairs in an electric generator. Remember that Nelson is almost looking for MM, and that MM has killed and eaten a lot of people (including his boss), and Nelson is very aware that MM is violently insane and hungry for human beings and blood. <br /> <br /> So, Sherif points out his gun to the MM, who is the point, and I give the film and the props of Rick Baker to this end, the boring and terrifying human being we've ever had. see DOCTOR TED NELSON issues a very important question: "WHAT DO WE DO ?!?!" <br /> <br /> The camera goes to DOCTOR TED NELSON, and it is obvious that Ted does not know what to do. Apparently Ted was so confident that he could find the man of fusion, he never thought he would have to hold some devices, a loop or rugged, or network, or some relaxing darts, or Vangelis's New Age ribbon. wild beast <br /> <br /> So, the sheriff is terrifying and terrified, Melting Man goes wild, and darkness arises. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is why NASA explains that the space shuttle under the last 30 years is losing the lunar space underwater, going back to the moon or going to Mars, as everyone knows. doing. I do not know. <br /> <br /> However, this is a quiet, straightforward way to write down all aspects of this movie. It's hard to say that the actors are really good because they're scorned by their characters. <br /> <br /> The other two incredibly painful sequences also increase the stupidity of the procedure: there is a scene from lumpiest. Old couples in the world tried to steal lemons from a tree, only smashed by fusion men. This scene is what cinema was in the 70s. I can assure you have not seen any of the things that people watch over your life, and do not see any violence. And every woman trying to resist the Melting Man's attack on the walls of a horse, BTW, I think that the famous filmmaker Jonathon Demme has a long career in this scene. The redneck husband goes home first and never comes out again. The only thing that helps to literally keep up is that, as I said, their horse is apparently wrinkled, and we must see at least a two-minute duration of any film directed at SANE filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning, director of IMM and He must be damaging to the photographer. I remember old-fashioned Columbo where he was much better than here - no one is the idea of ​​the main man, but strong and discrete, but nobody can be completely unfair in real life, because the director looks at it here. <br /> < br /> The others make a little better except for the old couple (and close, I know that laughter was playing, but the I was laughing!) but not much. <br /> <br /> The category of film disasters falls into the category "so bad you can not". However, I would see them again before seeing the abortions of the 70s and 80s ("Track of the Moonbeast" and "It Lives By Night"), and MST coverage is very fun. If you have an option, see the MST version.
