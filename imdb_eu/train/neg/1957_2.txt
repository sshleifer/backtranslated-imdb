For most of the time I was enjoying this movie, but I felt I was watching the children's movie. I honestly think someone wrote a pg script and then decided to add blood, nudity and language to the filming. It was unfair. It seems that there are films like "magic" ("pig") or "outer angels" that have defeated the evil fairytale. parents believe their daughter to see the ghost and use that ability to defeat the fairy victory. When I bought this movie, I thought it was an answer to the B movie before the fallen darkness; In some ways, with a short film, money is 1/4, but they do not. They made a film worse, and probably lost the same amount of money lost in the darkness.
