What a horrible movie. The rotten tomato had a good score for that. do not be fooled by comments; It was not terrifying. It was not fun. It was not quick. It will not be your attention. I was wasting 2 days to see this dog holiday in my life. computer-generated monsters was interesting to see the first two times. After about 15 minutes, he was no longer entertained. It was a great conversation, it must be translated. Another stupid Americans have pointed out. They were portrayed 3 and all lacked character, intelligence and judgment.
