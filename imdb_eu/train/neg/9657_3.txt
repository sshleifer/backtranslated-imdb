1) I am not a skilled weapon, but I can also see the difference between US viral vultures between World War II and World War II. In the film, we can see the soldiers "M1 Garand" (sold out in 1932), but not the true "1903 Springfield" ("Silent Death") and used until World War II. The difference - M1 will load 1.5 times more and 3 times more fire scale! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield had to reload after each shot. Low Difference?! 2) German army uniforms have been borrowed in 1940. Especially helmets. The German helm of the end of the First World War has been very alive, we can not see a movie too. And if we make other searches in archives, how true is this "True Story"? I'm surprised, how many directors might be "true" for cheap expansion.
