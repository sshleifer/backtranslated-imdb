This woman has never stopped talking all over the film. He recorded all the lines and gave everything a bit of natural emotion. It also has the most extraordinary brightness, and the tone of his voice is like nail polish. This movie has a lot of BAY, Betsy Drake, and not enough Cary Grant, who left the film, left the whole film on his own.
