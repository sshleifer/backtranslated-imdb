I thought it was better than the average movie because it was a cable. I expected something of the melodrama's cheek and its extraordinary effects on Christmas Rush or the classic First Daughter / Target / Shot. <br /> <br /> I chose the cast ... especially liked me. Ron Livingston was a tough SWAT commander. Welcome to see the same material that was so lucky to hear Band of Brothers. Producers and designers made homework, since all the scenes and shots seem to be made in 1997. <br /> <br /> So if you can see this movie and I'm sure you will play FX fifty times ... Take 2 hours and enjoy it.
