So, this guy named George is sitting alone at home, until he appears to have two women. George's wife is in a hospital where her son is guarded, when his wife is away, George enters the bubble bath and loves two girls. It's not because this great scene really shows anything. After that, the birthday wakes up and the girls are still in the house. They make a nice breakfast, but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and tries to dock them but when he returns home, girls are still home. The girls have just had enough of the old George and they do not want to prepare anymore. Both become the main psychopaths and George uses their bad game. They liked the girls who liked what they did and they mixed the George house. George was not really his two great guests. George said he was married, he did not really mean. He looks like George in Tom Tucker Family Guy. I've been for two girls all the time.
