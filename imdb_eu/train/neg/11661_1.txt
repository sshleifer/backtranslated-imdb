Basically, action / comedy is excessive and unpleasant. First of all, I'd like to say, Scans Movie (1) I enjoyed the Wayans brother and they were moments of succession. Unfortunately, the white chick does not give half laughing. <br /> <br /> Their mood is totally raw. If you like burping, farting, stupid catchphrases you should probably look this way. When they are not raw, they're idiotic. All the first 10 minutes of the film gave me everything, completely unknown, stupid. <br /> <br /> However, I saw everything because I was with a friend (otherwise I would not worry). This story is definitely thin, it was a terrifying movie, but at least laughs were fast and steady. I think this is probably one of the main problems of this film, laughter is not fast enough. Some jokes are browsing for a long time, first of all, when they are fun. If you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells, try. If you want a sleek comedy with more laughs, check out the horror movie, 1 + 2/2 aircraft. <br /> <br /> 1/10 An absolutely unknown, a thin story, a movie that seems to be based on an idea. that is, if we are dressed in white films?), but there is not enough material.
