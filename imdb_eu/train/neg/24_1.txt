I have to congratulate the genius that has accepted this. Edward Furlong, you are not as good as friendship, you can not take a huge amount of amateur amateur cost, just want to make money. <br /> <br /> Shooting is bad and I mean BAD. Anyone with the camera would get the same or better results. <br /> <br /> It can be said by the agent: do not go to the supermarket for the actress. Good people usually get into a degree or at least have a damn experience! Director ... Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your goal in life, just suck yourself as a director. Your leadership is inadequate, the angles are completely mixed (not in a good way), the lines seem like they are reading the toilet paper, and damn music ... it always happens and it should not be. without apparent reason. And do not write, by the way. Making films is not like working in a cafe, it requires art and skill, what I really need. <br /> <br /> Instead of filming a shooting shooter, you should shoot it. Go back to oblivion and wait "until something good is created" or just go find a job in a cafe. You will have less stress and you have saved movies and bad nights. <br /> <br /> vote: 1/10 (my first)
