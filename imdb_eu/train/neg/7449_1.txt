Lorna Doone's very disappointing versions. Lacking too many characters, without romantic scenes, the story changes is too short, there was a small budget. It's not enough to understand the story of the conversation novel. Certain scenes Lorna seems to have a cold pain in her upper lips. I'm sure it's better to make makeup better. I think they did not shoot to stop until healed, compassion. Probably, why this movie is missing the scenes of kisses. Only one endless kisses scene. Lorna Doone is a great story and it's true. Lorna Doone's 2000 version is longer, romantic, pleasant and truthful for the book.
