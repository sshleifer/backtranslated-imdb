Oh, god, what a horrible and horrible movie. To make a comment on the state of affairs, television is just a reflection of the worst thing in reality. Jason Jones and Don McKellar will take part of Interstitials, the most fragile part of a ton of thought and thinking. Rather, at this time, he is a brainless minded man when he speaks of the camera, an interview written with love and insults to insults, which promotes the "meaning" of the spectator's throat. <br /> <br /> Also, points that can be filmmakers: long periods and quiet scenes do not match the art. There are no absurdities to extend even large ends or angles. If you want to see this movie, please. Serious Please. You need to do better things.
