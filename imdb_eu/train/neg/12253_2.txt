I never thought that the movie could be so serious, but I was wrong. Tremendous influence, plump terrain, awful effects. The crocodile was horrible and, suddenly, the word was sitting on the stupid sex / murder. It was amazing and that's not wonderful! How can someone see this movie after saying "Yeah, it's a good movie. People will see" if you have not seen it, do not let them say that you do not :-(
