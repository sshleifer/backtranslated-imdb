I've seen many years of horror, such as the Nightstalker, the Wendigo legend, so I started looking for an angry love that caused them to add flavor to the Halloween season. I was wrong. The whole movie generates a horrible sense of horrific and horrible events, but then a very simplistic revenge and murder story for losing property. Frightening: no! This movie is very similar to Cold Creek Manor, a totally loser. <br /> <br /> Believing something of horror films in Hollywood is getting harder and harder, it's almost always very original and scary. . What stupid movie pays you to pay? Return to drawing tables. Do some millions of green ones to throw away.
