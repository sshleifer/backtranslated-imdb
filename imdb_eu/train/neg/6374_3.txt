This movie was a confusing beginning. I like Gina Phillips, but I did not have to say this, just like the movie was Ring Around the Rosie, this is not a good movie. Jeepers Creepers was a better way. However, Faye Dunaway was good. He was totally disturbed by me and at the end he was crazy. Jennifer Cassi (Phillips) was talking about how her twin sisters would come to the funeral. She is in a house owned by her sister and her grandmother (Dunaway) is Emma's life aunt. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) is pleased to refuse her life while living, she can not die. Although he tries to kill Jennifer, he tries. The choir has a strange part. When sleep is in contact, roots eat the organs, so they can not sleep. But they do it. She is fundamentally crazy and Mary Ellen will never die and her relationships will be buried, but not dead, they suffer permanently to keep Mary Ellen alive. Yes, I hope that helps. If not, forgive. I love you.
