I rented this movie, today I think football is a good movie because I am a great footballer. Boy, I was wrong. This movie is religious and predictable and really realistic. This movie pretty much tells you that your Christians can get everything you want in life so you can become an excellent football player! You do not become an excellent football player becoming a Christian and asking God, you practice and hard work. All you need to do is ask God and give it to you ... puh-lease. That is not true at all. I laughed several times for that shame. It was fun when the only part was muted (Shultz the cartoonist? No, he ducked over the Atlantic, etc.) But really this movie was not very good. I do not recommend, especially if you are not a Christian, lol.
