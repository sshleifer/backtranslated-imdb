Van Damme. What can I say? Bill Goldberg. YOU'LL BE DONE We now know that this movie will be very horrible. <br /> <br /> I saw in the first five minutes of this film in TBS, knowing that it would be bad. But I did not think it would be too bad. It's horrible, Van Damme is getting old (at last), but unlike Arnold, his films are also. <br /> <br /> Forget the movie. Do not see Then I would not pay for this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars - Its a wonderful heart, a wonderful walk with emotion. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe not. But we would think that the merchant would like to be sure, right? <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
