I just finished watching this movie. I was very excited because I am a fan of Punk Rock, Horror movies and Spoofs. I was surprised at what I saw. I know it was a small budget, but I did not expect a video camera to be expected. With a good song and The Old Fantorpops, the band begins with a very rich song, reforming the Where they Wander song, and immediately gets killed in a great way. It's an excellent opening. But the problem is that everything in the end was the movie. Direct screening, A death. Another live one, A death. It is annihilated The scene of the death is excessive abuse (literally). Why does not the murderer use other limbs, like legs, eyes, or brains? Do not be miserable, this movie is very wonderful. Like the hardcore French-renowned BERET, a group of Atticus, a group that plays the role of members of The Used and Simple Plan; I'm going to beat the abusive and proud guitar of Zopaka in a hilarious way, saving my future audiences. But the main problem of this film is at first comical, but after a while, there is a huge lack of talent in many "actors". Especially the founder of Warped Tour, Kevin Lyman. He tries very hard, but I suspect he did not want to make the movie, but he needed a contract or something. In addition, the sound quality is horrible and there is no subtitling DVD. The resolution plot of the film is very scarce and very random. magical sword and Lloyd Kaufman devil. The bottom line, this film has many good features, but it's not enough to be close to some of the horror, music and comedy movies. Although I do not have to listen to some groups I do not listen to, otherwise I have to believe. For example, Tsunami Bomb and Phenomonauts (madness, Psychobilly band). I recommend renting this movie, see the first 10 or 20 minutes, if you like it, watch it in the next 20 or 30 years, if you still like it, continue. Otherwise, go to special features and watch all music videos and live shows. They make rocks! Long live Punk Rock and Horror!
