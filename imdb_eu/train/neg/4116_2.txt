The summary of my line should be fully explained, but I will also go. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning, this movie seems like a noisy telenobal, and I can comment on it all. . There were some interesting scenes, such as "Big One" in the center of the movie, but wait, what's that? Earthquakes * shake *, wait a minute! It's Dante's Peak! Well, cut off the pieces and whistle them. I can not believe how badly this movie has been done, as well as taking on many other scenes of "lending." The director who asks himself to one thinks that the audience is a bit mute, because the middle-class MT mountain ranges, or the Dante Peak. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to you, forget Bond Wanna-be, Nash, in this movie and go real (again, someone at the Dante Summit). <br /> <br /> <br />
