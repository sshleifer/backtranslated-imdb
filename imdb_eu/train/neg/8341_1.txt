I love horror movies. Although I like cheese (I'm 9 cheeses from today's 10 horror films), but this was so ridiculous. Awesome play, awesome writing, plain characters and disbelief (no Meisner actors here!) And there is not enough body number. I could have saved SALVAGE that I lost 79 minutes of my life. Crook brothers name at least. Alicia Silverstone wanna-be face-up on the whole movie. Ever wondered how EVER got to Sundance for me. Most of the plots were totally realistic, despite the slasher movie standards. I mean, Come on! Who would take a cheap earring in 10 seconds after leaving a terrible stalker at his door? Lame
