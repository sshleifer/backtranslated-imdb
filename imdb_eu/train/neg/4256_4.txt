The upload is a step by focusing on the original movies with the story and special effects. Jason Scott Lee is looking for a vampire hunter (remembering that Dragon was in The Bruce Lee Story). Jason London is fun for Luke. A slab that steals the Dracula body away. Diane Neal Dracula's body is just as good as a robbery to heal her girlfriend, and she is just as good as Stephen Billington Dracula. Giving more performance than Gerard Butler's original film. Roy Scheider has given the rest of the pieces in this movie, and works as a tutor for Jason Scott Lee's character. This is the second trilogy and a good start. In the end, the latest movie warns of the good series.
