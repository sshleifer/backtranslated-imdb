I saw this show and I just did not find it funny. It could be the first episode. Lately I realize that ABC is currently playing stupid shows and goes to the station. All the characters in this show are very bad actors, but although they are good, jokes and scripts are awesome and the show will still bring. I would say I think that this show will be canceled, but the quality of the shows being watched by ABC as they are playing is perhaps only kept in comparison to the average.
