Despite being a television product, there is no excuse under the result of the finished product. This movie has a quote and a questionnaire, so that if you put a movie about a real life story and put the "real story" in the title, it would not make an effort. Are you trying to get some realism? First of all, this movie is sensible. These actors get into the TV's soaps or lifetime ridiculous movie channels, and it's not a real life in a gangster / Christian story. Everything about them, from their look at their manners, is just the screaming of the generation of the 90's commercial stores-alt-rock-heard generation. What is the script? He describes two words: stupid and insults, and again is a game. I do not think that the real Clyde Barrow has ever said: "I'm here." He picked up the group of "New Kids on the block" and decided to make a "kewl flick" of "Bonnie and Clyde", you know that he would be rad and rocky. Well, this sticker does not have much calamities. Anything that may be misleading in any movie is wrong here, from the quiz and performing in editing and music. Each thing is very wrong ... and it is powerful that the head of this turkey pushed all parties into the title "real story". Without a doubt, NO is a real story, but even worse, it is not a remote entertainment that is accepted in its own terms by the cynical palenvation. As I have stated in my mind, it is immensely horrible in every level that can be imagined. Trust me or watch me at your own risk.
