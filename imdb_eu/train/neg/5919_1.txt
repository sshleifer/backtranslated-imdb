Yesterday I rented this movie and it is almost impossible for Laura Ingalls to say something I want to express my disappointment for being poorly produced. I do not know if writing was horrible or bad or not, but the viewer is very disappointed that seeing that dirt was wasting time. The weak line of story was weak, very bad lines, and it was based solely on beautiful landscapes and to sell pretty people. Unfortunately, that was not enough. You are better than renting a static ribbon as much as possible. Lindsey Wagner was also pretty pathetic for the owner of the ranch and apparently did not do anything, but anyone who has been close to the ranch knows, of course, that he has written a youngster from Los Angeles and not someone who has a great knowledge of the world. .
