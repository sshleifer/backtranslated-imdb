The writing on this movie seemed to me to be terribly awful. <br /> <br /> The performance of Lacy Chabert, from 10 to 10, saved me from this movie, because I thought he played a great many characters. For me, it definitely was the star of this movie. <br /> <br /> Dina Meyer was just as nice as ever, but his role seemed pretty thin, so I do not think his performance could be excellent. > <br /> In relation to the male director, Armand Assant reminded me of his role, especially in the series of cheese from the 1980s hospitals. <br /> <br /> I lived all this. However, the endless, horrific and horrible solution, the role of the psychic and the role of psychics, have been some of the worst writings I've ever seen.
