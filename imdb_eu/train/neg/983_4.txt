When Marlene Dietrich was nominated for a box office in 1938, she was one of the only actors nominated by professional papers, such as The Garden Of Allah. In my opinion, how a movie can be so spectacular and beautiful and dull. Likewise, how Marlene tried to spread its range and I was not stuck with a sneaky old fashioned story that I was beyond. <br /> <br /> Allah Garden, one of the first films of modern technicolor. Robert Hitchens was a novel set in the early twentieth century, and later he participated in a theater adaptation with Mary Anderson, which had 241 performances in 1911-12. Then he got two silent screen arrangements. The story is about a monk fleeing from the French monastery to see something missed in the world. He was also an unmarried woman who was protected and, in her first years, she was a sick father. Now he travels in the desert and both meet in a train. <br /> <br /> Woman Marlene is known and elusive boy is Charles Boyer. I do not know what happened to David O. Selznick's story to shoot this story. Someone like Ingrid Bergman might be delighted for the audience. But you can opt for the 1936 movie advertising when they went into money, as Marlene's current Salome was hoping for with that title rather than a saint. The public still remembered Rudolph Valentino, and we hope that he was hopeless and seductive in the desert. <br /> <br /> Regarding the monks, it must be remembered that they are protected in their monasteries and especially. Boyer throws a special wine that matches the secret. The monastery must re-think his economy if he leaves Boyer. It's an honest group of relatives, but Charles Waldron has the right to be worried about concerns. <br /> <br /> However, here are many religious distributions here. through a couple of unnecessary portions. Especially Marlene Dietrich. Look at this movie and look at the plot with a unique color that has to do with the desert cinema.
