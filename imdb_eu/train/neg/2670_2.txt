There is no way to care for these characters on the ground. Some of the girls who are totally damaged in middle classes take some medications at a party and start out and argue. I have seen this on TV and I do not think it was a "movie", so that there is no resonance or drama that does not "Indulgence of this life" more. Such things are going to be time-consuming, unfortunately, middle class does not matter "lifestyle". David Baddiel has been there, and that bird "Cold Feet" away, you know what to expect. In 2000, there were many things in the area, especially the British's iniquities ... "They are educating and doing drugs, but we have dysfunctional friends and our relationship." This nonsense, and the post-Guy Ritchie comedy - gangster stuff ... dark days. If you have a taste, this will make you angry at the point of violence.
