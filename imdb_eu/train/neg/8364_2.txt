I can see boys who make money-saving budgets. "Well, let's face it now, we get 50% Dirk Benidict, that the Battle Star Galactic and A-Team were cool. We spend 40% doing Demon Costume, it does not matter that it's supposed to enter Demon's scripts, and we're doing the rest." This was pretty bad and very ordinary ... Put yourself in the look of my dear (or bring a good book).
