Where do i start I wanted to enjoy this movie, and I did it. However, I wanted to enjoy being another zombie movie that deserves my power, and that was not it. This was different like this. This was not a healthy, glee bad, seeing one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. And I did not take much care of Fulci's excuses, there was no excuse for how this movie went. This was a bad movie, but I still can not give it below ten quarters, that is, what I gave it, well ... I could laugh at least the suitability of a movie. <br /> <br /> These people had to imagine in all the places where they were in the ceiling of these buildings ... they had to be imagined that they were bored in hell, because they were browsing and browsing. stone erection, or saw jerk-offs, a short and lively meat, so that they can arrange a lot of aerial ambitions. Hell, what else is there in the dead? <br /> <br /> I needed to laugh at some zombies, to make some martial arts, swings, jumps and jumping. I divide my eyes, I never had my mind moving. I saw a terrific boy, the land on the ground of Phillipens, the fog, the fog was very dense, and the ponds seemed to boil the castle hole. When I dyed the cure for the cure for the plague as an octagon, I drew it as an octagon, there were lines in each angle, written in the center of "Dead One." I had to ask ... If the zoning is easy to cure, then I wonder how it will come up to me to start a zombie explosion! <br /> <br /> When I was aboard all the effects, it was a huge duplication, I am sure that the original story is poor, it is nonsense, non-zoned, although in a very bad way, and although women are ugly, I enjoyed it. The watch was fun. It's a very bad movie, and I would not recommend it unless I'm in the wrong direction of exploitation, but I still say ... it's a good laugh again. I'd like zombie movies, whatever, but with the name Fulci, it was much better. I dare say, the Holocaust was better.
