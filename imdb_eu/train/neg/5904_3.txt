Due to the successful "God's Navy", the Mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now. In the case of "The Other Side of Heaven", it's not a bad thing. Although this movie was not very good, it was pretty good. "The Singles Ward", however, is not. <br /> <br /> The story of a divorced young Mormon has come back to life, and is often the style of writing and shooting "The Singles Ward", similar to the "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" in the 80's. However, similarities end. While "Ferris Bueller" was fun, original and well-interpreted (never-before-nothing comedies), "The Singles Ward" is quite the opposite. It is very difficult to make fun. However, millions of times you can hear 90% of the gag or flat or jokes. Another 10% seem to be full time. And the performance is not horrible, but amaturish. <br /> <br /> Also, if you are not Mormon, or very, very knowledgeable about Mormon culture, you will not get anything. at all While the "God's Army" and "Other Side of Heaven" attracted the audience inside and outside the Mormon church, this movie is part of the joke, and that's just what you get. It's not fun.
