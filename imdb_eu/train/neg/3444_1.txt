This is the worst film ever I've ever seen. From the plot, from the shots, I have mentioned "special effects", acting, even on plot? Everything sucked ass! <br /> <br /> This is a good example of what "over-making" means and I will try to explain: <br /> <br /> I understand what the creator was trying to do with this movie; That is, one of those movies could really think, what is up to the end. You are seated mysterious, knowing who is killed and who lives and who and why and why you think the timeline is correct and that you are wrong and when the movie is finished, leaving it open in the next 5 minutes. ! It means something like "Unbreakable" or "The Job". <br /> <br /> But Olga Levens, the writer of this garbage, Olga? Writer, director, producer, screenwriter, caster, production designer, art director, costume designer, and even a double character, some scenes ... this is basically a woman and Olga Levens "Levens Productions" can not go wrong: - ) <br /> <br /> Well, this can be exciting but "this time" Olga had a long time to go, scene and scene, from dreams to reality. ... but wait! Eventually it was a dream ... or was it ??? The image blurs and I realized that it never happened, the girls alone were in the boat ... there was not really a ship ... without waiting! The ship is back, and the boys! They are alive! Thanksgiving to God! No, they are calling to join a cruise ... but then the ship will disappear, maybe they will eventually be dead? Or maybe they were never written alive? <br /> <br /> If you have not stated otherwise, you would like to have this movie - otherwise it's boring, and I've emphasized all of this. It's just how I can find the way to end the movie ... <br /> <br /> Do not see this if you value this time, in this case it's 90 minutes unnecessary ...
