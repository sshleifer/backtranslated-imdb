VILLA RIDES (1968) is a great despair! And while Sam Peckinpah has been a screenwriter, along with Robert Towne, a well-written film directed by Buzz Kulik undistinguished is being created. First, the Yul Brynner Pancho Villa is in the wrong part! Not enough charismatic to play a great Mexican revolution! The performance of his notes is lacking fire and Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland would play a role. Brynner, in particular, replaces the Russian-born Russian-looking Russian aristocratic dress in the midst of the Mexican revolution. Also, the second billed Robert Mitchum is totally damaged in the picture! As a result of the revolution, the bombardment of the home, taking part as an aircraft biplane, is a bad and written role for any small star. Mitche does not have a honest line throughout the film, and will take into account the other Mexican revolution, "Bandido" (1956), a superb image, but unfortunately no one is interested in publishing DVDs. In addition to the style of "Villa Rides", the presence of female stars is badly damaged! Grazia Buccella starla is a young Mexican girl and Mitchum looks happy, but she is a smelting. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters would probably have added a couple of misunderstood stories to the shaky line of the story. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the action are good in the movie, but they do two scenes of good action. It does not matter if it's filmed and Panavision's best quality and repetitive Maurice Tarre theme tunes matter no matter what. <br /> <br /> Like Paramount there are no extras, no trailer! Yes, depressing movie and DVD presentations could be much better and would be better.
