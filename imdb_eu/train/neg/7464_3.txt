I did not see the entire movie. I could not see the entire movie. I proposed watching the DVD for half an hour and stopped, and I suggest that someone stop thinking of it. <br /> <br /> Mafia movies are like tragic and comical, but Corky Romano Mafia must be described as a tragic essay of a comedy. <br /> <br /> The problem is that Corky Romano is trying hard to laugh at the audience, it seems that the plot is a pretext for moving Chris Kattan (Corky). from one scene to another. Corky himself surpasses himself completely, and there is no lack of sympathy or credibility. All their strange ways are invented. Chris Kattan's "acting" is clear, you took it into account before taking a role. Each scene is completely predictable, as the "event comedy" that will happen in the set will be evident when entering each scene. Mr. Within comedy such as Bean, the destructions created by the title characters are fun, the motivations of the characters and the initial events and the situation that ends with the character is not telegraphed. However, Corky gives a feeling of desperation to draw a laugh from the audience. <br /> <br /> Chris does not play such an alien star (never connected to other characters). film) and their behavior is completely incomprehensible (except to try to laugh) and comedy scenes were not so predicted and stereotypical - all the jokes seemed too familiar - to watch the movie. But it is not. Ignore
