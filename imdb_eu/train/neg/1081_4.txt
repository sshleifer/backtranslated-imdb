No original characters in the whole movie. Do we have a lawyer who is Kenneth Branagh? Well, let's see - we will learn that a sleazebag defense lawyer is off shutting off the technical criminals. Treats her coworkers as cow, helps her participate in her personal crisis (in the process, killing one of them), threatening the safety of her children, threatening the drowning of her ex-wife's girlfriend and strengthening the police. School administrators - and all that? He was thinking of his little head! Well, my dad and gangs were trying to overcome the plague of the attorney and I was sinking swamp ... it would be much more encouraging.
