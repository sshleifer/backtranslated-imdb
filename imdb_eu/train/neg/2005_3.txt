I was not surprised ... movies have never been as good as the original books. This movie was looking forward to one of my favorite books, I knew it was probably sucking. I was glad to be surprised. However, the story of the book was far removed, and the film's version did not realize that the house was huge. At the end it was also different. Lara Flynn Boyle was a bad cosmetic surgery. The plays were not very remarkable. Perhaps if a theater version had been made, because Lifetime's "TV for made box" would not have been so much, it would be a better movie. If you have seen this movie, I encourage you to follow and read the book. Certainly, I'm going to question myself and I hope you enjoy how much I do each time I read.
