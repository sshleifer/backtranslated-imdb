This is a disturbing movie I've ever seen. "Requiem for Dream" is like a Disney movie. Technically, although it is quite well done, theater, cinema, music, direction, etc. They are good However, at the end of the rape group I have never seen anything that I've ever seen and I did not see. I'm afraid they will hate my whole life. I think anyone would be worried about the movie, my wife and some of her friends were very similar to the victim and I did not remember the horrors that really lived. I saw the movie at the SXSW Festival in Austinen and it was not a group of people. I'd like to defend violence in their films, it seemed to me to be excessive, free, and useless. An earlier scene seemed to convey the mood that seemed stingy, but you do not rub your face with explicit and extreme sexual violence. This film must have a great deal of warning. That's why I would not recommend watching. You have been warned
