OK, plain and simple, if you are a fan of other Tomb Raider games (yes, even ODA), FROM THE LANGUAGE. <br /> <br /> Certainly TR is the best game. It looks pretty, it's very nice, but I can not play it and I gave it up. I feel Eidoki stole. <br /> <br /> It's very easy. TR was another computer game before anything else. You control it using the Lara keyboard. 6 Tomb Raider games were standard controls. They were "stupid" in ODA, but they were still the same general control sequence. Legend's movement and control methods have completely changed and can be fully controlled. <br /> <br /> People who say 'Use the mouse' have seen comments elsewhere. No, why should you do it? Others say 'Using Gamepad'. No, why should you do it? Others say, 'but this is a standard for third-party control over the years.' Well, I do not like it, it's not a standard for other TR games, why do you mix it with it? Oh, I know, they do not care less about their original and faithful fan base, they also want to hear from the series with new children until they get their movies up and make a lot more money. Pathetic <br /> <br /> Any advice with my serious pastime does not stop leaving this game and if Eidos purchases it. I have seen other posts, especially in Eidos's forums, because they told people that they were rude and maybe they would listen.
