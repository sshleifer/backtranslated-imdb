A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but they are all linked to something stupid. <br /> <br /> It's probably one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever. Does anyone realize that this movie is being ignored by the boy's condemnation? I agree that it is a teenager, that a man who is seducing a teenager (reasonably) would be frightened. Sorry, but a boy is not forgiven. There is still a sick person. I know Brown was a minor (at the age of 18) but he looks at it. It seems alarming to me that some people find them well. <br /> <br /> Draw this dirty thing (Kristel is beautiful - but it can not be played, Brown is one of the worst actress I have ever seen and a constant nudity is bored and there's also a remote erotic. <br /> <br /> I saw this operation in theater in 1981. I was 19 years old and I was 14 years old with my cousin (who was easily over the age of 18). He wanted to see - I did not decide what hell? We went in and bought tickets for three teenage teenagers My cousin thought he was boring and the other three children were left halfway! Let's see this: three HELP children gave a movie with a nudity, which would give an idea of ​​how bad it was. I was surprised.
