I would give ten films to this film. Before leaving for the next day, I came to the IMDb for comments. A comment is a movie that is predictable and has a great conversation. I have never heard the opinions of others, so I lost seven dollars to this movie. I WANTED TO BE A LITTLE FESTIVAL I NEVER SEEN. <br /> <br /> The person who wrote the script should throw a cave. When did the sappy scenes of the scary movies? I swear, I was surprised there were not HUG ^ - ^ moments at the GROUP. <br /> <br /> I think I jumped. Once. And I made this division, thinking about my English research paper. Closer, when the bird / cat was coming out of nowhere, when you think something would happen <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I laughed, when the alarm turned off and the main character said: "I have to get my mother's apron!" You Idiot Boot shawl! Security is a step by step, but not my mother's beard (which was not compatible with the dress) WAYYYY it is more important than my health and safety. And to accomplish all this, they will take him to his home, to know where the killer was. God. <br /> <br /> My friends and I also announced the whole movie. And not only, I say that it is hidden under the bed for a moment. "He stole the costume of the garment and left the hotel" and "was coming down the detective corridor, not a murderer!" moments The movies have never been PREVIOUS. Disney movies are not even foreseen. <br /> <br /> I will now complete my sentence, saying, it was a horrible movie. I'm glad I went to theaters, so I would not buy $ 15.00 and then I hate it. It was bad It would be a better thing if that would happen. After shooting a detective, when the murderer fell in the same position, his knife fell and his girlfriend fell down. Oh, what would be beautiful. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money. Go to a good movie!
