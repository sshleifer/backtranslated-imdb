I guess the reason why this movie is coming up is at the box office of Eddie Murphy. I think it was because of his first film "Beverly Hills Cop", so it was hot at the time. Considering more than 200 million people, R and 80 million people did, and pg said that this was not all. I have never had a great fan of Eddie Murphy, so I probably do not like any other reason. This Eddie has lost the kids search engine. He had to find a golden child or the world is in dire danger. The plot is very bad, but it's as bad as it is not compared to special effects. In the 70's, I've seen better things than some of them, Ray Harryhausen has done better things. The main reason why you see a movie such as Eddie is unfortunately not very funny at all and it just seems to be a stupid "Lost Ark" type scenes. I think they expect a fish from the water effect, but he just worked for me.
