This movie is not horrible, really. Someone commented on how wonderful Mo-Europe's Americans are. But there are Anglo-Saxon Yahoo, not necessarily taken care of by the French. and Xabier's nature will not be affected. <br /> <br /> See the attributes of his French stereotyped: <br /> <br /> 1). Cynical - very cynical. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 2). Reform, unfamiliar look, though: <br /> <br /> 3). Cooking very appreciated. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 4). Green work ethics Check (It must be forgotten that he is a wealthy adventurer who seems to be working at ten hours in the film). <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful wife, look. However: <br /> <br /> 6). Free interpretations of wedding vows. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 7). As a gay sex, an American is owed to you if you buy dinner. Check it out. <br /> <br /> Whether it is a murderer or a murderer, there is no reason to not be a part of scripture for this European burn. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, like other reviewers, I saw Karen Allen's pretty and small body. I will give you a four-star movie; Two of them are for that.
