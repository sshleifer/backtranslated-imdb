Sorry to buy this series. I expected more actions, an objective image and more consistency. This is an empty series of propaganda, very dark, without any charm or romance, it's just boredom. The actors are also very weak. O'Donnell seemed to be a breeze like Robin (with Batman), but this image has no charm. While probably older, he is losing his childhood charm, but he has not grown up in adult charm. Not surprisingly, it was not shown in many countries and 40% of the recommended price to be sold in the United Kingdom and it was not even published in the Netherlands.
