As long as I wanted to see this movie, here, in Latin American Japan or in any East Asian film, there are no theaters, we can find some of these films in underground stores, and I found something in Avalon, something I expected. It's good, but this movie is the first scene of good things; The rest of the movie is boring and absurd, it's completely stupid, it has unnecessary scenes and a boring story. I missed time writing about this movie. Sorry but it's true.
