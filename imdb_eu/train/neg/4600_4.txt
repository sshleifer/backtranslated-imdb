I've read all these reviews here, how this movie is very good. Jeez, the film was predictable and quite boring. It was in most of the time below the average, especially Mckenna. I have never felt sensitive to making a movie "bad". Oh, man, this movie was harsh. Somewhere I read this can be a classic worship. I know they are the followers of the director, but this movie is just a movie average. <br /> <br /> It was a screenplay, it was mostly a great actor, it was a movie lama. > <br /> Oh, and pray for the guy in Cheers. It looks really bad. <br /> <br /> One of the best actors in this movie was the Office Space guy, and only about 8 minutes went to this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
