Let's see ... I am trying to consider everything as positive, so how can I tell about Pallbear? <br /> <br /> I know! The performances did not work. Gwyneth Paltrow's personality has been able to savor everything, usually so intense, and they began to caricature Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey ... <br /> <br /> <br / > Oh, how's the story ... This is not a fly, that is, it caused it to be cooked. What was the genre anyway? It was not funny to take away the comedy. It was not very interesting to be dramatic. Was Schwimmer and Paltrow a romance? I must ask, as I am sure, to call "losers." I'm sure that they started with a vision behind this movie, for example, they had to go to the studio suits, but I need help. <br /> <br /> Though he was a patient person, he could pardon the story's stupidity, I could not recommend in good conscience a movie that would allow the guy to enter a professional conversation in a windbreaker and naughty, stupid and stupid hair. Are we supposed to talk about hair: we need to have fun Blacksmiths and Platinum locks in Hershey? <br /> <br /> What do I do? I've lost 97 minutes as I'm already watching the movie - I can not give more time to this loser.
