Sorry Fulci fans, but I could not get through this. The soundtracks were so annoying as they came in, the play was staggering, the story was made and it was done, and the direction did not exist. <br /> <br /> Massacre resembles a children's film project. But I've seen some of them and they really look better than that! Apparently, they could not afford so much money ... BEFORE! It's not a DoP, a director, nor a reminder of it. Cinema experience was very bad; my worst thing <br /> <br /> I saw this was the worst rumor, next to Terror Toons, that is, Killer Klowns rather than the second space. I do not need to say about it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
