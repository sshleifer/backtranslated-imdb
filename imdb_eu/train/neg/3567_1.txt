Louis's father (Dale Midkiff), Rachel (Denise Crosby), Eileen's 10-year-old family (Blaze Berdalh and the 3-year-old Gage (Miko Hughes) move to this beautiful Maine house at the bottom of the highway before the house 90 seconds or so! Wonderful Gwynne) feels like home and ... a cemetery is shown, children are burying their pets, but a little more is a sacred land that can bring lives to the dead ... but the dead go back in bad mood. <br /> <br /> < > "DOWNLOAD SPOILERS ** The Stephen King novel was good - it was a long time, but it developed the characters and situations that took care of what happened and this film develops to all the characters and simply plays gore and violence. (I know it's falsehood, but it's still repulsive), it's half-aimed and its box opens up to an open funeral (in a totally ill scene) ; He has brought back life and attacks and kills his mother (I wonder how a 3-year-old woman was able to hang her); A spiritual street (or ask) tries to help with the family without reason ... In the film, the viewer only encourages all monster death or violence on the face. That just causes you. ** NEW RETURNS ** <br /> <br /> Operation is not a help. Midkiff is just as dreadful as dad - it's beautiful and buff, but totally empty. Crosby is not much better. Both children are annoying. Only Gwynne saves this photo with his unimpeded activity. <br /> <br /> This image is a contempt for audiences to leap in the logic and make the characters look stupid (especially Midkiff). This movie was hidden in the box office in 1989 (in 1992) was a bit worse. At that time I saw it in the theater and I saw how the spectators were pushing violence, and I saw what I saw. . Horrifying movie horror A 1 full path. <br /> <br /> If everything is over and you can not think it wrong, Ramon sing a title !!!!!! ("I do not bury myself in a cemetery"). Really belief
