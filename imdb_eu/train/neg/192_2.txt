A good part about this movie is a beautiful landscape. This movie was long and boring. The minister had to retire Pulpira, from his teachings by his son Paule. How many times can his boys name the Lord's name from the back of the presbytery? Not suitable. Paul wanted me to catch Paulek through the river without paying any bucks, but Paul Brad (Brad Pitt) paid us a stupid, stupid, stupid story. Normally, Norm becomes a teacher and Paule turns the compulsive behavior that Norms want to rescue, but not. It's not very interesting. Paule sees us in the face of white prejudices because of her American girl. That was the only interest and perhaps it could be converted into the real western west. As we can only see, the two ministers' children have nothing to do with, but 1. Norma escapes from a girlfriend and her family and 2. Paule attacks stories at the newspaper store, bends her head and takes a lot. Swig and fly a lot to connect. I'd rather shoot a fishing spectacle than ever.
