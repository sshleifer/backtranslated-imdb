- To begin, I understood the Star Creatures invasion as a parody of science fiction films of the 1950s. I understand that it is not necessary to take it seriously. My problem is nowhere. A parody should be fun and that's not it. I did not smile at all the execution. In general, I am easily entertained, but I was not able to find entertainment in Izar Izaki Invasion anywhere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < They look like two "stars" on the screen with one of the most African imaginable glands: they can not control it with the water sleeve, both getting wet. Both Bowery Boys come out as wannabes. Whoever wants to play bored boys and mummy people is for me. After less than the most popular outputs, movies continue comic sequential harassment, dancing Indians, vegetables, decoders and many other unbalanced bits. Time is wasted. <br /> <br /> - I bought it with the Bead Girls of the Invasion DVD feature film. This movie won the Oscar for Invasion Star Star Creatures.
