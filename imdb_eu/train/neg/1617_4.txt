What a curious movie. <br /> <br /> It's not entirely "special Hollywood effects" or concessions for entertainment. No background music, no special effects or enhanced sound. <br /> <br /> Normally, beard expression covers thick beards and Spanish is a sudden shine monotony. talking about a camp. <br /> <br /> I am visiting these films (Parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience and not really something to go and entertained. It's quite long and it's a dull place. <br /> <br /> But I think that due to lack of land development, I do not think it's too educating. <br /> <br /> It's also hard to imagine that any movie in the movie is inseparable. It would be a good idea to read this story in order to understand the context in which it is happening, for some reason, the director did not think the opinion why the viewer was moved by the Che team. That's why it seems that the gangs around the woods are filming for no reason. <br /> <br /> I would like to give this film more stars. somehow creating empathy with me and developing a deeper nature, but somehow all my characters were unknown to me at last. The stars that come up are realism and show the guerrilla warlike difficulties.
