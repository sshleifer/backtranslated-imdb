I have seen thousands of films and never wrote a review, but compared to the glittering tribute published by the Red Idea here, I am forced to offer my two cents protest and only vote for the lowest score to bring the average reality closer. <br /> <br /> This is a delicious and boring smell of a memorable movie for just endless apologists (John Bolton-squire, a bully diplomat, you're a really big man, do not you know). ) and Dr. Phil's oh-so-beautiful and popular (his most successful book, anyone who learns, reads frequently around the world). My eyes were red, my eyes were awakened. <br /> <br /> After selling $ 10 a year before for this B movie, read the above 'Quotes (trailer)' above and ask yourself if you would enjoy a movie of the most honest lines you would really find. Unfortunately, there's nothing better in this movie. The basic premise is hell; Acting is active, a chemical pro / antagonist that is completely missing; Suspension potential is prevented alternately, except for the last five minutes, except direct direction and pre-edition; The script is similar to the lacrosse star of the universe, the early discoveries of the heroes are challenged when they fight with the antagonist later with a hockey stick. and plots are wider than the first class (the development of the characters is strictly for the Coach). <br /> <br /> And then there are ridiculous extreme moments that the daughters of a high level civil servant do not start straight. for airport security, in his first choice, to alert Homeland Security and his murderous father to a plot. Or if the same woman wears a leather skinny linoleum on the airport, the arms on her neck cover her arms and veins, wearing 4-centimeter pens. Or when his followers also suck up the trachea's wound. Or if the terrorist uses a fishing rod under the terrible port to carry his weapon. I always want to interrupt credibility, but I will not jump 30.00 feet without a parachute. <br /> <br /> I can say about that movie that a good thing is that women represent them. They are capable (albeit in bimbo mode) handling the most serious emergencies - the type of gender image that is missing in American films. In addition, the movie never came out, and it was not as exciting as the red-eyed red NY Boston. Remember the deceptive lagoons and shining tributes for the last time you whispered in this forum or elsewhere? It's one of those times. Wait for the Red Eye video and do not watch it anymore.
