Yes, the nature of Madsen - speaking to the television woman - is correct: the LAPD police are corrupt, violent and racist. And this movie does not change anything. OK, here are good police, moral police, even a black man, how, a Christian, a martyr. But this is a fairy tale, accept it. Reality is not the case. And the most important action for lovers: shooting is boring. He is shooting, shooting and shooting. Nothing else Play Counter Strike, then you have to do something. The moral of this film is unique: now the LAPD is good. Not a bad policeman. If you want to see non-critical and euphemic ads for police and military, watch the movie. The biggest commercial I have ever seen. (Camera and 2 editing points).
