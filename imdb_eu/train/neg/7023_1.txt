Okay, my girlfriend and I rented the DVD and about 30 minutes a movie, "ehhh, what's this movie and what's more important, we know what it's ending" and I've decided "we needed drugs to" plot "interest or just to see something else that's over when it's over. <br /> <br /> "But I'm Cheerleader" I liked a lot, but Mango Kiss is very absurd and surreal to my liking, sorry! I have "DEBS", "Better Than Chocolate", "Fucking Åmål", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire". <br /> <br /> -Sorcia
