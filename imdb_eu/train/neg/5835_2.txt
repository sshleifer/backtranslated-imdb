It's not a thriller - It's a dirty thing, I'm sure it's the worst movie I've ever seen this month and I've seen lots of bad movies in June. The problem lies both in management and scripting, and with William Richert's responsibility, they should be guilty of this noisy noodle. <br /> <br /> There are two things wrong with this movie.
