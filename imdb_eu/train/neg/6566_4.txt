I watched this movie after having problems downloading it through rapidshare. I have to say it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Parinda was so noisy, I was really looking forward to looking. <br /> <br /> Parinda is one of those films. Although other standard Indian filmmakers do not meet the standards set, despite the excellent story. It was more pathetic to know that the story was not the original, it was based on the classical "On the waterfront". <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor was angry, especially when he comes from America. The management often lacked quality, except for a few scenes. <br /> <br /> Give me any of these script: Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm 100 years old. They will surely make a movie that they will make. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying Parinda bad. It was not enough.
