This is the worst film I've ever seen at home! Check out 1 and 2 parts, but do not let anyone know that it's better than the first two! I mean, really, you do not make a movie, then make a sequel with the same characters and actors and then make another sequel to other characters and actors! I mean, it would be fine if that was not a "Home Alone" movie, but it turned into a home movie. Culkin is old now, so you're supposed to stop racing! God, this movie makes me! Buy Parts 1 and 2.
