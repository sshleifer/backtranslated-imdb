Well, what can I say, there are B-Grade Cynthia and B-Grade Videos and this is definitely on the second level. However, it is clear that the film makers are also unaware of a credible movie (credits that close a shutdown). <br /> <br /> The plot is essential when the deceased psychosis dies. . Unexpectedly, it has mixed its genetic material with some acid experiments that have been joined and then lost in the snow. The killer now takes the shape of the snowman - if you think. Jack Frost, the snowman, was behind the town of Sherif. By doing so, Jack Frost kills half the town. <br /> <br /> This movie has no real fear and reminds me of the B-grades of the 50s. That's just what it deserves to laugh. Time to spend outside the movie.
