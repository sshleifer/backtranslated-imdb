This version has been a bit slow to my liking and, at the beginning, I have problems with that play. The first film is a typical version of the television movie, that is, it does not have the flutter of the original version of William Holden's film. Why could not they hire more than twelve people to hire? Why move the movie until 1966? So, would your little sister give you a line about Vietnam's war protests? Why was not 1963 and a line of rights-based movement? <br /> <br /> As for the cast, some missions are wrong. Jay O. Sanders has focused on the particulars of his character with Josh Brolin. On the other hand, Brolin has lost a lot of notes. It's incredible as a BMOC jock, but it does not have the sensuality of William Holden. I always thought that Brolin is similar to the gorilla and all the women of the town play it (pardon punishment). Gretchen Moll was pretty, but it seemed a bit too wise. He projected innocence or ignorance as a necessary character. Maybe it was Brolin and older than 5 years. But again ten years ago, Holden was too old. Bonnie Bedelia was unforgettable, since her mother and Mary Steenburg could not believe that Blanche duBois or Katharine was playing "Shrew of The Shrew". <br /> <br /> Mr. In the case of Inge. To play, I always felt that similar stories were chosen by practice as passion, the story of a young woman always had an epilogue. "The Twilight Zone" I think that a epilogue with the "Hyper Spur of the Moment" episode, behind a young Diana Hyland, was pursuing an older Diana Hyland. Because Diana younger Hyland chose to escape just like that. Hal Carter.
