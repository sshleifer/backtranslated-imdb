In sum, filmmaker's performance was weak, with compulsory performance, and a little rhythm and pause, a second, decent action, which created some volumes and intrigues. cast, and actress 3 ... there are hardly 3 shares! <br /> <br /> With regard to the 3rd year, the movie is abruptly ending. There is no resolution and it does not have the path down to the 2nd video clip, so it is not a third event. The bad boy is dead and that's it; final credits It shows anything that happens to the protagonists and the contributors. The audience is likely after leaving the theater after the movie, "is that it?" A real condemnation. <br /> <br /> David Belle has long been a musician to serve the movie, but there is definitely nothing outstanding. It's just functional, but that's only generic and derivative. It is evident that VERY score is synthesized by some of the percussionists. At least I was surprised by the shock, James Horner was taking away some musical tensions that were extracted by "48 HRS". and "Commando", especially brass. <br /> <br /> In the end, because the movie was a good story of potential, but the execution was minimal, with poor performances and a bit consistent. <br /> <br /> There is almost no 3 practice to complete the story correctly, and it is an important and unfathomable void because it does not end the movie. This could be a script or, perhaps, production was editing or editing the 3rd edition due to budget constraints in the finished movie (but I do not know why). Regardless of the reason, the end is violent as the movies are in general pain. <br /> <br /> This is a good thing if you are curious and you can get a very cheap movie and learn a reason for 3 actions (start, middle, end). If you write scripts and do some movies. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you might not want to waste your time. You can get the MST3K version at least laughing.
