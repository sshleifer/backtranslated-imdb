The COBWEB presented in 1955, LILLIAN GISH is a silent screen veteran, and Actors Studio is the SUSAN STRASBERG progenitor. Established in an exclusive psychiatric hospital, what is your own movie about yourself? ... great drama? Doctors and Patient Relations? Shock Therapy Treatment? No, knowing how to do this is to select coatings for a psychiatric hospital in detail. Do you think I'm kidding? You do not believe in your eyes because you are watching this unbelievable story that has become a movie. Dr McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants to reduce the progressive head in all the hospital patients in the design, execution and execution of the necessary draining new ones. McIver's wife is made of marble GLORIA GRAHAM wants to get around 2 cents in this monumental task. So, for a long time, the staff makes Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Under the direction of VINCENT MINELLI, you ask, really, it was very upset, because it was exactly because of a wedding sock, JUDY GARLAND. LAUREN BACALL, talented actors such as SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR lose sight of this hocey story. What did they think?
