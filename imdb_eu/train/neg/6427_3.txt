So this completely documentary seemed strange and very useless. I know they are prizes and things, but I personally do not like them much. There was no humor or drama to keep you interested, a bunch of wierdos and their work. Some people do not have a bad thing, but I do not leave any impression. I was bored with this movie, there was no problem with the creative writer teacher. The whole circus movie was a nice theme but I did not get it, and I did not learn about robotics and lions. The green animals were clean, the garden I liked a lot of colorful gardens, but how were these four works connected? I was not sure why he would do a movie about that movie. But if you enter such things, you can enjoy it. who am I to take your way? I only know the possible suffering.
