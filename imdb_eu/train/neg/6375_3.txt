Jennifer's Shadow is set in Argentina and Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips) arrives after her sister Johanna dies. Jennifer Johanna will leave the house in her will to sell Jennifer house and return to Los Angeles, despite the fact that her grandmother was Mary Ellen (Faye Dunaway). While rare things happen, Jennifer begins to dreams with Ravens and he begins to feel very bad. After a hospitalization, it seems that one of his kidneys has disappeared mysteriously, what about Jennifer? Is the curse of old families? Jennifer will be next ... <br /> <br /> Daniel de la Vega and Pablo Parés wrote and directed the American co-production co-production. A strange little minute, I would imagine a modern and boring story of ghosts before people sleep more. Vega, Parés and P.J. Pettiette's script is pretty slow and anyone who wants it is not boring, I mean, surely, people do not sit and get bored. The character is not uncommon and quite a beer, to make a little or little motivation. For example, who is the cemetery? How did you know about demons? What is the interest and motivation? I can not see Jennifer herself is a very public and innocent lady that is the main one, as her grandmother Mary Allen is coming to be klixed and it is amazing, so obviously she is evil. I create a horrible horror story, which is surprisingly predictable. There are two gaps in the logic and the story, a story that does not end the whole tour, I did not like Jennifer's Shadow one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I think that they wanted to get the gothic feeling of that era, but it has been done so many times before and it's so much better that it did not make me too much and the whole movie was sad and boring. It also seems to be a period of 40, the costume of the interior of the big house, but it looks cheaper. Jennifer's Shadow is well-done, but it's not overlooked, it's not terrifying or overwhelming and predictable. If that was not enough, there are no runners, some scenes of rolls look at people, and stir up their hearts. <br /> <br /> With Raven's supposedly budgeted $ 1,000,000 for US and international DVD versions, this is pretty well done, but a million is not buying too much these days, and Jennifer's Shadow theory pretty much proves this. In addition, the actors are in excess of the scene that speaks in the great accents of Argentina, although realists may be able to understand what people are saying. Dunaway is well off to overcome it, and it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Jennifer's Shadow is a fantastic movie, when I thought it was a boring end to the beginning. Those who have been left to live and are confused with Zombies! (1964) again. Loss of time
