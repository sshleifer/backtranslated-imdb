I got this movie because I worked in a movie store, I got free wages. He came in, and the cover looked fine. Hot chick, to carry a weapon, I'll be fine. I looked at it. <br /> <br /> Oh, man, a bad move. That was so horrible, I spent half the movie in the nudity I could see on the fast forward, it was minimal. I think MAYBE three naked scenes. <br /> <br /> Cheesy conversation, crappy violence, bad character excuses. I'm sorry to put down this movie because I know it's a cheap budget, but it's also "Clerks," and became a cult classic and franchise. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
