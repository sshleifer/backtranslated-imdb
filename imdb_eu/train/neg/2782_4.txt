Last weekend I watched the movie, I'm disappointed and disappointed with it. In essence, the film tells the immigrants, especially the Soviet Union, to come to this country, that they bring in all the oldest countries and that they invade and take on what the Americans have done. Immigration is a very wrong way to look, and that's a worse way of saying it. That is the main thing. Writing, directing and filming other things are the enthusiasts of the country. The actors did it pretty well, but they did not save the left-handed trash. Some jokes were fun, but most were bad and cursive. It was not possible to wait for the theater, I want to get the money back.
