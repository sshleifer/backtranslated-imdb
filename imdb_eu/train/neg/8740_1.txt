My friend and I rented this movie last night and we made a laugh. The movie should not be fun, but it's so ridiculous and lacking in realism. First of all, Phillippe (I forgot his personality and does not really care) uses his regular employee ID to pass all high-security terminals. It's not just pathetic, but thanks to its strenuous effort, it is able to find such a terrifying room with super computers. This is very funny. The huge mood you're experiencing is totally ruining your baby. At the end, like all others, it's very cheesy, especially as the dog's lawyer shows "the right time". However, the movie is a good laugh. If you need something to silence, definitely see.
