I like Jane Austin's novels. I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility books and movies, and I'm half way through Mansfield Park. But I could not play Emma. I made the book in 2 chapters, and at the end of the film I could not care less about Emma. It does not seem to have changed. Maybe Paltrows (Se7en's excellent) or movie was missing my interest. Dunno <br /> <br /> The clothes are nice, but the dances were evil, compared to Coline Firth and Jennifer Ehle's Pride and Prejudice dance. <br /> <br /> I basically gave Knightly a beautiful bloody and, despite the bad performance of Ewan McGregor, I liked his song.
