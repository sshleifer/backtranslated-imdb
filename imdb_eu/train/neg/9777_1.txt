I was drawn to this movie, knowing how to adapt Hubert Shelby's brutal novel. I thought that a character with a literary depth, rich carpet of characters, awesome situations and social criticism could not be a bad movie. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Flick film is a terrific experience, not about its content, but its shape. The director Ulrich Edel, my honest opinion, runs a great work of director, without the original book. It's no wonder Edel TV director; This movie looks like "TV-made". Some of my opinions about this bomb (** before spoilers **): <br /> <br /> - Creative direction. The scenes are slow, they feel slow, they look bad, and they are almost never put in an anchored position, the only freedom they take in the cinematography area, with a dark and pleasant tone. In addition, the film has the same technical creativity as the opera for television. <br /> <br /> - All the actors make a great job of portraying these wonderful characters. The problem is that adapting is not a basic element in the development of the plot: MOTIVATION. All characters move like robots, without their action being clearly motivated. They seem like blue things, like robots, without reason. Edel loses the bravery of all the possibilities by analyzing the motivation to develop character and avoiding the development of the identity of each stranger. <br /> <br /> This character does not develop around Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight plays an excellent role as an evil prostitute, but does not explain the decision to violate the alcohol that leaves her seafarers. He looks very stupid, as he sees this character in blue. It's a clear example of misleading the character. <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot of secondary characters and does not make any characters that do not do anything, and they do not listen to anything, and do not add them to the plot. I'd like to know more about Harry's wife, for example, and interaction between them. Another option is a lost one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Jugglers are not even developed when they are missing. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack is the worst ever. Mark Knopfler's great work. I was looking more seriously at Dire Straits chief, but the movie's work is seriously missing. Sometimes, as a fight between trade unions and police, music seems to be completely disconnected. It also feels poverty and anachronism; I swore the whole soundtrack with a Casio toy keyboard. Reverses real action. <br /> <br /> - Desmond Nakano's adaptation of the book is so literal that it deletes the story point. They remember that they try to keep their actions in the action book line, the characters actually develop forgotten and will explain their actions and motivations again. <br /> <br /> I am very careful. You can not recommend this movie, or even Shelby fans, because it can ruin your original book. The novel is a simple adaptation effort and shows little creative input.
