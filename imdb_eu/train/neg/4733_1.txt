I can not believe really sitting all the same. This movie is Killjoy's worst performance. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot: the movie begins with a dog sitting next to Jojo and the beach, but a hairy hair on a hairdresser's hair. "Hunk" does not look like a day's gym. Somehow, everyone knows that, and every single shooter in the movies wants it. UH OH! Here comes the contest! The stereotyped "Hot Chick" and her best friends drive a stunning rose car. Soon, Jojo's mother got her whole life in Australia. That's why Jojo should move and leave his best friend behind (or I'll cry, I think). There will be a giant storm that fills this pool with water wells. Somehow, without any apparent reason, the jar falls into the pool and faces face to face, yes, you guessed it, MERMAID! Here is the "story" that really comes out. Basically, they want to fall in love with the "hunk" mermaid. <br /> <br /> This is a public championship, when it is so bad, it seems like the peak of the 80's Oscars. This movie allows all the clich√©s ... the best friends, everyone who likes the "bad", "bad" bad girl and her enthusiastic companion, a horrible age ... what you name is there. I had a lot of people watching this observation. Consider my hour and 40 minutes for a sacrifice for you. Please do not watch this movie. Do not do it, I suffered in vain.
