My first occurrence with Templar and not good. Anchor Bay Video, with other classic worship like "Spider Baby" I was excited about this title. Print quality is excellent, but this can not be hidden unless the film is dull. An exciting sequence for beginners. In it, the people are revenge on the temples (and they put everything into effect), but everything else in the film is slow, cumbersome and, in the end, not fulfilled. Adding an insult to the injury: the movie has doubled, not a subtitle, as the video jacket promised.
