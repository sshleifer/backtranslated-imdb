This is an incredible and non-sensible piece of Hollywood dreck. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, dressed as a Snake Pliskin, believes that the 2nd base was better. Ray Liotta, as a psychotic policeman, is completely predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is his usual cardboard and does not have to be a victim of persuasion. <br /> <br /> Every one of the completely anticipated scenes is absolutely foreseeable at the end, when Kurt attacks Ray's vase or something. down and away. Kurtek and Madelin embraced the film with their compulsory, and EVERYBODY --- except Russell and Stowe, CONTACTS Liotta will return and the couple will threaten again. <br /> <br /> It does not, of course, and Russell punched 10 times 9 centimeters, which is INTIRELY unnecessary. This movie was well finished with bludgeoning scenes - with exceptions about unnecessary violations of Hollywood, and the more you add or "improve", the more slobbery they get.
