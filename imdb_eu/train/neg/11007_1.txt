Lately movie over the night have been trying on cable television ads. Do not believe hype. I was one of the happiest people to watch at theaters. This is, in my opinion, behind the worst movie of all time, behind Mac & Me (worst # 1), and behind Jack Frost (2nd worst), but I must admit that they are very close and ALL! Actually, this movie is funny or disturbing, or whatever it says, do not waste your money. It's good to give your worst enemy. I do not talk about that. You'd like to kill or torture someone would be a great candidate for this movie. That's horrible. If you do not believe it, you deserve it through the misery that is being watched, that is, I doubt that I can finish it. Both fats go down.
