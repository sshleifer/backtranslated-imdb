I really wanted much more than I liked this movie. This is what I love to do with foreign evil comedies, especially those that impress you. However, although this often caught me, they were almost never pleasantly surprised. South Park reminded me that all the social norms almost violated the fact that they were going to study only to be fun to be ill. For example, after analyzing adultery, drug abuse (almost all types of drugs (pot, heroin, speed sniffing), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, etc., was a movie (?) Ridiculous pedophilia. One (it seemed to be about 12 years old) to sleep with men in the vicinity, because in a moment in the movie, this dentist gives this wizard payment for dental work! Funny! You should be scared, this movie is too far away and "black comedy" is included. should they have fun for the next cancer or rectal tumors?
