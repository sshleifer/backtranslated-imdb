Amy Heckerling's second movie, Johnny Dangerously, is a parody of the gangster movie in the 1930s in the Warner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton plays as a giant age, when he strikes a hard-fought back when he caught a boy who was trying to steal something in his 1935 pet store. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has health problems, so Keaton falls into crime. Peter Boyle through early age. Meanwhile, Richard Dimitri is the owner of crime against Boyle and eventually the highest Keaton rises. Joe Piscopo has a fun turn like Danny Vermin, yes, Vermin! Griffin Dunne Keaton's younger brother is Glynnis O'Connor's wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton's moll. The film seems to be very cheap, instead of a theater movie, it resembles a television show. <br /> <br /> It starts with a great movie and then it is slowed down after half an hour. Due to the combination of the interview and the gag, the film is in the first part, but soon it loses its steam and the second half enters into mediocrity and vulgarity. Keaton makes James Cagney a landscape of his best impression. Stapleton has several straight lines, foolish and not fun. Piscopo "every time" takes too much time. Several assistant actors Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston, Alan Hale, Jr. As a sergeant, they try to keep Sudie Bond as a woman without cleaning. In the second half, the TV show is successful or lost and will never be recovered. The scene closes with The Roaring Twenties is anachronism, as well as the first movie that saw The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable in a tent. I think Heckerling was better acquainted, knowing the recipients of The Roaring Twenties' 1939 version. * 1/2 star.
