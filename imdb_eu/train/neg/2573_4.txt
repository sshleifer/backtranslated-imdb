If you lose a lot of time ... it's okay. It is moving in a good pace, but this movie should have a little more to get out with a little face on the child. <br /> <br /> The play is okay. Mariana Klaveno is the best job and is more believable. <br /> <br /> William R. Moses played like a husband quite well. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady, the wife was a weak part and the reasons for returning to work were not developed. <br /> <br /> It's an endless fool. Like most of those movies with a dream ... there are interesting parts ... but, in general, you wonder why the time went by.
