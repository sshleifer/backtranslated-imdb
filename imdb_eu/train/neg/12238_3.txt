It was a true concept, and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together, but ... <br /> <br /> Rudolph's bright nose did not require "explanation" in this film. Star Wars did not need "blood medichlorians" explanations. Mostly, the movie left Winterbolt cold because of the complex plot of Santa's destruction. It has the ability to make suggestions on people's opinions, so why do things go in the right way? Rudolph's nose breaks the magic, Rudolph's cheeks, threatening the Frosty family melting ... Pinky and Brain's abuses and Dr. Doofenshmirtz's "Phineas and Ferb" (that's, they do it in a precise way and laugh) It seems straight and easy In comparison to Winterbolt, we expect something to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> A special moment (and funny) it is curious that a character casts its two guns as bad boys, like boomerangs. If I do not understand the desire to shoot guns in a family movie, why should guns be first?
