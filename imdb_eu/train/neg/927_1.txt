I really want to say, how can I make a totally dying ball like the DEMONICUS head of the band Charles Band Full Moon? I mean at first it would not get green light. The story is repetitive, the characters are weak, Tyranus's other real story is not there, but it's a bad thing. Then the writer or director goes to the end. Clear is the end, Demonicus rises. Cave may be the last survivor of a mortal, and, then, the image of a hanging out alive, I'm cheap and I expel plus. Then, it's the FUNHOUSE on foot at home. A century ago, the statue is destroyed, its no reason, for no reason. I mean, that does not make sense. Charles puke pile of what he thought of this, they swore in four different movies in the film company. They could say, DEMONICUS ideas were better. THANKS TO TURKEY.
