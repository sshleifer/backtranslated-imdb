When I was younger, I thought the first movie was very good at childhood, so I decided to watch it. This is why some films do not have to be tracked, for example, it's usually the best movie, and that's it. Now, when Ariel and Eric are married, she has a daughter who does not leave her home, because she is worried about Ursula's sister (cinematic octopus octopus). When the boy comes out, he asks Ursula's sister to become a mermaid, just like her mother. This will return to Ariel for her. The good voice artist is just a story that can have a bit of thought. Fit!
