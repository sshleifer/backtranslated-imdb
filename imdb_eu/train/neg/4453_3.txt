I am sure that people who see this movement will be a fun watch for this movie, but in the case of someone in the UK it is painful. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, Elijah Wood gets out of the bank station when trashed out of a tube. She says to her sister, "What happened here" and "Oh, they were in the town of Tottenham yesterday". Tottenham is already in the village .. They are part of town, they do not have to go! And the last place where Tottenham fans will fight against other fans is a banking station, as there is more security cameras in the world. <br /> <br /> There are other similar mistakes, but for me it has failed to act as a green hooligan. He clearly stated that it was not worth mentioning with the East End accent and decided to make a mock-ney style of Dick Van Dyke. In fact, all the other gangs talked about West Ham fans as you expected. This error was incredible because it ruined paper and film.
