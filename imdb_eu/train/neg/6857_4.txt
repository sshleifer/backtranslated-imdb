This comedy screw is very hard pressed. In fact, the actors are basically playing hardcore books. And, as a result, it is not free in any way. The idea of ​​a woman who was given a quick divorce from a woman was not so funny. And then, when Cooper goes out with his baby, he does not want to be considered as a bearer, it seems to be a great look, and he's really becoming a comedian. It's a shame, too, that the actors were more than capable of scripts and I was bored that mess. Thanks to Cooper's so much good comedy, you should see them instead.
