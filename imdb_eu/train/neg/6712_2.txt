I think we have to give you some stories about the bravery of the history lesson for musical writing, but about some decent music? <br /> <br /> Howard DeSilva's cartoons want to clarify the interests of young children? <br /> <br /> William Daniels (the time) is today's style to reach the 1960s and 70s demographics? <br /> <br /> Do we need to "joke" about NY and NJ? (I have heard Broadway's blue hair from the audience). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I think the whole piece is dated, boring and acting on the screen.
