"Power Play" begins with an interesting interest but the hill goes down rapidly. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and has a very small part. Beyond Bell, "Power Play" does not exchange value or interest. "Power Play" has more earthquakes than in California. The scene of the earthquake in the center is so credible and incredible. All action scenes resemble third-level students who put on a theater. It's wonderful, it's just awesome. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, if "Power Play" was in the 60s or 70s, the classic "B" movie would be a bad thing. "Power Play" was really dull in 2001. Is there a movie "D" movie? If so, the "Power Play" mold conforms.
