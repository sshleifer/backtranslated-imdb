First of all, let's say I'm a fan of Ashley Judd; That's why I was curious to see her, her first role. He does not argue that his talent is apparent and his excellent behavior. I think professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. However, I think movies are fun for us and where this movie fails. <br /> <br /> I thought in the middle: "How much longer do we have to get bored, the store, standing around a mere souvenir store, replacing merchandise?" It seemed to continue! <br /> <br /> Then, I thought, maybe the director is one of those films that he wants to immerse himself in a calm situation, before he thinks he can knock him out with a dynamic event. There is no luck. The movie continues with a strange, boring story and shaking to the bottom. <br /> <br /> I do not say this because I agree. I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic comedies. But I hope I am entertained. <br /> <br /> Add cinematography and sound quality to match your neighbors' home movies. Pressing <br /> <br /> I just do not like this film about anyone. Leisure value 114 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
