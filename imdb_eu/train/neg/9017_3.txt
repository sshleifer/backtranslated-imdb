I received this movie on Sci-Fi before I started work. If you are interested in dive into Dean Cain and you are interested in avoiding the inclusion of at least a dozen times in the flames, the movie is for you. If your interest does not prevail, well, I'm afraid that you're up for us, this movie is pretty bad. To begin, the play is horrible, horrible, horrible. The characters are completely evil and the conversation is worse than the science-fiction film of your Z-grade. Finally, he reminded me of the movie 'Man Hollow', a dragon, not a naked and invisible man. Unlike other similar films, however, this was not a bad thing ... it was bad.
