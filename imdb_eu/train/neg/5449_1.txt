The idea is that something interesting happens in the first ten minutes to keep the audience in the crowd. Late Shopping at Night does not prevent much more than this interest. When we arrive at a point, it is so monumental that I think I ought to misunderstand it. But I did not. <br /> <br /> Sean tells the story they rented to two people who changed the same apartment to the owner Osaka, so they did not know how to share it. He asks his friend "but what about the weekends?" Sean has no proper explanation. Then he tells the story of Sean's similar problem. That's right, his girlfriend still lives in the house and does not ever see each other's work all night long. It's been three weeks. But her friend does not ask: "Yes, but as I said before, what happened on the weekends? You must see it. It does not make sense. What happens to you, Sean? Do you have medication or something?" But let's be generous and Feel that you work for two days a week. <br /> <br /> We verify Sean to see how soap and towels are used. (In fact, it's strange to start with soap with it.) But what about her girlfriend's conditioner and shampoo, sanpro and moisturizer, toothpaste and toothbrush. Let's go to the kitchen Food and drink? Is it missing? Is it bought? In the bedroom, is it shared in the shared bed or not? Do they wear clean clothes? Is the cart clean? In the bathroom, is the seat up or down? I mean, fluoride! <br /> <br /> And to do all this, Paule has decided to leave work early to see his girlfriend still living. Why does not he talk about his phone? <br /> <br /> But it's worse. In the last act, even if no one told him that Vincent's other team would go there, he finds them. Lenny's interest in love and Sean's girlfriend are good friends and they also find the team. There is little attempt to explain how difficult these circumstances are. <br /> <br /> The conversation is correct, but it is not nearly enough for a good character to be terribly mild. <br /> <br /> I heard one of the interviewed actors and ordered "no guns, no drugs, no criminals". I thought "great". But after an hour and half an hour I was screaming at the screen: "I want guns! I want drugs! I want the drivers!" <br /> <br /> It should not be enough to sort them out, but the director of the official website has not released any screenplay. That's all you need to know.
