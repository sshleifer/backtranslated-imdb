The writer found a decent idea to make a story, but there were several flaws in the plot running away from the movie. However, basic elements such as character development have been overcome. The inconsistency was too ugly. A massive mansion in the middle of the Irish countryside? In the gardens are just the characters "showing" in a stormy night (I would add it to a very comfortable time)? Eventually it was not "bad". I scored 4, especially the story and talents of Alison Elliotten.
