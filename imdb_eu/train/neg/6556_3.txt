I bought this on the DVD, my brother, Michelle Pfeiffer, a great fan. I decided to see it a week earlier. <br /> <br /> Practicing is quite entertaining with two completely separate stories. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was much more interesting. She plays a great Hollywood actress, but she does not have filling relationships. He goes to Brian Kerwin literally (with a commonly married boy) driving the back of the car. After starting a different one, he starts driving home because he is no longer comfortable driving. Love finally leads the tragedy when her wife knows. Eventually what happened was not ready, but a slow stretch and the usual television direction from any plot comes from the plot. <br /> <br /> Another episode of Darren McGavin brings with it a former Senior Studio. This section is better with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer and Stella Stevens. Everyone wants the studio chief, but when they are asked to cancel it, they realize that their careers are nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> It's time, but it's not interesting, and I'm glad this was not bought for me. I'm not a fan of Michelle Pffeifer, but she is the only actress worthy of this movie, and in 1983 she was also a decent actor. In general, if you are a fan of her, avoid this because it is very common.
