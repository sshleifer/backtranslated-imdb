I liked this movie for many reasons. In the first ten minutes of the movie, I was very disappointed and concluded that if the movie was saved, at least I had to get out of it with a hollow drill. . Unfortunately, that did not happen. Two Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman were on the two draws for the film. I do not know if he was interested in film about Lindsey Lohan's work. Then I felt for them and I made three performances for them, although they were "moments" in each of their performances. I think that each one of them finding his "moments" was very difficult due to the characterization of characters and their lack of dialogue. Although the land is interesting, in general, the film was so handwritten, corrected and edited that its performance as an actress and that it would be damaged. I think that the inadequate ways of misrepresentation and misunderstanding of America in small towns and small villages are the main reasons for these two films by tapping their brand. As stated by a reviewer, I would like to agree, the film is virtually impossible because of the completion of the market completion. I suspect, or at least hope (even for the actor's senses) there are some real gems on the cutting floor of the room. It's sad to us, but if it's true, then the actors take their peace of mind and feel their talent and timing down like that. Yes, and one more thing ... I wanted to see the American movie I wanted, including unfortunate but beautifully included movies, such as this movie where the main characters were not absentmindedly and / or disrespectfully scattered litter in the country with latas, broken CDs and other trash!
