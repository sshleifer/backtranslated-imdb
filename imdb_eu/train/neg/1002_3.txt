I do not want to go too far, I can not justify it when I lose a lot of time to review this movie, but I have had to give a different opinion to help people avoid their movie. Animation is cruel and the story is boring / useless among the most angry. Full humor is lost to the audience, and either: Ghost in the Shell fans, this is not a science-fiction action or something like this: it's a comedy slapstick essay and it just returned humor after returning. I was watching this movie and watching the terrifying ways in the film festival, especially with a passionate feeling and how much I was open. I did not expect the ghost Shell in the sequel, but I was expecting something that was entertaining, and that was only achieved. Yaaawwnnn ... Rent instead of Kino Journey.
