I gave him this movie 2 and, although I'm considered a science fiction fan, I find it very difficult to take this movie seriously. It was the night of AMC, and I'm glad I saw it free. This movie may be for a few laughs, but not much more. <br /> <br /> The special effects are of the average in terms of time: it is not horrible, but not great. We know more than Mars in that period, of course, but we can not really resist this film. The main reason why I liked this movie is the story. <br /> <br /> I would look at some more sections of this movie, the astronauts' injury or situation, the city of Marte, the lake, creatures, etc. In general, the movie is like a long version of the 1960s The Outer Limits. It is very endless with a cheesy man.
