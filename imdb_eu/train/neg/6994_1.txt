I saw this movie and when I saw the great hope. But I was wrong. This movie was like any other horror film. A virus, zombies, etc. Resident Evil and many other films. However, the difference between that and the other movies is that the story is very heavy. Bad actors and boring music. The picture is OK, but the rest is empty. Do not watch the movie "horror", watch 2 rings or any other story. I hope you have a virus and spread viruses and stop people from horroring zombie movies. We have seen enough for this. When the movie is playing a good thing on a roof when celebrities and polluted celebrities shoot.
