It's amazing for me that many reviewers think it's a masterpiece. As far as quality is concerned, I've released the film, I'm not sad, and I agree with the technical shooting, as well as for some of the portraits, which is worth a movie prize. But no sense (for me) this movie will go anywhere; I mean to bring the viewer anywhere. Mood is a set of scenes, perhaps, such as remarkable, but I want a movie more. I look for the story and the movement and to reach it, I have not found any of them. Yes, the movie would be poetry. . . But I can not experience many poetry for the same reason: it paints images without going any further. <br /> <br /> Another thing to be said is what we document in the mid-nineties of Central English childhood. necessarily limited in its universality. It was a time and place that really liked me about what a British young man should live for. Having grown a decade in America, in truth, the contrast is horrible. I can not question the contrast that has affected those films so beneficial. In other words, can the film tend to fully judge its "magic film" (that is why I admit it) and totally reject the importance of its totally recalled experience?
