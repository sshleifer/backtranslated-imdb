I remember when I left outside, when we were outside the star. It was always someone who could have a good story telling us about the forests that surround us and they always threatened me. Well, when I found Wendigo in the library, when I expected to be one of those films supernatural in the woods, they were like stories that were told in the camp. Well, with myself, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. The story begins when the family of the three family drives the winter cabin, it seems like your usual suburban house and a booth in the woods, and deer joins. Well, it seems that the hostages were hunted with specific deer and the people of our city were very angry. The film spends too much time following families' everyday activities, rather than reaching the movie's point. Until last 15 minutes we did not involve "wendigo" action. My suggestion is that this film is far from being. You will leave your desired hour and a half.
