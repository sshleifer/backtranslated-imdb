The man has gone to the limits of the earth and is now traveling to newer worlds. But new worlds come with ancient diseases ... the space vampires. And not only a few but full handles. In this movie (I saw "Bloodsuckers", but I think it also goes through "Vampires Wars"), we see what happens to imperialist earthlings distributed to imperialist vampires. <br /> <br /> This opinion will be very brief. for good reviews. For the best of this movie I can say good list of b-list and next stars. Natassia Malthe was Quintana, and she was very attractive here in "Bloodrayne 2". Michael Ironside is Muco, and he is always a favorite (as I said, Jack Nicholson is inadequate). And we'll also get Carrie-Ann Fleming "Damian's Wife", horror fans will be called Jenifer by Dario Argent's "Jenifer". So, this movie, as it is wrong, does not add a name ... but the same thing can be said about Uwe Boll's work. <br /> <br /> Vampires keep track of and die in space, it is not necessarily a bad idea, but it easily falls into the "cheese" area, and this film is hard on. The play, especially vampires, is on top and I do not think it's very persuasive. The worst thing is that vampire tribes have names like "Voorhess" and "Leatherfaces". I understand that it was a quick reference for horror fans, but it was not very clear. It was only dumb and out of place (James Gunn's "Slither" references were much more subtle, for example, stores he knew less about horror directors). <br /> <br /> I mean all this. If I have a lot of cheese (I can not do it today and I was in Wisconsin) and I want to see the average vampires of the costumes wearing bad clothes in space (although "space" looks like any other forest on the ground), look if you can find them. I do not recommend this, a movie for young vampires (Jon Carpenter "Vampires") or other cheesy movies. Or maybe some good ones too. But, yes, do your thing.
