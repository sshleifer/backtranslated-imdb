I have always liked Fred MacMurray, and his career was tragically short? I think that seeing Carole Lombard is fun. These two attractive and attractive stars, Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour, and Charles Butterworth, have added a generous script, join with the famous Mitchell Leis director and get a great movie experience. <br /> <br /> Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "love to visit the Panama Canal" and fall in love with the next few weeks. Skid is a great trumpet, so it starts with a music career, that is, the predicted meteorite both its rise and fall. While Maggie climbs into the music scene, Maggie does not leave her, and then inspires it again. Well, Hollywood's real end is happy, and that's not coming soon. <br /> <br /> The stars and the quality director should guarantee success, but this film is predictable and slow as it is difficult. watch at times. The initial scenarios set up in Panama are very dangerous, they continue forever, and later, Skid Alcoholics is constantly walking in New York. Fred and Carole try their best, but they only have the tedious screenplay and direction S-L-O-W. Maggie's latest scene of alcohol and despair as well, it's not true. <br /> <br /> This movie can be seen once to see some of the first performances of MacMurray stars in Lombard. However, there seems to be around 48 hours of observation.
