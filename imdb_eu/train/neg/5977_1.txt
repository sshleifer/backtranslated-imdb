Wow I never remember that there's so much more about this movie. <br /> <br /> Basically the drawing; The parents of little girls do not leave, so PokeMon wants to be his father. Is that the only one that is only confused? Afterwards, this PokeMon murder has been kidnapped by Ashren's mother to become a little girl. I do not like trying to please the girl, that's just it. <br /> <br /> There was no real plot. The little girl was just like the little girl who liked her way. He played with Unowns, he was the "daughter of Ente" and apparently grew and diminished with his father's help. <br /> <br /> I remember that pretty much, but I think you can think it as a tip and do not see it. (Or if you see, do not expect more.) 10 to 10. <br /> <br /> Really. If you want a PokeMon movie, rent "PokeMon; the first movie".
