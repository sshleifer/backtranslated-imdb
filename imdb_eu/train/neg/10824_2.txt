This version is terrifying. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been in childhood, but William Hurt's highly-interpreted style is completely inadequate with the daring passion of Edward Rochester and the boring and nasty teenage girl Charlotte Gainsbrough. I can not believe that, since the end of the book, Edward's wedding proposals have been removed, one of the most important moments in literature. I am grateful that you have recently used a young and ordinary woman, a character who plays Jane, who plays 18, but if you want to see a new version of the novel's identity and passion, see version 70 with George C. Scott and Susannah York. York was old, tall and pretty to play Jane, but no one touched Rochester's character as Scott did.
