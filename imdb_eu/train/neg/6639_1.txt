It's very sad that Lucian Pintiles does not stop making movies. Every time they get worse. Niki and Flo (2003) is a captivating face of the camera. It is unfortunate for many of the films that are made every year in Romania, the worst of these can be sent abroad (for example, the Chicago International Film Festival). It's time and money without loss of money without a movie, play or script. Score from 10 to 10.
