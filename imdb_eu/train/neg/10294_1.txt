Nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Then unidentified characters are not developing. <br /> <br /> Then the end is never beginning, because there is no beginning and a half. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There is no "is" in this movie because there are no plots, characters or themes or ideas, or symbolism, because it is not a discussion or a conversation or a point. Nothing! <br /> <br /> It's a good point: it has a good soundtrack. However, it's a sound editing and it's a good movie, just like you do not see your time is worth it, so if you're really interested in it, I'd suggest it and buy a soundtrack or something. With this movie, you can do everything you can, fatigue, headache and no problem. <br /> <br /> --ParisDiB
