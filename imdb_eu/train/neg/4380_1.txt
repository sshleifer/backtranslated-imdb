Plot: A couple of love decides to escape in a very bright car. Then, they stick (literally) into a compromise position, while the car means unwantedly until hapless horsepower couple authorities rescue it. <br /> <br /> That's it. That's the whole movie. There may be some conversations here and there, but nothing comes to mind. Now it should be clear that this movie is not useless, but really physically painful. One of the two great stars of the United Kingdom (one of them, now sadly dead) has a horrible horror. win 'Fire of Fire'. Remember to get this role and try to make this tough celluloid abomination that never happened to happen.
