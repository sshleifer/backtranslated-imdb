This movie has been a waste of time, even if it is rented on the DVD. If high-speed camera shots get faster than this, then we can also pay eight dollars with laundry, get popcorn and watch the dryer. Jet Li is much better than this. She only hopes that she will not make a bid to make another movie theater soon available. As one, you should avoid the movie "The One".
