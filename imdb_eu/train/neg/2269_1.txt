Let's take a movie about a talk show that's already there, and it's basically everything that's going on in the show! Well, if that idea is not intriguing, that is, it should not be outside the ring. I wanted to see this theater and, in fact, I could feel the mess of a movie. Jerry Springer thinks he's not showing himself the cheapest props for the show (it seems cheaper than the real jerry springer show) and the movie is only known as Jerry. Earth (if it's called) is about a daughter, while she decides to stay asleep with her mother while she lives with her mother. So the great idea of ​​her mother is to call the show Jerry Springer and her boyfriend. (Is not it a coincidence that they live in the trailer park). Meanwhile, elsewhere in America, a woman finds herself in bed with her friend with her friend in bed. So, of course, call America springer therapist! I'd like to talk about the rest of the movie, but it also hurts me to think about the movie. Jamie Pressly, when she plays her daughter, is not very attractive in the film. And remember Michael Dudikoff of the American ninja serious karate master? Look at it now that you are in the trash. The thing is terribly stunning and lacking in form to call "to get in touch with her outfit". But if your essential idea is to sing a popular song that Jerry Springer links with his show or travestitos ... well ... YOU CAN EXPRESS! ... at least steve was smart enough to stop this movie.
