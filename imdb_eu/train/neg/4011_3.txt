For all TV series, 100 ideas are created, 50 script writers are written, 15 riders, and one, one, really leads to production. Based on this selection process, we believe that the final product should be a cream of crops, which was another reason to deny so many ideas to give a single television series. <br /> <br /> And so goes True Blood; All the stars were aligned and the idea began as a series of novels, the screen theater, a rider and eventually become a series. Unfortunately, sometimes it may be a long journey and on the way there are many tours that will eventually change what is good and pure and make people feel like it would be the best way to make the ratings. Oh, how bad they are ... <br /> <br /> True Blood is a creative account, the latest final television storyline, the worst performance and the bird. . The international film, which is quite unknown to the actors, tries to find voices, but continues to keep the story of the southern stories. Alan Ball tells Ryan's secret inequalities (Jason Stackhouse) a naked weekend, but often has nothing to do with storyline. Tara Black's characterization of anger fails to conceal and conceal that you are hiding when the vampire is quickly removed, before joining another conference on the White Crisis, who will participate in the Glorious Decease of the Confederacy in the Confederacy. Sam has taken away the love for Sookie and suddenly believes that he ought to take care of him in the morning and at nighttime, avoiding the relationship for many years. <br /> <br /> In regards to Bill Vampire, the first opportunity to make love with Sookie falls in love with his moral abilities, and he has not had any trouble in making a quick bite (although he has not suffered any harm). Other vampires will not be as prominent as Bill, but people accept life while they are happy with their legs. <br /> <br /> Despite the biggest efforts in the first six episodes. I noticed, besides seeing the bad weather, it's still bad. Some die for a reason as well as vampires. Maybe this show.
