This movie is a total dog. I found myself laughing, I felt that I simply would not waste my money. Writing this movie is absolutely horrible. Pena is not in front of Hale Storm's other movie standards. <br /> <br /> They should save money as long as the D-list actors spend money and money with Fred Willard and Gary Coleman. it was correct Although Gary Coleman did not use it correctly. <br /> <br /> This movie allows you to explain the most part of the plot. After watching this movie, it seems to me that some producers intend to capture Napolean Dynamite's humor in a way that is not as clear as characters and deliveries. Unfortunately, this film does not include lines, characters, delivery or humor. I should go to a dentist!
