That's why Angela has grown and has achieved therapy and operation to become a true daughter, a child born, and now she works - wait - a counselor! Which one is right, right? I know, I love it. However, the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp franchising franchise meets all the rules of horror seizures: more blood, more imaginative kills (not imagination, but more than original), more nudities, more elaborate land and, in general, worse than the original. <br /> <br /> It was as entertaining as the original, the characters and cabinets so strangely and so real that the 80s can not get you laughing. One moment, a guy asks Angela, and says "I will call you," and then walks quickly. The man tells himself: "How will he call me? I do not have a phone!" and then he sniffs his armpits as he asks what his off (hair is dude!). <br /> <br /> It's well-known in the 80s slasher movies, more often than not, by their teenage deaths, their killers did not punish them for some bad behavior, usually because they were confused. When I went into the horror movies and when I first saw eleventh films in the mid-90s, I did not notice. I learned a year or two years later in a film class and I was surprised that it was a madhouse method. I was very impressed that the movies were broadcasting a message, though they were morbid, but they actually introduced some thoughts. <br /> <br /> But not in this movie! For a moment, Angela dies before one of the victims, says: "Leave this lesson. Say no drugs!" There is a real, subtle screening on it, boys. Again, the conversation is the funniest thing in the movie. Angela (by the way, she tried to recover all of her past therapy and recover herself and become a normal and well-developed person, then changed the name Angela, umm, Angela). At one point he said: "I do not like being a bad western witch, but I know what happens when things get out of control." (People kill me ... for me! HA!) <br /> <br /> Then, later, a consultant, Mare, asks her to apologize, as the girl responds, "I would rather!" She died! "Sorry, but you really entered ... <br /> <br /> Two years ago, I was a camp counselor in a sleepaway camping similar to this movie (except the camp I taught), more than three children aged 15 or 20 advisers and the rules of the film, which made me feel the difference in the film, as it seems to be a life campist. <br /> <br /> However, it's okay, but you can not do such a movie that surrounds 9-year-old young people Despite the fact that some 10 or 11 year old children died in this movie, I did not see that kind of thing before. <br /> <br /> Final taste for a melancholic slasher in the 80's.
