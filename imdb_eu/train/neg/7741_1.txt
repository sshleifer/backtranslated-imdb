Josh Hartnett's eyes dead, his bold writing, and comedy friend Harrison Ford! Here are 3 reasons to hate, avoid and use 116 minutes better. <br /> <br /> The police are very fun. However, their real gold year returned in the 1980s and 1990s. It's a good idea to try to confront action and comedy with the Hollywood police, but the result of this last result was not a mistake of the underworld, but the reason for God's mercy. This type of past film was worst than Hollywood homicide. Yes, did something happen to you with this fun formula! From the beginning of the decade things were not the same. You would be a tough flop for a friend. I will gladly enjoy titles about good disasters: (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky & Hutch - 2004), and still worst. (Miami Vice - 2006)! <br /> <br /> I think it's a reason that it's almost saturated after almost 2 decades of theater movies and theater. Add to that, above all, carelessness and humor. Actually, this time is totally unbearable. Yes, we have 2 loyal police officers with second jobs, and the backs of the urban vector, but what's new? It's not about clich√©s; Both are innovations that are newly mixed with topical issues. <br /> <br /> The agent, especially (Hartnett), is horrible. The guy is a comedian (or actor!). So, his character wanted to avenge his father's death! To avenge yourself, you've probably died to watch your play! Although the role of small people with no comedy (or so it seemed), <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < dull (without being arrested by the black guy?); It's strange to be boring to be an action / comedy! Hollywood did not use them as an ironic place, like a superficial charm behind a ugly face or a star-shaped star or falling star (some of the most interesting moments of the cameras). > <br /> The film is very easy to watch only the glamor of its stars, and the Buddy-cop that ends as one of the worst cases of non-chemistry. one of them does not have chemists with the same screen! Guess who ?!), and more than a Buddy-Cop destroyer! God, do not make me, or my children, a living witness (Hollywood Homicide? Part 2)! Finally, look at Harrison Ford's performance, he wanted to have fun, but at least we did not.
