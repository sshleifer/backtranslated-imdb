I have read many good reviews that have defended and criticized different aspects of this movie. One thing I can see is that Megan, an idealistic political scientist, is trying to change the world. I loved her character. Maybe, at the age of 23, I am a student of political science and I will change the world, so I relate it to Megan. It's nice too. Not a supermarket, but a nice little girl next door. <br /> <br /> Okay, so he cried and cried out. It's very dramatic, and it seems to be overwhelming, but does it fit its character? This show continues to prove his life. People who enjoy this show think it is ill. I think his argument has done well. Of course, if you were a young girl, she was afraid to send her face. I believe that his actions are accurately portrayed by a young girl who shows in moral sense that fear is overwhelming. I also believe that maintaining a dignity throughout the film, despite the surprising situation. <br /> <br /> In the overall movie, unlike Megan, I really expected what it was. He had excellent Gore scenes, according to micro budgets. The plot can make a quick thinking, there is hardly any intuition. Basically, it's simply a dark humorist, a nonsensical slasher movie that comes with the name. I love the sadism of the doctor. Megan's shirt did not go away, not just the cause of sleaze (though, largely, anyway), but at the same time his torment before he died. Chainsaw hick was hilarious. For fans of Slasher film, it was probably the best character. <br /> <br /> I have given 4 of this film. It's a good place, it's hardly a plot, and a good mix of good acting. I would recommend it for cheap emotion, but it's hardly a diamond horror for a micro-budget.
