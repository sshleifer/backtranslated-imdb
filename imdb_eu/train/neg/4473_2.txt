It hurts hard and tries with all the extreme shouting and madness that flows and flows in the ground. Too much. Relax, meet and laugh. I did not understand the comparison of his comic and rock stars. Just do it on stage or something? Every comedy says he wants to become a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was alive. He had jokes like the Burger King joke, where the people cried in the drive. I liked the Reese's Piez joke. He just thought about it, it would be fun, and that could be a higher point, maybe a bit higher than one.
