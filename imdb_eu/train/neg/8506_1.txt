This can be a really bad movie. It would be an inconsistent compliment. Although at the end there was no sense, but it was a tremendous relief that it was finally over. I saw a kind of fatal illusion to see if it could continue to deteriorate and did so. At the end of this mix I felt all the characters survived and I did not feel too well for the actors. If you want to see the train's disaster, I recommend hanging it on the train station. Although it is waiting in a flat rail platform, this disorder falls. It seems that I have no courage to complete ten command lines, so I'll be able to redone it again. This movie is zero, and it would be less, even if it's a lower score. What is zero?
