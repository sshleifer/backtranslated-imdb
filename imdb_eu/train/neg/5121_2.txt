I went into this movie thinking that the football drama would be clean (like the Remember the Titans); However, I felt like I was coming away as I attended the preaching Ted Haggard. The only thing missing was that the movie was asked at ten in the end. In fact, you would surely get more out of the pretext for a TV preacher than this bad one. At the same time as the television preacher, there are quotes from the Saints, but they refer to the primitive popularization of self-help. The land was predictable, anyone who was long enough could give the plot in the first 15 minutes of the movie.
