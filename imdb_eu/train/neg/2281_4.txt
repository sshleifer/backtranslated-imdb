Think of "theater". That's the story of Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye's performances. Share Melvyn DOuglas with this movie "Ghost Story" with Melvyn DOuglas. Is there a vampire freely "bavarian" in this town, or is there more natural explanation, even so much? Dwight Frye Herman is a red penetration that is cast as a particularly morain. It is very funny to perform in different facial expressions, in a character that is truly a character. It's been a long time since, but we now know that the doctor who burns Atwill's pipe is a real killer. There is too much "relief", but it's just like that for the time. Fay Wray really looks good.
