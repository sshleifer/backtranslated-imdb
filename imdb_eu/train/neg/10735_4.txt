It's possible that being a former Muscovite being my own and having a mood, I try to throw this movie "arthouse / festival crap" into the trash. It's not the biggest 2005 movie, nor the litter. He has a lot of problems. Undoubtedly, this film has been banned if "ideological fears" or "taboo conservatives" or for any other reason the foreign film was called "bold" and "rigorous". It was forbidden because the censors accounted for 99% of Russian filmmakers because they were fond of offensive movies or other films. kick A wonderful sound design, an excellent premise - meaning and symbolism. The use and positioning of symbols will always be the strongest part of the movie (not 4 is a visual challenge). In the next 40 minutes we have the same settings. A fun and written conversation between the three main characters, we feel people, a great Russian country, a human condition and all that. Then the movie starts to slow down. We will begin by asking what happens. <br /> <br /> The rest is quite boring, just put it. Surely, the guy of the town puts up heartfelt enthusiasm and there are some pleasant times. Beautiful sound, sure. But the enjoyment of this movie, to name the plot, the rhythm is seriously compromised. And that is to say, that is, in the end, people are angry as "offensive" (in itself, the most damaging scene is the most offensive to the elderly). The drunkenness that can be harmful to the pathetic way may appear). <br /> <br /> If you want to see the Russians wasting a long time (full movie), see the National Hunt details. Sovereign wealth is much richer. So, yes, from 10 to 10, nice and symbolic under the condition of my post.
