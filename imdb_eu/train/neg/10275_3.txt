The premise is amazing and some plays, especially Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, are charming ... but this movie is not close. It sounds like music free from the online website and the source of some fonts, as if it were written in the lap with a wide dictionary. Most of the songs are off-off keys. I think maybe they can shoot the songs of the song and play music ... The conversation is really stupid and sad. The film is best done when it talks about the real estate theme, but unfortunately it is often diverted by stupid sub-plot. After about the first twenty minutes I found my watch and I asked 40 "when it will end".
