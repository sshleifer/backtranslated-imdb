The best amateurism describes the adaptation of the best philosophical novel "The Celestine Prophecy", which follows the spiritual awakening of a teacher who works in a mysterious town in Perun. Home video quality agents showcase significant characters while overwrought the exhibition and metaphysical hokum, under Armand Mastroianni's direction. Although ABC's "Lost" or Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code" attempt to measure unnecessary fare rates are visible, filmmakers do not reach that task. This film is a mass consumer-consumed spiritual mass propaganda, and the results are so few that you can go through this mess to find a real point.
