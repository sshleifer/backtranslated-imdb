What can I say? I have to write "Spoiler Alert" and "reveal" in this movie they used the F-word LOT, as in all two sentences. This movie was not liked, too much sex-perversions, sidesteps and cheating hints. And swear that it came out of the window completely. I gave this movie "3" and some of these points are Mira Sorvino dancing for sexy movements on the floor.
