A movie written and directed by Neil Young, in the works of a "Greendale", is more than a 87-minute music video. Conversely, the films are based on Young's words, sociopolitical commentaries, when they tell the story, the actors are based on the scene. <br /> <br /> Hammy performances and hand-made growth. In the picture, the effect is equivalent to the release of young people from their home movies and to public consumption. A "story" that crosses the film allegedly does not know what happens, especially with the clear appearance of the film, lack of dialogue and the ineptitude of the playmaker. All that we get from seventy-seven minutes is a silent silence of hippies, silently silent, in a soundtrack that plays Youngen's song through a consistent narrative. The whole thing becomes self-indulgence exercise tedious. "Hollywood" is called "Greendale".
