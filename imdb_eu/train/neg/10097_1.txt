I stopped BB and I received 4 zombie movies for the weekend. Now, I understand that the effects will be cursed, the actors will be sub-pairs and the groups will be suspicious. So I do not expect much. But at least it should have a story. Stories are not worth the time ... apparently, they did not have any time. <br /> <br /> Five zombies emerged from the end of the "Zombie Nation" movie. It seemed the slot of the new waves. The zombie image on the front is NEVER the movie. He saw nothing that he did not offer, and he had no problems. <br /> <br /> The time was only about 81 minutes, but it was felt for 2 hours. According to my wife (the movie could have been heard since the computer was in the other room), it seemed zombie porn ... .... if you think, the sounds are serious ... but it was not that good though. <br /> <br /> I can make the only suggestion, maybe the writer has done too many things and has avoided unpleasant confusion. <br /> <br /> The free rental is over and I'm still ripped off. I value 10 to 10, the IMDb does not allow tithes to use.
