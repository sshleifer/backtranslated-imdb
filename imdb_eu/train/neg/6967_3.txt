Oh God, what a stupid movie! Fake special effects are incredibly cheap (a creature who plays lame costume) and stupid plots. All conversations are unbelievably bad and the actors (HA! HA! HA!) ... It's just so playful. For example, I have never seen such horrible characters in these rubbish (ie pregnant dumb or pregnant woman, and much more). In any case, this is great entertainment if you drink it. like plague. I drank it I do not think so ...
