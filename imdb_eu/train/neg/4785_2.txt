It's so bad that knowing the tricky smell of a movie is to start with that liar. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's a terrifying movie that's terrifying, even if it's based on amercien standards. The conversation is a topic, the characters are two-dimensional, the script is ho-hum, and there is little story that is neither consistent nor far from interesting. <br /> <br /> We meet the following stereotypes: Balding Loser Guy (probably divorced but who knows, this movie does not tell us) with a brave heart, Young Hero (which has no heroic character), little darling Kid (mile wide with a homicide) and black black mum head (much more than brains). These boys are constantly fighting Tall Scary Reaper Man and his evil Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is full of small metallic orbs around the threatening crowds. By giving them an opportunity, they perform an improvised brain surgery, for those who do not have the rigors of the mind to duck when they are forgotten. Booh! In fact, one of them is investigating a good ghost (but again, perhaps it may be a false spectrum) that our Kartagonist Brava wants to help recover his kidnapped young friend. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no character input in the background or even characters. It starts with a few extinctions that finish the previous film, but this does not explain much. If you've seen the first two movies, well. Otherwise, you do not know who the people are, how they relate, why they are not in school or at work, or why you should take care of living or dying. So you do not. The only point of interest becomes a splatter effect. And there is not much to keep awake. <br /> <br /> Potential interests / games are three Raider punks, evil stupid, threatening our Heroes. But they do not get much time on the screen. Almost immediately they take them away. Then they are buried (why they need to take more time than anyone else), and they will appear again in Evil Raider as Punk Zombies. Just for one minute to be released again. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film, especially, seems to be that Caspar's Ghost Ghost appears and disappears, looking for a place and trying to get Balding Loser Bad Black Bitch Booty, mentally disturbed a teenager would be embarrassed by collecting lines . No dice even if he had sexually free movie, so good was never any. <br /> <br /> The head of the foolish person, called the High Man, no longer afraid of anyone over 3; "Booooy!" It's not enough every five minutes. Why, with its amazing telekinetic powers and a high level of bodybuilding, our actors will not appear like jokes. Instead, the job postpones, who does not kill anyone, who does not kill anyone before shooting at the hell. <br /> <br /> "Friday, XXXXVIII. Friday" likes masterpieces. find some entertainment The rest, those who generate public, skulls are bored.
