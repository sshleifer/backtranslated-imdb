Please do not let the cover of this movie fool you. And if you're looking for cheap movie horror, this is not it. Usually I'm going to take stupid things if it's funny, but this idiot was so stupid that I was almost (or maybe he did) stupid. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film is better than an electronic agenda, but not much, and it is not possible to create a music by pressing the Keyboard 2 of a keyboard by Casio. These problems would never have to watch the horror movie, but add this (weeping) cast, and you have a real humdinger. <br /> <br /> The story is a story about a man who invites his friends. This weekend the Texas family booth. He will also open the guest to the twisted lady of her office. There you will find a woman on the road, who invites you to another girl. <br /> <br /> In-house stay in sex and nudity, and soon all the panties are in the middle. The girl disappears and the curious elements will appear at home. <br /> <br /> From there (viewers) and slogans, um, actors, try to know what happens and they soon start to mute each other. In general, I think it was better than the sound. The main battle against this film is a very undeveloped character, created on the plot, acting bad and motivating. It may be again overwhelming that it was the weirdest thing but it was fun, but it's not. <br /> <br /> The tour is just a twist to the end, if you only think that nobody should invent it. In any case, the movie would not make sense. Please do not leave this review to see the horror rock of this movie. (Woah, my nose grew eight inches).
