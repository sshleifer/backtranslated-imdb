The worst movie ever! Please see the real movie reviews of this movie. Check out the Rotten Tomatoes website to see some good independent reviews about this film. The comments made on this site seem like some people with financial interests in these films. The positive comment is very misleading. I find it amazing that negative comments on this movie are positive and positive comments are similar to the Oscars. Do not miss out on the money earned !!!!!! This movie is delayed !! I can not believe it will ever do such a movie. Why would Hollywood lose these times? This movie is not trying. I ask myself how much money I would waste on the money. I went to the big restaurant and he told us the loss of time or money that the guardian did not. I did not hear and wasted my time and money. Please do not make the same mistake! It's really "the worst movie ever".
