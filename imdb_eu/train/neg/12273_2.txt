PLAN B has been published without a short film, with the session to take part with the agents involved, from the start it was necessary to leave the output. The other mafia is just a "comedy", it's just another that reduces the standard for those who participate. <br /> <br /> Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is worried about the crime of dressing up and apparently than his business. under control Mario's personal assistant (Anthony DeSando) is more demanding than dirt and his ignorance is fun. Malonik, one of his debtors (hidden under Diane Keaton's book), and Malonik will be taking care of her husband as Frank's husband's debt, as a result of Maloni's "man". Fran is afraid of his shadow, and he can not perform the tasks of Maloni, who chooses to transport their "wheke" to Florida until they know what to do to hide their brother James's house. This alternative to killing three candidates is the B Plan, which is the Plan A's that kills! The ending is completely predictable for all the lines that are designated in the script for the characters. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton has made many great films and is one of the greatest talents of our actors and comedies, but she is shouting here. and it makes it different and it violates its path, seeing it quickly through the hilarious part that is annoying. Paul Sorvino, well, is the type of other mafioso films, Paul Sorvino. In the same way, it allows the holder to play on the balcony, in the most popular fashion. Having a comedy has nonsense and nonsense. The director Greg Yaitanes had to return to the TV sitcoms: this weak story compressed the half-century conception and this could be. Grady Harpa
