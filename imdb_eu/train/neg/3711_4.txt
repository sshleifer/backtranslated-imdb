I did not watch the movie when I saw the movie, I found my opinions in a friend's opinion. Now, I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie falls on his face. <br /> <br /> Filmean Rock offers some fun jokes, but unfortunately the movie is missing comedy. The film seems to want to unite laughter and love, and the effort fails. The film's love story is right (fortunately), but the film overwhelms the rock with serious and humble ones. In the end, the movie is geared towards being a comedy, first of all, laughter has to be the first concern. Not many of them in the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is not very interesting. Some parts were completely interrupted. If they help them to be fun, they certainly do not do a good job. The twin angels of heaven made jokes that were dry and dull. The first twin rocks in Rock were blurred. Even if it's a good reason, Rock became a fun look.
