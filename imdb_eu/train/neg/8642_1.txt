I have to say that the film is horrible, when you watch this movie as a documentary when you watch the guide. As I looked at, I started laughing, thinking about myself, does the guy really expect that this belief is real? So I had to look, and now I see that it's a movie, but now it's not a documentary, it's a movie now. So in a way, it's pretty bad. Actually, I did not finish. I had to shut up. I am a NYC Police Officer and I feel someone trying to trick people into thinking it is a documentary, with no intention of earning money for me and my colleagues to be a great day. So I personally took a little. Maybe I've blinded that way, and it's not so bad as I personally think. Everyone has their say.
