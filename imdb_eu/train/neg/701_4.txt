During the Christmas break, a group of university friends will be accommodated and replaced by apartments. To make the work more difficult, Chucks's psycho psychiatrist walks through the classroom, integrating the group into violent and varied ways. <br /> <br /> 74 'registered among the wicked videos. 'In the United Kingdom, it was listed in the 1980s, The Dorm That Dripped Blood was created well before seeing it first. The term "bad video" takes into account the images of gore, violence, sexuality, etc.: all things that dread fans of horror. So, after hearing all this information, I expected a drastic experience of Pranks (alt. Title) Slasher. . . and that has been tried, but it has failed completely. Visually, the movie is not great. Cinematography, gore (except a couple of scenes) and a general direction fail. It's just not nice to see. A plain script is not missing and it often casts random things without real reason (like opening the kill). There are some cool death scenes, the pretty face melts (it can be seen on the poster), but it's positive about it. The play is pretty bad, the story seems unimportant, the killer is not horrible or scary, and slasher is a major mistake to always avoid any movie. It's boring. In general, for a movie by some UCLA film students over $ 90,000 (which is more than double today), The Dorm That Dripped Blood is not a total mess. It has two good things, and it's pretty nice. . . But, as a Slasher film, he wants to be at the movies like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces. . . can not compare Do not expect much, and it can be at least entertained. I hate to say, but this is one of the few films that would improve with a remake. . . and yet they do great work like Black Christmas. Okay . . <br /> <br /> Required horror items: <br /> <br /> - Azcar: Slasher <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There are some cold deaths, and courtesy is most often. . . but it's not special. In addition, some of the best murders have been released. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: it's not very attractive to me, but not many. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): Nah. The final monologue of the murderer made him his beautiful uncool. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: It's scaring the jump or two, but nothing is very effective. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: I think, yes, but I do not like it enough, and it's as clear as the killer's nose. <br /> <br /> - - - <br /> <br /> Last ruling: 3.75 / 10! Humbug! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
