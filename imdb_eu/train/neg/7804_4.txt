THE TEMP (1993) did not do any great theater business, but the video clip you do not want is straightforward! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is a young woman from Millennium Investments, a large-scale mediation house, which Deidre (Sheila Kelley) is looking at the broad secretary. Deidre is a father, a pretty girl, who stays in the corporate stairs, who finds the broker and can not stand up and die for anyone who is bad at all. She throws skeletons in the wardrobe of Ellen, her husband (Barry Bostwick) may cause problems, she says she is responsible for killing her, kidnaps her daughter and tries to stop the company's money. <br /> <br /> Harris and Kelley will be giving them the most important screenings. The correct support is right and well placed, but this does not fully compensate for a script that offers a wonderful way to get through and overwhelm.
