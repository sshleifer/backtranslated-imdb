Let's say in a different way: balls. Or, what kind of bun * ks. This is really horrible, more shameful than those who try to satire. Julia Roberts is a talented actress and is usually the highest level of her work. This movie lacks so much leadership, even if it tries to be a good one. He is usually a professional profession, but I swear in his eyes, it is surprising and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Moving this one can only rescue the director's idea (Chris Walken). The movie has become a secret documentary about actresses. Unfortunately, this issue was not fully explored. Small, it's too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was wood, it was Cusack Cusack, and Crystal would behave. Both Buffy's two talented stars had experiences - Green misperly mis-cast, and Balfour did not use it. To avoid the worst film ever made by Mr. Julia.
