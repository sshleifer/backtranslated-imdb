Witchy Hildegard Knef captures a whole host of people in an isolated hotel and pulls them out one by one. I saw everything I had seen until an unfortunate man was crucified, and then fired at his head. Hildy is also a pretty jeweler: he takes a dangerous harpy and closes his mouth ... then hangs on the fireplace, but a fire! "The witches" got sick. My eyes wounded me. I wanted to record art as the worst movie ever made by evil people ... until the end. I have to admit I love the end. Linda Blair has tightened the fantastically clad boys and their tape recorders. The scene only lasts about a minute, and the movie is over, but you know the old phrase that says: "If you get a great end, people will forgive you for anything!"
