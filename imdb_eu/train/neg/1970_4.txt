Watching this movie for this action is only a waste of time, because the heads of ships work better than humans. It is a pity that Anthony Quinn can not force anyone to correct any other film after this turkey. <br /> <br /> But it's full of fun, because Yul Brynner's hair, Lorne Greene is not convincing. French accent, and all the other great names are comic books.
