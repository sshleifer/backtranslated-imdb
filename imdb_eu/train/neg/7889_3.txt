I just finished watching this movie. It was not ridiculous bad, but I'm really disappointed. I'm not sure why someone can do such a movie. Fortunately it was entertaining, but I'm sorry that the people that made people did a lot of disagreement about what they did. On Monday, the writer was in charge of it; Tuesday, director; Wednesday, the tip that gets coffee; etc. It seems that they wanted to make almost different films, but they could only have time and money to make one. <br /> <br /> Another person commented that the performance was really good, but I would not agree. Once again, if the actor could keep the face on the shoot, maybe they're more actors than I'm giving credit. Have a mystery ... according to the legal and historical order or national treasure. That's when it starts, but then it's nowhere to twist the bad section of Twilight Zone, or ... what other show was not so good ... The bad part of The Outer Limits. . <br /> <br /> The main complaint about my film is that way. There is an evil man with a hairy hair. It is the interest of love, when it is the first time that the wind really crosses the hair. Serious After realizing that he is a Christian movie, the end is quite easy to spot. <br /> <br /> Cinematography has been badly done, especially in the initial scenes - the best way to send your feet. Most of the movies were not horrible, but occasionally an old woman laughed, in a dark room, the horny shot was bad, the dark light is a striking lightning - just embarrassed the kind of thing you do. watch the movie
