It was something nice, but the small budget is a bit boring with the low budget appliance. The use of virtual sets is almost always working, but sometimes it fails. I think that they use the small budget correctly. I just wanted the story and most of the plays were better. There are many parts where they wanted to see what would be and it would be wonderful to actually attack these brands but not. A confusing and unbelievable story. A bad DVD transfer too. It's not much for me to watch the movie. I had to close this. It was very boring. I can make slow movies. But just make it attractive in some aspects. Visuals, stories, actors, etc. This was a lack of every department, so he never had a wonderful experience. Maybe the next filmmaker's attempt will be better.
