It was a decent movie, I really like it. But the end is so violent! There is no shutdown and it looses the ends. What happens after the concert? What's up with the groom? Does Grant link? Does the next semester get? And what about Angela? Holly's performance, of course, would have fallen a few Angels, but there's nothing to show how it reacts. He stays in the air and he is very happy. I do not know how to make a sequel or something else, but the end is horrible and I think the movie makes a joke. I was very disappointed.
