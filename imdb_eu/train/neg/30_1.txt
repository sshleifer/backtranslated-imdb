In 1987 I did not like the tortoise idea for the woman, because TMNT had four brothers with her teacher Splinter and her enemies, and four brothers named names of great artists such as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphel and Leonardo. Donatello, therefore, does not have any meaning or Venus, and does not play any important role, and I think that the old TMNT series Venus is much better than Venus. That is why we would like the story. In 1987, all the new enemies we know of, TMNT is a good act, but being a turtle is too weak to act, we want to see more TMNT series, but the same character we knew in 1987 without this turtle.
