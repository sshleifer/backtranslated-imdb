The American Humane Association, which is the origin of an unknown source "Animals are not hurt ..." (AHA's trademark), continued to keep track of the use of animal films over 60 years ago, when it was covered. He filmed Jesse James (1939) on the top of a cliff that was to be taken to death. Needless to say, this horrible act kills the whole entertainment of the movie for me. I think that at least the horse was not in vain because it was a terrible and horrible pain to celebrate because of the great celebration of cinema, but I can not feel sorry if the sick animal has an opportunity, he would not be sure!
