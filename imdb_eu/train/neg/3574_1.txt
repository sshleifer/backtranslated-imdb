I can not finish this movie. I was aware that, in my opinion, he was the candidate for the nomination of the most suggestive of sexual suggestions: Pia Zadora is one of the two boys who want to go on a picnic. One (good boy) asks you to see the error of his path. The other (a bad boy) asks him just how he would like a dog, which then waits for him. At the floating level. I hope that I am not saying catastrophes, and the dog is smiling. Pathetic
