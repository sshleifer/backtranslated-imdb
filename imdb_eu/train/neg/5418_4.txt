This movie is S.E. it's like material. Hinton wrote in the 70s and Copola adjusted to the beginning of the 80's, and if Trueblood had really been a product, the results could be much better (especially in the performance department). Instead, we find the mediocrity piece so bad-funny. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey plays with Ray Trueblood, a former street rumor, I think it's a straightforward description. The boys and girls of the 1940s and the 1940s used them during the action movies and in the most productive selection of thongs or bangs. However, Ray's younger brother, Donny (a part that shouts a lot in Chad Lowe) is a lonely gatekeeper, who is successfully retiring at a train station, he is nabbed by the host of police. and time is required at the Mariners. Flash is now moving forward and has returned to the village of Ray and is looking for a brother who has become a member of the street teams, a rival team against Rayen and old scores must be violated (and once again police have been forbidden). and this time, a woman who has defended the act of cinema) Ray's brother, Donny, could have a normal life. <br /> <br /> In most cases, the movie is very ridiculous. For me, this is, above all, that it has to do with excessive abuse, but Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn does not work in love with the server. The gang's boys and Lowe seem to have no less absurdity than the toughest streets in New York. Although larger hanging lines are recycled lines and, perhaps, a type of first film produced in 1989.
