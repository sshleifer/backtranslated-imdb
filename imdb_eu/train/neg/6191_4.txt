I saw this movie, along with other adaptations to be put on hand, including theater shows, for preparing for some academic research. Cinematography is very moving, as well as music. Unfortunately, all the life came out of the story. I have never seen a horrible portrait of Mr. Rochester. All of its essential features have disappeared. Where is her knowing? Where is the passion? Scott Rochester resembles Rochester's role, St. John, more than the character of the novel. In fact, St. John's involvement in the actress involved St John's passionate fate when Scott tried to break things or look at the ceiling (all that he did all the time). I do not know what they thought. I'd like to give a little bit of votes based on wonderful music and cinematic movie, but I can honestly watch this movie for a long time because of George C. Scott's performance.
