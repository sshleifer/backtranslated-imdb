The movie was so huge, it was almost ... almost. We love musicals, but not this. With soaring sound quality, poor cinematography and plenty of actors that can not be sung, Anthony Rapp really enjoyed it (especially at the end). Marjorie character, a drunken lady, was also pleasant to see. <br /> <br /> The land is very unexpected and it could be very fun without great songs and no piano music. Citizens, some (fantabulous) songs are very attractive (but not in a good way). <br /> <br /> The Open House movie is fun just because it's just scary! We believe we can be a good music scene (excellent actors).
