To use AMAITZ (see it on a double star) is like using a white noise or a sound of sound, so you can sleep, store it on the DVD because it is left in the parking lot in stores and you are diverted after a bright day. And for that it works for it: it's a little bit more than a romantic British comedy. <br /> <br /> The story is married to a younger husband of Alice in Wonderland (Jennifer Love Hewitt). Sam (Jimi Mistry) has maintained his love life for his busy legal practices. Archie (Dougray Scott) is very fond of Sam and Alic, but Alic has a temporary attraction that goes beyond friendship. Alic, his sister Felicity (Kate Miles), is a defender of love, Alic encourages some problems. On Valentine's Day, when he drinks with his sister, Alice sends a card to Sam with the name "Anonymous", if Sam responds by testing his fidelity. At the same time, Archie will send Alic to an alkoholic pack of alcohol, where no suggestive love has been written. Both will regret the ex post facto. Sam, in fact, is spending time with Katia lover (Branka Katic) and she really deceives Alic. Alice arranges Sam's assignments for email and phone calls and Sam's plans to satisfy her as 'Anonymous' to prove her fidelity. The whole team of characters finds it stupid and at the end proves that true love has to be true, which is the surprise of the fluffy script for how it works. <br /> British comedies have a great deal of quality and quality of writing. Perhaps John Hayre was the director of the British actress Alicia, Alice, instead of sticking to a false accent of Jennifer Love Hewitt, the result could be improved. In the end, this story of Peter Bloore is bounced back from the mercy and pathetic of his messages. A terrific distraction covers all the conversation and is a very intrusive music score. There are moments in London's beautiful scenes and humor, but in the end this little movie is used as a key musical / noise. Grady Harpa
