Nu Image, UFO and others produce films with SCI FI channels for $ 2 million in budgets. Some work on a variety of effects, others are characterized by errors and others, as well as $ 2 million. <br /> <br /> Mr. Hines initially claimed that this movie was a $ 20 million budget, but it's clear that this is probably a $ 750,000 dollar, much less than that. Little sets are used, some scenes are shot against the green screen and most of the effects seem to be incomplete and amateur. <br /> <br /> Looks painful. It's not so much addressed, because we're doing it wrongly running and running, but many of us have continued the progress of this production for a long time and have had a lot of expectations for a fairly low budget. <br /> <br /> When we first believe that movie, when we announced it, Barnum binds to PT's words.
