This movie is like "Flashdance", you know that dance with Jennifer Beals. This movie is surely the most boring movie I've ever seen, because it's not fun. "G.I. Jane" is much better than this movie, but that does not mean much. Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and there is great music and we will see his fight and everything, but it is certainly not very attractive. I really think the idea behind the movie is interesting, but the script is too much and Ridley Scott can not do anything. Well, as I said ... It's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
