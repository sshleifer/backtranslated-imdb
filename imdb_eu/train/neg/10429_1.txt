The first part was in favor, but the last one really is really disappointed. It's funny that the producers did not even get it to the end, and it really showed. What is really sad is that I have to send at least ten comments to send a line. I really did not want to go into ruin to classify my opinion, because the show is not worth the effort. When the first Battlestar galactic came out, I was excited about a better replay, but it was not the first space for pornographic space. They finally cleaned up a bit and really had a fairly straight play, so I saw them again. But to finish the series, it is a god angel to be a cyclone with the sound and six pretty bad.
