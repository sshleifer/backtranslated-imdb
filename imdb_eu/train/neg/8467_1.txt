My friends and I were renting in Blockbuster, because we saw the Nana Guest Name box. This movie does not deny its curriculum. <br /> <br /> The "Land" was lost and it was bold; The performance was mostly dry and unbearable in some parts. The movie does not make any sense. The harsh plot of alien-parasitic infections that human beings has done has been done several times, much better than this script, for example, the invasion of the body snatchers and the faculty. <br /> <br /> If you ever had the misfortune that does not know about this movie, I recommend you to smoke. <br /> <br /> How is it classified as horror film, fear, suspicion, gore, fear or horror film without the usual use of the technique? I do not know, but I still recommend that you still have enough sugars to watch this movie, so it's part You can find fun.
