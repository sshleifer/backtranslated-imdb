If you've seen your friends, the script is very popular. In the last three or four season of friends, they share the same configuration of the comedy. <br /> <br /> The show is about a group of people who have a connection, even when they have young people sharing the same class (about 10 years old). I think years). Now they are thirty-three and they meet again in class. Here the series begins. <br /> <br /> A typical episode, at the same time, deals with several lines. They are usually not connected. Each story is cut in more than one episode. Then they appear in a mixed order. <br /> <br /> These are my problems with the series. As in recent seasonal friends, it is often a stupid setting, as difficult as it is. One of the main characters makes it hard to believe. The situation is exaggerating, as if it were not quite stupid. If you're a fan of your face, maybe you'll like this series. For me it's a great turn for me. <br /> <br /> I started seeing my friends for the first season. Interesting and particularly credible lines of story, with the romance that makes the roots of the characters. The class has no such thing. Characters are often preferred and stereotypes are pushed further. So it's not related to them and they're similar. <br /> <br /> With at least one of your friends, it took several seasons to run out of steam and all of the character's features came out. In class, it seems that before the start of steam exhausted.
