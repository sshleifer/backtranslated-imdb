The argument of 'Games of the House' is the strongest thing: a successful author and psychologist strain a group of criminals, but to find out about the bad part of the emotion they do, they eventually revenge. . Because of this: someone has to take responsibility as the puppets do. Mamet has to be director: Lindsay Crouse has a diverse and stable career of television and film, so it can not always be misinterpreted. It's a quick and funny lady to calculate from a sharp, fresh, and controlled professional, to wear a beige trousers (depending on the change in the clothes she wears three days after, including underwear). But all seem to say that their lines are in the same and more precise way; I think that Mamet does not have a syllabary for his sculptural writing. The effect is imbalanced and destroys the atmosphere of mystery and suspension that he tries to try to try. Sometimes the "House of Games" loses the link between people who actually talk or talk about it, and becomes a plot of land rotation. Clunky vibes'n'oboe's faux-jazz soundtrack does not help either. The final result is that the only entertainment has been to guess the result, and what you do earlier will get bored with robotic bi-dimensionals. And they burn too much !!!
