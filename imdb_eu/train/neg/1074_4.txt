I would never have started this movie and I saw it after 3/4. I lost the last lost end. This movie was disappointing, because it could be much better. It was a pretty atmosphere, a senior theater and director. But a baaaaaad story line, a bad script. I took care of Southern Kenneth Branaghen: it was better than the script. Plots were stupid - people acted in real and unknown ways. Nobody plays out of Hollywood scripts.
