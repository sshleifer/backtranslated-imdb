In Buenos Aires, I was playing "Otro" and I was very disappointed. The movie is very slow (I'm not mistaken, I'm enjoying the slow movies!), You're going to crash into the madman. Everything you hear is breathing all the time with Julio Chavez. Films are badly made, but more importantly, it's an inspirational source. I have nothing to feel for the story or its characters. "El Otro" was only made a film ... without forgetting. I'd recommend this if you'd like to see good Argentine films, search for Sorin movies.
