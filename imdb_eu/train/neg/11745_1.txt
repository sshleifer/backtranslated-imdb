My belief that I did not like music is a very personal opinion, because historical inaccessibility is not. I realize that it is an opera and not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, especially if others comment on it. <br /> <br /> Abbu Abas was the head of this operation. He reorganized 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, one of them was Samir Kuntar, who was able to find a story that looks for a google "klinghoffer samir kuntar". Abbu Abbas was responsible for other terrorist operations, although he never walked on the Akuro Lauro. Did Ben Laden never put the WTC on his shots? <br /> <br /> *** Possible havoc *** <br /> <br /> The actions and reactions of the terrorist films apologize for the horrors that could be experienced, which were always exacerbated and excessive for the Israelis to hurt them. However, they never reflect on the damage caused by the Palestinians to Israel. The film uses Sabra and Chatila's horror images (which are terribly terrifying), and they say nothing, as they believed Israel was responsible, without mentioning the Syrian Liban army. slaughter <br /> <br /> In general, the performance was very bad, but I think what the opera singers can expect? <br /> <br /> I was surprised at how terrorist could pardon the terrorists as a kidnapping of kidnappers killed 400 guilty against innocent armed armed terrorists and would not be sympathetic to Zionism. Imagine who his wife is similar to, shot her husband and spilled her body into the sea to spit terrorists. I hope that no one in the world is as cruel (gesture gesture)
