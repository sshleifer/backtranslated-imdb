"Wrinkle in Time" is my favorite series of my childhood. I have read and read again the times they can count on in the last 35 years. The characters, with all the virtues and defects, are near and loved in my heart. I love the story that I loved very little, I am a wonderful, magical, spiritual. I would say that I was disappointed with this movie would be very great. <br /> <br /> If you have never read the book, I imagine you enjoy the movie. The play is good, it performs special effects for television and the story is interesting. However, if you love books, avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I found this statement on the Wikipedia page of the novel: "In an interview with Newsweek, he said that he was the movie L'Engle." It was a bad thing and I hope it is. "" <br /> <br /> Here again, as another reviewer, I feel the need to read the book again in order to eliminate this movie.
