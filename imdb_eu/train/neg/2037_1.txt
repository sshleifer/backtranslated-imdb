If it had been given a zero, I would change myself and -10. A totally horrifying movie without a movie is making sense. Just PLAIN BORING. Please do not miss out on this. Pleaseee !!! This movie can do well if he represents the true story of the zombie killer, but I did not feel anything I was seeing. Make yourself a leap and rent some classic movies, so it's best to watch the movie you saw 3-4 times than you've watched! I do not understand why people do not even know how to take part in these films. A zombie killer must be called 'Boriac Killer'!
