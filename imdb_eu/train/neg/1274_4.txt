This was about Sam and his wife, glorious Peter Falk and Olympia Dukakis. It would be a movie that deserves to be seen. Instead, Paul Reiser is a vehicle that throws a little Falk. Elizabeth Perkins is also a great movie, but you would hardly know it. I think that Reiser is a huge movie star that is an impression of a good vehicle. It is not. It is still worse for Reiser to try to hire some of the best female actresses on the current screen, and then drop them all in their background. Dukakis has not appeared for the last 15 minutes, but when it does, the screen shines. The story is really Falk and Dukakis, but we're under the strange, stupid and absurd road trip, so Reiser can show how incredibly nice, coveted, and so deep that psychological (wrong!) Vision. . For example, Reiser hopes to "Cassavetes" in a restaurant scene, "I think the laughably false conflicts between Reiser and Falk were so stupid that they were ridiculous."
