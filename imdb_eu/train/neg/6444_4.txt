Most of the university students find themselves lost in the academy bubble, cut off by communities of learning and living. Their conversations are done with classmates and university professors. Steven Greenstreet's documentary is an excellent example of a disillusioned university that judges universities, based on a limited number of their members, based on limited contact. <br /> <br /> It is aimed at a small group of people who portrayed the documentary. It replaces large population groups. As usual, people who shout most get the most attention from the media. In addition to the community condemnation of the film, the documentary was well done. My only conflict is that the feelings and echoes of the movie have been attributed to the whole community, just like few people said. <br /> <br /> Of course, analyzing such discussions and knowing people is important. Considering the differences between the political perspectives, but it is ridiculous to involve the whole community of people in a few communities.
