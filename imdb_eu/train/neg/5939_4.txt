I thought the movie was fine, but it was very disappointed that the true image of his life was not captured. So, my mother was hoping to be a Jamaican girl, she would have a crazy guy. At the start of the movie I only saw the movie was not correct. I just missed the movie from the beginning in seconds. I am very disappointed to see a story about Mark Anthony's biography and Arnold's involvement. I do not know what the writer thought about missing a valuable piece of the movie, I am sure that his mother had a tremendous role in his life. I'll tell you the movie is ok Fla !!!!!!
