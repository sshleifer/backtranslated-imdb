In 2005 I did not enjoy the gore party's "shelter" hit, and most of those hopes were bad or worse. However, "Live Feed" was first entertained for the first 30 days in minutes. It started with a lot of sex and settings, a lot of good deaths related to the Chinese Organized Group and a 7-meter oak factory, what did the guns and heroes of the "heroine" hard-pressed out to save the day ... In this movie, at best I would call it. In fact, the premise of malignant young men dying in a minaret theater porn, I think it's attractive to conceal the mafia. If torture was too long to be fully effective, then my grades would be very different. Unfortunately, most of the crowds are stacked in one single scene, leaving the rest of the movie as a revenge scenario. So, basically, a low-budget "hostel" is just an almost common use of sexually free use, almost constant in the first half of the film ... I would not have had any problems in general.
