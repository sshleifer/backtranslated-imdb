Vijay Krishna Acharya "Tashan" is a hyper-stimulated and stylized product. You are sure to be one of the most elegant films, but in terms of content, even if they refuse people. Why? The movie's script is a 2-year-old baby. The script is king, without good screenplay, the greatest director of all time can not do anything. Tashan produces successful bands, featuring "Yash Raj Films" and Mega Stars. On the ground there is nothing left for you if you have a blank script. Thumbs down! <br /> <br /> Performances: Anil Kapoor, a veteran actress. But how did he accept such a role? Akshay Kumar is an excellent actress, which is the only passion for saving. Kareena Kapoor has never felt so hot. It looks stunning and leaves you, stand up. Saif Ali Khan does not have to get it. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted. <br /> <br /> 'Tashan' is a boring movie. If the movie fails at the box office, you should stay away.
