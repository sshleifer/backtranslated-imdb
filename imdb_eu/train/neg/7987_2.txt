I'm sure "WOAH!" It was one of them. Attraction in 1982 when Epcot opened, but now it's stupid. The message from the movie is topical. Circle-Vision is disoriented. And at the end this horrible song is penetrating. And I really want to have seats installed. After so much walking, all you can do is sit down for a few minutes. And when you hear a movie, it's pretty fascinating to you! Get yourself entertained, right? WRONG! You stay there for 18 minutes in a minute, against a small small railing. Disney should make a new Maelstrom to attract things and replace dark and pleasing movies. YOU HAVE NO. Jump. In fact, you've fallen out of Canada if you have not eaten. Take it directly to the United Kingdom.
