The man was ridiculous. It should be under COMEDIA. Or STUPID It was much easier to realize a bunch of puta. Really I would like you to like anyone interested in this movie. See all of those who are thinking of seeing this "movie", passing some points on the plot. Oh, wait. No one is there There is literally no plot. I think that Casper Van Dien was bored and someone randomly decided to shoot something, and, by the way, he dumped the video. The movie is literally the worst film of all time. Do you not believe me? Go see Do it, man I dare. But be ready to take your eyes out. If you throw a cow out of it, you're very strong and daring.
