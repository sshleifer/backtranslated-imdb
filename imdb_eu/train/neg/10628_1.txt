The so-called "documentary" means that the United States has faked the landing of the moon. Annual right. Everyone who has really studied the case knows different. <br /> <br /> First of all: it's just a proof. When the astronauts were on the moon, they brought LERRO kilos of kilos for geological studies. They spread hundreds of laboratories throughout the world and tested them. And all those who concluded that they came from the same planet, not the earth: the isotopes inside the fundamental elements are different than the ones found on the ground, but similar to the ones in the moon. For example, the theorists of conspiracy never study anything: they only take one thing in their theory and exclude the rest. <br /> <br /> Another disapproval from others says that it was hanging on the ground where they landed their land. IE flag moves. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved with his hand, so he moved. And this proves: although the theorists of conspiracy have analyzed the footage, they would ever see the flag that lasted ASTEON, I.E. The theoretical conspiracies are bad scientists, they are able to fully analyze a subject or only analyze what they have come to it, to lie down and not profit-making (the document is "IE"). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Again, the theoretical conspiracies are wrong (as usual). At night the earth would happen in the desert without a source of light. But I doubt that any theoretical conspiracy has had more than a few days in the basement of the grandmother's Star Treck convention. <br /> <br /> The theoretical hiring declines, BIG TIME. They only want to see That's why all these lies seem to be important, that's it.
