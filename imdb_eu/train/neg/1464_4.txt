I expected to know something about the modern history of the man I did not know, and I could not think of HITLER: THE RIL OF EVIL. Hitler was so hairy with her nephew, threatening to have one of her admirers movie. Hitler held a pistol with his hands to arrest Ernst Rohm. Pardon me to ask, but writers Adolph Hitler confused with Tony Montana with SCARFACE? It's pretty bad, but the whole series of the circuit that really hurt me was missing out on this small series. Germany lost its first war in the world, and the allies' powers were paid by the Germans for high prices. This was an economic environment for the Germans to take on someone - to make anyone regain their pride and that is why they became Nazism. The German insurgency caused by the power of allies seems to fail completely, so there is no way HITLER: The treasure of the evil can be considered a serious historical document, and I did not mention that Himmler and Goering are spectacular. According to their absence <br /> <br /> a small series and a positive point about Robert Carlyle is the title role. Well, his manners are wrong and the voice is very loud (recordings show that Hitler has had a smooth and attractive voice), but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and is able to communicate the charisma of Hitler on the screen. Carlyle's commentary on British media, which plays more than Adolph Hitler's Sparks, does not make sense and is one of Hitler's best performances. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle liked me, but I hate everything else. about this little series and he asked me why he first made it. Nothing is recommended for serious fans of history
