Not surprisingly, she gave up Pamela Springsteen as a full-time photographer; It's a better idea than having a camera behind it. This movie is not without its interesting elements (hell, varicose veins, etc.), it's over the error. For some reason, Angela, the deadly counselor, seems to be the same age at camp. He would like to be a more threatening director of the outdoors at the movies. And then you have a murderous scene. The budget was seemingly small, most of them to run correctly (without any mistakes), even if someone was completely upset in the community toilet. But, in general, there are a lot of movies out there and more fun, seeing your life one and a half hours.
