If I write an opinion about a movie, maybe it will be with me ... but, overall, I hope that I will forget that I only saw it two weeks ago. So why worry? I saw the little movie that I found again, it was fun to watch. I did not expect to be in the room. <br /> <br /> It was not very good, but at least it was not overwhelming ... no mistake. that always shakes me. Lightweight was just sweet ... and if you can not take it, stay in the room for the locker room. I agree with those who advocate this movie, because it is a favorite demographic targeted and it will not be completely bored by an adult. <br /> <br /> It gives some notes from the inside, but nary side dividers. You are sure you are stupid and only entertaining, but at least not sucking (as much as I said). Maybe people are afraid of their sensitive side? <br /> <br /> I have a tendency to qualify the bell curve, so 4.5 or 6 in my book is a very good score. The rendering of the 4 is sensible and will reinforce the assessment at the time of this writing. Making a score of 1 or 10, as far as most of the time have done, the score numbers are absurd. I can not believe that someone who feels strongly about this unforgettable wave (or even trying to write about it) in one way or another. Do I Miss Something? <br /> <br /> Anyway, it must be taken into account that Emma Roberts plays the role of Clairedycat in a pretty clear way. Ariell Kebbel does not disappoint his b * ch role too often. You will also meet Bruce Spence Leonard, although his role is complementary. <br /> <br /> If you are sure if you have an adult you can lose that. But if there's a young girl in your life, rent this movie for him ... and be prepared not to hate (maybe you'll enjoy it).
