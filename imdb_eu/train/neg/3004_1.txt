What a horrible movie. The performance was bad, bad path, bad cinematography, bad management, "special" bad effects. In Slasher you expect a certain level of evil, but the killings were bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the past event that caused the murder lasted 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would end in the end. They would deduct 80% of them and explain what happened. <br /> <br /> Then, the victims invited "meetings" in an abandoned school, because it had all the tools used. One of the victims thought that this was a little bit curious, but they refused to do so and still decided to break it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the killings were so fake that they were almost invisible. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to see this movie if you want to see some breasts and not very good breasts. This movie shows Showgirls with Kane of citizens almost impossible.
