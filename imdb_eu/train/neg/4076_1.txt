This topic is worth a better screenplay and the end result is worth the use of this movie. The script has holes, it was never thought of as a story, but they only had a nightmare chain outfit. The gap and loop of the story line are abundant. The scene that is said to be a victim of his life is that the parents are not dead, and since he was looking for it, the wife is just strange. When he was eight years old, he was written as a therapeutic moment at the head of the shelters at the time of the dead, at the age of eight, "missing". In the real world, knowing that the head of a refugee shelter, on his roof, repaired the kidnapping, what would have been followed by the police would be immediately called to the police. Police issues are not 12-minute segment with Oprah. From then on everything is so short and I can not conclude that it was a mere exploitation in the first 90 minutes. It's fun to condemn this movie. In the end, it seems to come in.
