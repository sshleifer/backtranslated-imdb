I'm looking for the movie of that time, it seems to me very strange, because it's one of the awful videos. Finally, I found it on DVD at the end of last year. It's a very small budget movie. The story is about the tribes of the Amazon forest that are afraid of the devil. Laura Crawford, while working in South America, is a model kidnapped by a group of thugs. They take her to the jungle and Laura is backed by a ridiculous original called "the devil" to make unpleasant things until she's happy. Maidens are chained. The devil eats meat in a terrible way. Peter Weston is a demon huntsman who tries to save and penetrate the jungle.
