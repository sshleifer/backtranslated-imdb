First of all, yes, I'm white, so I try to go clear in the tricky race of the race ... anyway ... Black people black in blacks = BAD but black people bleach "Okay" (it seems we were worth it! !! ). where do i start I'd like to tell you something good about this movie I had to abandon the old comedy scenes: Ice Cube and co. Start fighting with Neo-Nazis really great, really powerful, really angry and scary, and win! neo-Nazi double size :) and behind! Chase is priceless ... This is not a movie about race, tolerance and understanding, it does not deliver ... the movie is a racist movie that confirms all stereotypes, a man who owns himself. She slowly transforms my slack into a skinhead ... I see it just as scary as I can. <br /> <br /> Save your time and misunderstanding, save the image, misunderstood, dull and clearly unbearable. You are within the subject, go and rent American History X, now it's a movie
