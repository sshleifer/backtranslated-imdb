Why? For some reason, there's never been a better theater than singing in Ann Margret's "Bye Bye Birdie" song. Repeats again at the end (in another mood!). Both wonderful. Rent and watch. Even if you see all this. I'm sure, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Everything about the original is very good, but it is not necessary to have a restore. Jason and Vanesa performed wonderful performances, including Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all the actors and singers of this new version were "all", but it is like trying to improve "Casablanca": it can not be done! It's even more annoying to try to review the two, trying to review the mind, and short of being the guilty actress.
