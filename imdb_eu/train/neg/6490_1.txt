Okay ... so I've watched some extravagant movies / jewelry every day. Las Vegas is a fear and anxiety when I think about it. Well, no ... right now, when someone asks me, "hi, what's the worst thing you've ever seen?" I'd like to say Slipstream! And I do not mean "unusual" in a good way. Since the beginning of the film, it was evident that the camera was one of these "trippy effects" film. This means that, like those on the screen, they are like bright images, the people's words and scenes are redone and forward, mixed with the color of the screen, flashing back and forth continuously ... then you have a real performance. People get random rapes, shooter / people, they just say much more strange things, it's sensible. In the absence of a better writing and explanation, you see essentially this "trip" over the whole movie. The thing is, Johnny Depp made Las Vegas and Fear a similar trip to Las Vegas, but the only difference is that the trip was entertaining, not painful! Honestly, I ended up with Slipstream really hard. The brain has a little bit of pain. <br /> <br /> I can see a black film that some of the hues of this movie say that they do not add the feeling of dementia ... blah, blah, blah. It's a point, when you see this movie your brain pain ... it's very sensible, it takes all your concentration to try to remotely try and understand what happens, at the end. happy ending ... and you can say that you were really sitting there! So closing down, if you want to watch a movie, "heck" means loudly and in your head, go ahead and lose an hour and 30 minutes and look at this. > <br /> Mr. Hopkins, while applauding as an actress and I recommend taking your choices under direction ... please do not do that movie again. Next, try to tell more than just a camera technique that allows you to see story-stroke pain.
