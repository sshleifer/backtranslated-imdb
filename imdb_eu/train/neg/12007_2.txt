It's amazing to see how Nikhil Advani plays theater in the theater. I mean ... cast here, the promotion is excellent, there are enough songs and trailers. That's the first day the house is full, but when people go to watch the movie they only realize that the money is not refundable. The whole house is on the first day, the movie comes out next week. <br /> <br /> This movie, inspired by "Love Actually," is not well-managed. They tried to get big stars, but eventually the average performance was achieved by anyone. The stories are empty and cursive, so the viewer can not connect to one of them. It is a disappointment for those who like big stars or Nikhil Advani's success in 'Kal Ho Na Ho'.
