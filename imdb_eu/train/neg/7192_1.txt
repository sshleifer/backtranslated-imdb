For about 5 minutes I was hyperventilating in this movie, trembling and pains. And not in a good way. It's always a good idea to have a story about the idiotic children who make phone calls. It turns out that the psychosis do not like to make phone calls, it's in their door for 2 minutes because Williams kills his father and father. 15 years before going well and guess what? Still calling the phone by calling people. You should always think that the massive murders would be repeated, but not. So, after two hours later, I noticed that there was not too much scream that this movie made me feel like a flabby taste in my mouth and want to take my life. These pieces did not deserve to be disseminated in quality production, the "performance" or the Rutger Haurs career. I love the terrifying horror movies, but it's the most fun piece I've ever seen. Nothing else.
