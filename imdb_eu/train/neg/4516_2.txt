This DVD set, I bought the unseen sight and I did not want it. The script needs a serious rewriting, it seems to be totally unmistakable and more humble to the book. The lighting is awesome, it's really nice, but if you do not forget I'll miss it. The script does not focus on the characters ... there is little access to different characters, it is difficult to distinguish between who they are (especially on the shots - who do not have any ideas that kill them). <br /> </ p> <p> I have long felt the character of a good movie is the responsibility of the characters; If you do not have anything. There was no attention to the characters. You never knew who they were, what they liked ... what they did. The series has a 5-hour duration and is divided into six parts ... Let's take a look at what they would do if the characters had not been detailed all the time --- if they put a lot of filler ... I spent at least an hour as they see the land and on the LOL (I mean, I have to see it again and again ???). I would give it if I had a much higher score, they improved the knowledge of our characters.
