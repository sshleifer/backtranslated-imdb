I never panned a movie online, but I felt it for that, I felt after seeing this. Someone does not appear to be murdered and says to someone: "My relatives have died, so why would I take care of you?" <br /> <br /> Less propaganda, though little, could not do that. It is called "art". Being a child of parents, I was particularly annoyed by the use of deafness. A person who would feel the vibration of this immensity would investigate, would ignore it. <br /> <br /> The word "txutzpah" is conceived. As a writer, there are some subjects that I would stay short: the Holocaust; this is. These filmmakers would not be so arrogant (and inept).
