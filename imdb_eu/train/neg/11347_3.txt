Cult of the Cobra DVD is available as a movie that is worthy of today's movie. Unfortunately, that does not mean much. <br /> <br /> It has the competent competences of the secondary responsible, just as it might have expected in these cases. It is directed efficiently, in the background of the studio's soundtrack and standing. It's okay, but it's too drawn and it's full of just 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> For example, the first IG anti-bullying double attack was probably too much. <br /> <br /> Julia, a business that decides to marry Pete rather than marry Tom is worthless. Tom immediately falls in love with Lisa and never lets Julia be jealous (or even). <br /> <br /> Julia enters into a major plot as a 'feminine intuition'. development, but not. Likewise, the research on Petek Kobra's studies on cultures and the suspicions that Tom's briefly fall into have no purpose whatsoever on the screen's time. <br /> <br /> These are the symptoms of the underlying problem. The movie is structured as a mystery, but it's not. As soon as the curse is pronounced, we know exactly what the story is about, so we must carefully explore what we already know. <br /> <br /> The endless one is a particular lama. Julia is just threatened accidentally. Lisa does not want to kill him, he must be in the wrong spot in a bad time. When Tom reveals it during his rescue, it is not clearly threatened or not. Then, it deprives any of the previous victims in any way. <br /> <br /> The bad pipsarchy of a story, as there is no such incident, I wondered how I had to move it to the ground. studio heads Then it happened to me. Someone said: "Val Lewton was a very successful film at RKO, so why do not we create such a thing?" <br /> <br /> Cobra de la cultura is a model in Cat People: mysterious, confusing, Shifting, woman falls in love with the hero, apparently cold, kills people, spies suspicions of her heroine and dies at the end. But 'modeling' does not mean 'good as' - a vast margin. It copies it, but does not understand what it copies. <br /> <br /> Lewton is obviously trying to try a small and suggestive style, but this approach does not penetrate the story. Lisa is not Irene. It wants to be strange and mysterious, but it's not mysterious. After the first attack in Asia, we will see it immediately, so it will soon appear in New York. There is no doubt about its purpose. Nor is ambiguity really becoming a snake. <br /> <br /> Then we get through the night gimmick, not one, but rather two buses. Likewise, the managers do not understand what the "buses" do, and, nevertheless, they happen to stalkers and not that person. "/> <br /> <br /> Cat People's Echoes Evolve Give a little distinction between Culture Cobra, but pay attention to the gap between hijacking and imitation. <br /> <br /> Plagiarity It may be the most honest form of punching, but I would be uncertain whether Lewton or Tourneure particularly caressed their time.
