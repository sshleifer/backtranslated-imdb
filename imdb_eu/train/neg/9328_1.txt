Lucky I got a pinch for a short, short-lived "short film" from Texas Artisan Entertainment a week before I got into the video clips and I said ... I've rarely laughed so hard in my life. Megabomb's frightening outburst and "The worst movie clown ever" title robbing KILLJOY for Full Moon fiasco for unstable fiasco (I'm sure he's been so much afraid of many of us!) It was filmed on DV, and it's not really a bad "look" for digital sensuality, but the boy never fails in every other place ! <br /> <br /> The story (lightweight and, if applicable), an executive (Ken Hebert, co-wrote and co-produced) Tracy (Amanda Watson) skeptical colleague and Mark and Susan married couple (Hank Fields and Chris Buck) on a weekend getaway, in a lonely farmhouse located 12 kilometers from the nearest town. On the way, they were hanging on a bar (Melissa Bale) picking up a hitchhiker / guy, where night-time fires are made about a killer criminals of the same forest. Pot-smokin ?? friends disappear one by one; only the pieces of the dolls left behind tell them their story of fate. <br /> <br /> No movie killer will appear in the movie. near the end, and there is no apparent demonic image of that demonic in the video box (moreover, being a slave of obesity). He walks an hour in the woods, especially when cutting wood and cutting nursery. I can not say enough bad things about castration, especially with both boys and the hitchhiker chick, who give bad conversations in times of excitement and exaggeration. It does not really help the script completely, and totally suspended suspense, originality, intelligence, general coherence or humor. These days I would continue to see how this movie is impossible, how many tracking errors and how the whole production is amateur, but I have tried to say that the entire package is a sign of Boy-This ... It is somehow overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> Also, SICK was released in the US (SERIAL INSANE CLOWN KILLER). Currently GRIM WEEKEND (its original title) is cataloged below. <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10
