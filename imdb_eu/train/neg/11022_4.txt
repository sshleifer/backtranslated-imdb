On his way, Mister Foe (originally, and Hallam Foe, I can not see his title as "mister") is a good performance. Jamie Bell, Hallam, a physically attractive voyeur / creep, and Sophia Myles, Kate, as their kinky teen sex and fantasy kinky, are convinced. The problem is when you try to connect with your business in real life. A young man who looks at the intimate details of people's lives, like Hallam, should win the dough. In a chain situation, a woman would be terrifying and terrifying - probably the police would call her. <br /> <br /> These things are not, however, what happens with the movie. Mother mother, Hallam, is killed and married to a married woman with her father. Hallam, of course, hates his housekeeper and knows. He has sex with him. Kate is a type of professional that places Hallam's dishwasher and makes sex games. It's like a born mother. They all end up happily finding Hallam "his" "problems" and breaking one after another. The problem is that he does not always work in this way, especially since nobody cared for it. In Virginia Woolf, the end is fruitful because of the intensity of emotional revelation. In Mister Foe, emotional revelation does not really happen.
