I have seen all four of this series. Each one goes away from the books. This is still the worst. My problem is that it does not continue in the book with the title below! Directors and producers should name another thing than Love's Abiding Joy. Similar to this book, the names of some of the characters are similar to this movie (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). Children's names / age / sex are wrong. The whole story is not in the book. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it to Janette Oke, his books and his fans, that it is not correct to produce a title movie. Music is too loud. Actors are not convinced: they lack emotions. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family movie, this can be done. It's clean Do not watch if you expect the condensed version of the book. I hope that it will be the latest movie in this series, but I doubt it. If more films have been made, Michael Landon, Jr. and others will be closer to plot and story lines. They are great books and, in good condition, they will make excellent films!
