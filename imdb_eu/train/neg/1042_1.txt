First, write the script in a napkin. Who needs more than this? In the end we're not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Then get amateur agents. It's good for the rumor of the festival. After all, who owns crafts for people who need them? Then hire a filmmaker not hired. You will see, if it is well-lit, it does not look "real" and people of the festival will not like it. Who needs professional photography? After ten years, it has not been a camera for your camera operator. Your film is going to be a bit annoyed, that the projection of the festival mixes "reality" and ensures that real people empty their seats, even though more intellectuals cite "genius". They did not think this was a dream time. <br /> Once you have done this, buy your card Sundance, the Bad Film of Sundance. <br /> <br /> What is a dull waste?
