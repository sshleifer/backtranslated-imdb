I am very surprised that the positive comments were four friends that we saw in a performance and we all walked. We personally felt that we could see it slowly and the entire movie could not sit. And we really tried to stick. In fact, the group who liked it, due to the experiences of alienation of sexual orientation represented during the school years, did not like to be identified. :( <br /> <br /> That said, it's very good that this movie has resonated with many people in the boards and reviewers, which is the beauty of the subjective film.):
