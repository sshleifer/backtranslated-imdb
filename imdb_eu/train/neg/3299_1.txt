I have to be one of the worst movie I have ever seen. I really expected a bad movie, but they caught me unexpectedly or not. It's a traditional story that includes all the clich√©s. <br /> <br /> The conversation is so less written, when you really laugh, when the actors of semi-descent are trying to make a real sound. The picture is not very good, the music is so bad, it really annoys me, the actors are not trying too, because the screenplay is nearly impossible for people who are 30 years old and can expect that they call action. The scene really lacks the "action" itself. <br /> <br /> I do not know why these types of filthy movies follow, who finances this shit? Where is the projection And why do these actors take up this impossible writing? <br /> <br /> There are about a million Hollywood films in this genre, although they do not want to get to theaters, even though Straight To Video looks at getting a professional look. <br /> <br /> I can not say anything except what the title says about something positive, I stole 2 hours of my life.
