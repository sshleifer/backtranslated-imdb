WOW! I did not know that someone made this movie! it's horrible! I have written 5 figures why I do not want to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Number 1: "The greatest rave ever" where is that rave? I could see some people dancing. <br /> <br /> When they are in radius 2, blood can be seen everywhere everywhere, not people, two damaged carp and a stage ... and what do they do? They drank! <br /> <br /> 3. The worst actor I've ever seen! Captain and his team ... horrible! <br /> <br /> When a person draws an ordinary gun, he shot it almost 30 times without recharging it! <br /> <br /> 5. I did not know how to fight as a pro every person in the world! It must be a new thing. <br /> <br /> I wonder what the product was thinking about! "It will be a great success, it will be classical." I am sure, however, that you do not see this movie, it's time worn. My eyes are still spilled!
