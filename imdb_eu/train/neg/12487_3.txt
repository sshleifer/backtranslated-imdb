This movie was a great despair. <br /> <br /> I take the view of critics. This is not material without reaching the actors level; Here, the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are not the level of material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were just as big as Davis and Cagney, and a look like it happened tonight - classical of all time. Davis demonstrates that his talent does not prove to be a comedy (that is, the only comedy that considers it convenient!) Davis's unnoticed behavior, but there is no shadow in Colbert's play. It happened one night. Cagney was a great actress, Davis seemed a mere symbol. The script offers some good lines and gags, but emotion gives a better drama than the comedian. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is part of the problem, that is, as distribution of Davis and Cagney seems to be appropriate. It's a drama rather than comedy. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson carries out similar roles throughout his career, handling very similar materials. In a quite typical medium Eugene Palette gives a respectable performance. Like ancient relics of the West, Harry Davenport is a very good thing to do. But in one of his worst performances, William Frawley is quite disturbing. His ongoing reference to the fictional character's police is an effort to irony. <br /> <br /> I really love each of these performers, and it is shameful, as a team, that they do not get chemistry and that the wife's wedding is in the C.O.D.
