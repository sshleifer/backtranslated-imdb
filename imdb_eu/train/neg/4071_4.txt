A young man kills a young woman for no reason. He denounces the man's brother, but soon escapes. After escaping, a seemingly innocent man will remove three victims and soon enters his girlfriend on the plot. If this is not enough, the situation goes down. <br /> <br /> This film had good and bad aspects. Her most powerful part was Emily Haack's main actor. Although the fair amount of this film has not been bare, he presents himself with a dignified and very strong character. I have no reason to see that experience can not be taken and become a career in some way. I was convinced that he was a rude man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Flawless nudity (male and female), coprophagia and extreme anal-violence are not distant. My horror movie is like a bit of a limitation, and this is not entirely ignored, taking Gomorrah on the way. Maybe it was too much, but I think they got what they were looking for. <br /> <br /> But now the parties are negative. First and foremost, this movie is a small budget and shows the quality of the film. I can not help - the plot was decent, good performances and some scenes, the film with a lower quality film was really disturbing (realistic feeling). So, I'm not putting off low-power equipment. I'm going to be surprised by the use of bad selections in the shots. Without a doubt, I do not know (if you do a plumping movie) the footage of a cemetery. I do not know why, and I began to blend in a very faithful way at this time, because it was so long and absurd. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with the title too. Here is the idea of ​​deceiving people to think that this film was related to the classic "I Spit on Your Grave". Now it seems that a line means that the main character is the daughter of another movie. And the issues are very false (men take revenge on men). But there was no strong connection and the reason for choosing this title was that the video store client was thinking of getting a sequel. This was misleading and ignorant. <br /> <br /> My last main complaint is that this plot does not make sense. Not a bit too much. A woman has died early for no reason. A prisoner finds time to catch people without torture (without cause) because they harmed his girlfriend? The good and very bad man himself goes without explanation. Similarly, the female lead (Haack) becomes a normal person who is too cruel and sadistic, for no reason, and for the most part most of them only marginally meant people (they are a sexually active drug). It's wrong, but it's worthless because it's worth torturing. <br /> <br /> Do not let this title foolish, or claim that it's a terrific movie. Yes, some scenes were amazing, but most of the movie is sad and you want to sleep. In the video store or on Netflix, continue browsing. Or rent, and sit and approach for a few hours. You have been warned
