This movie is just a second star, I work in the city center and I've seen it destroyed. the effects were pretty good. I've never heard the most expensive Korean movie. Being the most expensive and absolutely horrible is wasting money. I rented it, I did not complain too much about what I complained about, but a couple of hours I will never return. Plots holes are abundant. awesome performance I do not recommend it for a short time to see this time. If your friends want to see this, run away. I can not stress enough that this movie was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Where did the second dragon come from? why did not it appear earlier? How did the dinosaurs get their salts just 500 years ago?
