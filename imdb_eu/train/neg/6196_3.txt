I watched this movie at the Rotterdam Festival (January 06) and I followed the debate between the director and the public. Many people were surprised and protested. It will get a lot of negative criticism. But the world is such a cruel, and it's not fun. People do not like it. This does not mean that the movie is bad. I see the difference. Do not shoot a messenger that shows us our hubble outside the world! However, I think the movie is bad. The film is technically good. Plans and beautiful scripts, best music, excellent actors. The director wants to make a psychological film, psychology is a bad quality. To describe this powerful violence is not art. Art would be a powerful description of psychological process behind this violence. How is a shy boy coming to this cruelty? The director intends to describe it, but this is not good. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> The director has used people several times with the word "selfishness", for example, referring to the teacher. Only: this teacher was not selfish, the only role was someone, the care of their students, and their script worried. I think it's simple to call it selfish. The atmosphere of the country is horrible and the mother has made terrible mistakes ("do you leave me?") But it does not make me believe it can cause much pain, the shameful boy comes with such amazing things. Indeed, reality is a much more complex way, describes this film? and needs much better description. It would be interesting: how does it work? Describe me the process, please understand. <br /> <br /> At the end of the sentence, the director said to live in a different way. It was another extreme, and he reminded me that the director and screenwriter are bad psychologists, encouraging black / white thinking. The relationship between violence and film has been demonstrated. The use of such violence is right. There are black / white thinkers in the world that cause a lot of war and misery. I hope this film will not be successful.
