I can not really understand how this amazing movie can be given to more than one star ... How do you like a delayed movie, where the scenes of abusive animals are real? I do not imagine any imagination of the terrible pain that innocent and innocent lifestyles have experienced ... Jesus ... What kind of torture would they torture them as "human" for no reason, or just money? I tell you, the director is mentally retarded or just is the "heart" monster with stones. Or both. He really deserves to cut his hands and live alive. <br /> <br /> There are several incredibly barbarous shows, especially those that can be sensitive to children: a real frog is alive, the fish are sadistically boys. and turned to the water, a dog is beaten, the birds are thrown into the water ... <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible; It must be the worst and most accomplished movie ever, called "Cannibal Holocaust" or so forth. I never saw them anymore and I did not buy any movie without a film. Nobody wants to miss out on time, especially if movies are really great there, where all the animal-abuse scenes are played. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, only a few people liked this one. It's natural, it's the worst film ever, so it's not a success. I hope that such a backward director realizes that acts of barbarous acts against cruelty and non-violent anti-animal animals are never praised and will present scenes of animal abuse in subsequent films. I truly believe that everything they give what they give what they give! There will be one day, the "humans" will feel the same pain that is delayed and cruel to others. <br /> <br /> That, however, is surely my 'negative' review. I do not usually like to comment on the movie, but this time I could not close it. I really needed to interrupt the abuse of animals!
