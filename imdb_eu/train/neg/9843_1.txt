I really hate Robert De Niro. The movie is stupid with an awesome performance (of course, not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma, his mafia movie must always perform as Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). De Palma's Mission: I Love it Impossible (1996). De Niro worked twice in Palma, Greetings and The Wedding Party. Even if the wedding party was OK (I did not see greetings). <br /> <br /> The script is very bad and shameless. There is no scene to be able to smile sometime. The movie was a fun style to be "Be Black baby" a strange scene and I also do not like the scene of a man's sexual organ. So, it's one of the worst movie I've ever seen! the worst I hate.
