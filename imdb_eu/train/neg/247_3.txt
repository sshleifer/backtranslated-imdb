At night, at 9:30 p.m., he was accompanied by a friend's camping trailer and South Park (a new section). The thing is that in my country, South Park was airing at 10:30 and we decided to kill time with the show now airing, watching the Father of the Church. I will only say the passages I have seen. For the first time I saw it, it was not empty and I found it raw, so I thought, "Holy, tomorrow I have a game of football, so I need to see the stupid cartoon." But yesterday, I wanted to give him the second chance of the Father's Voice. I think the Simpsons is a complete incarnation. However, instead of lions, the character sets yellow. <br /> <br /> I ask the second thing why I got TV-14 grade. Simpsons seems very ordinary, and in this show, the only real ordinary is with real homosexual (unfunny) jokes. The Simpsons are also much stronger (Halloween specialties) and raw. Also, I heard that the series's creator was targeted by Shrek 2, I've got some good news: Shrek 2 has a better way, and I think that this family was too much. However, I must admit that Father's Father smiled (even if he laughed) three or four times. <br /> <br /> With all that, Father does not care. I do not hate it, but I do not like it either. I've seen better the "Simpsons". <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
