STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> The new American military has launched a new major aviation aircraft. Avoid perception like any other. He steals the undeniable pilot of Steve Touissant and the plot will rescue the United States government with him. So, John Sands (Seagal, the other?) Are obliged to send him to a good man, to stop him, to free himself from an arrests center, to erase all the criminal information he had learned over the years. <br /> <br /> I told the attack that I had left in force when I checked out all the post-production manipulation, and I confirmed that it was abusive, and all the negative reviews and user ratings were abolished. I thought. However, I decided to give FOF that Shadow Man (the director himself) was not bad and what a hell was Seagal my favorite star action once and maybe he might just have made a great movie again. I was such a stupid man. <br /> <br /> Doubtlessness, rumors against air-star fighters, huge camera work, inexpensive production costs, unknown, Seagal's trademark and sleep-inducing scenes. Landless land <br /> <br /> Fortunately, his next film, Behin Behin Hood (that is, I'll skip), apparently marks the end of his contract with Sony, does not mean more action on the lens of Europe than one of these horror movies and his next movie Prince of It could be a return to the Pistols theater. Hell, ahead of him and before Stallone (Rocky Balboa.) <br /> <br /> This is not an angry flight. It's not fun too. Although it is a flight that does not fall on the ground. *
