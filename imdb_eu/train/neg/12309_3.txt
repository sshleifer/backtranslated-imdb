This was a great movie. Bearing in mind the material - the life of the army is always a laugh - and the star should have a fall in the decline of the movie. In most cases, laughter was worth a couple of. Steve Martin is much more fun than this, and Dan Ackroyd seems to have to take on dramatic roles to keep up the Robin Williams challenge and win one of the Oscars.
