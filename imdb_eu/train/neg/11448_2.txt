This movie is not as bad as "Stranger perfect", but it's not fun. Can not paste into a comedy type; He went down from SNL, Adam Sandler-esquire, romantic, little boy, slapstick, "Loser" (movie) in the types of comedies. It seems that although there are some fun and entertaining moments (downhill in the hill), nobody was really funny or outstanding at all. "Schindler's list" was more fun (and it felt shorter). She never knew that Andy Samberg was a loser of secondary school, university education, or just a loser at home, with Sissy Spacek, in her worst role. And poor Ian McShane, if I want to nominate a serious actor, is shocked to read the camera. The story is dragged and is completely predictable until the end (internal events are not for Adam Sambergen's mom to see). Do not spend any money on this movie and perhaps Lorne Michaels will advise you and start producing quality (Yes, it's Wayne's World and Tommy Boy movies).
