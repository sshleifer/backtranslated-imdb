It is impossible for me to consider this movie. I did not try, do not think ... but I sat down, they are at the low-grade VHS store, and I see the opening ... and suddenly I was five years old again and I see and keep all of my Care Bear. The film is open and eager for the heart. <br /> <br /> I see this movie objectively with BIZARRE baby merchandising pets and prehistoric babies with a story that is thin and wicked, and not interesting animations. However, my age is five years old, "Yay! Care Bears!" every time I think about it. So, I would only recommend (cautiously, contemptuously) only for those who have seen the movie for the first time and have called for an incredible power of nostalgia (as I am) or a bad / strange looking intentionally cynical / gen-X / Y (this movie It is ... definitive category). For a compelling movie or family health entertainment, you can continue searching.
