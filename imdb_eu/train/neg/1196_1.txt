How can a movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel not have any fun? Believe it or not "Bunny House" made it better and more fun. Fortunately, the holidays have been a good holiday and they have made some money - this movie is embarrassed. Klixea is from beginning to end. Klixe works well with a script, or at least with an idea. This movie is used as clicks by using clues, rather than ideas or scripts. It uses the character of the actors before the characters develop. Bad, dull and rubbish. Now, apparently, I have ten text lines to make a comment. Really Why? As an IT operator manager, this is an example of sloppy coding.
