Slaughter High is slammed in the 80's by itself flick. A prank comes out of his hand, leaving the guy who is terribly smoky. A few years later, the geek man returns and the people who hurt him dies. Now the story can be interesting and very fun, but this horrible movie is different from the rest of the 80's, with errors and errors of humor. <br /> <br /> The effect is horrible. However, it is not so bad at all as a suspect. Although it does not help all the characters in the movie are so rude and hardly familiar. Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is the chief of all responsible for all of them, and that's why we are the only one to share compassion and roots. It's worth mentioning, geeky guy is almost geeky and I think stereotyped geeks himself rude and maddened just are totally antagonized to his own geeky, so he is guarded by anybody who gets boys? <br /> <br /> There is a lot of hilarious unwanted laughter. Munro's acting talent is not quite unfathomable, that is, it puts it at the same level as the enormous piece. However, the best time to play is the fact that the movie Munro, which is in the mid-eighties, is easily seen as a teenage teenager. Later, later, Munro is playing around his real age, but the rest are not as adults. This is a song that sings well, with the horny thrash of heavy metal, laughter, and a screaming voice, "I will give you." What is being said, Slaughter High really is not very slash flick very good, but bad entertainment has a value for entertainment. Maybe it's crucial for hardcore slasher lovers, but do not expect dilemma, suspense or credibility about it. Amazing!!!
