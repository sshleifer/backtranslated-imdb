It's not "Ulli Lommel's movie" who has met me with hope, but I must admit that ZODIAC KILLER has come under the least hope. There is a new trend towards the use of cinematic video for premier film projects, which means that it is very good for them to spend their job without spending expensive films. Many of these young filmmakers were also aware of the idea of ​​filtering the finished movie to showcase qualitatively similar to celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Non-video digital video only works for "mockumentary" style, since it's never a look like a video. It is the main problem with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie is like watching a daytime killer about a killer. She does not want to watch the movie. And even undeniable, Lommel NO is a young filmmaker. He needed to know better. You should know that it is almost impossible to create videos of horror (or even suspense!). For the love of God, he has directed the guy since the 60s! It can only be a director who has failed to improve over the course of more than 40 years. He also wrote the script for luck! So you can expect mixed behavior that is nothing, at least in a realistic way that will leave your behavior reasonable and least satisfied. Please ask this movie. Then you will thank me.
