This movie is awesome. Warm combat scenes or not, the performance is really bad, as your lines are reading from the card. All line-ups with a painful line sent. Think of a high school game and see the lack of smoothness with the actors' interaction (by stopping the lines of different characters from strangers to other lines). If all the movies are in action, this can be overwhelming, but a lot of movies include plot setup and Family Guy styles, shameless cutouts (O, wow, they're wrong). I suppose they want to be fun with them, but it has just come as a high school student or college entry student to enjoy a fun YouTube chat on the afternoon in the afternoon. <br /> <br /> Now fight scenes. They are not very bad, considering the quality that is seen in other parts of the film. There is no doubt that there is no doubt that anyone who is not close to the levels indicated by other posters (Nothing Unlike the Master of Drunks). Fights have a lot of feelings that are played out, and those who have participated have cut many different positions that have different positions. <br /> <br /> This is the only reason to see this movie if you are a friend of a very cheap and productive company. What kind of boy can you ask? Oh, he wrote, directed, produced AND saw the same Middle School masterpiece.
