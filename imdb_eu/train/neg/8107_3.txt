This movie is pretty boring. Trying to keep looking at is completely blank, but they did not succeed. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is Lena Olin: she works for her work. character, but Day-Lewis wore most of his lines. <br /> <br /> It's clear how Kaufman shot it. Bouncing between home / marriage problems and political crises does not match. Character attitudes change without explanation. Disconnected
