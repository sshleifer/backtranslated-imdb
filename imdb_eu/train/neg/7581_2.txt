I watched this movie on the other day of the school class and I did not see Almodovar before watching a movie but I was expecting it. Unfortunately, it came to be an inexpensive movie, because laughter had only a couple of boredom for two hours. High Heels is just a separate collection of random scenes that can work their own films separately, but in no way have they added any meaningful in their entirety. <br /> <br /> Or so I thought. Then, the next day, my film teachers gave the entire season of the room all the hidden hidden details, such as the stereotyped dancers of Flemish, who had a murky backdrop behind a scene with no personality. Spain has been developed under the fascist rule as a nation. Apparently, the whole movie has visual tricks and small references, as well. <br /> <br /> Very well, but you know? Still a bad movie. They need more than a depth and complexity for a deep film. You still have to pay attention to the audience, but the audience is interested enough to take care of the tricky basements. High Heels give us off-beat rare characters, but keeps them, especially in everyday situations, with other films recycled, and Almodovar seems to be using them for any kind of point. What is significant, for example, when the hitchcockian happens to the end of the movie, the surprise character revelation? Why is that too? Please, amaze you <br /> <br /> There's a fun scene with news issues. And that is the only entertaining moment. The rest of the film is nothing more than meaningless references and visual references that seem to be just as good as Pedro Almodovar. Regardless of what a movie teacher says about, it's more than just a deception of a good movie.
