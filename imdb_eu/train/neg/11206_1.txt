I never had the greatest pastime of Geroge Macdonald Fraser Flashman on paper. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see that Richard Lester, who directed Royal Flash, also saw three / four musketeers. Although Fraser's pretty good. <br /> <br /> It's not Royal Flash. <br /> <br /> The movie was released for 12 years and I was no longer enthusiastic. He read all Flashman articles until then, and A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel got intoxicated (I'm still, but he never really gave up after that). <br /> <br /> What a disappointment (I saw it again at age 20 on TV and it seemed worse). <br /> <br /> A sharp booklet is not transferred to the screen. The comedy of the flashman character did not seem to me to handle it in a unique way, imagining that it was parodying a group of high school students. Duel and fence was horrible and dramatic. <br /> <br /> Looking back at the melee of the eye, the movie failed to exploit the live satire choices of the first movie of the Zendako prisoner. <br /> If you have read the book and have not seen the movie, I can only say that the movie ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg to make fast friends and play Rudi's newly invented game: Russian Roulette. <br /> <br /> Pathetic betrayal of all the books. <br /> <br /> My comments would be more correct if I watched the movie lately, but I'm glad I do not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Roger Moore made all the wonderful films of James Bond.
