I rented this movie in Netflix after winning all the Oscars to find out if it was really good. <br /> <br /> The portrait of a Hurt Locker soldier is very real (mostly). In Iraq The film is about a bold soldier who solves adrenaline by taking risks and seizing bombs at Will James. <br /> <br /> I think this film, in my opinion, is the director and director of the film. This movie has no plot of light or other films like Black Hawk Down. He tries to make this movie in characters and their attitude is different from the war. Bigelow works well for the attention of the characters, but it seems that a lot of points in the film are dragging conversations. Hurt Locker has a 131-minute lead, but feels like a 3-hour movie. <br /> <br /> A movie scene was horrible and it ruined the perfect movie credibility. It was unrealistic and it was very long. <br /> <br /> In general, I thought that this film was OKAY, but on the 6th of the 7th it was because I received the Best Picture Award. At the Oscars. I thought this movie could be much better. Saving privacy lost Ryan's best Picture, but it was much better than this. It's worth noting that only Black Hawk Down 2 wins the Oscars. Honestly I do not know how to win the best picture. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a war movie to complete, rent Black Hawk Down. This movie will be forgotten within a year.
