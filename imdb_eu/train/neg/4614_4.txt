Remember that the movie was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. It's not worth it because it's deserving to be worthy of being credible behind the creative team or behind the creative team, but it is unveiled at Prizzi Honor in every category. Some, the Hollywood pioneer John Huston, was lost in his career, but I did not buy it. Only the last year was UNDO VOLCANO, the dark character set in Mexico, which he had ever made. Prizzi's Honor, a movie full of stars, good intentions and a good script, proves a great imbalance. <br /> <br /> A general tone and drawing of a gangster in love with a woman. hit-man Hollywood pre-defined curiosities by Hollywood's early 90's, but the scripts are self-confused, motivations are deactivated and, in general, the story is not what we want to be: romantic comedy. Jack Nicholson (who does the accent of Brooklyn, who works well with De Niro, but Jack's Jack does not think it's convincing) and Kathleen Turner seems like a paycheck in the main roles, practically practically moving through some movements. On the other hand, Anjelica Huston improves better, but her performance is sabotaging the motivations of her character: she begins to suffer the victim of her father-in-law's disapproval, bet on her ex-husband, and then becomes a vengeance. a plate <br /> <br /> The colors of the film were cleared just like they had done at the beginning of the Sixties and Huston's direction is another interesting thing. It's a promise behind the story, and perhaps it could be better for a director to be admitted to something better, but it's like a movie that looks like what's left.
