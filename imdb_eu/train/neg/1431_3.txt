!!!!! SPOILER POSSIBLE !!!!! <br /> <br /> Archie Gray's Owl in English is a story that raises the Indian as a story that this would be humorous. In fact, I would say the only way to treat such a movie is to treat a beautiful man as a comedy for the public. However, Richard Attenborough does something like a crime, making GRAY OWL a serious drama. Even worse, he made a very serious film. Pierce Brosnan does not lack the character of the title role, and Owl Gray and Pony (Annie Gaupeau made of wood) lack a romantic infrastructure on the screen. But being correct with castles does not help the script that Archie describes as unfortunate, that everyone has to deceive the belief that he is an American American. Producers and screenwriters have made major mistakes due to Archie's English-language film center. That's why I wrote that "a possible spoiler" is not revealed until late in the English title of the film's title, but it is obvious that everyone who watched this film was previously aware that there was no surprise involved. <br /> <br /> Yes, I agree with all that the landscape is beautiful and deep. the ecologic message that is not new concept. Theodore Roosevelt XX. The first century environmental ecologist was really important. And remember that SOYLENT GREEN (and possibly BIKE ITZULIA wanting to have a green message) except green email, is not a great ecological film. In particular, GRAY OWL has taken on a serious problem with environmental awareness and, therefore, GRAY OWL had a serious problem in finding a distributor.
