For a painless movie science to work properly, it must be really innovative or very good. This movie is not. Be sure there is a pseudo-original twist because the tip is a toxin that is dead and not due to illness, but this is very small. There is an angle of the Government conspiracy, protagonists crossed with personal experience ... <br /> <br /> And the problem of this movie is that the human being is not affected by the disease. Although he is a person who is still a merciless person, he is not. The film without pity does not make sense. The other characters are so cookie cutter ridiculous. Subplots are mixed and annoying. The sadest thing is that the movie is very flat, even though it is a simulated material. The movie is 45 minutes long and it's worth seeing.
