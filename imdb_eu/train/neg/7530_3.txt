I found this movie to be boring, monotonous and very interesting because I was quick and superficial with the "fastest" fastness, because it was not a general story. Following these characters with abusive events, bad postures and bad news, it's not an idea of ​​an interesting and interesting movie, and I'm very tired of the "note" issue and I could not wait. In fact, I stopped almost halfway. The whole movie seemed vain and seemed, and the characters were mostly depressive and unpleasant, although acting was good. A small movie with small intentions and small appeals - I apologize, but I did not do it with myself, and I love good and small movies! I just did not see that, though I continue to see that hope and trust will be this. I was disappointed, especially when two reviewers put them into the "Top 10 of the Year" list. I would gladly recommend "The House of Sand" - now it's a good little movie!
