The worst film with Burton seems to make it worse with each film he is directing. An amazing clich√© full of clicks is the first of the most milestone aspects of this film. This is when each type of movie takes place, it is certain that someone will hear you hear "the gun has lost!" so that anyone can know it. Carter is really horrible and Wahlberg can not play correctly and be compelling. Very beautiful effects and photography, but the mold of John Williams, bad music by Burton's Elfman. Heston appears in the empty scene to throw away the most significant phrase of the first movie. Very bad results. <br /> <br /> If other people would also see "Sleepy Hollow", they will surely realize, as I have, the quality of Burton's movies. I've heard that Burton was the director of one of these specific projects, in which case his opinion should be questioned. But I think that he has slipped any apparition that could have preceded him in all his career; proof is in the movies. In the book "Sleepy Hollow", he could not decide what film he was doing, a comedy or a real horror movie, and it was believed by the British people's actors (Chris Lee, etc.). A kind of monster rally movie (they are never scary, horror fans know). The film could not have been a schizophrenic because of the horror or comedy, and they were not developed to smooth both styles. "Planet of the Apes" is much the same as science fiction, such as "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash". He has also fallen into the big "big" directors to meet all possible audiences. Speak to Burton, if you're out there, pick something up and do it right, or use some styles to see together (like "Mars Attacks" or "Beetlejuice") or retire, because people like it. I will not go to your movie enthusiasts.
