B best film. The sound effects are pretty good. Lame concept, decent execution. I think it's a rent. <br /> <br /> "You put a bit of olive oil in your mouth, keep it from the poison, cut the bite and suck pois. Tommy will be fine." /> <br /> "You're next to your cell phone, when Harris calls me! " "Give it a fire extinguisher." <br /> <br /> "We need weapons - weapons - where are the silvers? Everything is this. Sporks!" <br /> <br /> Dr. Price is the snake expert. <br /> <br /> Local ER manages rigidly rims. Triple city in all alerts.
