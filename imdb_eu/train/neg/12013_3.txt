I should think that any good movie with Mrs. Poltergeist is not. It really starts well, but the first murder scene is a movie that you see during the movie you're watching. There are people sitting in a movie theater. An Audience Girl was so annoying that I would turn it on and I would squeeze it. A little strange, but very far away.
