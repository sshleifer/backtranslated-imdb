Before looking at this movie, check out the comments on film events, especially in the case of 7-8,000 Muslims shot by Srebrenica buses and Serb paramilitaries. The documentary is also made up of several American institutions for the Serbs. Check out the movie critically and read the comments before. Most reviews argue that the documentary is far from their arguments, even though they raise questions about the wise wisdom surrounding the war. Stephen Holden's NYTimes review "will not be labeled as pro-Serb documentary," but it would be a question of the presentation of factors, many of them taken from trusted sources and the absence of these events by switching to the Serbs. I do not recommend you to watch this document, but I have to be careful with a critical look at it (at all times).
