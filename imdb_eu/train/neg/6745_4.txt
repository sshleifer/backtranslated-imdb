It's a low-budget "Scream" style. A new "Maddy" worker is named in an unnamed office where he contacts and starts contacting his "Chris" partner. In a hot tub party, Chris and his friends will convince Maddy of "Murder Club". Maddy loses and someone is dead. <br /> <br /> The movie looks good and there are the necessary conditions for this genre and budget (stars, gore, maybe some cameos with more stars). Throw over, but after completing your credits, you'll ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life.
