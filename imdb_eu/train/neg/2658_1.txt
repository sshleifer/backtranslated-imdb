While watching CBS's "Surrender, Dorothy", I asked why Diane Keaton wanted her (she's not a TV movie, but she's not an attractive role for older actors), it's not surprising to win the Academy Award. Performers like Keaton go to television, but Keaton has no choice to shine. A single mother, twenty of her daughter, who causes pain at sudden death, and gradually joins with her friends when her daughters were in an accident during her daughter's accident. Depending on the novel, telelestekotasuna is a set of characters wiped out to avoid crossing the street. Apart from being bold and gloomy, fake people are incredibly incredible, as well as a corner and bungalow near the beach where the kids live (a young man who wears muscles, that is to say, gay, as Diane Keaton says). Surrender, Dorothy "and he really asks," Oztar's Wizard, is not it ... not, genius, "from Kane!"). Keaton wanted to do this material about the issue that was facing death. He struggles to return to the shadow of his character (kooky costumes), but it does not look good in the audience, because Keaton has always enjoyed it and warm springs. Here, the discovery of himself is a stupid harpy who does not learn many lessons on the trip (the movie is forgotten quickly It's about a young man who is dead and becomes the odyssey of a national mother's girlfriend.) Whoever has not lost anyone.) This is what the film casts on the talk show shows: "Father's mother should help a lot." I can not imagine helping anyone , because he is inferior to himself, confused and insolent. He is gone.
