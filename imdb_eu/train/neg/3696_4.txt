I would normally give this movie 6 a very important topic, and it's pretty good for Katie Wright, it's a real achievement. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it was true, it was an order of character like this or it was naturally angry, but it did a wonderful job because it was impossible for him to take care of Lexi. There is no dimension that is confused in him, nothing but an outburst, and how much good he is to impress. I understand how scary, fear and pain is a young girl denying herself the loss of her friend and her eating disorder under control. However, Wright's full performance is a constant cry and the rest tears. I could not help feeling that the problem of this girl was that the Bulimian devil was not affected, but he did not have a spine. I definitely do not want the movie to do.
