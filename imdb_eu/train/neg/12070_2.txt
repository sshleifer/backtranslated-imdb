I've purchased one of the 50 collection albums of "Horror Fear" and I am still looking to find a good HORROR movie through them. Sometimes you'll find a nice campaign like Devil's Messenger or The Devil Bat, or one of the great films by Alfred Hitchcock (some are not afraid, because Hitchcock has directed some horrors and suspicions). They put movies like The Island Monster and they would not be able to accept them forgotten and they should be able to do so. <br /> <br /> So we open Westing to sort the idea of ​​the game. . Carradine (a main character) plays a rich and cruel father who is dead and still hates his children and servants hate it. Carradin plays as good as ever, but most of all he has left voice-recording and flashback sequences to be seated between half-board shows. It covers or explains the rest casts in a scene. Due to the independent film of the 70's, the lights and effects are quite limited. It is difficult to build a lot of voltages that the viewer can not see clearly in what happens in some scenes. Actors like Igor and Elga, at least, make an effort and embarrass me as they eventually got into extreme stupidity, but they still throw a version of a tour with a smaller happiness. Otherwise, clearly, who did it, but it's not enough to improve the quality of the movie. You do not like the characters, because they are selfish and cruel or psychotic, but they lead to a whole new level and there is not much. The scene of the death is pretty bad and the suspense is not really there. He demonstrates how to enjoy a packet of 20 films on "Chilling", such as House on a Haunted Hill, Little Shop of Horror's Jack Nicholson and Night of the Living Dead. That should be avoided.
