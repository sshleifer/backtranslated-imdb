... children were annoying actors. Likewise, it seems that the people in charge of this film had to meet 90 minutes. However, death is a decent scene. If it's not a scene of death, this movie would have a very dissolution for Disney. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist was not as scared. In the middle of the forest, if it were divided with a kind of ghostly fairytale ghost, you could throw it on your ass that I did not wander and ride on a bicycle. <br /> <br /> In general, I've seen it worse (that is, it waits for it), but I do not want to see it again or I do not recommend that you are worried about anyone being a horror collector.
