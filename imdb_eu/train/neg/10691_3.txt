Would you like to rent me with me or not? I'm always afraid of renting something I always hear (do not remember being in theaters). Great cast ... that's tipped by scales. Within 30 minutes, I almost stopped watching. Watching the first minutes is fun, but unbelievable. Then it's getting worse. The writers of this film could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their films a bit better. Or they just tried to write something compelling. I write 3 ... a 1 (it's just a few words) and 2 actors can get this wrong to read this movie. Oh, my god, this movie is awesome.
