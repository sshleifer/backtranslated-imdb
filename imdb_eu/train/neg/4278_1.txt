I just got the movie I received at the National Wholesale Liquidators and, after seeing it, I feel rotten. <br /> <br /> I do not know I saw a movie worse than this. Honestly And I would not think of such a huge respect for the subject I did not write a negative review of the movie, Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> <br /> First, what is it? Is music a biography? Yes, there are many tunes in Foster here, and there's much more pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern than the Mississippi Delta. Do we mean that someone is writing this payment? Secondly, Foster's REAL story is wonderful. Why do not you come here? Thirdly, what do Ray Middleton do to make this movie? His images with little boys? With the Communists? What a talented waste? <br /> <br /> So, Foster friends, and true and good entertainment, do not worry ... very, very, scared.
