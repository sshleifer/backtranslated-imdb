Zwick was my main comment Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie. Big boot For character contributors, none of them really help this movie. Do I have to admit, was Tom Hank's camera worth it? what was it with that Tom? Have you missed a bet? The best cameo of the film was Joe Isuzu, however, a classic! It's a good premise. The character of Basinger, who is fighting for Lady Rose, is slowly slowing down the Vegas motel by bringing her a huge cosmetic sales pyramid. This happens when the character of Corbett arrives at Vegas, motivated by the fact that Elvis is getting ready for his old wife, what else is extortion. As for both, Elvis's imitators make up several executions, Elvis leads the way to the exit of the Vegas Convention. Soon, the FBI implies that Elvis's imitator begins to think of a serial killer. Unfortunately, this premise does not mean that the movie was good. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, imagine being back in the first grade? when story lines and continuity are not very important. It's so nice for Basinger to look at his beautiful Lady Pink outfit, why she does not really ask her why she's doing it. The film tries hard, but eventually it falls short way. In the end, it is accomplished with ideas that can be theoretically fun, but in practice they were not fun. one???? Do not warn me not to warn me!
