** Possible Waiting ** <br /> <br /> A direct live messenger combines the power of the gun, the Z-grade effects, the Nazis, the mummy and the endless lesbian footage, and it's still boring; The video's 45-minute duration only looks like an Eternity.

Take this snoozer to the video store again and watch TV golf, bowling or tennis.
