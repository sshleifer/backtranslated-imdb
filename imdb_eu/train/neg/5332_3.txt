Okay, the portrait of stereotypical stories in this story is plain. I agree, Elvis seems pretty good here, but it seems that the color of his skin changes during the movie. I was thinking, well, ... it was never so real life. It's one of the most popular brown makeup I've ever seen. "F-Troop" "Indians" and American Hollywood and Italian actors are just as bad as Western western theater and non-American divines! <br /> <br /> This movie is ok, but it's usually tidy. Stories and medium-sided songs, like in all Elvis films. It only made Colonel Parker associate it with long-lasting movie contacts to make Elvis more money! "I thank God," I still think, Elvis has stopped making movies permanently short. Fine is the character Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this movie. <br /> <br /> Burgess Meredith's 'Indian' make-up is totally AWFUL. Surely the worst range is. What did the director think? Did Mr. Meredith make any money or what did he do? However, I love Elvis movies. For example: 'Love Me Tender', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas'. On the other hand, along with television as Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, along with 'Change Of Habit', she also watches her movie, Elvis plays an urban doctor. <br /> <br /> Well, at least we made some short Elvis films, but they are evil and evil, good and decent. <br /> <br /> I always love ELVIS! Thank you, Thank you!
