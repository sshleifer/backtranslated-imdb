The best 4 best, better than 3, but hardly anymore. Basically, this is because part 4 is not contradicting section 1/2 (like 3), (that is, no reference to Tommy Lee's brother). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked Russian. drawing of the story line, and, in particular, the small part of Sven Ole-Thorsen's Boris. In addition, there are also some fighting scenes, the film is nothing special. The limited budget is very clear (especially the scene that hits the aircraft). <br /> <br /> In addition, section 4 does not really have a moral or does not say section 3, there are a couple of others. more well-known actors (Hudson, Thorsen), but at least at the beginning of the series (and these characters also have very small roles). <br /> <br /> It seems that Best of the Best is best to show Rhee, and to be true, it can not make a movie. <br /> <br /> See on tape, rating: 4
