For this you would get a 10-year-old (American manic) to write a story of a lunar trip by a man. Absolute loafers without quality, it fascinated the fascinating 3D. But in an entertaining and entertaining way of animation, one hour and a half wasted did nothing to do. Save your time and money and watch BOLT instead of <br /> <br /> damn. There is not enough line, however, I think that's summarized ... well, I agree with a previous review - this is like a story about cold war propaganda. Perhaps it would be more interesting for those flies that reveal fake lunar landing or for the first time killed in the minute. BTW - why did all the main characters fly? - No one is a full body!
