It must be one of the most crazy episodes of anime ever. Yes, though, I showed him the "end of the Evangelion", which even more hated me. Without having to mention a lot of this show! <br /> <br /> I do not care about psychology and non-philosophy, but Evangelion drags it in the mud like anything else! Not many characters seemed very interesting. The only ones that seemed interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. In addition, the majority of the rest were all losing losers. They must go to a psychiatric center without piloting huge robots against foreigners called "Angels". <br /> <br /> Even though the most powerful mechanics and fighting do not help in any way. It does something like this: <br /> <br /> "Well, there are these robots, and they are very good when they do cuts (!) Because they sneak, but they are not really smart, but captured angels, so they sometimes make crazy and they do not like the young riders, and they need better control ... blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not recommend Evangelion to anyone, anime otakus or not. For all those who love the series, I have the right to this opinion, I respect you. But those who are "obsessed with" are thinking of thinking about this series, you are more perspiring than you. <br /> <br /> "Macross", "Mospeada", "I'd rather run". -Dim "and" Robot Taekwon V "myself.
