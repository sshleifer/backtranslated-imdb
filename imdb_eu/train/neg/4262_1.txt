This is just the worst film ever I've ever seen. They are like 2 + hours, and the box was completely misleading. My friend and I rented it, we thought the poor man would be 300 men. You know, laugh and laugh. There is nothing funny about this movie, only pain. Then the movie starts and a different language is being spoken. We think 'it's just a start'. But no, since then the movie sinks completely and the book you had to read was a boring book, because it does not literally happen in hours, and the battlefields fight for 2 children's play. Give Cinematography, and this movie goes into the trash. Such films will take you to the world where we will see Wall-E. That had a good way.
