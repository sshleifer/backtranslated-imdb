I've heard that I've read all the reviews and comments that I've received in this movie as an Oscar movie, I saw today. What a great despair! 1) If you have read other reviews, members of Iraq's military members will learn how difficult the events of this film are. They reflect my thoughts; As I play the movies, the whole civilian, as I continued to think myself, can we say WHAT? There is no such way. 2) There is little in the case of soil. The bombardment appeared a new guy to replace one of the killed ones (it is not really clear). The new man makes his adrenaline work. His attitude endangers others. THAT'S IT! 3) This movie is not as promulgated as any solution. If you want to suspect Bourne, try one of the movies. If you want to see an emotionally powerful war movie, try renting Go Tell The Spartans, about the Vietnam War, and out with Burt Lancaster (who told me that he was very proud of being in a superhero serendipite). and he saw some of his best works, and he was still angry, he was ignored by Apocalypse Now, or the white and black classic of the Second World War. The English film has a huge twinkle. Do not disassemble your time locked.
