One night later I watched the movie with the cable and I could not believe it was bad. I usually have bad movies, but this was very upsetting, though it was not entertaining. Among the most important events in this film, they enter the absurd music that constantly stops throughout the film, with special effects (when someone shoots a laser track, when the green neon becomes green and it immediately breaks down) and the actress. The realization, in fact, is the robbery of the show. I did not know one of the actors of the movies, and I hope I never see one of them again. In general, I recommend renting this movie (you can find it, I can not imagine this video store with this garbage) after you have seen the trash can learn quality movies.
