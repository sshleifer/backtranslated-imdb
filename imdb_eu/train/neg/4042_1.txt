This movie is beautiful, but it's like seeing a bad experimental theater. The plot (if any) does not make sense. But it is very "artistic". Taking a look at the many shots of the mid-sized actors and their eyes. Multiple shots through windows and people from outside. Mumbling and wandering people wistering. Plans near the face and the body. When you get to the roof with the cat, you will be ready to throw a bottle of KY on the screen. <br /> <br /> Relations between father and son. but you'll both prefer each other simply and end. If you wanted to see bad Russian gay gay, no money yet, it was your wish.
