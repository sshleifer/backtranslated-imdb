Please do not hate me, but I have to be honest, I see this movie, I was fun. <br /> <br /> A video has a stupid Throw and stupid song! <br /> <br /> Necessary songs !!! Mehbooba ... The original plague total Holi ... well ... well it was! As a result of tradition, each film got one! Chad Raha hai Nasha Whatever ... Very UNNEEDED stupid Song Jee Le ... Playboy Song like a similar sound ... <br /> <br /> More than songs. The film was well adapted by Ram Gopal Verma ... If you think that this movie would like to be like this <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is only under the Spectator and, in his opinion, thinks about it. The whole movie Copy If he thinks he should turn himself into the cinema seat or if his director thinks he looks like he'll be comfortable, he'll look at this movie <br /> <br /> However, I saw Ram Gopal's Congratulations and the two ways I did not do it. for your disaster ... <br /> <br /> There were some other things that were believed to be Incredibly Bad <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan As Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in his Remake, Thinking Director) Ajay Devgan Heero / Veeru (Bobby Deol could be better) Prashant Raj Raj / Jai as important (although Abhishe was obliged to play this role in the Mehbooba song) Sushmita Sen Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan was the correct Tabu role) Nisha Kothari Ghungroo / Basanti ( I think Deol would be great.) Mohanlal As Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal is so nice ... Oops I'm sorry hehehehe, Ados He I did not think anybody) If you're the least attentive <br /> <br /> I was not even a movie Unbelievable, the film was okay, to watch <br /> <br /> Overall rating <br /> <br /> Direction ... 8/10 I received some credits Cinematography ... 9/10 Script ... 3/10 BAD Scripting Songs ... 5/10 It's not a necessary movie, it could be better, Easy ears on the PC and iPod and Play ... 1/10 <br /> <br /> Total ... 3/10 <br /> <br /> Pakistan Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi
