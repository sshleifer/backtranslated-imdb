I'm definitely not going to be a cult movie. I was sure that Gram Parsons was sure and I did not expect much from this movie, and I got even less. It could be intelligent and moving. He had no music with Grams and he had more filler than dog food. There was no backdrop about the colorful people of that era. The characters shown did not know me, although I've heard of all the versions of "adventure of life". Rock and roll is full of stories, good ones must also be taken with a salmon. The stories may be excellent, even if they are excessive. However, this movie took a good story and became a triumph. The robbery of dead bodies and consequential implications should never be a fake story, but it was somehow bored. I'm tempted to steal all copies of Grand Theft Parsons, get out of the desert and burn it all.
