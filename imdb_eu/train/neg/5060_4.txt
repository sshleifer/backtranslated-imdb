This film is the perfect adaptation of the English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit is the role of Richard Gere, Emran Olivier and Malikka, the role of perfect Lane's fraudulent wife. The second part of the film has changed to adapt to the Indian masses. <br /> <br /> The films have also got infidel traces, even though the original could not be. It was a soft and cheap pornography for Bollywood fans, where Mallika showed no tears to anybody who dare not show. Emran made such duties more and was also called the serial killer. If Indian directors want to renew the English film in the future, they will have to examine the viability of the plot with the Indian Censors. Even though the movies were bombarded at the box office, the actors got too much recognition. In the future the director should be clear about the recovery of an Oscar film. <br /> <br /> Everyone said, this is not a family movie; so be careful looking at home with the family.
