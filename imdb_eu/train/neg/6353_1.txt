For a comedian writer, Woody Allen really pays the viewer with this minimal attempt at character development. There are some really entertaining moments, but more than one could hear the dryer that can shake the tennis balls. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrelle loses his time in the movie that does not present his usual fun. Amanda Peet has done well, but he has not had to shoot again as soon as he has filmed. The film is so heavy and dull that it can not be done, but they have been taken by Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies that follow only one scene and do not really do anything, your writer may occasionally write some lines of fun conversation, you love this one. movie
