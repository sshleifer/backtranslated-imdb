I made a personal assignment after the makers of this film. The rental company also asked for a refund because they made a false advertisement. <br /> <br /> It's not enough movie itself, but the cover is what art sold me. I've made better makeup effects for kids of Halloween than on the cover of what's really in the movies. "Raccoon eyes?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < da. Raise Alabama - but it's a German accent !?! Beyond insolution.
