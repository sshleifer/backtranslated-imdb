Well, they say that nymphomania leaves you happy. I do not know if Stella James (Sean Young) is considered as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she is definitely in sex with men. She is still exploring, she tries to find "more data" so she can see what she wants from life and the men she is there, although she seems to have had a good idea at her age. (I can not agree, however, that the younger one is saying that it is too old to say, we should do it so well at all ages.) Most of the time, this movie has left me cold, though it's not the worst. you will never see it by its kind. And unlike the last Eyes Wide Shut, something happens here.
