This movie is horrible. The story is a woman who is trying to find out what has happened to her sister. The film fights with its identity to fight against Noir / thriller with erotic and horror elements. Film has a very confusing structure, for example, to use flashbacks frequently in the story. The plot is poorly developed, and the characterization has been difficult to distinguish who was the part of oneself. There are several existential movies that are impossible, but the main character voluntarily sends a friend to a virtual stranger and then goes to the top only (he says, he'll find a phone) with the gun that he has brought with him. To call the police, it was hard to believe. Some cinematographies are very poor: 42 "we were watching in a television, so that with a smaller set, anyone who was almost completely in the dark could do it for me. It's above me. Overall, a chaotic mess.
