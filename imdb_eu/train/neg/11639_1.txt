SPOILERS: I'm always amazed how many people gave game reviews for you. It was wonderful. He only destroyed the script and the voices. Gabriel and Grace are characters that can not be played. You are almost dead to pray. And, worstly, there are fewer vampires in the masked man between wolves. <br /> <br /> The vain vignettes were very disappointing. If you expect the story of Anne Rice style vampire, forget about it. The story of this game is very small with vampires. You will never see the end, and you will not even fight against them. <br /> <br /> The story has radical and evil views of Christianity. I'm surprised to leave the paint board. I am not a Christian and I was offensive. In most cases, the story seeks the search of the Holy Grail and a treasure trove. The kidnapping of the king's child, which should be the focus, really is pushed aside. Gabriel does not feel urgently in search of the child. In fact, almost never ask questions about the child from the blocked blocks first. <br /> <br /> The graphics are pretty bad. The characters move in the snail's rhythm, even in the best system. They are rough and outdated. And it's hard to go from the Beast of the Beast to a FMV with this horrible game of Blood of Sacred. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Gabriel and Grace also has a horrible turn. I really do not know why she was so scared, but they sleep. And it's not fun. Gabriel gives Mosely the best game to his good friend, Moses, how much more than a sister thinks about Grace, and does not believe that she is the same. And they seem to have slept together. However, it is very difficult for the whole game, that you are almost certainly not careful. His worst conversation was in the game. And he was constantly doing the whole game of women innuendos stupid women. At the end of the game, Grace John Dear seems to leave a letter to him. I think that most of the players were boring. <br /> <br /> The story seemed annoying and boring. I expected the story of the kingship of vampires kidnapped. I expected to see and fight vampires, perhaps in Gabriel or Grace. But no. Instead, the author focused on the Christianized viewpoint. What a shame! Here we have elements for a wonderful adventure, and instead we have achieved that. <br /> <br /> For me, they were finally the only interesting episodes of the game. We get some action style puzzles at the end. However, it was not worth the game to get suffering. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this game. When I came out I came back a few years ago, and I hated the game engine for so many years. I recently removed it to see if I was missing. And now, I'm very sorry. My favorite characters were ruined. I hope there will be a fourth game to free the series. And I hope the next time it will be fine. It would be terribly embarrassed by this installment.
