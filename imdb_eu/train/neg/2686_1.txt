First of all, I'm not American or Middle Eastern. Secondly, I do not have a religion. The closest thing to a religion is to sports and movies. From now on, I think that it would be the best way to give an opinion on neutrality and without any tendency. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films are shy. This horrific event has to be used for innocent recollections that have been killed in "some" barbarian and civilian varieties. So, most of all, I saw in these short films, they tried to get a lot of political points. Examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Ken Loach segment. Of course, we are all sad that this has been a tough life in his country, but what happened in 2001 with innocent victims? Do they have two wrongs right? Whatever! This movie should be a subtitle for those who have not heard of a Chilean-English scientific accent. <br /> <br /> 2) The most disturbing part is Youssef Chahine segment. It is clear that it has problems with logic. The United States was justified by the demon and the Americans voted for political power, and in the end, Americans took decisions and decisions taken by Central Eastern states. Helloooo! Is this guy? Some Americans do not vote too! Some Americans also do not know where the Middle East is; Some people do not even know what religion practiced; and most do not know the real political problems that arise behind the scenes. ### Chahine, why we all had problems in the world, because there are too many people with your type of logic. Twin towers innocent couples arrived all over the world. Firefighters, retrievers, office workers, authorities and aircraft have nothing to do with politics. And yet, we do not allow "some" about our lives to believe that people have to choose one or all of the religions. We are perceived as fair game for extreme politics. 3) The Israeli Segments killed their victims. Another filmmaker uses this event to promote his political agenda. Sometimes it's not yours. Some people always think "I, I, I". Sometimes it's about other people. <br /> <br /> 4) Idrissa Ouedrago's segment is a joke and another political point. Of course, the international community wants money, emphasizing poverty. Blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> This film remembers the victims of "September 11, 2001". <br /> <br /> Regarding it, it is best to TRASH CAN.
