This movie was terribly terrifying. The worst performance was! It was worse than a student's movie. Super curious, and I think the worst actor was old lady. At first, I thought myself, well it's an old movie. So, I remember that, there is no excuse! I watched older movies with a better performance. <br /> <br /> The music was horrible. It was very rough. The editing was a bit wrong (most of the dialog box was synchronized.) <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is not worth 1. I was bored, because I was so bored and I was hardly entertained by the movie. It was a bit like that. My dear grandmother's left finger can make the movie better.
