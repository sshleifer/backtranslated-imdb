For the fun of the comedy, the movie was awesome. Be quick and never get better! Losing time and losing money! Tina Fey is a great writer, I thought it would be a great comedy. The predictions were so good, but they only showed the best part of the movie. My husband also thought of Chick Flick. What is it with that? The movie was very heavy and boring. At this time I do not recommend anyone. I'd like to make my money again! BOO with us here, Arizona. Thanks, but not thank you. Who makes this stupid thing to think about people who are pregnant. I thought it was so fun, I had children and I had children. It could be more in line with reality.
