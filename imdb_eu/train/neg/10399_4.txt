One of the main mistakes in this movie is that while the delightful pretense of yuppies is delightful, it fails to realize that those responsible for these films are worthy of joking. One of the characteristics of these types of yuppies is misunderstood to understand (yuppies) sophisticated art. Apart from the character of the film, and instead of misunderstanding, I find it ironic that those who enjoy this movie are just supposed to have suppository suppository films that are proud of their flavors. If these prolific characters in this movie feature a video library in the house, I would bet it would be one of the American Psycho films.
