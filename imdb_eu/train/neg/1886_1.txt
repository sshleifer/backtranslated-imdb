I promised every time I could not extract a movie (such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact, personal policies I suffered from different dreck types) but Mr. Seidl was almost successful. Hundstage was a great experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that the Austrians will be a wonderful and pathetic bunch of people back. Love and humankind show a world that is not existent, because humankind only humiliates it for one reason: to extract their existence miserably. When choosing a documentary style with non-professional actors (most of them are directly related to the cartoon imager of the Austrian cartoonist Deix) Seidl's director thinks he's a real life in Austrian (Western European?) Neighborhoods. . Audiences are confronted with sexual organs, violence against women and disabilities, insanity and degradation. But it's not a social criticism. This is not a mere excitement for aesthetic value. On the contrary, bad performance, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. If someone needs a movie like this, things that are bad in our society realize, this person must have a closed life with his eyes closed. This is a pessimistic social criticism with a sledge hammer. And he looks at people in a sharp and moving way. It shows ugly people, that is, I hate it. But the average people show it in an ugly and misanthropic way. That's why the movie is really contemptuous.
