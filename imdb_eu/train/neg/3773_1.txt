When people asked me the worst movie ever I've ever seen. It's not a MST3 class riff or midnight show at a theater or not even close to the Disney Channel Night Filler. In Disney World (or in this case, Disney / MGM Studios), I just wanted to go down a walk to get Dick Tracey's jacket maniac, I had to shrink and I steered it in the throats. "Eat this! Eat nephew with this unusual shield!" I have never been mad at a movie, either "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". Want nice colors and cinematography? Not here The reviewers say "Oh, but also a comic book," for me, after a few weeks in the sun, Gordito's color. Enjoy it as well. Beatty walks around this scenery and watches her watch, she and she is occasionally talking to other actors, someone will wait for the time to start shooting at once. To be fair, I saw this movie only once, but my pain is a section of men, not God.
