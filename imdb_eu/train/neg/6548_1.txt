If you see it without any idea of ​​what the story is, then you'll be surprised. However, the synopsis has been painted by a solid picture, but it's just a real movie. <br /> <br /> If you follow the summary, it informs you of an obsessed mountain climbing. The preface to the initial credits and text dragging, which suggests Chronopolis, a imaginative city in the dream-minded manuscripts of the mind (because the self-esteem produces flashes of brilliance), its inhabitants are immortal. their omnipresence change. They can see our world and the mountain climber, and the synopsis explains that they have decided to contact them through alchemy, creating a sphere that fills human beings. <br /> <br /> What it means, it's a repetitive animation that a boy from a 5-year-old can give. Generate forms, even if the credit stops moving style, and put it through a loop that will be considered. And repeat until your eyes close, and then go to the next scene. In any case, the Chopopolysians (if this term exists) really loves their sticks and balls, playing constantly playing the magic sphere, and playing a field day before releasing him before the "other" world. Similarly, there is no better way when man interacts with a sphere when another hypnotic sequence is boring and sleeping. <br /> <br /> Thank you, obviously, less than the time predicted, that is, 57 minutes (or less) against the indicated 70. Although it is dull, its colors, the story does not exist, the rigorous soundtrack and repetitive images will not gain more fans. Do not waste your time.
