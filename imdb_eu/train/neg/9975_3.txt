I recall that this movie was often seen as a very young boy, and I did not understand a few sections (in fact, many). I think I've seen it once as an adult, and then I understand these parts. The only problem I saw as an adult was not any entertainment. So what is the type of film? Is it a "movie for kids"? It's almost not. It has a language and a theme that is not suitable for children. Does every parent have a hyperbola with their children? Maybe, but why not put John Ritter instead of Junior? When the movie is a 7-year-old main character, to work with the public, it should be a movie that is under seven and crowded, older people would not be able to (8 would not watch a movie about a younger than a year old.) I'm sure This movie is not good at the box office, and the reason could not find a niche in the market.
