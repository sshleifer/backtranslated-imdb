Imagine the days you would like to watch the movie you want to watch, and remember to watch the trailer on "The Grudge". So, in good faith, you recommend watching this movie. It's Halloween season, after all. Last weekend he made a boff box at the box office, so it must be pretty good ... you can go. <br /> <br /> And you're really worried about the way the movie ends and you're listening to yourself, "this can not finish the movie ..." But, oh, it's. <br /> <br /> And think that you were ashamed of the movie theater and you would be ashamed to recommend a dog in this movie. Do you think your date thinks you are the one who suggests that character, and the hopeful relationship with your suggestion will end. Actually, it was so bad that they both laughed at us. Mrs. Gellar does not see any future in the movies, and suggests that she will have access to television in the future. In fact, it is not long before the flea bundles that sell the Buffy memoranda, and it can not happen soon, if you ask. Horrible, horrible, horrible The plot does not make sense; continuity was awful. It's evident that he had achieved the "Gudge II - Cat-Boy return".
