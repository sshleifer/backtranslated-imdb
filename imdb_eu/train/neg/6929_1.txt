I read the comments of this movie and decided to give it a shot. In the end, I'm an open man and I've done some good reviews. When I finished the credits, I looked for something meaningful and meaningful. Here it goes: "This movie was short." That's all. <br /> <br /> Okay, well. The sets and images were well-developed and the music helped support the life of asylum, but the movie was painful and the endless conversation brought good bits. I found this movie to be fun, but I found the best way to make people laugh at how many people were embarrassed. <br /> <br /> He decided to run away with the movie that ended up with "Chicken Dance" and the bodies fell. I do not know how to recover this movie. The show was not bad and it seemed to be a quote, but there was no way to be available; nor even the presence of naked breasts. Maybe I would turn a doobie or take a lot of beer to get the whole movie experience. Anyway, I do not see this movie again, I'm really confused. Then I can say "I was not at least" Dr. Tarr's Dungeon of Torture 'I'm better than us. "
