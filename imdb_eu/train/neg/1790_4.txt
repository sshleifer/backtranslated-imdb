At first it was a nice movie, and then the songs were very wrong and prominent. <br /> <br /> King James is not talking too much English in English but it is not only annoying in today's world, but not always. easy to interpret Have you imagined that today's youngsters are trying to hear this movie? Forget it <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has good lines here and is as nice as "Hank Martin". Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was also her good looks and her long red hair. <br /> <br /> The movie is nice, it's a sensitive end and I can not knock it. Perhaps, it's worth a rental, historically, or if you're a big fan of Crosby, but it's not so much in general.
