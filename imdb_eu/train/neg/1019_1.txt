Honestly, before seeing this movie, many people heard that the movie was a shame. I did not believe Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey took the roles of this film and watched me. Apparently it seems. I was really disappointed and I wondered all the time in the movie - why did I see the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, I did not wait for Justin, because I was not in the movie / theater. business But Morgan and Kevin? I was not able to stop asking me why they took part in Edison. To be honest, their roles are stupid. <br /> <br /> It might be thought that if they got sucked by the players, then I'd have to take a closer look at the story. In fact, the story is the core of a movie, but the guys ... believe me ... this is not the movie you want to tell her story. Imagine this, writing a story against the expert journalist (Justin Timberlake) and studying at the same time how to become a "real" journalist, Morgan Freeman. All this has been aided by a heart of justice (LL Cool J) and excellent researcher (Kevin Spacey). At the end, the beat of the beat of the end of the system beat. <br /> <br /> Jeez, I could not even continue with this. I remember the movie. My advisors, do not miss it! Save your money and time to make another movie.
