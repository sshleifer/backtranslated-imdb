Something Borrowed B- <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Super Bowl Sunday is every year the slowest movie. That is why the film studio prevents the release of large-budget films over the weekend. A few years ago, a studio will present a women's program in the movie "The Wedding Planner". Likewise, Super Bowl Weekend "The Wedding Date" will try to play successfully and attract audiences that are not looking at the game. <br /> <br /> A woman who feels like a wife, single women, Kat Ellis (Debra Messing, "Will and Grace" TV), hires Nick escort male (Dermot Mulrony, "Schmidt") to put her way. his sister's wedding boy in London. His family is a difficult time for his wife, and after seven years, he is the best man. Kat's jealous parades make him around his ex to see him doing what he missed. In the end, Nick can open that Kat can help him realize that he loves someone. The "Picture Perfect" 1999 copy is almost a copy and the scenes of "The Wedding Planner" and "My Best Friends Wedding" are mixed. The film also reverses the theme "Pretty Women", and by knowing its audience, the director makes quick references to this and other films. <br /> <br /> "Marriage date" has all the topical items. A typical wedding film, a stereotypical mother is close (Holland Taylor, "Legally Blonde"), and a wedding and rehearsal dinner with almost plagiarized wedding and family. It was done before the end of the tour, but it was not entirely expected. The real reason that eliminated the cat is a surprise and the direction of the film lasts half an hour. <br /> <br /> Even though "Wedding Date" is planned, it is able to stay on its own. . Debra Messing, her main role, proves that it can be charming and fun. Dermot Mulrony has a great chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of her conversations were very crisp and unrealistic. He can do the good and he can retrieve the character. <br /> <br /> Using film lights (often sexual), the movie is really fun. Although the film is primarily a part of all the films that can be enjoyed. It's the best date published by good stories and moods.
