They ask me what I've seen what I've seen. This movie is a very difficult time and / or continues on a plot. If you tell yourself a comedy, do not be fooled, 98% are odd percent and 2% are comedies. All the agents make a great profit, it can not be denied, but seems to have lost something. I do not know if the original script is good or not, what to do or what to do. This was the potential, and instead, it was really a flop. I'd really like to spend hours and half invested in this movie, but the video rental spot does not return hours. Save your money and see something else.
