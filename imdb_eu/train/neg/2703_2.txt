SPOILERS RIGHTS! <br /> <br /> Well, I sat down late and watched the movie, especially when I first liked and rated Singleton's "Boyz n the Hood" works. However, I must say that this was a great despair regarding the hate that I call "posts". <br /> <br /> The performance is bad especially (pop stars and patterns are NOT actin 'good actors ... notice), is it a tough situation (does the rape victim turn into a lesbian? ... please), but all It reinforces the worst possible stereotypes. In the second half of the film he has become a cartoon, as in his characterization, if he loses a bit of empathy for his single-player players <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br A valid point of reason for racism and culture, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, the results of these problems are only sensationalized. The message is contradictory, creating confusion and creating a general cohesion of the plot. The film seemed predictable, shaky, exploitative and totally offensive. For a movie called "Higher Education", all I learned is to say this is more than once. <br /> <br /> If you check the comments on the topic that does not completely fail. Then hire "American History X" ... If you only had Tyra Banks, rent a life.
