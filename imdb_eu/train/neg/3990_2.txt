Stylized Jungle Fever is stereotyped too and basically stingy. Wesley Snipes missed the lead, and there was no chemistry between Annabella Sciorra. Although there are many talents in this film, it is mostly wasteful because the pieces are less than decorative ornaments. Also, instead of just racial and stupid, Spike Lee wants to shake like a flag. I made most of the movies, but I could not finish it, and this, for me, rarely happens.
