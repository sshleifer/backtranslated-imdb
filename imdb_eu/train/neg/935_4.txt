The users who love this movie simply can not compare enough film. Have they cleared their heads? I've felt a bit disappointed about a movie, and a bit of it has to be ridiculous about this movie. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, BU is just a bullying. At the end of a harassment we go and go to another. And another one. And another one. And another one. Do you see a model? Land, the development of the characters or the boring realities of ancient 'wasted' is almost no time. <br /> <br /> If you do not see two other Bourne movies, you've lost quite a bit. If you have - you were just lost from one movie to another ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was a feeling it overcame, but Bourne and its endless evils have only been removed by the audience with the character. It hurts. Jumps He dug it up It gets awry. He has cleaned up tall buildings. Yada yada yada. Especially he was alive. Plastic Action Man survived as he survived, and that only makes it ridiculous stunts even more paralyzed and it lacks any type of voltage. So he got a building? And what? It will survive Hatred <br /> <br /> A girl is confused because the interest of Bourne's love died in a previous corpse, but she only has decoration. I've seen deeper and more intense conversations in Captain Scarlet's chapters. <br /> <br /> Bourne's own literary discovery tragedy is dull and formal and tells us nothing of the first movie. The murder became a machine. Great She knows her true identity. And what? He has no emotional resonance. <br /> <br /> The 'Twist' end is telegraphic and weak. Oh, my dear, I think more about the movie I hate more! When I was writing the comment I've already reduced 4 4 scores! I'd better let the slides go ahead. <br /> <br /> I love the nice movie of the action and I love the thriller. Bourne is not ultimatum. Shiny change is a fierce and boring series of hilarious sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /> <br /> Bond franchise is a "mere way" way of thinking. Casino Royale comes out of the water.
