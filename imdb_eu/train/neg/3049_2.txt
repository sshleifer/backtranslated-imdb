Why this generic title? BISCUITS ??? So soft and surprising. The films that tried before the spirit of the holiday, especially "Santa Claus, won by Santa Maria", was at least entertaining for that camp, and the footage used ... for some reason, it seemed to me that I was happy. But this movie is put on the buttocks by Christmas, and it overwhelms the joy of all children. Does Santa live in space? Is his enemy a devil called Pitch? Does Santa Merlin help the magician? How random is this! Well, since it was made in Mexico, how was the story of how some of you did to understand the movie. Some of these effects have been said to be those times. Zoro was a giant cluster! Despite all the problems in the movie, it still feels like a Christmas movie. It's good to conquer the evil one, and Christmas is still one of the most beautiful hearts in the world, or perhaps the universe, our Claus concedes Santa Claus to conquer Martians ... apparently. So you should try, though it is one of the worst film holidays of all time ... you should put a smile at any time.
