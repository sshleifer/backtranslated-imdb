What happened to God's name here? How does Redneck Zombies create almost a cheap fall? Did Zombie '90 ever suppose someone ... to entertain anyone or make a profit dollar? But, above all, what happened here? <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence directed by an unlucky fellow of the Andes Schnaas, specializing in terrestrial fracture gore films, such as Gore of Gore and Anthropophagus 2000. In the Gore section, this is not the rest of the rest. Even without this level ... well, crust. <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestylence is just as bad as the Deadly Aliatian of Peter Jackson. <br /> <br /> Having a more detailed story would be a waste of time. Accidents caused by chemistry can return to the dead and lead to life. The concept is never treated like that. Gore effects are very small. Z-level nightmare. I can not say whether I wanted to be originally fun, or not, in a way that was dubbed in English, I'm sure it was very true to the original script, but things have happened more strangely. The whole thing reminds me of the introduction of a video clip from a Troma movie, it's still much longer. <br /> <br /> I saw only one movie that's worse than that. The Chooper. <br /> <br /> To prove that Andreas Schnaas is a real director, with Nikos The Impaler I would highly recommend you if you do not have the standard movie for what you are looking for, try Extreme Pestilence, but you have warned. It takes the steel nerves all the way. But if you're up to it all, then you can excite it. In addition, there is no atmosphere, no, and I do not have a quote, not the value of entertainment, but above all, pride. Show pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Update / 05/09/7: After making some of Zombie '90's insights, I've had a heart attack, or I think that's what I've got. Zombie '90 is the horny one, so it never means harsh words, even Extreme Pestilence is worth a single star.
