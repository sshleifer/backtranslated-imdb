The parody of Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones is very flimsy, humorous, and similar. After all, it is a soft core, it is expected and it does not matter, because whatever you want is sex. This leads me to the main problem, it's hardly a lot. You feel like you're watching TV at 3:00 a.m., and they're playing independent films, which has been made by a college student at any university. You've waited for a long time for a sex scene, you're thinking about something that's going to happen and then hang it on. It really goes somewhere (maybe two or two parts) is very nice. Personally, I can not recommend this if you do not save one or two dollars on the shelf. If you are looking for a good drawing and a good acting good, you do not want to. If you're looking for a good soft core lesbian movie, you do not even want to.
