I was looking forward to this movie. The theater is a monologue and Nic Balthazar is an interesting man with a lot of experience and knowledge in the movies. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of Belgian films, but this is a bad movie. It's absolutely incredible that the 34-year-old actress suddenly plays teenage role. "Language games" were superb and up. I did not think about the movie anymore. The endless way is too much for me to ex machina. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed and I think that they lost an hour and a half of my life.
