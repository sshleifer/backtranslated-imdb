I have watched this movie I have seen several times and I can say that there is little budget, and it does not have any real storytelling. Actors' performances are very poor, but it is the result of limited action. Those who have watched this movie, probably, Hitler would think a crazy rumor, running with a pistol like Chicago gun. In that year, I can say that the movie about Hitler and Germany is much better than that, and that the rise of evil is below average. I recommend the German Downfall movie, as you can see in a book by Bruno Ganz, a Swiss Bruno, in a book by Adolf Hitler.
