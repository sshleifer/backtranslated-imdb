An inside dimension in the hospital is an interesting idea. He recalled - Stephen Kings "Langoliers", "Kingdom Hospital" and the old Twilight Zone episodes. Atmospherically strong, it was an excellent training. In addition, the moments of 'time-loop' were very clear, always attracting the head-collapse. The story had fuzzy references, which seemed to me to explain the darkness of this time / all the ghosts / the ghosts described / a strange demon full of jokes and strange things that had heavy metals. And it was the dark floors that left me seriously. As I have seen, the movie is not an explanation about events. In the meantime, some ambiguities are expected / welcome in these films. The dark floors led to the new height of blurring. I do not wrap things in a hanging tape, but I do not feel "Huh? ... Is that it?" I used to say it was too much. Dark Floors was a "dream," it made me embarrassed, it was shame to get the last team and enjoy it I had the movie
