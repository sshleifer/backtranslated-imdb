Probably the worst Bollywood movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There is no plot. Very small character development. <br /> <br /> Funny and humorous. The whole movie was chaotic and not correct. There was no end to the story. The airport was shot in a shopping mall. <br /> <br /> The story itself is immersed repeatedly "it's wonderful, just go for it !!" Even though the song and dance are nonsense and choreographed. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this movie is that they were hot bodes ... but then the majority of Bollywood films have everything. <br /> <br /> I am not in the background from an Indian <br /> <br /> 2/10
