This is not a very good movie, but it's not sour. It is very confusing and useless, so rent under your care. <br /> <br /> My GF and I have figured this film (we think), so here it is: <br /> <br /> * ** THE FIRST PUPPIES OF AGE ** <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is really easy, if you dump all the confused unconscious dreams of the dream situation (95% of the movie). <br /> Except for the lawn, this really happened: a school group of friends leave one night. They run away and get into a car accident, except for everyone except Cassie and Sean. That's a simple cut out version. (Reasonably, I said Sean, take me) <br /> <br /> <br /> After the accident, Cassie lives in the hospital and is stuck between death until the end of the movie. This is where the dream part begins. <br /> <br /> The movie is SOUL Survivors, right? Cassie's souls and souls continue to interact with other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, 2 weirdos and Jude), with their own imagined images (Sean, school and around her). The souls were defined as follows: Annie chorizo, two cartoons (opening scene), Father Jude helps people and so on. <br /> <br /> Then we take a long walk, show a lot of images (many of them my GF and we can not even bind), but everything goes down if Cassie is not dead. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cassie wakes up. After being "dead" in a hospital a bit. There are family and Sean. This is the reality again. Ok okay <br /> <br /> Then the director adds a small extra species trying to confuse him again, showing a small dream that is suffering from the wheelchair. But this part is nothing but a nightmare, and it awakens next to Sean, of course, still working on his traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Due to space constraints, we did not cover all the small things, but feel free. send an email if you want. <br /> <br />
