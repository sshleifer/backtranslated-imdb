If Fassbinder made a movie worse, I'm sure I did not see it! Everyone who complains about the claustrophobic and claustrophobic films is better off to learn more about the style chosen in "The Petra von Kant Of Tear Bites". This film has many artistic and almost symbolic images and is a parody of the "film of the art". In the slaughterhouse and ten minutes later, the scene of the Elvira prostitute-friend's channel surfing is a clearer example of what this movie turns into the true resistance of the audience. But that's why I'm really upset, Elvira and her ex-wife and / or her daughter are just scenes that appear. These are the moments that show the human emotion, and show that it was struggling to release film that was excellent at the heart of the horrible movie. What waste?
