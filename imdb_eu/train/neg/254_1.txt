Ah, Bait. How do I hate you? Let me count in ways. 1. You try to be fun, but it's nice and pleasant; jokes are predicted and expected, and then it does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to. You try to be dramatic 2, but it's unbelievable; The woman goes beyond the horrible level and "bad" looks like Bill Gates and it's terrifying ... well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine that Bill Gates is trying to frighten someone with a gun. It does not work, not a lawyer, maybe not a gun. It does not fit.) Jamie Foxx, just try to make him watch a dramatic and sensible conversation. and I want to push it. 3. You try to be full of action, but vice versa often and dragging. And when the action is warmed up, the camera tripod must be lost, the scene is more than the Blair Witch Project, and I am scared to myself and again. 4. You're trying to be a good movie, but you've failed, you're coming, you're coming! I would like to barefoot all of Sahara, beef meat and not water, cream, and only with Meryl Streep. This hell would be very enjoyable because all the minutes spent tell us all about writing the story written with Bill Gates, and let's not even discuss the massive Bombardment Jamie Foxx character. He has just thrown off a cliff, but somehow he escapes ... just kill me now, or do good things and promise me to somehow never get to see this bad movie again, never.
