I almost cried to see this movie. It's not laughing, remembering Rodney Dangerfield's great movie. Candyshack was his first and steals the movie, Easy Money was best, and Back To School is a classic masterpiece of the 80s. Then Ladybugs were there and she started to show it. Rodney's poor age (Discovering Wally Sparks was a little step for Ladybugs, but he did not say much). <br /> <br /> In my 5 wives, Rodney plays Monte (a woman who loves a wealthy woman (not always), who is married to his wife, and who is married to him as his money was named after Easy Money. Now, he inherited a large part of the earth and inherited the land by Amish, inheriting 5 Wives. This is a great idea for Dangerfield. The problem is ALL The script is so bad that Rodney seems to say that he has a camcorder and does not neglect all the characters. The movie seems to have shot a video clip, no doubt due to bad Rodney's events. Andrew Dice Clay tells the gangster that he's dying to say the word F (as R's but PG's) and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2-minute message. Do not go wrong, but I laughed at Rodney's jokes, but the poor man is too old and too slow. We can see jokes coming from millions. And the movie becomes a PC, in the 1990s, in the 70s and 80s, Rodney just works.
