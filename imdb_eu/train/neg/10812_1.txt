What a pathetic film. <br /> <br /> I do not lose much time commenting on it. I still try to recover two hours before I was wasting. <br /> <br /> Let me leave: Shaq has NO BUSINESS as an actor or singer. In both talents he does not give much talent. It is a shame to say that most talented people are spoiled in the community's theaters and karaoke bars, and Shaq uses his name as a basketball player, not being cut off by films and CDs. <br /> <br /> This is a great failure. The movie was a talents of talented Shaq.
