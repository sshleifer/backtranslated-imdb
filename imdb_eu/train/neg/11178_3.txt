First of all, I must admit that it is not a good movie. And I would never see the movie if I was not in Pacino. <br /> <br /> The strange publishing movie is in 24 hours. And too much work, dizziness, sick and sometimes regretted. It's very nice, after 20 minutes you can sleep. And I do not understand why he wanted Pacino to be part of this horrible film. Money or what? Why? <br /> <br /> As I am a Pacino fan, I bought this movie People I Know in 2002. If you have not bought yet, do not think it's just a waste of time.
