I'm getting started with a giant spoiler about this movie. Do not read anymore ... Here comes your eyes! The main hero, always a girl who has survived slasher movies, died here. There I only save 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> This is a cheap movie that was cast in the mid-eighties slasher era. Although the heroine is dead, that is, no garbage below. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> /> <br/> <br/> Many social problems are represented as psychiatric problems, and university students are even worse. <br /> <br /> Just make "Splatter University" when you want to put your video player, although I do not have anything to do with it, I recommend you watch the tape that cleans your head, which would be more entertaining. <br /> <br /> This is valued by strong physical violence. , ugly, very naked female nudes and sexual references. <br /> <br />
