I rented this movie for 3 years ago, and still seems to be the worst film ever made. I do not think I've ever finished. It's worse than a home-made video from a high school student. I recall a flashback in the 1970s and a shirtback with a man in the flashback, Oakley sunglasses and a new SUV, something like Toyota Rav-4 (I do not remember). I do not know how it could possibly be said to be in the 70s. It may even have a phone, I do not remember, it was horrible. I came back to the video store and asked them why they shoot it even if I returned to the time of my life. The movie I've ever seen today is the worst, and I've seen it pretty bad.
