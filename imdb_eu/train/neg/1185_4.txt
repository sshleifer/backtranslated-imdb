A new, variant of the famous children's and fairy tale, The Bite (1975), The Beast imagines (very graphic and offensive and disturbing, but in a rather stupid and comical reality) what happened to Beauty and Beauty beast? I like the reviews and commentaries that deeply look at this movie. I would not go on saying that they say they say that they are focusing on issues such as sexual frustration, longing, fulfillment, or satirical criticism of Catholic religion. I would not even call an erotic horror film. It's a parody of all genres that touches or mentions, even if you've got some amazing moments in every department, you'll be sure to be in your memory. <br /> <br /> The long scene between an aristocratic young person (too long) The most spectacular but striking sight of a horrible movie that has ever been seen by women and ever seen is the music of Scarlatti's clavecorders and is hysterical. My husband and I laughed before the overview of the meeting. It's a moral scene - the beauty to defeat and defeat the monster. The question is: who is the main recipient of the movie? For an erotic image, it is very bold; As far as art is concerned, insanity of madness is too much in excess of scenes and I would like to say that it is a violent end. The IMO, the filmmaker, does not mean having a serious drama. As an art house / horror / erotic parody, it's fun and definitely original. Laugh and try to find a deep sense. An unusual story of curious jewelry and rich animals is definitely not recommended for children to see together. The scene of the presentation is perfect, the scene of bestiality can be much worse than the bad one, it can be used successfully in the Discovery channel in the "Animal world - horse habits and rituals" program.
