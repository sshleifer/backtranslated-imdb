This movie is a good example for a book that spoils 109 minutes. Apart from the names of the characters, the movie has a small resemblance to the book. A book made up of strong Latin characters, and most of them non-Latin. There is no character in the development of the film, and we do not have reason to love or hate the characters. And the elimination of the whole generation is impossible. Isabel Allende has written a powerful book and the book should be read!
