I really get what I really get about this movie (that is, something that's about my film about physically ill) that is someone who has paid for it. There is no end to the existence of this film. It's not scary, it's not thinking, it's not entertaining, it's not good. The pill is a cyanide sleep. The DVD case contrasts Blair Witch, Evil Dead and other decent films, making clear the desperation of the filmmaker. It's like any other movie ever made; far, much worse. The claims of "The Ultimate Endlessness" will be equivalent to acute horse decoctions. Do not waste your time seeing the part of the trash because it can be sterile. The man who wrote this film should be removed from the list of members of the Writer's Brotherhood, and has never shot anything. Because he believes it to be a movie that deserves to be, he probably does not offer something in the future. Zero stars Grod can have mercy on seeing the soul of any unhappy man. Now I will vomit.
