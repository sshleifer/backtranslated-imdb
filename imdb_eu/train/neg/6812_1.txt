From the beginning of this movie, you have soon noticed that the name of the film is not that it was not necessary to see what the movie was about to do with it, and I've seen the stunning women I've seen the civil servants that I have ever seen before. And all this is done through subtitles, the type of movie you want to think twice, and while the movie is slowly moving, you soon realize that the vampire is not a vampire when the title came from some parts of cinema. Pierre is sensible and a father, but as the film ends with his stupidity, you have to think why this film is over and only if there was a better end to it, this is basically not seeing this movie
