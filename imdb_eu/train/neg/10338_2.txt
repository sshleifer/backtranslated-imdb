This movie is just plain mute. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the premiere of Ralph Meeker's Mike Hammer, with an amazing sunset, the movie is an exercise in wood preview. <br /> <br /> Mike Hammer is a true fictitious societal detective. Unlike Marlow and Spade, the pieces that solve the mystery together, Hammer breaks things apart to get the truth. This movie turns the Hammer Boob into the good guys that surround him ... well, too dumb to escape anything. There is a crisis in Crisis in several crises. <br /> <br /> The other parts of the movie are released in Three Stooges's book. Velda laughed at the dance, for example, or the bad man who does not hold his boss in the back. And the breaks of continuity are shameful: when Frauch Blucher runs down the center of the road, the camera is smaller in its lower legs, but sends it to the other side to get a larger shot camera. The worst part, however, attacks the popcorn. Hammer makes a nasty man watch a clock in seconds after our heroine, the watch is seven minutes behind our guy. <br /> <br /> In order to be fair, some interesting cameras and an excellent lighting and finish were. It is so bad that it is worth seeing, that is, it gets two points from 10 points.
