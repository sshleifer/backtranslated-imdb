In my low opinion, this version of BDWY music music deals with two things: Tyne Daly and his original script have a scripted version. (Ok, it's good to see Vanessa Williams.) But all of this for me. Most casts seem to go across the show - Chynna Phillips does not know who is really Kim and it's not surprising that when people surpass Harry McAfee when George Wendt seems to be sitting in a Boston bar. . Jason Alexander is right, but I have to go and get a better dance at Bugsy Malon. As I said, it's good to have a script version of the scene, but I hope there is no trial of the youngsters who have never seen music.
