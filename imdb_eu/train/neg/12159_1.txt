I can not believe I actually saw it, but I think I would like to know at the end that this movie would get you unwittingly and more entertaining. and he did it. It has been a more pernicious performance by defense lawyers, so it was also very rare for fictional stories that were out of real life. On this planet anyone can play in front of a judge like any one. and probably the worst land taxation. why was it in court anyway? He did nothing and did not prove anything guilty. A simple search for his house would bring rings. but do not go. He preferred to say "objection" 2 or 3 times throughout the test - that was it. The blond madman had been given a real drug to prove himself innocent, but not Brett. The crazy person had a Brett's altar in his house, he could prove his ill-conceived obsession. but do not go again. I pulled the mirror across the court scene and handed it several times against himself. Even if the strangest realities do not look like this "I'm innocent." What did this movie say to you? To marry a woman not married to life insurance: when she falls down the stairs, her husband is thrown into prison and guilty. evil and evil men.
