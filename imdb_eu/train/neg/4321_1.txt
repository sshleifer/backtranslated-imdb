This was the biggest Christmas movie I ever saw. I have seen two of my little children. The worst earthquake, the land was more sad - the family has no money, the mother has lost her job, her father has died in the bank, robbed the bank robber with the family and then dropped it back and forth. on the river Mother only remains. It is not surprising that his Christmas spirit has disappeared. Christmas angels do not save their drowned children, and Santa does not bring the dead father! The message to send children was SHORT. Better to say, there's no Santa NO movie to show!
