I did not know I could see it or I laughed. Danni filth's addiction fans would just like her. It's supposed to be a horror movie, but that's just dirty. The most beautiful scene is the car accident, which is the best of Hollywood and has some real effects. Avoid the movie at all costs. See this just for bad reviews ................
