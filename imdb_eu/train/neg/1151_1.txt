This movie was very depressing. <br /> <br /> The characters were so cold. She is the main mother, but she is "mother." Ok, his marriage was unhappy and he always put his husband and children first. Her husband has died. He then goes to visit his son and finds himself with a hunk who sleeps with his daughter and sleeps with him. Until that part, the movie is fine. It's not excellent, but it can be seen. The guy is charming and who can blame her? Ok, it's not a good night to sleep with your daughter's lover, but we're sorry to lose her husband. <br /> <br /> The guy becomes completely obsessed. I guess the movie I liked. He always likes to "like his old age" while working at his son's house (I think that's the only thing he did), as if he did not get his way. attention Men, of course, are not very interested (they seem to admit that they are more welcome as an activity), instead of insulting, they will go to bed with him and have a good time. it becomes very abusive. "I like what I want," he tells him in a desperate way, while he is very badly insulting. <br /> <br /> I was angry at this movie, my mother's respect for herself. Craig tells him the first time I'm "Lump Formeless". <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult for women. If it was for me, I would buy a small object that would bring me the same satisfaction and much less emotion ... :)
