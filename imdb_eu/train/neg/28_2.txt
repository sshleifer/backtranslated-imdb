This movie is horrible. You really do not need to read this review anymore. If you're watching, it's enough to say - no (if you do not learn how to make a good movie) <br /> <br /> The operation is horrible ... serious hours. I thought it was interesting throughout the film that Michael Madsen had talked and found someone who looks like that, that's just that! The news is also for him! <br /> <br /> The plot is horrible. People who say it's original or good can hardly ever see a decent movie. In the Hollywood movie act movie, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it! Go ahead to make a trip, at least you do not kill yourself.
