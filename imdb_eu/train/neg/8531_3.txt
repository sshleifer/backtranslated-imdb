In this strange unbelievable, Norma Shearer 40-ish heavy sociality and a girl plays in Monte Carlo, trapped in a relationship between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be a temptation to write down the failure of the film so that George Cukor was not guilty of the writer or curator. In most cases, however, Shearer's fault is that the "young person" who wanted unwanted will continue playing to escape him. So, his "cartoon lover" is lying on an old woman's age.
