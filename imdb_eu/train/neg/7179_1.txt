It does not matter the film that makes sense of his "message". This movie has a terrific workout - an awesome performance, which works with the camera - I do not know why he agreed to try to pull out a stutter and Carr agreed. You see DVD-extracted accessories and it's a way to keep a camera - it just spills it-it's like to be in the center of attention. The actor is evil: Eric Schaffer reminded me of the proud filmmaker. Car, in the Young City Centers and in the New Age churches, showed this film about talking about the people affected and paying attention to themselves, and perhaps because of that, but as a movie, very heavy, predictable and sappy.
