Lotsa Yash Raj and Aditya Chopra, who seems to have lost their minds over the years and offer honest crew in this piece of film, is also not worth the standard of YouTube. When I started to finish my teeth with schizophrenia, my plot of land never took place and I felt ashamed at this last scene that my country and its crorepati film director would be "ATERO". Sorry for the actors for the work they do and much more they can comment on. Saif Ali Khan-the selection of your films is totally disappointed. Kareen shows puberty skin and Akshay is embarrassed. A new retarded fascination with English. His enthusiasm for their performance and in the last 15 minutes with strange cinematography, was enough to emit blood. Do not let the brain cells, energy or your money see to see this - Go see / rent with AMU instead of Konkana Sensharma - an independent piece of independent film that never goes out of India. He will touch all the smart actors and I hope that all is not in the Indian cinema.
