This is undoubtedly one of the worst movie ever I have ever seen ... <br /> <br /> The plot has many holes; The story is like a bad suspense film and a bad remake of actors. He was reading the manuscript like a sound for the first time. The worst is Steve Guttenberg. He plays the character "Police Academy", the same stupid female, which is not the best man to be a thriller. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult for Hanson to believe. Make the "LA Confidential" ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague ...
