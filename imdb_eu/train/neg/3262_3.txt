Although I was fortunate enough to meet George Pal (and still autographed by my DS: TMOB poster) in a convention, and asked me why he chose the "camp" movie. Before answering, I found two studio bags and gave me a lecture in "better known" in the studio and how "no one will ever take this serious movie". A few years ago, I read Bantamen reprinted by a friend (in the 1970s, attendees were reminded by Blackhaw and his team, I was with him in a couple of years), and I got more hope. . <br /> <br /> Flacks stressed that the great adventures would never be serious, and so it was the only way to "camp". Other fans jumped on my side, as well as Pal heard him. At the end of the little event, Pal came to us and apologized, trying to make it more and better. STAR WARS lying and Spielberg died a year after. and Lucas has proven that Doc Savage would be the easiest next movie franchise franchise ... if it were not flacks. <br /> <br /> Removing Doc Doc's history or history and being a movie would be worth the 6/10 worth of a popcorn popcorn. <br /> <br /> But destroying that heritage was not less than a baby's death. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Doc Savage can get on the screen and Indiana Jones can overcome the unavoidable comparison to the poorly informed, but it should seriously make the first American superhero hopefully proclaim the glory. <br /> <br /> SIDENOTS: Yes, there was a second script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL and it was much worse. Yes, it was shot at the same time, but mostly by actors and very few. And, yes, there's a page of Ron Ely leaping over a brick wall and something built with a brass gun that shakes his shoulder. Ely is a white shirt wearing a button with a bronze tie and "DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMY OF EVIL ... next summer!" Words. POSTSCRIPT: Everyone knows the studio bags with George Pal in 1975, about what San Diego was about for the convention, knocked the idols next to their heads and called the idiots. At that time, Dorkknobs and Fu Manchu dots and fabrics made trousers and made in the Paramount wallets.
