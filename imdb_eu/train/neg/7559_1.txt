This has been one of the worst fills I've ever seen and I've seen few. Slow, boring, he is a amateur - he does not even agree with the simplistic reading of the plot itself. Actors do not play. I can not blame you - everything you can do with a script that can do it, it has pain behind your eyes and has nothing to do with the wickedness in SummersIsle. <br /> <br> </ p> </ p> <p> There is not a moment in this film that is true and not a honest line, not a single current where one moves. Nicholas Cage's character is so badly drawn that he does not feel compassion for all his guilt. I do not doubt that I was seeing a man suffering, but Nicholas Cage was completely aware that it was the worst film in his career.
