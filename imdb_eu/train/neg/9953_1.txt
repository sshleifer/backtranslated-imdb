Soon I have to see a movie soon, because it seems that any other entry seems to be something I underestimate. However, my story speaks, I do not lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything around it absorbs green banana bananas. I never thought that this is just as daunting as the movies. Al Pacino is not playing in this movie: he's getting up. There are many scenes from his character, looking at the cameraman in the race car. It's wonderful. Marthe Keller is wrong. Both should be in love relationship and there is no chemical. Sydney Pollack directed this film? There is no trace of the genius behind Tootsie. Is it the same man who encouraged Eyes Wide Shut? I can not believe it. Save yourself a horrible movie experience. Run, do not walk away from Bobby Deerfield.
