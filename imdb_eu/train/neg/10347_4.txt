I saw Adam Had Four Sons the first time and I think they were Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. They were similar to the four boys in this film. When portrayed by Warner Baxter in Adam Stoddard, he spoke to the same values ​​and traditions of the 26th President, without the many aspects of TR's nature. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Stoddard children make a World War, in this case, even though the younger ones lose their eyes. <br /> <br /> But what happens if a sloppy woman enters everything that is home-grown and disrupts things? Here's the work of Susan Hayward. In one of his most prominent roles, Hayward is a flirtatious girlfriend of love, who is married to a child and has a relationship with another and performs for a third party. Later I wanted to be an Oscar-nominated Oscar as an actor. I want to live. <br /> <br /> I think Theodore Roosevelt and even a powerful model with Warner Baxter's portrait, they portray everyone. Father is afraid of what happens. The children and their governor, Ingrid Bergman. Here are plots something stupid. Bergman Baxter and his wife are presented as governors hired by Fay Wray for their children. Wray dies and Baxter suffers from financial delays in business. Bergman must leave. He returned to France and later returned to the family when the children grow up. <br /> <br /> I apologize, but I can not believe that children need a governor now. Hayward was very pleased that he did not bring himself back to the children. In the ordinary course of things, Bergman would take him with his life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous reviews has said that a quarter of the film has been edited. Perhaps, the hole in the plot could be a reason. <br /> <br /> Very badly Ingrid and Susan could not make another film in the 1950s when Hayward was at its height and only Bergman did it. a return <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason for Adam Had Four Four children. And I think that a large part of Ingrid has left the cutting room on the floor.
