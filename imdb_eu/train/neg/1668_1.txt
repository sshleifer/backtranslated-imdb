As well as being a music student, I thought watching movies in a conservatory might be fun. Little did I know ... (I did not know the movie was based on Britney Spears's book) This movie was no doubt. It is obvious that the writer who writes does not sit at the conservatory and does not know about classical music. I want to give you some examples: 1) There is no way anyone who will be included in the classical conservatory with no classical training! It's just enough to have a nice pop voice, something else - another genre, different techniques. The violin is like a request to learn the viola. 2) Why did the lady come to teach the theory of music in the jury's singers? If the singer was not a teacher, he would not say in such situations, and if he was a singer-teacher, why did not we say? 3) Being able to read music is essential if you get used to music. 4) How did you get that Angela video tape? It would be confidential, only for the jury's eyes. Now he got tape from just one teacher or scriptwriter. I wonder ... 5) The singer's teacher said that Holly had given a song to Carmen that she had "ranch", which clearly is NOT. Yes, he could sing the notes, but Carmen is a mezzo-soprano. Holly's voice seemed lighter, but not compatible with that song. 6) Worst: As far as classical music is concerned, the film shows ignorance, but does not try to hide. Angel's song is not recognized, a critically compassionate recital, where he cuts out shamelessly - Mozart would return in his grave. Carmen's Habanera was also curious and, at the end of the day, it was built, the producers show little about thinking about music: it's hard and boring, but they've added electric drums and guitars. Good as Britney Spears! I know they are small, but it would be so easy to avoid them with a little research. In any case, I thought that the characters and plots were suspended well. But without this, I have not found any quality changes in this movie, except one: it's a laugh.
