Seeing this stinker in Sandler's hands is a cruel and sensible sentence. Death is slow and painful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Buy DVD $ 5.88 Walmart- in. But the thought that echoes in my mind is: "How can I get my money back?" <br /> <br /> The unbelievable thing about the movie CAN NOT BE SATISFELY! <br /> Constructive suggestion: Mystery Comedy Theater. You know this show at SciFi Channel, where there are no movies with horror films (Mystery Science Theater) with some muppets and muppets. IMEDIATE, turn the comedy program and write this film. Although I'm not a fan of railroad disasters, I'm afraid Sandler continues with ice rods and motorcycles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
