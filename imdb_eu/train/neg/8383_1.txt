... Ever. This is the bottom difference. I'm not joking. The theater should be a warning. 'All expectations of what you are introducing here would be discarded'. <br /> <br /> I have no words to describe this movie in detail. His wonderful stupidity is not even fun. This movie is aimed at the slowest turtles in sandbox. The story was stolen by a 10-minute Bugs Bunny cartoon and then extended to 90-minute painful Mr. Fantastic. I think that the production pressure of producing Hollywood products is a blame for the fact that it is a blame. I'm sad and I think it was stupid enough to enjoy a good plot of 90 minutes based on cartoons. . I do not ruin anything, but the baby is actually a bad face by Marlon Wayans, superimposed over the central body. Finally I finished what it was. It's not a movie resolution, but we all got up and ended the end. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a star, but clearly it is less worth it. I do not believe the script is worth six minutes worth of a star. This is worth a Razzie and I pray to God when he gets that. <br /> <br /> When people learn it; If you pay to see this stupidity, they will stop. Seppuku is an alternative to this film. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned
