This movie was slow, but it was boring and theatrical landed frequently. Redgrave's character was a bit older than 60 people who tried to compete with Thurrman with 20 characters, Fox's personality. The title of the film should be "People on earth". Actors acted like in a play. Extreme foreclosure to start. I can not believe this as a comedy in this website!
