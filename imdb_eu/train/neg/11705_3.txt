This seemingly melodrama is the worst movie I've seen Ingrid Bergman. Even though the presence of its bright screens is not nearly impossible to keep a slim and storing movie, without much transportation. <br /> <br /> Only dumb monsters from Bergman; others are very likely to be asleep. Instead of "Bell Bell Tolls" I recommend you.
