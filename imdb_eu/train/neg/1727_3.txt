We have a lake We have an animated meteorite. We have deadly dinosaurs that stop the killer. Okay, so call this movie at CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm, Arnie & Mitch called two stupid people to define "comic relief". We also have no service at the cinema and no one listens. Badly, the movie is halfway and the guy is inserted! Do not worry, let's face it with a guy with a mustache, wanting to steal at the store to be a guy, then show him next to the lake, walk around the woods and finish all this. Dinosaurs as a snack food. That should work. <br /> <br /> The whole evil, evil, this movie. Logic turns your mind to force laughter from the inside. Dave Allen's new stop motion supervisor. After that, I joined Charles Band for many years until the mid-90s, when I thought the band was paying little money. The effects of the dinosaurs are charming and the movie is completely unpleasantly funny. Unfortunately, it's about good things that can be said about it. <br /> <br /> Good evil? Yes In the narrative of the logical expression, there should be sufficient grounds for listing. Otherwise, Arnie & Mitch will make a trick. 3/10 and 8/10
