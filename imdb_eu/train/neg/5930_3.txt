Hey, <br /> <br /> If you want to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen, you'll try to do it with Leonard Cohen! This only needs Leonard to ask the audience why the other singers are listening why they hear (why it is doubtful) why they hear it. Puleeze ... sound like those that revive their diary entries, who cares about Leonard? Guess people, if you're "worth something", someone will make a documentary about you. I particularly suggested the U2 members' parade as if they added credibility to this movie - NO. Leonard does not have any Bono or Edge talking about his spirituality. The filmmakers who could be honestly imagined a part of their spirituality in the film. Gee, what a concept! I'll give them with Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for Cohen tunes coverings. The rest of the shows got bored and others were overwhelming. you!
