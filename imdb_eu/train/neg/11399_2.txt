I can not believe that I was still waiting to see the terrible movie that I lost in my 80-minute life, which eventually improved, but I was wrong. The plot was abysmal, very poor performance and special effects was awful. Not even two pretty girls can revive my interest in this boring and bloody disorder. However, I can not lie, the lines in this film were quite memorable, for example, when the Asian boy says: 'I lost my virginity to the child career, so stereotypes'' <br /> <br /> <br /> please do it in vain If you miss your time with this crash, if you do not want to be prepared or laughed ... maybe you can watch this movie with some people
