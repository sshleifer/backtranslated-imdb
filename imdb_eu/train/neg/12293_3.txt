This is only embarrassed by David Hasselhoff. Well, let me bash. Nowadays, compared to the rubbish that they call terror, this movie is not bad. Leslie Cumming is beautiful. He's hot, but he can not speak very well. There's a brilliant scene with him when he rapes supernaturally. She shows her pretty body. Linda Blair does nothing with Hasselhoff. 3/10
