... and they can even watch it. To make it sound, this film (if you want to call it) is only true for bondage freaks. The fans of Bettie Page will not learn anything new (and I do not want anything to say *), nor to know about knowledge, love or something that is not loved. <br /> <br /> It has never been a great script, wood, less than the theater community's performance, lacking direction, pure lighting, or the rest of the production of the vaulted basement. This is definitely "Hey, kids, let's have a movie!" Making the least order movies. I think the camera could work at least as soon as possible. No, I feel that this is not the reason why this is precisely * wrong *. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> The Queen of the Curves with dark hair and trademarks, completely fails the recipient who overcomes the bond and gaggedness. It seems that this is very good for her film career before and after, but not particularly for bad mumbling, which is, above all, a terrifying dramatic biographical playmaker, who will determine her. The fall of the grace of the page (so to speak). More information may possibly be related to the initial and final credits of the page. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled. This is not a supporting film called "The Notorious Bettie Page". This is not worth the film. It's a fetish piece that strokes one of the greatest pin-ups of all time, and has no class, without style, and without understanding the nature of Bettie Page. Not a fan of a true Bettie Page will not find anything, but I guarantee that. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. If it's free, remember that time is also money. It may not be worth much more than yours, but I bet you feel that you do not waste a bit. That's it, I've finished, you warned.
