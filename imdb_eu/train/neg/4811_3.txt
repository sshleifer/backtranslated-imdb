I watched the Canadian video from this movie "Witching", somehow came to the New York State. Audio was pretty bad, I climbed about 7/8, I heard it, and the soundtrack had a great deal of conversation. Orson Welles was a mumbler, worse than usual, and his conversation and others were echoed through a chamber. The image that appeared again was a distorted image of the spirit. Closed captions were helpful! <br /> <br /> A group of witches or satanists (the latest credits do not have a team to represent a real group!) To have a ritual naked and to cause a staggering miscarriage doll. The woman with a miscarriage and her husband goes to a town called "Lilith", where she is given a job at a toy factory. The AKA of this movie does not see it as a "Toy Factory", although it is mentioned occasionally. <br /> <br /> On the way to Lilith, the husband gives patience with some. Mr. Cato about what he wanted to know about his new questions about his new boss. He drives aggressively and pulls out of the car and stops. After arriving at the police, he takes a doll from the car, second in the hands of many dolls in the film. <br /> <br /> Mr. Cato and all the citizens are witches, and they ... who caused his warning, but did not realize it. Because he wants to have a talented necromancy, he really did not know. <br /> <br /> Some of the movie images have an impact, but, in general, the movie is not very relevant. The movie seems to be a mess, and it's definitely a great deal of a rebuilding and footage. The original version, according to the final credits, is called Necromancy: a life a life. We can see both versions of the DVD Magic Disk, but re-publishing this movie is not a priority.
