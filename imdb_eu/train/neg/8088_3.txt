You need a good movie, excellent actors or excellent directors. You need at least one. In the eyes of the needle. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the name of the director. He could not do much in his career. I like Donald Sutherland, but he can not be the main actor in a movie. More or less. Sutherland is superb in a movie that spans more than 15 minutes. For example, Sutherland was superb at Oliver Stone JFK, when Oliver Stone spoke with Kevin Costner, without breathing on the bench for 10 minutes without interruption. Wonderful. The main actress of a Sutherland movie is not well. <br /> <br /> Kate Nelligan? It's probably good for TV series. DVD is awesome Awesome colors Immense light I could not appreciate the landscape of Storm Island for the honest photography. <br /> <br /> Ken Follett was a good story, but he feels guilty as an interesting movie.
