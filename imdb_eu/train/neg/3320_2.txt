I was very glad I watched the movie when I first started, but I've probably been one of the most boring films ever seen! It seems so much longer (and not short). Surely when he wrote the book Jane Austen, he made several pages, filled with descriptions and did not intend to read it. One day, or "Emma" surely dragged and loses the appeals. Now this "Sense and Sensibility" slowed down, but at least he had a lot of lines, as well as some good performances! <br /> <br /> That I fall into 2nd. this is, of course, acting. Although I do not pay much attention to anyone involved in this film, I'm sure they can do a good job, but I do not see much in this movie. As people were trying harder to become "harder", it was a tough British (yes, some of them), so they all had a lot of actors and not people. . <br /> <br /> # 3. Cast, as I said, just like the actors, and they were not like people who were playing. Maybe it's a good thing because the people playing was not so nice. Why, for example, all like Emma? Of course, he was pleased with the rich and beautiful people, but his back was on his back. If his friends were "ugly", then he did not throw back his back. So why is this pretty girl so beautiful? Why do people have to tell "to laugh?" Of course, the snob could not do that. I had quite a bit of trouble with Gwyneth Paltrow with Gwyneth Paltrow, and his "Emma" did not change my mind in detail. <br /> <br /> Well, I easily see, I was not responsible for that. I'm sure it's a great book, but some books are not for the big screen, and it's one of those "Emma".
