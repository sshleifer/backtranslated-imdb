Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) lives in a nursery girl, Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole), who recently lost her mother. Rosalie, however, is missing her dead mom and is constantly visiting her grave (next to the cemetery next to the cemetery) ... where she also knows "friends" ... <br /> <br /> This cemetery sequence is terribly It starts with good, and then it falls. The story is thin and it does not fill a ton of filler for 85 minutes. The play is horrible (Cole being the easiest). I was wrong with the hardest jobs I've ever seen in a directed movie. Scenes (and sound) are rhyme or without reason. In addition, the film has a great post-production sound. <br /> <br /> Regarding blood and violence, forget it! It is very small and looks very fake. I have never seen such a seeming blood - it looks like ketchup! Unhappy, senseless - a directly forgotten movie. You can jump on this.
