Director Ron Atkins is mad This low-budget movie, written by Harry Russo (writes by John Giancaspro himself), is a few days of life; Rubberneck doll is a work that she receives from her girlfriend. In order to take the doll orders the drugs to take a massive amount of rape and kill, not always in that order. It begins as a film that is exploited on the wall of the exploitation wall, which is still the case, but it is very repetitive very quickly. I'm more likely to be insane. It's never seen without forgetting. As Tom Green did a horror movie. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell is naked; Jasmin Putnam showed tits and shrubs. ANTI-eye candy: John is completely naked
