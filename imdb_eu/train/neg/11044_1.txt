This very bad movie, Australia's 'Hydrosphere', is very bad to become a hypnotist and see it to the end, to see if it could be worse ... and to see it! The story is so predictable, as it seems written by high school theater classes, the sets are pathetic, but smaller than the miniatures, and the actor is wood. <br /> <br /> The baby seems like 'muppet'. 'Restore' from the closet of the portal. It seems that the whole idea of ​​the whole movie is not. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to me very bad, when I laughed at the same time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell must shame herself. Of course, he needed money!
