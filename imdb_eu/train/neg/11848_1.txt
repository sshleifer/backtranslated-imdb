It's about a simple general mystery about a philanthropist who is a fictional story about a bunch of characters (Ginger Rogers, the only great actor at the very beginning). Killer apartment between a small apartment cast in a building. These characters are completely stupid and absurd. As a cheap and inexpensive production budget, most actions are related to Rogers and his head (the guy, I do not like who he really is), talking about different ways of solving delinquency, despite being constantly. An absurd detective has cut off his ass. Honestly, I've never had a worse time to watch a movie of this type of b rate old and I've seen real fans. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the misfortune has not been done. there was no main board. But be aware of the type closest to a desktop. No go <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
