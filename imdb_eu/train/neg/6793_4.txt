Regardless of what Richard Brooks looks like in the west, it seems to be very involved in the genre, keeping all the usual clich√©s. In the early 1900s, it attracted a small horse race (Gene Hackman), a playful toy (James Coburn), an awesome boy (Jan Michael Vincent) and a FEMALE (amazing game of Candice Berg). If you make preliminary debates (an undisputed part of a woman), the entry becomes quite penetrating, although it does not have any other terrain (which resembles Gary Cooper's time). Good looks, long pieces with a brick stick and a good cast, but the plot mechanism is quite laborious. ** ****
