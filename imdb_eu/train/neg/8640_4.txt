I saw 3/4 in this movie and he asked me why we made awful reviews here. It was pretty easy to see (3:00 p.m.). He had a good cast: the role of the killer of the series of the Kevin Dillon series was very credible and even karasmatic. The rest of the main characters were not so bad. <br /> <br /> This is a typical Stalker / suspense film. Spouses can not understand, they go to clinical fertility assistance. The donor refers to the recipients of a "genetic material", and usually stalkers form into their lives. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the movies were pretty good ... We'll grow "Conan". He is increasingly obsessed with raising his baby and creating a perfect family with his mother. Actually, things are not as it was for him. It is not a bad plot plot. <br /> <br /> But the last 15 minutes was horrible. I am tolerant of films (especially at 3:00 p.m.). But, I was surprised at the end he wrote. Really scoffed outloud! <br /> <br /> In the end, I did not see the worst film I saw, but I would not have to sit down again (unless I jumped in the end). Kevin Dillon's role was only one of the best quality: one of the best killer ever ever. <br /> <br /> Try to see other ways before seeing this ... But, if it's not better, I would try ... =)
