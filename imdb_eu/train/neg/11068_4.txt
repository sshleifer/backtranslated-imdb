Dahmer, a confused young man. Dahmer, a confusing movie. When I had finished, I had some beer for my beginner, but this did not explain to me that I was bored. <br /> <br /> His flashbacks are confusing and annoying, and it's not a real story. The beginning and the end, the only thing that makes sense of the film was the text that depicts the film on the cover and at the end. The things between the film are just a boring image and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> We never saw the murder, it's all just an innuendo range. Sometimes, Dahmer thinks it's the whole thing, but it does not know that <br /> <br /> is based on a true story, at least most of it happened. But what happened? It's not easy to say. <br /> <br /> I do not encourage people to lose this time in this leak. <br /> <br /> I did not like it curiously and suddenly I felt the scam. <br /> <br /> * / *****
