Imagine a group of scriptwriters sitting down at a table and saying, "a black woman calls closer to the unbelievable people (black) in the street and asks her to say black." Other writers are istysicly laughing. They suggest one repeat until each section. More laughter Now, if you think the premise is fun, and if there are a lot of these kinds of shows, you will enjoy this show. In the rest, use zappera and find something fun with more dry paint. Those who have written a brilliant report on this show should watch out for a more comedic TV show or have fun. Another example of the show's humor is that a girl tries to pay for the supermarket payment trying to hypnotize the box. For the first time it is marginally funny, but why repeat it with different shows with Kutxa? I can give other examples, but they will only be treated as a spoiler, this comedy will not be just fun.
