By giving me three points I would give her the original Soviet version of my film. American-International (a studio specialized in low-budget 60s rates) seems to have bought and completely destroyed - adding two-hour movies to a 64-minute movie! In addition, in these 64 minutes there has been much new material (for example, "monsters"); So you know that this film does not look like the original. The original movie seems to be fairly drama about Soviet conquest against Soviet space, although I do not know originally! To read the original movie, read Steven Nyland's review - it was very helpful. <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw Americans and internationalists as a third-party scientist who was later hacked. In addition, to make a "new" movie - a standard practice for making a Buck on the screen for any company that was ready to do anything - if, of course, it did not cost much more than a dollar at first! This American film was about two world powers (NOT U.S. and the Soviets) who wanted to be the first Mars. The "bad jokes" fail and they go to Martha after saving a stupid astronaut from "good men". Unfortunately, they are temporarily landed on the moon on Mars, where REAAAALLY cheesy (some American-born add-ons) see some monster and some similarities to female anatomy are similarities. Then they are rescued - Return to the heroes of the Earth. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie has died, a piece of art that is terribly beautiful (this time) has become a grade C. movie That is why the Soviets had a reason for America's hatred! I'm surprised to see that the incredible work A-I with this film was not convinced to sell more films with these attacks! You have to find a laugh, but the bad times that make you laugh. So, the movie is not bad at all, it's not bad enough for movie makers and it's essential to watch it. I would really like to see this movie in its original form; It was a picture.
