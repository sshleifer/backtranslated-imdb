Well, my God, I am disappointed. When I announced a remake of the movie "The Haunting", written by Robert Wise in 1963, I was afraid that it would destroy the abundance of suntan-sized effects. But, deeply, I had faith. Undoubtedly, this tale is entirely in vain ... De Bontek and the companies do not break the movie, the original was a wonderful and horrifying movie, he understood the delicate art of subtlety. Well, subtlety, where are you now! ?? My fears have appeared ... the hopeful movie has gone wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is jaw-dropping; The movie is wonderful in the photo; and Jerry Goldsmith has never made a mistake. But the script tries on good actors - offers a melancholic conversation that only speaks in the movies. In the end, always wonderful, Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape dignity ... and that's just about. But the crime of all crimes is to see fear. We can not use our imagination, fear fear fear fear fear. No, we will get some visual effects to the US, what we fear ... and what do you know? They realized just as well ... the visual effect is stupid. And the peak is a ghostly mess ... but many things went wrong before that. <br /> <br /> The Haunting's all is really and abusive. I am afraid that there is no horrible thunder or horrible slug in the monsters of the ancient houses ... just groans. Check the original <br /> <br />
