The Earth is very interesting ... a scientist (Bateman) discovers the animal's eyes and nerves how to transpose optics into other animals, like humans. A young man (Monteith) blinds himself before a colleague who works - a scientist has received a call for a young man to be the first human recipient. The receiver begins more and it's a wolf, but the effect is only "weird eyes" and the dogs run at night! (for the whole movie) The quote is very low, the interview is very compact (I laughed in some loud laughing debates), and acting is not inept. The long part of the movie is a wild dream, mysterious music and wild wolves. Over 90 minutes too, boring and unintentionally. <br /> <br /> The military want to use eye transplants to return to wounded soldiers, and allegedly want to militarize technology. A beautiful Indian girl (Korey) has a stupid subtype, she can help her think, Indian wisdom wolves. They make love while drums and Indian songs are heavy. The death of love happens immediately after a terrible murder. The "medicine" of a taste of Platitude seems to make little, except for additions to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Here are two hilarious scenes. A research laboratory staff enters the animal room to find out about the boats. It scared, the monkey looks to the left, rotates to the right, rotates left to the left, rotates left ... This continues a bit (who edited this ??). They counted DAMN LAB! It was so stupid to start laughing. Our ridiculous scene - our heroine is at home, escapes while armed men get to the window - the window opens, the military boys go to the open windows, they look from the window, "it seems to be here," and leave! He opened the window, boys! Crazy <br /> <br /> After finishing the movie, the military boys shoot their tracks on their tracks repeatedly, of course, there is nothing - I think it's easier to locate. They have 6 guns that cut the trees, but our heroine wants to fight with a knife! Shoot guy !! Who wrote this rude one? In the end, I did not make any savings and believe that I'm not doing anything wrong. There is not enough land to ruin. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think it was a tax deduction or a bad job. To make the most out of budget money from the best movie.
