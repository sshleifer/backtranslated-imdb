James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to a mental illness facility to assign a doctor's office with Dr. McCort (Bruce Paynes). In it, he realizes that many interns are dying, "The Ripper," who carries his soul to the devil, Dr. In a worship promoted by McCort. This story is so absurd and absurd that it is impossible to write a summary. The interviews are so hilarious, especially when the character of Helen arrives at the blonde protector of German James Bishop, it is almost unbelievable that a writer has the courage to have the script. And what about bringing James back to the hospital with the death files? And cast, consisting of ham actors and actors? Honestly, I do not know who or who is the worst in this movie: script, director or cast. The correct answer is, of course, all. I saw this cable television movie, and I'm surprised how a producer can spend money on these junk. This horror movie turns out to be very funny considering the plot's nonsense. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Demonio '(` Devil')
