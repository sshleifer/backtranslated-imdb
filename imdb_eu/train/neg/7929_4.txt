I think it's interesting in science fiction and horror stuff. The play is fine, but it's not great. Two pregnant women are supposed to be fifteen, but at that time there were twenty-one and over-obsolete actors. The plot is in good shape, but the story is a little leap, letting Boston or Pennsylvania think about it. Apparently, the priest uses the tilting speed. The Catholic Church shows that there is a secret sect to investigate incidents that occur only in that faith. What would happen to both Protestant girls? Could we take care of the Catholics? So something was invented. Who knows, some days, the Catholic Church can also learn what the Bible teaches. If you have not lost this, you have not lost anything.
