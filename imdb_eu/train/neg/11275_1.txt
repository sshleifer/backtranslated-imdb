This "LOCK STOCK" clone is really awesome with a star star and a great script. I do not know why so many British actors have been involved in these junk, they must be confused. If the game of an old match lasts forever and forever and I have not paid any money, I would deactivate it after 10 minutes. He never saw the worst movie ever seen, the honor that he makes of the true pathetic honor (I use "GUMMO" in vain) ("I tell him the director" when he missed it and half of my life), but the bin is almost right. Without a doubt, the 5 worst movie I've ever seen. Hollywood reminds such things, they really do not have a monopoly of horrible movies.
