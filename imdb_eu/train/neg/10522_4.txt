This movie uses a rather original idea: I never saw the nymphs that were not filmed from heaven. However, the way that this idea is executed is not the original; We will continue with a series of children, who for some reason decide to travel through the woods. The forests that inhabit the Nymph make it more interesting than other forests made up of butterflies / sites / zombies; But really, monsters are just one of the most common horror variants of the forest theme. Many films of this kind do not seem like a single idea, and it seems to have been used only by brain cells. The real assets that they bring on the monsters on the table is not that they are beautiful characters that are not their favorite characters, but instead of being superb grotesque who want to escape. That's good until one point; but it is soon bored and ensures that any background story that surrounds the central monsters is virtually incomplete, so that movies never get out of the "horror trash" category. <br /> <br /> A few years ago The Evil Dead forest turned into a terrific horror scene and was a movie like The Blair Witch Project; He still has a great horror setting. This is one of the main assets of the film, because it provides a good impression on the forest - the only problem is that the Damned Forest is never a huge blanket. The sequence of death shows an unimaginable lack of imagination, and the fact that all the characters are an extreme topic does not help but kill them, as they wait for their hopes. Especially young people are cast, but Tom Savini's role is here; who unfortunately does not play in special effects section. The film has a real importance in terms of staff: the nymphs themselves generate. Bare women look good, and if they do not, this movie would be very boring. She does not really recommend this film; But if you want a little horror movie that looks back on the backdrop of the eighties forest, you can enjoy it here.
