There are many commentaries that have already been published, as I have felt about this film. <br /> <br /> I thought the "Grinch" was wonderful - Jim Carrey really is a talented comic physicist. versatile and intelligent actor (I think). On the other hand, Mike Myers laughs annoyingly. I liked the likes of "Waynes World" and "So I Married a Ax Murderer" very well - but I have never liked Austin Powers and "Cat the Hat in" has just finished. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible - the gags were awesome! It is considered suitable for children not adapted for children, but some of them dated, nobody liked 50 years ago! The plot was bad, nasty and confusing! It's a pity that the children were really nice as it was "the mother". It is likely that they would choose a better evil than Alec Baldwin, but he could not remove Myers ugly and not as if he were a portrayal of Cat's late-acting accident. <br /> <br /> I mean - did Myers even look at the script? Is it written? The other actors seemed to be one, but it seemed like Cat was flying! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I would like to mention that they were wonderful sets and props! But sadly they do not save this movie. <br /> <br /> Dr Seuss's poor - man was a genius! You do not ruin his reputation, adapting his work in a relaxed and confusing way!
