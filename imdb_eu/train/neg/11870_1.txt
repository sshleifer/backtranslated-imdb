This is the sadest movie I have ever seen. I saw a child and I'm thinking about it. I know it was a time of hard life and I know that people were poor and crops were essential. Yes, I get all this. I find it difficult to remember that I have only one clear moment in the whole movie. Life can be honest, I do not know. I'm sure the filming of the performance was first and foremost. That direction and quality were wonderful and I know that all the movies can not be happy, but as a family movie, I think it's really fun. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend anyone to be entertained by a movie. I can not stress this enough movie for me as a child. I was talking about it recently, and all the sad memories went back. I think it would be a no-brainer for Prozac.
