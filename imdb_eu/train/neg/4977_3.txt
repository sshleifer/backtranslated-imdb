Beowulf's story is a story of Beowulf's television and rather the Science-fiction channel after the latest film "Beowulf and Grendel". This movie does not fit the story of Beowulf, but it fights against the terrifying beast Grendel, when he leaves the fear of the kingdom and absolute anxiety, Beowulf asks him to get rid of the monster in rampage. If successful, the king will not continue to sacrifice his children. After a few failed attempts, the creature has been killed, but the angry and the wicked mother is soon attacked, leaving Beowulf to his courage and strength. "Grendel" seems to have shot in a small budget and the CG effect is horrible. As I said, this movie is not necessary.
