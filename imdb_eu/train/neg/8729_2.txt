This is a good concept thriller, good performance, good photography and good intentions, but when it's done, it's mixed and unpolluted. <br /> <br /> Garciak is John Berlin, a forensic detective moving. In a small town in California asking for a friend's power. Shortly thereafter, he is not participating in an unprepared murder, thanks to the theorizing of a series that is believed by anyone else. He knows someone who believes. The well-known victim is theorized to be blind, creating romance with a blind girl. to be witnessed - in a nearby blind school <br /> <br /> <br /> In an intriguing story, I found that there were too many quantum leaps and holes in this movie, I asked myself, "How did we do it? are you here? 'or' how did we find this? ' I have found a mixture and an imbalance, although it's a good performance, etc. John Malkovich has a small part of the F.B.I. researcher in Berlin. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended.
