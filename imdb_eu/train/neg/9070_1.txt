Slackers is just another movie for watching deserve it. Dave (Devon Sawa), Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael C. Maronna) will graduate from Holden University, honorary lie, fraud and betrayal. Three classmates have been proud of over the last four years of college and, nowadays, in the final examinations, the big men at the campus will receive unpolluted escort schools. The plot is very stupid and there is no reason to see why you do not want to close yourself for some time. Slackers is just a front-line movie for teens who have nothing new to the genre. The Slackers comedy hit or lost but there is no real or original movie of the movie. It's really just a gag collection and some are really fun. Although there are at least eight more for every joke they work on. The script is filled with a penis and breast joke, because they enjoy high school and college students. Although they probably do not remember this movie, while the comedy is not memorable. Jason Schwartzman plays Ethan horrible and has broken a bit after appearing on comedy. Jaime King and Devon Sawa are the main stars, but they do a bad job on this movie. Directed by Dewey Nicks, this is his first movie, so you can not blame too much. The most entertaining character was Laura Prepon, but it's not a lot of the movie. The movie is too short for 86 minutes, maybe some people who do not like humor may be too long. Slackers is not the worst movie in 2002, but it's definitely below the average. Compared to other films in this genre, it's much better, such as Teen Movie, American Pie and its follow-ups, Scary Movie 1 and 2, etc. So, if you do not see most of them and are looking for something new. then maybe Slackers may adjust this bill, but it's better if you see something else. Rating below 4.3 / 10 average average cheat worthy to skip.
