I must admit that I am a great fan of this show, so you should know what I was disappointed when I saw this movie. First of all, the plot was horrible, I thought something interesting, Arnold wanted to see what happened to her or something more interesting, but she wanted to destroy NOOOOOOO, mania, Arnold house, among many other places. Many people try to stop it. <br /> <br /> Soil was not so bad at the end, but it really sucked Arnold and his friends to stop this maniac. spy friends; They drive a bus (based on a video game, for the sake of God), and worse, they make super-movements on the bus, because many people have already tried and killed, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga. They are experts in a video game. <br /> <br /> Honestly, my mother, sister, I am also disappointed after seeing this movie. In fact, it was the worst way to end the good cartoon. I must admit, "Hey Arnold!" I enjoyed being Nickelodeon's favorite cartoon, but after the disaster of this movie, I'm not sure I'm "Hey Arnold!" See it. as I saw in the past. <br /> <br /> Among other things, Nickelodeon, with a large number of dynamites, can assure that a simple street will not explode, I think it could explode the whole city, oh, and please all future movies of your favorite cartoon, Do not make more films, you're a bad critician. Cartoons are good. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think it was the worst way to end this show, a good show that turned this movie into a vacuum.
