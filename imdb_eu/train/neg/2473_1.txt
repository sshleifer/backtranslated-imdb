If my grandmother has movies, they would probably do much better than this ... bad thing ... the main characters (mother, father and son) are fine. She is especially a moody actress, and the baby is also pleasant in particularly scary scenes. But the director knows the meaning of Plot Point, Triller and Good Script. The script does not evolve to become a suspense in the atmosphere. If you want to follow the trees, you can surely enjoy it, or stay home and sleep. Oh ... actually, there was something fun: the movie was 2001, but we can not realize that the image is so bad (similar to mini-dv) and cars so old (like 70 and 80 years old).
