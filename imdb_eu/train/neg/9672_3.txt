Although most of the films are very amateur, the Kosher killing scene is played, but it is not a lie. Kosher says the law requires that the animal touches the skin of the palm. The kosher murder scene is accurate as anyone who saw or saw a murderous Killian movie Peta, where animals cut their throats and saw the esophagus alive while watching consciousness and suffering. We must remember that the victors have written history. What's more, can they give permission for the Nazi to think it might be correct too? <br /> <br /> Is not it said that some of the Nazis have forbidden this religious murder and that Jews are still practicing today?
