We all know that the slasher genres of the 80s have been numerous and often deserve our deepest adventure. Maybe it's a bit harsh, but the damn "Slaughter High" was not very original, even for Slasher Flick. The groundbreaking story of Carrie's humble showering is much closer to the old building, and he returns to the old building, looking for revenge of an old bullies group that reveals all the memories. As you expect, on April 1, a damn gets drunk constantly, electro-friction, burning, hanging and chemically-modified beer. I have had problems with the details and settings of this movie, but at the end I feel the need to exclude my complaints and to say it is a waste of time. Ignore the thoughts to see this movie ...
