I saw this movie, because it was the main Mira Sorvino. With her cast she can not be so bad. It also seems mysterious, and Olivier Martinez was his boyfriend at that time and was pretty "loyal". The story is set in Spain, so it could be an exotic movie that is entertaining to one of my favorite actors. <br /> <br /> If you think the same thing, please let us know: this is really horrible and interesting. boring film The only adjective that one thinks is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The story does not add to the narration with subplots. They try to build a slingher / thriller in Spain, but they fail. Twisters have no credibility and the so-called research does not take them anywhere. <br /> <br /> Characters are thin paper! I did not care about anyone. These people are more hateful and hateful. <br /> <br /> The operation is stunted. What happens to you? Why Look? You are the Oscar winner! Keep dignity! His character was weak, but that was not a huge excuse. It seems like a long movie. Think of it, I think it's really close to me that it closed me in some scenes. I thought the woman was sexy. Well, it's not here. If you want to look for some skin try Romi and Michelle, because there is nothing to see here. And that accent? My gods ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is even worse. It is very painful to remember his work here. Sorry but I can not. I've just been with this junk ... <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a disappointment! It's so bad in every way how wonder was it. Bad team to produce incorrect writing and earn money from the cast. Do not fall <br /> <br /> Avoid! <br /> <br />
