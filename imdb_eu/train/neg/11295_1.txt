I understand that this movie is for kids and there are many films that do not support my particular interest as a parent, but I can see constructively from the point of view of my children. Parents should be encouraged to participate in their children's activities and to monitor the quality of entertainment they see, so it should be something that should be geared towards adults' audiences on some levels in children's films. Disney has always understood this and that's why it's hard to figure out how to give her a whole piece of this kind as her name suggests. <br /> <br /> Technically, the sound editing is awful and it is considered in more than one conversation. duplicate and natural Personally I hate it, but it was a bit overwhelming that the same interview was written by a 12-year-old school. He reminded me of a play at the "Operation" school and one of the children's actors did not even have emotion in their voices. Fortunately, it was a very short film. <br /> <br /> Now, it is like a video game, a positive message is something that can save the worst movie for children, if it is a movie for kids that shoot a stick with a movie for kids. It's far from me to determine how to give me a message, as it is on the right hand side. Give this video a look at what posts are posted: <br /> <br /> If you've lost it, do not worry, you'll find the way home. <br /> <br /> Approach wild animals without any fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any competition because you "know" it. <br /> <br /> and my favorite, the last message left in the film: <br /> <br /> Accept to disobey the figures and do what you think is right.
