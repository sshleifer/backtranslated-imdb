There's no story! It's unpredictable hope! With a fast tracker, based on a car based on a brakes and auto transmission lever, it is not good! I would stop that vehicle for a minute, either in it or in the police car. I'm sorry I feel the actors with so much handwritten books. There were few scenes of acting similar to action, far away from realities. In addition, there were many legends, for example, the hood of the fugitive vehicle was 100 km. At first, he just folded over the wind, like in reality, but then he knocked on it. The vehicle was later seen in the movie ... <br /> <br /> The movie was annoying, but do not go far!
