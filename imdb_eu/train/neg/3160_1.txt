When you're watching a comedy when you're there, its fun part are the Animal Collections. It's a shame, at the same time, the flower, that Cat & Dog was alone and not the other way around, because humans were very handsome. <br /> <br /> If you're Paul, Eva, Lake (what's that name), Jason, and Lindsay. I would have forgotten that play and something else, as you are all fun, like to see paintings and dreadful actors. <br /> <br /> The main gag of the film is one of the characters that are shouting, I am not gay, that is, as if it were not fun, you could change yourself with three insanity, boring and daring to say The most common women in the film . <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've ever seen, and I hope I will never see a bad one, but I do not expect it.
