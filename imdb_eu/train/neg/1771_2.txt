Without a doubt, I have to be one of the worst movie ever I've ever seen. The only thing that is interesting in this film is the appearance of some great genres and the King himself. The film has a great premise, but the story falls around 15 minutes. In this movie, Madchen Amick liked it and I think he can have a good career in the whole movie.
