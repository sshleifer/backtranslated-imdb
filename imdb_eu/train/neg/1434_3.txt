James Bond in the desert? Well, it looks like Pierce Brosnan Bond is called "Tommorrow Never Dies" (1997) and "Golden Eye" (1995), filmed before two versions. In fact, the two directors of the film are misunderstood, Brosnan makes the film more convincing, and Annie Galipeau (Pony, Gray Owl love affair) is able to fight with conversations written carefully. <br /> <br /> Two aunts, on the other hand, are perfect. But the movie is not about aunt. It is about the Canadian wild wilderness. And although photography may be beautiful, there is no real reality in the wild. Annie Galipeau, as Pony, was unfortunately not convinced, unfortunately, because I wanted to believe it. He had thirty years of experience in this film, and could work, but Richard Attenborough might not have been hard enough. It's hard to imagine, of course ... but in a bad way. <br /> <br /> But one thing surely appears, the perfect image. But in the desert thickening mascara and eyebrows? It's just not good enough, above all, it just seems that wild trials run with Bond (sorry, Gray Owl), and use photo gifts for close-up kissing. <br /> <br /> I've been living in the Pacific Ocean Pacific people, and they simply do not look pretty and keep alive in the fight for survival. This will lead me to another point: the time does not recall the movie: The 1930s. I blame here, above all, for a bit of scriptwriter who likes preaching through dramatic arches, plot points, and occasional actions to preach little detail. <br /> <br /> William Nicholson wrote the script. , and his last offer, "Elizabeth, Golden Age" opened three days ago, so I hope that it is an improvement. <br /> <br /> Yes, I have read some comments published by others, but I'm not persuaded. Great potential, but poorly managed and perhaps misguided. If he had an religious movie, he would not break it down, but because he preached to the environment, the film is over criticism, because it is "politically correct." Sorry, though, I do not buy. Amen
