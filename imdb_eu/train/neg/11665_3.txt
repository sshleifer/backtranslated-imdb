I liked the movie a lot, emotionally, intellectually and visually. It does not have violence, no sex, no special drug or effect, and it does not have to be in any way, paying attention to all the time, by listening, with stories and wisdom. <br /> <br /> However: [1] some accents of foreign languages ​​have heard and understood a difficult conversation; [2] there is no need to swear abuse (especially the word, which is considered to be the movie). [3] The film is balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the emotion over the whole film over the last minute resolution is unpleasant as a result of a long and permanent dysfunction reaction. He lives for a long time in the depths of tiredness and depression. [4] I do not recommend the movie for the five seconds of the background story, because it did not apply it to the movie or the movie was somewhat added - it's back to the movie and it has stopped behind me. Full movie after the brain: the old German mother of the main character, watching the second films of World War II, "hidden roots in Germany." There was no "local color" or art if the Nazi wins a war. I do not know that today's Germans think they are a better place for the victory of the national world today.
