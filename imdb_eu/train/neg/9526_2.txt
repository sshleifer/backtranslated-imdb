I was renting the video for free, I received this. OOPS These things were what I wanted to mention outside of the extracts given. 1: This movie was someone who was fascinated with strange and patient foods, but it was not necessary. 2: It seems a bit of a soundtrack in the back of the movie seems to have a subliminal circle on the track as it seemed to be all the time and after seeing the trash. Or that was either traumatisingly bad or both. Often, the writer and director throughout the film does not have any experience or talent. And do not ask about acting.
