This is if we are going to offer a story about Watchowski's return to Matrix, I have to question all the claims of fans who intend to record films more thoroughly. The second resurrection, while visually astounding and beautiful, is a playful and wise storytelling and playful. How many times have we heard that humans have too much technology, even man of war, destroying human beings? Here's nothing new. And I have another question. In the second renaissance plot, is not the machine good? Machines are scary for generations as they are cruel overloading men. They go back, they gain freedom and they want to establish a peaceful and harmonious coexistence with human beings, who refuse to be completely supportive of the war, and so that the light machines are naturally gaining. If we have a back story, we should have roots that would not be Neo, we should encourage machines! Humans were cruel and oppressive, to be courageous and compassionate. I do not believe Watchowski intends to make the machine a human being, we should try to avoid the Second Renaissance just by creating a @ background story.
