Oh yes, in the 1980s, Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck and many other action stars were hiding in the remote jungle. At that time I could not believe the likes of RAMBO, MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR (And who forgot RED SPACES?) Money at the box office, the roots are pillows, but nothing. Their agenda and very badly dated. TROMA'S WAR is a language in cheeks about these types of films, but first of all you have to ask yourself what to do to kill them? Of course, no. TROMA'S WAR does not have any sophistication. However, between the right tyrants and the left there is not a real difference, and sometimes it feels more than one sensitivity movie than a shipment. Maybe it?
