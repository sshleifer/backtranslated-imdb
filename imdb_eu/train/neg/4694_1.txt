I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig while attending the Austin SXSW Film Festival. However, I was longing for the chairs to be finished with great seats. Big Rig is a "big" driver who wanted to deliver goods sold throughout the United States. The characters are wonderful people; however, filmmakers never profoundly enter into the complexity of their people. Instead, the story of movies is more and more a series of movies, but never before. At best, we're lost. The audience - we will not go anywhere, and like the direction of the story teller, we will finish somewhere without direction, location or plot. Why are we here Where are we How do we get there? The storytelling is wonderful and the managers find a "humanizing" and "invisible" group of people who are nonsensical and enthusiastic. Here is the problem instead of truck drivers instead of drivers. The directors assert noises about the truck driver and then edit the film to confirm these suppositions. In general, the story does not have a strain, the movie is too long (it should be a draft of 15 minutes), "So, what is" the big question is never answered, and the whole movie is part of visual propaganda. nothing more "to clarify" (directors say) about the outside world.
