Although it's an excellent cast, this is not remarkable, especially from aviation perspective. It may be much better than "von Richthofen and Brown" jewelry, but not much. "Blue Max" continues to be one of the smallest markets in the last 35 years, while "Darling Lilli" is really fun, if not seriously. It is interesting that ILM can do what Zeppelins and Gothas can do with speculation with a new high quality WW I aero film.
