The movie started strong, LL Cool J (Deed) as a police officer, Sgt. With partner Lazerov (In practice, Dylan McDermott, surely it might be bad?) Burglary and murder. The deed relinquishes the drug dealer, who sets the conscience of a dirty policeman. Other great names (Freeman, Spacey et al.) Are well-molded and promises a movie. <br /> <br /> The short movie begins as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) enters. Making it easy for people to see more than once, or for those who see Timberlake once and for all, I would choose the first one. Although talented actors must work hard in their work; Timberlake is NOT talented and hard work is not saved. I thought it would put on a better show, which had been very talented in the years. Everything he did in this film was not convinced. <br /> <br /> Because a singer sells millions of discs and sells their stadiums, they will not automatically return to feature long movies. N'Sync hardcore fans will not be able to discard undeniable acting talent. <br /> <br /> This excludes some holes in the hole, such as Pollack's sniper chip and the deadly operation of repository machinery. This movie had so much promise. Well disappointed
