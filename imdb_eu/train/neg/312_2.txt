If you have ever seen this movie, you should know this! If you do not want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest you watch this movie, it's the worst. So get bored, rent it. If you want to know what you want, here's my little summary: Adam Sandler is working on a huge cruise ship with Ms Universe models and working with five other people. Adam does not like how the passengers take their kids, and tries to overcome them with jokes. BUT waiting! It's only worse! You should rent the film yourself to see it really bad.
