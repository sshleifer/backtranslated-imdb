I hated this show when I was a baby. That was the day when the children had accents that showed their characters, we did not usually have the American general dialect. Jack Wild was accentuated by the British and was in the south of Pufnstuf. Like any of the aforementioned, however, I have never understood what agreement the witch wanted flutes. This was always strange to me, surely the flute was annoyed and I would not have had any problems to get rid of! <br /> <br /> Only one comment on McDonald's ads at the beginning of the 70s at Pufnstuf. Others have mentioned: Pufnstuf brought it to McDonalds. With McDonald's reputation, a television show (or rather, its creators) allowed McDonald's characters to their show, but when McDonalds denied television, the characters changed a bit and passed them. The McDonalds advertiser and senior voice actors also hired to make television shows. McDonald took him to trial and won. Search for the Pufnstuf McDonaldland issue and a variety of articles on it.
