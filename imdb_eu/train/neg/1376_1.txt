Among all the films (and I'm a filmmaker, if that's deserved, this is the movie I've ever seen). I know there are still some worse, I have not seen yet, but I have seen that, and this is the worst. One night we rented a friend and one, Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being a young man and being late. It's not a credit! His mission was very small! How did she do it on the skin? The IMDb also does not feature in his filmography. The film was so bad that we wrote the release when we came back to the video store, and we slipped inside the case. Read something like this: "save your customers if you do not have to watch the whole movie and absolutely bad!"
