Ruth Roman was an entertaining entertainer of the real life of the philanthropist to help enter the exit of the airport near San Francisco and to entertain troops. Warner Bros. Many celebrities feature a starlet star that is emerging as a love-deaf person and Air Force Corporal between penetrating and green corporation (Ron Hagerthy, who should deliver his bicycle newspaper). He thinks the body has deceived the actress to think he is entering into a crew of a battleship. Honestly, he thinks he's flying and flying (he would have thought he'd be happy, but he would play it like that). Like most women in the 1950s with movies. About Doris Day about thirty minutes or so, and the numbers of his beautiful songs and laughter are very enjoyable. Roman is also here, glamorous, James Cagney makes fun on his screen and Gordon MacRa sings in his beautiful baritone. She also sings Jane Wyman following the head of Doris Day, who repeats the night at the hospital, asking her to wonder. An interesting flashback for an unforgettable audience, another time and place. However, only low-wage production and good technical aspects are strictly enforced by the "Starlift" second bill. * 1/2 ****
