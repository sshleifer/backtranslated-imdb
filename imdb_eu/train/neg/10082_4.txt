I laughed through that rotten movie. It's so unbelievable. A woman leaves her husband for many years after her marriage has a breakdown in a real estate office. What's happening? The office manager goes out and offers the job !!! Hilarious The next thing you know is that the two women will go. Yes they are lesbians! There's nothing really in this movie for "Everything for a better life for women." Clunky interview: "I do not want to be happy with the rest of my life and I have not taken it," it does not help. The rejection of her new daughter's relationship is far from rich and far away. Maid-shameless black-incredible in 2003 a short film with a black maid's maid. Hattie McDaniel must be in the tomb. The woman has a husband and she likes teenage boys. Sheesh! There is no clue left.
