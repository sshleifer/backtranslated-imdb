Where is Michael Caine when you need it? I have seen many MST3K seasons, but this strange movie of the previous season (episodee K-20) is the worst film ever made. Three of the "stars", Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, the worst series of filmmakers ever filmed, Dick Cheney's style secret has been written by Exxon and GM attorneys. transition and energy efficiency research. The appearance seems almost shot in the dark, probably Super 8. Logan's Run looks like a movie theater movie from Shakespeare. I can not imagine seeing Crow and Servo without commenting, because it is not there. Clearly, what Hollywood needs is a 401K, that is, the actor prevents them from taking such bad films to pay for health care. By using the "polluting and driving rights" issue, I would like to see a truck at Charlton Heston that will deliver a "cold hand" speech. Lee, sorry for me this in 1989, but in 1981?
