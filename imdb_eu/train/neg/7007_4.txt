This movie is pretty bad. Earth is a sentimental mush. I think that the values ​​of production are good, decent photography, little direction and all that. Mark Hamill was horrible. I have never liked it, and this film validates this perception. Not surprisingly, he never had any career as a "Star Wars" movie. I say "Buh-bye, Mark", as it enters the well-deserved darkness. On the other hand, very young Annie Potts stole the show. He showed charm, beauty and actors in a single performance. I remember I noticed recently in "Texasville" and warned of its beauty. It's very interesting to see it ten years before. However, if you are not interested in Miss Potts, escape this movie from screaming in the mountains.
