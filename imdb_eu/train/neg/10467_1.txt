If he were to call a bad movie that reflects how he became a stupid human figure, he would receive the prize. The biblical prophecies that cover hidden voices hidden in the Holy Land by trying to take full control of the world around you. How stupid does the writer really think people? <br /> <br /> The act was bad. Casper Van Dien lost his talent. Michael York's work was a direct function, he was the focus of the film and he did a good job. <br /> <br /> This plot was sick and very disturbing. There is no thrill or immature desire to watch this movie. In this way, a good and evil base can be slowed down. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of mental illness around the circuit that seeks to market the type of garbage. To get a PG-13 rating, there was something to be crashed, but it was still horrible.
