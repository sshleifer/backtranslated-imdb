I just got this movie ... Was it music? no .. but choreographed songs and dancing right there ... <br /> <br /> Since it was serious drama ... it was not enough for that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is a quality actor. Certainly not. <br /> <br /> I was not at all afraid of this movie. The message about apartheid and the students who were killed in the uprising of the student expressed their "tribute". As an entertainment, it was very poor and it was a worse documentary style movie. <br /> <br /> See yourself, but I hate justice.
