The fifth episode of "Freddy's Dead" made the slightest thing due to disillusionment. He started to scratch. Surely, this "latest" movie in this saga is absurd, but at least it's the original. Some eyes breathe. And it is the only story of Freddy's son (Lisa Zane) who is confronted with his evil brother. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is just a cartoon for children to get on the theater. The cast of best actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Lezlie Deane), they are basically dumb and kill as many sheep as they die. It's a difference, it's a magic trick, and it's just a curious entertainment and baby. <br /> <br /> <br />
