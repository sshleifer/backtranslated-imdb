What is in heaven? Is it a plane? Is Superman going? No, no? It's a TORT !? See, that's because of the Cold War! Bad news and other issues! The Americans shoot a combat aircraft in a United States territory and break the subsequent explosion and wake up a real creature called Prehistoric Turtle Gammera. He is not invited to be very pleasing, as he immediately destroys everything and his way to destroy all of us. Government arguments finally decide to kill a stout bastard with a new, sophisticated ice bomb, but does Gammika have another surprise? Cursed tortoise can fly! The first time there is a terribly grotesque and hilarious sequence! Gammera is lying down on the back, at one time the fire blows fire and pushes it up in the air. How do you know that? Afterwards, there is also an annoying boy who is able to communicate telepathically with an angry boy, but it is not interesting enough. Poultry turtle, people! There is little need to write about the Japanese-language sci-fi (and American reinvestment), but it's a shame that the heartfelt, like the original Godzilla and The Beast, is such a shameless one. Effects and monsters are very hokey designs, and unlike the aforementioned films, it never gets apocalyptic. Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") respectable actors do not know what movies they are shooting and Japanese original mahemisms are not too persuasive. The song's own and personalized theme of the game is quite fresh, so it gets more points for it.
