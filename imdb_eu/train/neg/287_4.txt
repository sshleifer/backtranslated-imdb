As Altman's enthusiast, I searched this movie for many years, I think with that cast, it should be at least wonderful. <br /> <br /> Great mistake. <br /> </ p> <p> This is what Altman's big-casting machine suddenly blows (or so) with the hope that it will bring together in the editing room together with sudden improvisation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But also, avoid costs at all. (That's pretty easy: I never posted a video, and I think the cable's appearances have Halley's comet frequency).
