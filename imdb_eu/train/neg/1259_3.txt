Thank you Hollywood Still another classical movie is totally ruined, cheap, superficial, with heavy effects and a redundant remake. The "Planet of the Apes" original movie was a clear and thought-provoking message. A movie that was almost completely bored in the interview, the movie was very interesting. <br /> <br /> This film seems to have been a great deal more than all conversations. Instead of a great movie, two hours are completely stupid. The minimal dialogue has been reduced, the interaction and development of characters does not exist and most of the time is difficult to know what happens. Instead, there are a series of scenes of unreasonable actions, single-line cartoons and some almost intelligent conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing worthwhile about this movie seems to be fantastic. It is a magnificent composition of monkeys, as well as sets and beautiful origins. However, this does not warn that "Planet of the Apes (2001)" is a very small and simplistic movie, with thin paper characters, stupid conversations and plots that are almost non-existent. Hollywood, please, stop the great movies, making them unloving. <br /> <br /> Yes, the end has not been felt. <br /> <br /> * from the star, especially in regards to images <br /> <br />
