You just can not see it, I can not be surprised. <br /> <br /> Very good start, vision and atmosphere give this type of film a great feeling. But everything goes to the first monster when the monster appears. You only know from the Lord's band, but they are very serious in the movie. Doomsday monsters are leather jackets and piercings, so 80. <br /> <br /> In terms of Storyline, it begins like similar horror movies, people trapped in a hell hole. But there is no clear story explaining why and what happens. The viewer causes some possible reasons to line up, but the lines never meet and just end their wickedness. <br /> <br /> With all the money spent on this movie, with an interesting start and good effects, I thought someone would take care of the product. I ask myself to prove that the costumes of the show Lordi were awesome (unless they are). <br /> <br /> So, listening to the movies listens, I think that money should go somewhere. The rest is a shameful rock band whose scene monsters hide monsters.
