Given his reputation, I found this movie a great despair. Maybe I was expecting too much film. After all, it's one of the most popular martial arts films of the 1970s, but I could not know why. The story is interesting. It's also a very movie movie with sequential actions. The main problem of the movie was that they offered me a character that could not bring the story, because the hero can be a fool. Chang's director makes no sense, and can not hide the horrible mistakes found in the narration. I know this is not art, but I found the movie boring. Certainly, this is not the best example of this kind of genre. The situation of his worship escapes me. I recommend you jump.
