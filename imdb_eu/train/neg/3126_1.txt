Mr. VanHook got a good idea and shot it like football. Unfortunately, he did not get the goal. The story of the giant's story is good, but it spills it with goat milk and cheese with a huge wheel. Say, take this coil wheel and roll it from the abyss. I can not watch the entire movie. That's a great deal, from a few movies that I rarely ride. I always want the last minute redemption option. It's impossible to throw something bad. Well, at least acting was good ... NO! <br /> <br /> This is the only thing to "fall" in this movie. 1/10 and immersed in negative numbers!
