When I started back I knew they were in trouble! The premise is very amazing. The story line has been even worse, if any. <br /> <br /> The performance was hard and the actors gave an inexperienced feeling. I expect more like Slater, Reid and Dorff. He drew lines like a robot. And I'm sorry, I like Reid but he was very credible as an archeologist. Slater and Dorff chose a bad movie to test and test their comets. <br /> <br /> The film was still ongoing. The creatures were not bad, but they were not really good. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, I want to return to the ninety minute of my life. They can save money, but give me time! What waste?
