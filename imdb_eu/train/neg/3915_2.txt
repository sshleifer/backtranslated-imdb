This movie is not only written and directed badly, but rather it is painful. A beautiful novel is very badly represented in this film. There has been a lot of changes in the story, probably to adjust to the time. But what a result is completely confusing. The agent can not overcome the screenplay that depicts the behavior of characters. Additionally, converting to English does not work when all are mentioned in the ESTE as a patriarchal ESteban. Amazing. Please, please read this beautiful novel, in Spanish, if you can. Ignore this movie. It will spoil you a wonderful experience.
