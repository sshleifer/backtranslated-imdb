I've seen old movies before, but this is a "worst movie full of life" far away! Anthony Hopkins must have a bad headache so he can add his name - anywhere! I will never see it with another movie, direct it, and so on. I did not like that other actors and actors believed (in this picture) to be part of the catastrophe so badly bent! Excellent drugs must be there! Anyone who is part of that movie that does not want to be ashamed, I'm out! Save your money for that! GREAT BEGINNING from beginning to end! You are ashamed of Mr. Hopkins! Also, shame Christian Slater! I can not believe your reputation on the line!
