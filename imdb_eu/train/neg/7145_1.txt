Apparently, Hollywood does not make any money to talk with a camera and anyone with the ability to make money. This movie was not taken into account. The casting was awful, the performance impossible, and the story full of holes. Script? Who needs the script? I was surprised that the movie was not as mouth-like as I thought, but I had enough shots of T & A throughout my life. The movie was like a 19-year-old ADD rider (telling a story about how to buy a car when he decided to go to college). As a poor recording, I thought that the two brothers in the movie were the initial lovers. The scenes of the racetrack, along with the main female actor, continued to think about Herbie: Fully Loaded. Grindhouse is the descendant of one who modeled himself ... only writers thought it was serious.
