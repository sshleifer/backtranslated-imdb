If you enjoy films like American Pie, Road Trip and Van Wilder; Avoid this cinematic load with all costs. It is a waste of resources without loss, which is compassionate, which should never be debated; Selling a lot less and selling it to unprocessed consumers. Easily the worst movie I've ever seen in the last 18 months; It's bad all the time it lasted 86 minutes. If it were much longer, I would not write without writing this review. Let us be warned!
