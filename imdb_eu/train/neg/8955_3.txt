According to the film, science fiction is a good movie. It has a lot of cool things and has some quality scenes. That said, it's not good, and some things are quite far away ... <br /> <br /> This is another cube movie that's completely and complete. This is a defining original movie and an inventor's definition ... The whole look can be translated to the middle of the first, but the person / android is included in the cube itself. It's a bit of a stretch ... <br /> <br /> I gave it a 3 *** backdrop for the original. The part of the movie should be so sterile, place or time to mention all of them ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> for fans of the series ...
