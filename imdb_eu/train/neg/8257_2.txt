The game "Gentleman's Game" is used on a golf course in a town club, about finding a teenager, honesty, prejudices and other life lessons. I thought several times about the arrival of the movie, because it was badly proven. Unfortunately, I'm not sure why the director ever knew them. The most important moment in this movie is probably a scene that Gary Sinise is thinking of "The Karate Kid" and dissolves ideas that will turn the teenage golfer into a tutor. This film is refreshing, so to speak, this movie refuses to follow the simplistic and elaborate movie formulas. However, too much is still invented. The drops of a hat drops many persecuted people, or they fail to stick to things that they believe or so much that society has much less respect for their place. Unfortunately, there is no resolution at this time. And unless the club places them behind, there is no real follow-up or connection. It is shameful that writers and directors can not make a better film, especially in talented actors and in the configuration.
