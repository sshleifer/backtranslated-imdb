I read the book and the book was wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie, direction, script and theater were absolutely impossible. The pure act of the novel, simplicity and courage might have been a scourge of a novel that illustrates an argument for a great story about events. why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities. I would never recommend anyone I know about this movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, one of the worst adaptations that I have seen has become less exploration in the sky on earth. <br /> <br /> It was the most relevant cinematography. But how can Peru fail, for example, when filmed in a beautiful country. <br /> <br /> Looking to the audience for the future, do not waste your time or energy on this flop.
