The whole movie is empty. We have two good actors, the wrong ones and the meat-makers of Salman Khan to attract the female audience. The story is pure. Bad character was written. There's no telling story. Debating edition. Ajay Devgan as a Rock Star ... it's a dream. The film takes it to the point of decadence. Arjun's move to Manna in London, to approach his girlfriend and not play Wembley (Vimbley doubling) is absurd. Salman Khan is enjoying himself or forgetting himself is very painful. I remember the good works of this producer Vipul Shah, but this is not one of them. It seems that all good managers capture Boxing Mania ... created by Mumbai Media Morons. This is a movie called "Cova", on the lines called "Wanted", a stupid actress like Salman Khan, with no Hindi Hindi Cinema. Indian cinema is good for Titanic Winter Cruise Business. In a positive note, I like Asin's character Dancing Bharatnatyam, when the western style changes when the teacher is not watching when dancing.
