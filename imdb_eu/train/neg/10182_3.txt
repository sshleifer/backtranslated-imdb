OK, if you read the title, you would think it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did. He started well, but it was boring after half an hour. * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> Tells a story about a mom with their most delightful daughter, to go for a long time. The only problem is that the daughter's daughter is a girl on the way. Contest always wins and, therefore, mother is pushing "expulsion". After talking to "Hitman", Mum decides that a girl should be upset. So the actions are done, but it finally catches it. <br /> <br /> It's a great kick and the movie is too long if nothing happens. Do not waste your time watching. <br /> <br />
