Bright lights! The fight between both brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard). They both make head burning fire; They cut more than childhood differences, in the midst of the love-loving Debra Winger. Directed by Glenn Gordon Caron (a television behind "Moonlighting") it is terrifying that comedy text, Vince Gilligan's screenplay, with such a presentation presented, looks like a movie student of a scholarship of fourteen million dollars. . The power of a great commercial feature is prickly, but without any molded style, except for the characters that are kooky eccentric. These are not characters, they are plot functions. Released to the theater, the movie is a disaster, even though it is a good looking image as an example of substance. The wings are the only distinguishing feature of a cast that is really surprised. * 1/2 ****
