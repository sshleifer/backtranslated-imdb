This became a worship movie for Chinese university students, even though I saw it, broadcasting 4 (UK) channels. <br /> <br /> The work of art, full of phenomenal appearances, has not reached the ground; The "spirit" that he wants to convey is that independent artists maintain the music industry's commerce, and maintain their 'cleanliness of artistic purity' and 'do not sell money'. that's really upset and shorter; Diologists are especially pathetic. play is poor. sceenplay is full of art. It's a fantastic movie for kids and all of that <br /> <br />
