I thought Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was pretty good movie when a United States military is infected by a chemical stolen, it relaxes the body and releases the virus onto a small island. Soon the infected inhabitants will become hungry zombies, and a group of soldiers must leave together with a group of tourists and dive into an abandoned hotel when they try to fight the dead. I do not get this movie in the original film, just as good as Zombie Flesh Eaters. However, it was a horrible horror movie with good action. I do not think it was one of the best in the series. 4/10
