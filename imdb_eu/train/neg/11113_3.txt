I often feel Scrooge, others want to get rid of movie movies or write a review to balance unnecessary raves. I found this movie almost impossible, and it was not unusual to me, it was a quick conversation, through a solid interview dialogue, but also a dull musical number. Regardless of the originality of this movie, an unusual set of music, fantasy, animation, or a script that is not obscured by the development of mind or thinking plot. Only, June Haver and Dan Dailey seem to be a nice person, but they can not do in the film in the group. It's not really charismatic or sexual appeals. Both are frightening. I like Billy Gray, but his character is very unnoticed. The best part of the movie is June Haver's beautiful outfits and excellent bodies.
