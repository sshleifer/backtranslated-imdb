It's mostly the opinion that makes itself, but I have returned from this movie and have expressed my opinions. First of all, I start to say that I am a great fan of horror. But what's a horror movie? I'm sure you see a bit of scriptwriting and good character development. I know they are often missing out on horror movies, but Prom Night did not make any effort in that section. Then we all love suspense. That on the edge of your seat, unexpectedly unpredictable. Yes, Prom Night did not go anywhere! Of course, we like a horrific killer. Prom Night have that? No, he has a beautiful boy with a cute lilac knife. When everything else goes wrong ... I'm afraid, at least, it's a pleaser pleasing to gore gore and occasionally nude scenes. Yes, even if a PG-13 generation movie is rated as Prom Night, things are left. So I ask all those items missing ... is it still a horror movie like that? Laguia. I would call it a comedy. In the theater I laughed the people, when I thought that "Semi-Pro" was a comedy (but also another story!). I think he must refuse to give up on the new fear. All terrifying horror movies have been rolled out to make money in the studio for good money every day. I did not even see people who did not know that it was a remake! That crazy me! What do I ask about what will happen to reboot movies? Where will the fear be next?
