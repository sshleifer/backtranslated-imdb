Adam Sandler's first movie could be compared to the same comic period in 1989. It seems Sandler's constant sense of humorous horrors and frustration on comic humor and humor will come more than Sandler. The movie is not in front of its long-running movies, such as Big Daddy or Billy Maddison. Sadly, Sandler still did not find a way to express a successful and funny way when he made the movie, like his character. The majority of the "jokes" in the movie usually come with conversations that Sandler knows, because he usually surpasses the talent of his comic book and judges himself because he is ugly and can not get women. The film is also difficult to see because it is not treated as a real movie. Sandler speaks with the camera and the audience throughout the film, often referring to a small budget quiz or dubious content. In the end, the movie is cumbersome and shaky. Immediately after I saw the movie I wanted to forget, when he was more afraid of it, Sandler would destroy the route. In the video store I sent it, I rented it free and it was still a short time ago.
