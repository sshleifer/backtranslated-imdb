This is the Yahoo musician MASTERPIECE, a response that says the most real genius called Jaws. Yes, whites, whites (and other sharks, bulls, black tip, white tip, white tigers) are known to populate the spots where simple predators are found. Men often do not access this menu, when given, but the shark of the film has repeatedly shown that it shows abnormal behavior. It did not happen. A man who destroys a whale killer whale, naming a nemesis, twelve dozen North Atlantic fishing boats and some people, knowing that all the "Nemesis" friends are approaching the water very closely. To reach them, they are so thin. Jaws like this knock-off turd. Laughable Large white sharks also know how often ships, underwater protective cages and vests and surfboards frequently appear, and they seem to be the bottom seals. Bruce's shark size (if you do not know it, look), would be able to sink a ship like Orca (hey! The name we are discussing!). It would weigh over 6,000 kg. I could keep it, but I do not need it. The cheekbones are amazing (better performance, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca crap (BLATANT Jaws rip-off, malicious writing, abrasive effects, side by side with a movie by Olson Twins). A master of the University of Columbia does not know about this. See better movies.
