I suppose the period of this film was made according to the original. Really sad, in a deeper level, because the title "Vanishing Point" is an original. I'm sure it was not that way, but the original was shot in 1970 and was released in 1971. The real 'VANISHING POINT' era was the end of the era, it was quite finished in the early 70's. <br /> <br /> In this remake, all anti-cultural elements have been deleted, and PCs have been rendered more likely to attempt to reach a wider audience. "Protected whitewashed" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The American scene was a free entry of Americans and added to the idea of ​​a "noble purpose" trip. I'm glad I saw it; The original much appreciated me much more. Original worship is classical and gold. This remake is awesome.
