It is a Japanese movie, but here it is also spoken in English. It's a beautiful movie, with pretty eyes, with scenic Hawaiian beauty. <br /> <br /> However, this has been the only restorative quality for me. The story was generally boring. Who wants a young woman to watch 90% of the films, than he predicted that her husband's "image" was much older? It is given, that could be bummer ... but overcome! <br /> <br /> Only in the last 10 minutes he makes a face-up and likes it. By then, for most audiences, it was too late. We had slept for the time.
