'SherryBaby' is a very painful and sordid melodrama of Jersey, a story of a young mother who is imprisoned, after a drug-related conviction and a fight to find a place in her life and, above all, the love of her daughter who cares for her children's family. Watching film is the only reason Maggie Gyllenhaal, the actress at the top of her career, is very well suited to the entire role and role of the shoulder. This is not enough, however, since the line is very simplistic and expected, and emotional attention is placed in the wrong place. I still pictured myself asking myself a drug addict and possibly a future. mother and conductor and writer wanted, or about an innocent young man in the center. Even though the play of Maggie Gyllenhaal did not convince me I did not care much about the child.
