"It should have been" is another sign that goes unnoticed by Hollywood. This photo is written by Charlie Hudson. When Charlie's fianc√© comes out, she's stuck with all wedding planning. She spends a weekend in a charming hotel and she meets Anna Penn when a teacher is married. Two friends are quick and they want to organize their weddings. This is when the plot gets bored, Charlie falls in love with Anna, and she needs to choose a safe life or Charlie. This movie goes away from all the romantic comedies that have ever been made and wait until you have finished the movie to do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge give minimal screenings, and this movie makes it even more visible.
