I had to endure teenage and high accident and family conflicts for almost every show. Actually, I do not like girls in high school thinking about their relationships. What I'm doing is that I spent the time I spent in Hellen, and I did not like the fictional teenagers about "horrors" of horrors they have suffered. I want science fiction That's right here. There were a few seconds of science fiction in the show. We have finally seen a proto-Cylon. It was good but with a problem. The red eye would connect to an interesting point. We all know that Cylon Eyedot can always scan the machine that will give the world map. The red eye is never moving back and forth. <br /> <br /> I really hope the writers will fix abuse before the second episode.
