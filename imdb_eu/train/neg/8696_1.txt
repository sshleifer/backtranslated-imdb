I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my dad. First of all, I mean that the story of this movie and the creation of the Amber Alert system is good. However, the film itself was wrong and the performance was awful. The main problem of this film was included with Nichole Timmons and Glenn Park in the second part. The events on this part of the story were not entirely correct. My father at that time had psychological problems and Nichole received no harm at all. She loved her as a daughter and thought she believed that she had paid little attention to her mother who had cared for her father for less than 3 years of maternity for her future damages or salvation. and immediately he got up, and the mother could scare her mother. The movie made my father somehow harmed the shape or shape. It's a funny thing that Nicholas spent some nights in the place of my father, as long as Sharon worked or did. Originally the reason he was thinking of violence was the fact that he could think of weapons in his truck. My father was a rural house. The things that they believed to be weapons were gardening tools, they kept all their time working on the truck. My recommendation is that this movie should be recorded with salt, a good story based on real events, but the details of the film (at least Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park) are very correct and they show the director's failure. Get to know the truth about the story. It's a funny thing if the director interviewed anybody who knew Sharon's situation, I would say that they would be published in detail here.
