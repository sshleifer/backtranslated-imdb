When Zebbedy Colt (The Night-Walker) raises Harry Reems's girlfriend, she becomes Reems and comforts herself for sexually transmitted lesbians. In the meantime, Colt has dresses like a cane and magicians, raging women. In the end, Reems decides to monitor him and his crime ends. Although filmed in film, the worst thing about it, looks like any other movie in the 70's and it's not working well. Rape / abuse scenes are surprisingly limited and the "Death Wish" is a terrible attempt. R. Bolla ("Cannibal Holocaust") is a police officer. Colt, who is usually over-the-top, wigs in a couple of scenes, but very well behaves my money. This rough thing could be much harder.
