The first glance of this image seems to be a good rock n roll movie. But do not let the cover dirty, or Alice Cooper and Blondie is it. The story is awesome and the performance. Moderate and simple: BAD <br /> <br /> It's not a movie about a roadie, but a thin story of love, so scary. The good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Some good songs, which is why I give it from 2 to 10. If it were not for music, it would be 0 to 10. The actress is horrible (she was at least 1980), and the little girl who plays the group is not looking good! This movie has been a great disappointment for me, because it makes good promises.
