I love horror movies to say "silent hill" (it looks pretty good but I still missed it) and I guess I'd love to watch movies, that is, I thought it was one of them. At first the movie starts with a good suspense and creates a good starting point for a horror scene, but then it drops down the hill and from there it's faster and faster. I first mentioned a silent boy, for the reasons I saw many of the "robbed" themes of the movie ... I would all say, instead of seeing a silent extreme, it's better, it's more terrifying, it has a lot more suspense, and the ending is much better ... And best, I did not feel ripped off with this I did. This just seems to be one of them "I like the movie, so I'm going to create my bad version again" a little movie .. Oh and another thing ... Lord ... in a horror movie ... It's like trying to scare a bear cared for a baby, "I'll love you and I'll always love you" in the womb ...
