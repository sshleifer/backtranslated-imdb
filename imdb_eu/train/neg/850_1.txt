This was the most stupid movie ever I've ever seen (before spoilers)! First of all, the plot is stupid. The little child is strange and they will go to a hotel because their father is responsible. We see a baby gift, "Brightness." This gift has never had anything to do except to make the baby look good. Then he gets a boring and boring movie until he finally crazy. Because he is deeply dying for a baby and his wife ... well, he feels. Why did he do it? Suddenly, we see a woman naked in the chain. The man kisses and fully realizes that a dead man is dying, that is, it is very awful. Somehow, a black man enters the hotel and tightens it with an ax. Afterwards, the girl and the woman take on a black man's vehicle and leave their father, who dies during hypothermia. Most films do not have a full loss of time, but they belong to that category. The music is trashy, the characters are corny (except Jack Nicholson, who is a good actress), the plot tweaks and vomits the description, the end is very predictable, the storyline is slow, tedious, and boring. This movie is very unknown. Avoid this filter at all costs. I'm surprised I got a great score on the IMDb.
