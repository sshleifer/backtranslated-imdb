The original show was so much better. They should leave a good note. This movie has killed all the ideas. It was boring, excessive dramatization, and the fun parts were stopped in the distance. This movie seemed to me to try to get serious about it, and that was not what I wanted from that sequel. It is worth mentioning that, for a long time, the same thing happened to us again and again. So, forgive, Tyler Perry, but try the next time. This movie is sad and not very funny. I'm sorry. It's 4/10 stars. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
