Underground Comedy is one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I should know that it would be wrong to say that there was a "wrongly guaranteed" written phrase that meant that filmmakers would be more than dispersed. <br /> </ p> <p> This movie is a mixed nightmare, joke and bad jokes ... One of the pathetic Bat-Man sketches, Arnold Shvollenpecker skit, but not fun. There are a few fun little fun: Micheal Clark Duncan's virgin virgin, for example, is playing, but they are too long and they have been ruined by the imbalance of Vince Offering's comedy. <br /> <br /> Keep underground under the comedy ... bury it!
