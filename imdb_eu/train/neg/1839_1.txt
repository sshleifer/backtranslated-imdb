I could not wait when I rented this movie with my DVD player. After I started, I could not wait to get my DVD player. I really saw the whole movie. My wife and I waited until we were waiting for something fun, but it's never fun anymore. Readings like this box would be fun. The film's premise is good. Ben Stiller is fun. Jack Black is fun. How did this film get lost? Well ... miss! This is the most popular "comedy" I have ever seen. Nobody thinks about anything, even though it's a little fun. It's really a lick movie. Believe it. Avoid ... BUIL IT IT !!
