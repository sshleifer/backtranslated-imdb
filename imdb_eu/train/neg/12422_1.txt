I rented this movie to see the bloody and unstoppable motion picture in constant action and a low-budget and very cheap budget that Kickboxer got as a low-budget action drama like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and he has kept Lou from Rebokos from shots, who shoot in the head, easily happened. Vietnam scenes are shooting somebody's backyard, I swear! Lou is now damaged by the brain and Reb and they live together and have a bar. Super homoerotic Lou is convinced he is struggling to make money in a cage and Reb is dying to recover him. No good fight scene. One person is less than one person. Characters the characters change for a few seconds. A man is bad and the next scene is good. The play is terrifying, and Frank Stallone is a sensitive song that is sensitive to music. I hate this movie.
