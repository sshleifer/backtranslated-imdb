I've seen bad movies, LOTS !!!!!! It's really fun. On Saturday I come across almost all my friends, and I meet together and see trash all over the world. Turkish film super hero, Brazilian vampire, Italian transplants of gorilla, Kevin Costner, ANYTHING (maybe except Helen Raising), but never seen THEODORE REX. Never. And it's not even entertaining bad Ed Wood is just a SUCKS in any way. Now that the movie was made famous in Hollywood at that time, Whoopi gloves had been removed and it was clear to the press that they wanted to listen to and scraped to this CRAP. He whined, he moaned, but nevertheless, they threw their fat butt on the skin leather futuristic police uniform police that is spectacular, yikes !!!! However, in addition to seeing everything in his life, he is looking for everything besides the camera agent, to scream him. The dinosaur has three faces and the script is so huge that a third grade class can do a better job with the prescribed cookies.
