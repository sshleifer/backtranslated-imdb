This movie is very fun. Violence is bad, acting ... Well, Dani, sing or scream or do what you usually do. The chicks that use at least anything else can just capture the fortunate fortunes. Personally, I think this movie sucks. The story and the characters can be very good, if they are better understood by direction, actors and other little things. But the movie is bad, because people like this reason is because Danni is there. This film is the worst movie ever ever in B. And, believe me, this is a difficult task, especially when you are competing with Def with Temptation and more than just excuses for "horrible" horror movies. I'm not a CoF fan, so I see it as another garbage movie ... Really bad. If Dani is in a comedy mode, he'll be fine. Well done. More than over, I value it low, it's crappiness. Look happy, happy, cheerful, cheerful, when you laugh at it or scatter you in more than just a few kinds of drugs.
