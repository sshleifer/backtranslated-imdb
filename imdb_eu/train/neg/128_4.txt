This movie, surprised by its political thinking and depictions of free love and sexual liberation, has reduced time to pure curiosity. The absurd sense seems to be banned and arrested by government by many governments in most countries. Regardless of the way in which the Swedish Socialists have finally become, the "radicalism" of its politics, although controversial, appears four-decade later naive and almost identical. And sex scenes, at the same time, the subject of lingo essay sessions, are quite fascinating in the modern context. However, films and documentaries determine their many debates and influences. It is the relic of the early twentieth century revolt of young people. Still a part of the film that remains: the consciousness of himself in relation to the 'fourth wall'. Sometimes filmmakers are shooting their films. This satirical play still laughs.
