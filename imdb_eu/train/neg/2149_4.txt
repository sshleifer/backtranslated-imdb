Well, money has made a great machine again! Disney is very careful with the fact that a wizard like me has to have all the videos (bad or bad) that sealed with Disney moniker. Why do Don Bluth follow these evil days as "consequences" such as Leonardo DaVinci? Cinderella has two short stories (a bad chance!) One of Disney's most attractive creations is worth at least a linear story? Of these three, I only hope to bring this one closer to the quality of animation and storytelling. Music is atrocious and modern (it will be meaningless for 2 years) and it is not a story. Why should everything update? Do you know that original cartoons are still known and timeless, so why not be respectful and true with songs that reflect original style with the same style? Gee, I can not wait for a sequel to Sleeping Beauty. Instead of music from Tchaikovsky's theme, we will get music inspired by Britney Spears !!! So, if you're listening to Disney, remember that we're not a child's gender. Getting rid of holes in craftsmanship and garbage for lovers.
