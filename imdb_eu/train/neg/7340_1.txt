Amazed! This is the worst movie of SRK and the worst Bollywood movie I've ever seen! I did not like the novel, but this movie was worse! Very bad music, worse actors (of course SRK, of course, even though it did not save the movie), and it does not make sense. The director seems very confused, God knows why ... maybe he seems surrealist and credible. Well, he has not managed them. <br /> <br /> Even though you have spent several hours, do not miss the movie, please! (Say it's your welfare!) Find, you can see something else!
