This movie is angry. I do not think I've ever seen an accident movie. The plot was quite interesting, but the conversation was super flat and it was not acting. This could be a good movie. I think it was based on grotesque figures. I can handle the usual graphic scene and human taboos, but he felt it was shot by Miike. Just a bad movie. When you watch this movie you should not be entertained, fascinated by incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, milking, parental and sibling, and fascinated with explicit scenery of fecal scenes. I think I sell a lot of movies, but when I thought that, I said. He has got other films, but I think it's better to see someone pooping.
