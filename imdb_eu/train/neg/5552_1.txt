This exhibition has as many points of interest as the travel channel. It is billed as reality, but it's just a soap opera today. Exotic locations try to use it as a facade for people to put on a fake competition and then begin to upload audiences to a competition-style TV series. <br /> <br /> Also, he has released the first-class CBS show. Clock - hopes to overcome its situation with its residents. Then he rewards the winner's money. If they interact with a bit more interactive characters, even better.
