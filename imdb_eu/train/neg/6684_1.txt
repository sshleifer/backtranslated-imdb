This should re-write "A scary movie filmmaker who is not afraid of Shock Film as a fearless magazine." The story of a fraternity is long and boring, so happy that the Delta House also saw Flounder. Jeff East, a tax-paying actor, will be forgiven for any work he can get. Charles Martin Smith, George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah, who played in ancient light films. Once available on the tape, but fortunately, not on DVD. Garbage like this is prohibited and not elsewhere.
