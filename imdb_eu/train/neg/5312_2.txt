Fred Olen Ray's terribly terrifying dust bins, Jan-Michael Vincent, asked reluctant refugees to find what Ross Hagen has devoted to the earthly journey, by Jan-Michael Vincent. Soon with the Forest Ranger with John Phillip Law, Wagen must protect a protected group of children's college by Richard Wiley. Soon, Cyborg will burn a alcoholic alcoholic with a laser of his arm (Robert Quarry Yorga-Vampire fame). No one can prove that the convex shield is going to be recovered. It weakens his body. Law has found an ally in Leo Gordon, an old Vietnam veteran of war, weapons hidden in his cabin. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's a deliberate make-up for lovers of "cinema" ... it's horrible. effects, acting and premise. At least, the movie has a candy eye with PJ Soles ... In the 89's it burned quite a bit. It's sure that a laser-gun is fun ... It can attack some of the houses even when Cyborg explodes with Law, but it does not leave any mark left.
