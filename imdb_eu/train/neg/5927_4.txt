I am very politically correct. So when I say sexist, I mean Miranda Jones's director directed by Diana Muldar. Despite his allegedly brilliant brilliance and control, nothing more inside, but a reasonable, jealous child, now you've got the land Marvik, after his technical lover tried to kill him on the jellyfish. Ambassador Kollos, jealous rage, but first of all to see him. (Although you thought you could go into the room to close your eyes and be fasered in the box, it's too easy for you) to move Enterprise into an un-navigable space outside of the galaxy before the boys subdue him. Well, the boat is stuck in the mud, at that moment a good lady doctor could be linked and debated. "Spock wants to join the Medusa, to get home. I mean, like beetch, do you want to stop wandering until the supply is exhausted?" Star Star Trek is a monster of jealousy fashion, when she tells herself that idea and weeps down, even though her idol in Medusan called for them to close and go. That's why the effort runs out with Spock's melody, as Spock forgets it, because Spock crazy. Kirk, of course, realized how much it was and how much Spock intended to establish with its superior telepathic powers. Of course, at the end, Lady and Medusa are left and everything is forgiven. The President of the Battle Star Galactica wanted to expel a witch from the brilliant witch's elimination. But Star Trek on the ground, girls can be reasonably and cruel, but at the same time there is sexual equality. That is, I mean the sexist.
