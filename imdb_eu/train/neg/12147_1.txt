This is perhaps the worst attempt at a zombie movie that I had ever had. Horrible, horrible, horrible Any opinion found on this site, of course, is the work of a filmmaker, filmmaker family or filmmaker. How to open this movie? Leave some ways ... <br /> <br /> On the plot? Inconsistent For dialogue? Atrocious. I do not send effects / gore slam, I understand that this is a low budget. But was not there an obesity that was not a zombie? Pull it! And for a movie in Rhode Island, why did the truck make a Massachusetts Dish? Continuity found. <br /> <br /> While the girl is dancing "Pay attention". Please do not put your girlfriend or friend's sister naked in your movie. It was an ugly movie full of ugly people and did not mention Romero on the cover. The next time you decide to make a movie, no.
