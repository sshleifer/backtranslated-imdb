Someone called Howard Koch Schlockmeister but wrote the script "Casablanca", right? Or was not he? Maybe Koch moves in more than one Hollywood, and I do not like Casablanca too. Wait a minute - yes, the other Howard Koch Hollwyood moves around. That was written in Casablanca. It does not matter. I will carefully comment on this "Howard W. Koch" production, that is to say, just say a little. <br /> <br /> Do you know what this is? Someone read in the "King Lear" of Shakespeare's Cliff's Notes and decided that Inbound Inspiration Express was not original thoughts, with a happy update and sunset. <br /> <br /> There are differences. Lear decides to spread his real estate among his big sisters and ask before him what they love. Both sisters lay their feet on their feet and get their brown nose money. The third is a good little girl and Lear has not gotten out. In play, Lear is still alive to make his decision to give him two atmospheres and to get the good girl up. Crashes and cuts roughly frequently, during which time he puts flowers on his hair and salute them. Children can do it. (Take my baby, for example. When he tried to ruin it, he's interested in being a doctor or a lawyer?) In the end, every theater dies. <br /> <br /> In the movie, clearly, the good sister is light and lucid, but when she tries to denounce herself, someone jumps and saves her, and therefore the end is happier. Hollywood is a tragedy and a real tragedy, if Hollywood does not define itself as a tragedy enough.
