I saw Gary Busey and Fred Williamson thinking of being a policeman. They are, but Busey is the opening scene and then it's not re-appeared 40 minutes as in the movie. Although surprising at every scene. Especially when he conceals himself, he hides it. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredible in terms of the plot. In the movie Fred Williamson, he is trying to dwell and dare to look for sex workers. At one point I think it's Busey. But I become, partly right. Busey is not a murderer, but she is talking on the phone in harassment. Why? I do not know. In no way does it bind to the murderer, he only makes shots.
