I enjoyed the first Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2. This movie was trash. I could not see The story was a joke, the performance was a joke, and the zombie 3 Zombi 2 is not a joke anymore. People LIVE LIVE In any case, the movie does not cost $ 1.00. I really enjoyed the Lucio fulci movies, but this was awful. If Zombi 3 shows how to play zombies 4 and 5, I think they will skip that. <br /> <br /> Zombi 2 is wonderful.
