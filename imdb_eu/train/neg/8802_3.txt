I loved the movie PROPER Anchorman, but this one was very bad. The bad thing you want to achieve this time in your life is that you think "what the Earth thought first and foremost" could be a bad thing. You have taken 50 minutes more to make a snack during the kitchen in the kitchen, a bad leprosy look, if you think you want to rent a movie Pauly Shore. . Seriously, I can not explain what's too bad. <br /> <br /> That said ... there were a few funny laughs but it's so much less fun than Anchorman. No doubt, they wanted to be fun and fun, but here we've forgotten the whole mischief that was out of Anchorman ... it was not a bit good. <br /> <br /> Make it on your side (or in the US, on the side), and do not watch this DVD ... Anchorman will be a good movie and you do not want to do that. <br /> <br /> Okay ... I'm fine now.
