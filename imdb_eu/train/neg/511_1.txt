I am one of the extra elements of this great bonus. I had a straightforward job of racing in the USA. As I knew in that time. Thank you for the scene in the first minutes of the film and I do not have to sit down. It was a big party, but it was a good pay. The attention to detail was not so strong, but who knew it. We saw a funny thing in the car as the track was very slow and then the movie was at a normal speed. They shot a lot of scenes because they shot me, I'll decorate the cost and the time. But it was a good time to watch everyone!
