Spoiler Alert ?? Although I think that this is what was destroyed? It is very difficult to imagine that the film made with these stars, that study at that time, could be so scary, but that's it. The biggest mistake in the movie is not foolish. <br /> <br /> Penn Landslord, a wealthy American aristocrat, leaves a small daughter "responsible" and goes to the First World War. he's dead We go on in that period (1942) and completely mess. The three sisters are in court during the last thirty years and they are trying to get some jerk called Barclay. This is the beginning of the endless question of unanswered, scriptwriters, more holes than the Warren report. What happened to Gaylord's fortune? If the will is worth half a million, why does the family house come from a prosperous mansion? Who is the devil Barclay clown? And why is it someone who can take home? Questions raise much more questions. <br /> <br /> George Brent is generally a nice and charming Barclay, who is a totally bored young man. it's grief and not; However, besides Fiona (Barbara Stanwick), nobody else likes this creature. Why? None of the questions ever answered. Instead, we continue the life of Fiona from the rupture of a train to another; Bad Barclay takes away the house, money, and even the children. What does it do? Shoot it? Fire Awake? No, it's logical. This woman was only romantic romantic before Barclay, who, unequivocally, decides she does not hate she does not hate the middle sentence (literally). And they will never be happy. Suddenly, without reason in the world, this model of independence and femininity of the initial authority becomes an unprotected way by twisting it into the ankle that is found in the movies of the time. Yes, surely, steal everything in the world of me and I will fall in love with you. What happens to the planet? I can only imagine that I have not heard before Turner caught him, that he was lost to today's viewers.
