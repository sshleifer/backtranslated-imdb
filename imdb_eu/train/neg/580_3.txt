Really bad movie, the story is very easy and predictable and poor as an accessory. <br /> <br /> The story of the vampire hunter is the worst thing I've seen so far, he travels with Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi). In search of some suckers of blood in Mexico, he uses some interesting weapons (but he has nothing to do with Blade), and Van Helsig is part of some of the huntsman's vampires? Well, it works, but only works. He has been searched for a powerful vampire who is looking for a powerful vampire who is looking for a powerful black vampire capable of making a ritual of lightning (John Varshires (1998) is the star of James Woods.) Derek is looking for him He was looking for a queen with some new friends: a teenager inexperienced Sancho (Diego Luna, who is really bad), a Catholic priest Father Cristian Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente), a vampire Zoey (Natasha Wagner). and another expert distributor Ray Collins (Darius McCrary). Obviously, this adventure is not alone. <br /> <br /> You want to look at this movie as its main actor (Jon Bon Jovi); With James Woods, the quality of the theater is enormous, and if you watch the movie (I do not recommend this part), you will find stories that are the easiest, most absolutely predictable, with stories that are terribly interpretative. Special effects are very bad and inaccurate events! <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that you not see this short film, rent a movie, watch another channel, quit friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
