OK, as everyone has said, this movie is a complete dog. In a way, that is, it was a sexually-conceived film to get rid of the thick-skinned material (or until it's dark visibility) to absorb the X-grade of the censorship; But the movie also has other mistakes. <br /> <br /> At first, it seems that the scriptwriters have mixed their homosexual men and vampires. The bad guys are bold and do not have silver, but on the other they act like vampires. Now you can not do that with a lightweight genre film, you have to retain the rules of the genre, or fans will be confused and angry when the credibility is interrupted when it is in error. Indeed, it is something that has already been done for vampires (confusing and badly presented) on the plot, but it does not make any sense in a fun movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the pale man's clothes are the hardest. never seen A male movie business should know that the dreamer's costumes and transformations are critically appraised by fans, but some of these ruddy men are empty. <br /> <br /> There are a few pieces. I really like the score. Others have mentioned Sybil Danning's tits. And ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if applicable, if any) <br /> <br /> I really like the plan for attacking the rough man. There are so many horror films that play stupid characters, but in this case they get very sensitive and effective anti-men arsenals and kill monsters. I mean, you can fill elm men with silver bullets, and we have pretty strong firearms. It would not be hard to put two and two together, hmm? But in a typical style, this movie is under the top and adds anti-lycanthrope weapons very sterile and fun.
