Susan Sarandon admires his integrity and honesty in his private life, as well as his talent as an actor. So it seemed strange that the events would appear in such a distorted movie. His character was in South Pole in Edmonton (Alberta), a Canadian charter company. The Twin Otter aircraft designed and built the Canadian plane. US Airforce, Navy and Coast Guard changed their travel capability. A few years later, the company made a similar rescue to pull out a man from South Pole. The film seems to me to be a painful and pretty thing, and it has been documented by brave women before a terrifying task. I do not see why producers should find the courage of rescue riders and the rescue plane as the USAF Hercules.
