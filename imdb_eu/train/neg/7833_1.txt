I saw the third week of Stephen Kings's Nightmares and Dreamscapes mini series; Meaning I have seen 6 episodes up to now. The stories are very weak. I read Stephen King's Skeleton Crew, they published their short stories. I recall that most of the stories are poor on average, but it was really great, though it was remarkable. <br /> <br /> What I just want to say is that it's a collection of this mini series. Stephen King's story does not mean it's okay. In fact, if there is no indication of the previous image in his story collection, then most of the small series will be poor on average. <br /> <br /> I did not read these new stories in Stephen King's defense. Maybe in a book they are as good as stories and they are not easily adapted for television, or perhaps the scriptwriter has been trying to write an interesting script. Who knows Also, these stories can only be done for this small series and not for printing purposes. Perhaps this may be a problem. If he has been writing stories written by Stephen King, I was sure the editor would immediately tell him to become more interesting, because it's just boring. <br /> <br /> What is clear about this is the story / script and not the actors and actors, because the series have excellent people who act on this mini-theater. <br /> <br /> Seeing this series I appreciate the old "Twilight Zone". "series. Each series had only half an hour, but it was compelling and it was a trick. I do not know why they could not do something like this, but I'm sure that this mini series has a lot of money to make a good series of mini-series but unfortunately, it was not necessary to click on something. <br /> <br /> For example, the two episodes that appeared in this week, the first one who buys a picture drawn by an artist who sued a horror story writer, is beginning to see the figure being guided by the writer He was feeling uneasy, he throws paint, but he continues to approach him, and in this picture a portrait of a person is killed and killed. (I do not mention the second episode of this sequence as a crime even among criminals and their apprehension. !) <br /> <br /> The premise is interesting and, therefore, the story must be good, but after seeing it I was frustrated, too many voices in the story I was there, and this story did nothing to show anything that was external materials too. After the last scene, I left more questions than I had answered. <br /> <br /> I tried to enter this small series for 3 weeks, but it was very serious for the story / screenplay. If it were a movie, I would recommend that people wait for the cable to exit. I would not recommend renting in your video store. However, I'd say TNT, a cable channel, if you have not seen it already, and try it for a week. If you do not like that last week, you will not like the series of the past or future ones, they all have the same boring characteristics.
