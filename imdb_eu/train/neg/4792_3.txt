Phantasm .... Class. Phantasm II ... awesome. Phantasm III ... erm ... terrible. <br /> <br /> Even though I'd like to stick to this movie, I just can not. It seems the movie is "sold out". The first signs are wrong at the beginning because the video has other trailers (the others did not). Too much boring characters, for example, boys (the initial crack, the beginning funny but the dead woman you want), women who use karata (it will not work, or should not) Blooming zombies (what are they doing, there is no other connection with them Phatasms ). Likewise, miniatures are difficult. <br /> <br /> The only moods come out and, of course, Reggie B. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The ending characters will end at the end of IV IV. because they can continue with the main ones. <br /> <br /> Generally very, very depressing. 3/10
