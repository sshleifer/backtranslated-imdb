The movie I've ever seen is the worst, and I've watched some movies. Art is like a movie, but it's really a trash piece. Tango dance is a respectable quality, but this can not be paid by Sally Potter. The plot of this movie does not exist, and I assure you that it will start to laugh at the end. She starts singing mostly. It is totally unreal.
