If someone does not know, I really do not know what this movie is. It looks like an image with a message, but it's far away. The story tells the stories of a New York press and its problems. And basically everything. When Pacino's agent acts, he must think that something important must be. But hard thinking does not mean that this movie is nonsensical and dull. One of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, is the second annual film (the other "Simone"), "the most boring and significant year of the annual figure". So what's up, Al?
