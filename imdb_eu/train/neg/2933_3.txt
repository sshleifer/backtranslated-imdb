If you have read the book - do not expect high, if you do not - read and do not watch the movie. It is curious that knowing that Toby Young was involved in script writing (as in the book's post-script). The film is very different from the book. <br /> <br /> What the movie seems to be: an incentive and amusing thought that combines philosophical ideas with rare sarkas and simplifies all of us. Understand - it gets a perfection. The movie is a bad and cheap joke that is suitable for a sitcom, and loses significant messages. <br /> <br /> You'd better not see.
