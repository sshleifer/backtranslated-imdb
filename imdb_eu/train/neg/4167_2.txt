I wanted to see Mr. Fix It, I was a fan of David Boreanaz. I've gotten a 1-1 / 2-hour dad. The premise seemed nice: Boreanaz is Lance Valente, owner of a company called "Mr. Fix It." In it, many men help give their girlfriends again. <br /> <br /> Among these problems. Movie editing, script and theater. Although Boreanaz found some great films (with the exception of "Crow") he was disappointed. Sometimes his character was interesting and others were flat. The work of support reminded me of the newspapers. I know it was not a great budget movie, but some of the scenes and music did not look good. <br /> <br /> My advice: see at your own risk.
