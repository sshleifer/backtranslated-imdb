This movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen. There's no story completely. Gag is not just delays, and nothing else is worth seeing. Fredi's entire movie (what a funny name. Ha Ha) does not ask himself how the plane landed from an airplane. There are stupid and innocent characters whose names should be fun. For example: Gandalf is called Almghandi, it is called Sam Pupsi ... and so on. I did not smile once in the whole movie. Gag's seems to have been made by people with IQ negative. If you laughed at someone's door locked (this happens 5 times), maybe it's your movie. Another fun scene: They try to guess the code of a closed door (do not ask why do not ask "why" in this movie) and code (ha ha): sugar. So if you laugh at this example, you would like this movie. All others: Go to Youtubai and see "Lord grass": it's much more fun.
