I do not know for a lot of reason to get into this movie in great detail. Sylvester Stallone again recruited John Rambo, writer of "A Season in Hell", a private friend of Richard Crenna Major, who was hidden behind his return to Vietnam, taking photographs of American prisoners still awesome. camps, and return without invading the enemy. <br /> <br /> Fat fat. What's really going on, taking pictures and hiding? Who would come to see the movie? <br /> <br /> Basically, it is the celebration of Stallone's muscles. Preparing for his role, we see his oily muscles bulging. (They are made with oil and many). Black leather, ugly guns and even slimmer rituals. Black guns are cleaned with clack loud and almost covered with oil like Stallone's muscles. The bow is tested and, nevertheless, it has enough cracks through the enemy's eyebrows. The knife is sharpened with gentle snacks. <br /> <br /> One of the Stallone and one of their POWs betrayed one or two Washington costumes, the cynical politicians who could be in the cinema never had a fist. Grammar school No trip, do you know? Just sit your feet on the table and drink a foreign beer. <br /> <br /> The movie does what he wants to do, but it's wonderful to do it. The myth that was immersed in the mythical town of the mid-1980s deliberately included the number of MIAs kept silent in Northern Vietnam camps. Bumper stickers were ubiquitous. (Free our MIAs.) Why would they keep? It was never reasoned, but rather that the POW became a slave labor force, in a country that has no resources at work. Or, perhaps, as a tool for killing propaganda as a tool in the United States - as a tool that Vietnam has secretly kept secret in the world. <br /> <br /> As a captive, North Vietnamese is treated by a northern fashion of Rambo. When the pig was driven on his neck and then worn by the wrists, the muscles were still visible. Then, sub-Vietnamese men are not satisfied, a Russian officer takes the role of the official Gestapo - "Vee haff Vays of FAKING you remember." A high-tech type, the Russians use psychology and electricity, not pork spillage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> Rambo returns and tries to make efforts "as much as we love this country." Veterinarians from Vietnam have been frightened by the myth, which is why I believe we have had so many elections in the Congress and others appointing top positions. He lost the last three presidential candidates among these contemptuous groups. At least Rambo did not open his journey, a succession was open. <br /> <br /> <br /> With Schwarzenegger and Willis, other films gave pasture, but Rambo was humorous. He walks sharply through his ghostly, ideological screen, to kill without mercy, without words, who can not speak. It's a sign of weakness to talk.
