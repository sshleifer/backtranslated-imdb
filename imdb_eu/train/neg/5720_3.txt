Some friends suggested "Live Feed" for me, and I can basically complain that it could fill the movie smut raw and cubes, but it's not a good movie. Obviously, by telling the latest trend in horror movie called Torturation Porn, Ryan Nicholson tries to overcome all his other films (ie, "Shelter" and "View" models) with his patient. and the crunching makeup effects and naked colleagues were completely depressed, they suffered and their lives were demanded. There is no plot to describe. Five, totally brainless, twenty-five people are traveling to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but I do not know why they had to travel there instead of Cancun. It is clear that they are not interested in the culture of the continent and they create a buzzing scene when they are witnesses of a puppy dog ​​on the market. Then the quintet sinks into dark nightlife, and one of them insults the clan's head unexpectedly. Pardon is just enough, because the gangster will take them to the theater for adults and gradually bring them all to torture. A girl has infected her breasts and a nasty dog ​​has also put a poisonous snake in her throat; yikes "Live Feed" is surprisingly boring, despite bloodshed and production buffs, it's pretty hard to forget, even if this is a fan-boy trash independent movie. The fat block that appears in the face, an S & M in the eastern neck, is pretty good and is also the most talented in the whole range, because it has closed its mouth at least all the time. I would not recommend this stack of dirt, but if you want to use loud and horrible music music, go to the annoying torture footage and losers, go ahead and watch!
