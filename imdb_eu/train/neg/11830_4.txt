Okay, perhaps, it was a 13 year old, like me, for this movie. It's about this lovely rat in the palace. Then a toilet washed a rat! He ends at the city of this rat, and he meets this little girl with a gem that wants a gem. He will convert to this gem, sends an entire army after these two rats. He plans to attack the city of prey. The fresh part of this movie is slim. They perform all sound effects. They sing, make noise, it's horrible, it's also fun. OK at the bottom, it's targeted at 7-year-olds. Another excellent scholar to see a younger family member. I did not think animation was a true nightmare art, like WAllace and Gromit. I think that's a bit shaken. The movie was decent, but it's not worth spending $ 9.50, sorry.
