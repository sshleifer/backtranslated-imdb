First of all ... I never considered Uwe Boll Hater myself, I think I never saw one of his films but saw the cheap excuse of a movie called "Seed" (this movie is the name of the serial killer)) I am a member of the hate club . This movie does not make any sense ... The land is a joke and even though Bolle clearly tries, the stunning people tries to make 90% of this movie just boring. You can summarize such a movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Hooded killer watches clumsy tortured on TV. Pelt is a real life footage footage and the movie "making humanity statements" and giving a Peta address is a wonderful reason. Because this movie does not contain messages and the pornographic exploitation is the worst piece of torture, you're right to hate the start-up movie. <br /> <br /> 2. With the excuse of death electrocution, which appears in the screen printed on this screen later, with all the delays. <br /> <br /> 3. The police watch videos, stupid nightmares and whiskey murmuring animals, babies and women and decomposing them in the cellar, because Seed is a bad muffin. Although the play is fine, each time he tries to enter emotions, he takes a dive ... 4. The police take a bust in his house, making stupid and shut up in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game, you see almost nothing except flashlights. Seed is everywhere the super-killer and all the police at the same time kill the stupid ones, they just have enough ... except those who get bored. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 5. Seed chair gets its electrocution as long as we see everything else in "this movie" ... it will not die and It reminds us that it should release the initial statement if it lasts 3 times more electric. Guess what ... they've just buried alive to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. It comes out of the grave in Seed, everyone else dissipates another part and then seeks out the main cop. <br /> <br /> 7. A woman has hit her head with a hammer, an endless sequence from a point of view, for its fun and infectious values. <br /> <br /> 8. Seed the police family of the police, he takes his home, threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After murdering his wife with a nail gun, the policeman tosses himself in the head, considering Seed's willingness to do it (it is difficult for the boys to enter themselves, though they also hide in jail, but never speaks ... he does not have any conversations, however do not mind). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> Boll ends the end of the semester with Seed blocking his father-in-law dad, as if we were to see people in the sequel's video. <br /> <br /> This is ... there is no message, no plot, no reason, no face behind the mask, the back is not a stupid story except when it was burned as a child. <br /> <br /> This movie only focuses on key scenes and their value. I do not remember that movie is emotion or empty message or entertainment. It's like watching August's meter ... it's good for me, some people will enjoy this headless tobacco. However, it is really hard about the pseudo message at the beginning and the camera's work, effects and even the performance of a well-made movie is suitable for this celluloid waste. <br /> <br /> So how does Bolle get money to create "movies" when thousands of talented directors work on a huge budget? "Seed" is not the essence of the hilarious, a lively market-free evidence ... Luck, the German taxpayer pays a lot of waste to get subtractions.
