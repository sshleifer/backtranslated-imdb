I got this DVD over two years ago, and I decided to only see it yesterday. I do not know why they took me, the Inspector Gadget show as well as the new Gadgetinis. Despite the technical sophistication of a bright color palette and a modern animated film, there are some of the old things that are missing in the boat. This gadget is in the right toilet. <br /> <br /> The first classic Inspector gadget theme song and music are completely missing. Composing is committing a score that is similar to the composer, but it is not enough. Gadget mobile is a car that is a car that does not become a van. Also, it looks a lot cooler and more compact. Penny no longer has a book on his computer, and Brain and Brain hardly ever appeared. <br /> <br /> Land does not exist. There is something about a transformation formula and it is used by Doctor Claw for some illness that never shows up, but that's all. I do not know I never know what the deal is. Nothing has anything to do with it. <br /> <br /> And if the title is over, the last case will come together in any case. And keeps the force, the "last case" is why it is also called a mystery. <br /> <br /> I was not surprised at all. This is a murmur of an animated entertainment on DVD, but let's not let you get any Inspector Gadget DVD that you can. I sold it in the last seconds, after seeing it. No one likes or appreciates this, and the fan of the old show does not support them.
