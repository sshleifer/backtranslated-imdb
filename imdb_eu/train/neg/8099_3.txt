It was a great book and there were opportunities to make a really beautiful movie. But the polls' decision completely ruined the movie. Hanks is an excellent actor to be sure, but he does not lack the necessary and morally ambivalent features necessary for himself. Jeff Daniels would be my choice. <br /> <br /> Melanie Griffiths is understandable for eye candy reasons, but once again she has not portrayed depth or ambivalence, so it must come out. <Br> /> <br /> This movie is a great example of all decisions, as well as those who are already in the beginning of the movie, can make a file or break it.
