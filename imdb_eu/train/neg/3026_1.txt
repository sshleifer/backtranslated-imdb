presumably based on the life of Domino Harvey, became a model converter. I would say that 95% would be manufactured. Although I still remain in cinema, this movie has lost its chance to be a narrative throughout the film, but I could not stress it, so the hero of the story is hateful and proud to be thrown into my head. It's too exaggerated, overwhelming and very boring, who's a joke, and I think it's a great time for the director to make films of his own or a writer's imagination, I do not know he's saying something wild about snobby. .
