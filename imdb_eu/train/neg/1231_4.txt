Della Myers (Kim Basinger), a senior housewife lives in a private neighborhood, her twin children and Kenneth (Craig Sheffer) lives with her hateful husband. Della Twins pays attention to everyone, without leaving the house and appearance and disturbed by Kenneth. On Christmas Eve, he takes the local store that drives at night to buy gifts to buy paper and find no parking. When he sees an old car parked in two places, he leaves a message to the owner to call himself "jerk jerk". When the center closes, Della car retains the driver's car and has four-pointer threats? Chuckie (Lukas Haas), African American Huey (Jamie Starr), Vingh Chinese-American (Leonard Wu) and Tomás Latin (Luis Chávez). Protecting the center's shelter, Chuckie fired. Della, the car tries to escape from the criminals. However, his truck fails next to a forest, while the gang follows. It takes the tool box and hides it in the wood to survive in the fight against the gang. <br /> <br /> Two days ago, I saw the movie "When She Was Out", and I wanted to watch the DVD. . Unfortunately, the trailer is better than the movie, and I am totally disappointed with this blurry and unforgettable collection of topicals. Della Myers is a sure and unforgettable housewife and not a wife; Maternity is an interest in her family concept. It means four criminals, but it seems that Batman's utility belt. For this reason, the plot is so absurd that it flattens. Amongst the criminals, it is formed by the favorite American film, with the help of African American, American, and Latin American politicians. Kim Basinger has a decent job, but their children are fifty-five years old. My votes are four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela Está Fuera" ("Atera mientras")
