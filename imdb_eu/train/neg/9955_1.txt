The whole thing is very nice ... It was a good idea to shoot the European position. Actors are attractive. Score is advisable. <br /> <br /> BUT DO NOT USE IT! And it's been developed on a plot! And they fell from it. Pacino is a salmon that is sleeping and Keller still gets bored. Truly, my dear, you are not alone. When Mae West imitates, you should hide your face, seeing it painful. <br /> <br /> I did not imagine that the actor and director of Sydney's Pollock was involved, or better. Question, why is it so bad? <br /> <br /> When death is represented in almost every scene, in some way or another, you might enjoy it here. Maybe it feels like death and cold. But I still can not recommend it.
