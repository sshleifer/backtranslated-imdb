It was a long movie that was released by Christmas in 1940. Very poor copy resurrected and converted into a CD to sell now. Buy no! The movie is not horrible. Casting is a bad one, the script is horrible, and it is a great director. <br /> <br /> Image Roland Young singing and dancing. That was remarkable. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie was deliberately lost.
