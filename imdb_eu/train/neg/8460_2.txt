I rented this movie for the promises of William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. This movie was thought to be a good movie on the cover of RR (as an actor). Rodr√≠guez is like a movie to be done, so if he gives his name, he'll be fine? Poorly written Until now, the worst edition of "Manos hands fate". The edit mode was senseless and the movie was impossible and after 30 minutes you did not want to continue. I do not know how Dafoe and Rodriguez participated in this movie, maybe they owe it to someone, but this is a good way to do it. On the other hand, this movie was just two minutes away, and Rodriguez did not even talk. So if you want to watch the movie if you want to watch the movie, the bad performance and the story is more confusing than the guest, but do not say it was not.
