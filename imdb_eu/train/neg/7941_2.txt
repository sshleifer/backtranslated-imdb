As the year 2000 was over, the daughter adopted in King Kong went ahead and announced that her show was over. <br /> <br /> While Miss Winfrey was wandering, I laughed and cried like a wild man. West Indies <br /> <br /> So what does Oprah do? He takes famous people and puts them on his show. what celebrities? For those who suffer (like those who have lost more than their virginity as their own), face melting (real story), lack of body (real story, see at the end of the paragraph) and abuse of marriage (too much). and somehow they tell the show and tell her story, as if we had not heard it before ton and ton (Bethany Hamilton, I've heard that your story has lost an arm from the first day since it was a shark, it was October 2003. I do not have the toughest feelings no.) But Oprah's most important thing was Michael Jackson's 1993 conversation as a child molest. Sadly, Mr. Jackson has died. But a particular show talked about Michael's personal life, many people did not know at that time. Oprah's true impact comes from middle-aged women and soccer moms. It seems that it is sometimes similar to Jesus. But all I see in Oprah was a great big ghetto lady, and she just shows how rich she is. <br /> <br /> Glad its shows will soon end. we need better television programs.
