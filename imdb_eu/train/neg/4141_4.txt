Well ... the movie was a fun watch. The main problem of this movie is to oppose everything that most vampire myths do. Like the vampires that make sunlight. Although there are parts that society enjoys in the way of making films. A scene that squeezes and shouts a vampire "This is fine ... really stuck." Then, it seems that the scene may be missing but you are a little accustomed. There are sequential dreams of dreams, which really do not help the plot. Think it's not really sensible, but I've only got a bunch of friends and I've twice seen the full effect. Come to think the battle scenes were aweful, and the zombies are just fun to watch. As I write more slowly, I like this movie more. But you know that Schindlers List is impossible, but it's a fun watch.
