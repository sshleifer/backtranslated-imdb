This movie was made for people who found Gremlins serious and Critters hardcore. Like many critters / trolls / gremlins of the 80s, this movie is bad. The sad part is that there is no punishment for this comment. It's bad and it's not fun. <br /> <br /> The problem of this miniature movie is trying to be really fun and to be successful in Howie Mandell Walk Like A. Man Getting into the classics of the 80's horror films was really terrifying because they had been ridiculous because they failed. Someone would have to tell Bettina Hirsch (both Bettina Hirsch) before starting to direct the movie to a comedy. Sadly they were wrong. <br /> <br /> It is important to be sure that they see a small cross between a ferret and a cancer crossing old trousers and pools among those excluded from a quarry but not enough to store it. movie <br /> <br /> The most dangerous part of the movie is Paulo. Paul Reiser's winnabe schtick is enough to allow the first scene to be forwarded over time, to see the scene that casts a munchie art up until the end of the season, but I did not do that. <br /> So, the bottom line runs, you will not walk the nearest blockbuster and shake it to generosity and thank you for not having grapes to supply this pile of landfill on the shelf.
