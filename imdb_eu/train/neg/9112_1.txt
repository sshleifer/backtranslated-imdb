Basically, Cruel Intentions 2 Cruel Intentions 1 is once again just wrong. The story is the same as the first one (although some lines), with few exceptions.

I do not know about guilty lines about actors or writers ... And I always feel that I'm wrong, I know how hard it is ... but it was basically two ... the loss of my life's time. He literally impressed me with making some films, which is no exception ... I can not believe they will make a third.
