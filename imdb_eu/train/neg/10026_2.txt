I had a hope for the movie, it was a pretty dash of stars and it's a return to Akshay and Saif. Well, I was doubting seeing the movie because I did the same man who wrote the story of the Dhoom franchise, I hate Dhoom 2; But compared to Dhoom 2 Tashan, I would say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the credits, I felt pleasant, because it was a nice way. Well, the first scene made me awake. Next, the main obstacle to the film is action sequences. Me and my friends were scattered around our heads fighting badly. Akshay against 30 thugs and all and thugs was also a machine gun! Phew ... you should see this to misunderstand the action sequences. <br /> <br /> The other thing in the movie is more predictable. He reminded me of some of the early 80's films. <br /> <br /> Well, the only worthy movie is Kareena sexya, it really looks really hot. And for that, I give it a score. 10 people. 10. <br /> <br /> Boys, please ... please do not think this is a real movie for gangsters. Well, you can watch this, laughter some terrible scenes fights. <br /> <br /> That's it.
