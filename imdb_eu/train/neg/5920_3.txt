Unusual Yes! <br /> <br /> An unusual atmosphere for the American war movie in New Zealand. <br /> <br /> The unusual theme, four sisters and their relations between the American soldiers, the illegal child. The son of a senator died, he lives with another of the seven marines (one at a time), the new POW returned before his wife was killed by French husband. <br /> <br /> An unusual breakdown by Paul Newman as soon as he's been racing. His unforgettable role in rocky graceful "Somebody Up There Loves Me". <br /> <br /> An unusual two "Stars" by Joan Fontain and Jean Simmons, so much so to leave a movie. /> <br /> To work on writing a review of this unusual tool is very rare.
