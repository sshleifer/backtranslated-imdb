Two nights I saw 'Invidia' on the DVD at the friends' house. The premise of this film is quite promising, in a comedy with great potential, Jack Black and Ben Stiller, but he completely fails to deliver it. I have seen about five friends and no one has missed the whole movie. Jokes (roughly in between) They are NOT funny at all ... the story line is empty and they never answer this question ... WHERE SH * T GO? Of course, his response is not taken care of. This movie does not play comedy any way, and other users have said they are the only observation worthy of Christopher Walken's J-man. No character is ever developing; So plump plots are almost transparent and this film is very popular in the whole movie?
