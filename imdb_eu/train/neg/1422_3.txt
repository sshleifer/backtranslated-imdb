The original Lensman series of novels is a classic genre. SF is a pure adventure with some substances (here and there) and I've always wondered why it has not been filmed literally because Hollywood is the only thing that loves: massive explosions, super-weapons, iber-heroes, heroes get girls, aliens (CGI potential) Good-versus evil in good form, etc. Instead (and keep in mind that I'm a Japanese-o-phile and anime lover), we get this awful movie that violates our roots. The story is mixed with Star Wars (sometimes the books were extracted from time to time) pastiches and the whole thing falls into "Thundercats". To see Kimball Kinnison, the official Galactic Patrol and the second stage of the Lensman Reptile is depicted as a little boy (etc). I only understand why the authors made the story's rights and much more money (FAR!) Because they made it live. It does not make sense.
