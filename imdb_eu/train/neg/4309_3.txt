With a high school group, Keenan Wynn will hire a coach who is also a high school group of high school students (Cathy Lee Crosby). Are you really surprised? The coach and team player grows between the love of Jack (Michael Biehn). The police have never reported. <br /> <br /> Another film that is co-producted with Crown International Pictures is that this film does not provide any service. This can be easily edited in a one-week TV movie. Cathy Lee Crosby, Randy Rawlings, is a great coach, especially in front of his clothes, but I expected more than just titillation of R-rated. With his teammates, the former NBA player in a plot that hypnotizes an old Sydney Wicks player is a reason for the success of the group rather than the cathy Lee coach. There is not too much of a face and this sleaze is not enough.
