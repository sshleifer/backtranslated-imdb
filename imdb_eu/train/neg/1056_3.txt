Diana Guzman is an angry woman. Withdrawal and continued trauma in the series, the anger is based on the closest goals. <br /> <br /> When he transforms violence into a boxing club and he is immersed in a club discipline, he knows he has found his home. <br /> <br /> The film progresses from there, learning to teach Diana as much as she learns, along with the skills she needs for a successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good at playing a role, especially when she is transmitting the feminine rage of a young woman surrounded by all sides, and not just about people but also consolidated sexism. <br /> <br /> The image can use some refinements compared to the direction of all its young actors, older and more experienced. There are too many steps in the script, which eliminates the dramatic tension. The calmness of the film is in general shuddering. <br /> <br /> This is a good image to see more than once, even if a young woman has a power full of feminine power to access her power. Its limitation prevents the positioning of "see again and again".
