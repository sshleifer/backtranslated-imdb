Self-release, because foreign movies, dark and the star of Catherine Zeta-Jones does not mean. This is what happens with 'Blue Juice', a sketchy draft of a surfer in 1995 (apparently an American), when he considered the most dangerous place to find a surfer in Cornwall, England, might be thinking of arrangements for a fun and inviting comedy. It's just over ninety minutes, but it seems final. The easiest way to describe it 'Grease' is a British version of the 90s, without dancing, but it makes even better sounds, not the best way to take it in a small town, a small part of life Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Chloe, a young woman who lives with JC (Sean Pertwee; you remember) with a surf instructor. Pertwee is a movie star and his character is a surfing legend for a small group of surf devotees. It is inevitably the free spirits that live in such movies inevitably, in this case, because they want to be a journalist, a nightclub producer She is a national-trafficker who wants to be a former journalist and producer of discourse, and steals herself in a scene without need and loses all her inhibitions. Of course, it's the best thing ever happened. I can not say everything that happens in "Blue Juice" can be predicted, because it is located in a place, because it reflects the customs and customs that are very popular, but it is not surprising and it is not interesting what happens with the characters. Comedy, however, is very predictable and tired. You can feel a mile away and recite the dialog (American form, of course) before almost the actors. The relationship between JC and Chloe is in a bad way. He wants to grow up; He wants to keep up with passionate teenagers. She fears she loses her face; she thinks she prefers it. You get an idea. While I tried to stay around "Blue Juice", I felt at last, as it says, that I would never return an hour and a half of my life.
