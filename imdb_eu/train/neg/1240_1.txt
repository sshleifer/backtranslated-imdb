I think everyone was different from the sci-fi movie. For some reason, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing is the supposedly rebuilding of the classics. I found it boring, gross and ridiculous. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. All the Imdb say about shit and boys, right? If you do not avoid it. It's a fisherman. From 10 onwards
