I wanted to see the prequel at night last night or I decided to say it to Carlito Way's prequel - "Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)" DVD went live ... it's not surprising ..... altogether ... and I mean completely S% & KS !!! I'd like to see the time in the waist and I think it would be a war that is about this time ... I do not know how De Palma agreed to make this film's sh # t-fest consensus ... except for the fact that I'm wearing my hat. Jay Hernandez, a young brigand. He reminded me how De Niro was involved in Brando's footwear to portray young Don Corleone in Godfather II ... but De Niro was a stunning surprise and he got an Oscar! Jay Hernandez is doing well for trying to be a young Pacino ... bad for him. I think it's not playing in the movie and I've seen this video game ... and I've seen Carlitos's original path to get a bad taste.
