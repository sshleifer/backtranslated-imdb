I will be short and a point. This movie was an insult to any intensive room temperature. Forgive the liberals, the feminists, etc. Women will never be a seal. The draft can be forgotten or struggling. It will not happen. You see, understand, or accept as hard as men and women are physically different. Indeed, even in 2007, reality can not change things so people can not feel the feelings. Men can not feed their babies or babies (I forgot about San Francisco). <br /> <br /> Women have no physical strength to compare physical combat or other physically challenging men. How Many Women Do They Play NFL or NHL? In the end, I can not give a bloody one to what I write to hell. Think of this if you think that my heart warms up. I actually did not write a thing. This stupid movie is just a comedy and proud.
