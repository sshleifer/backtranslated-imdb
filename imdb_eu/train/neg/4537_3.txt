I really did not enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a campsite, and we did not hear about it, we laughed. Surely, some parts are shocking, but the play is awful, the effects are awful, and the overall idea of ​​the film is horrible (I now know I did not read the book I read, but I hope the book is better than that, in fact, this very bad movie and I thought it was boring). As I said, I went to people in a camp and we were excited about it, and I also got caffeine-drink, but I was still struggling. The only thing I kept when I was awake when I was afraid was that they only did not have guns. I do not like it.
