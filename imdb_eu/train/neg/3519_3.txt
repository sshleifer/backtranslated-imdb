I like the Stallone films that I like, but this film does not meet my small expectations. I found this movie incredible. For example, a series of terrorists that destroy the land in the desert are prepared for at least two-day survival. Additionally, all this savage Stallone and the company continue to work on bridges and ladders, briefly or through the stairs that offer good plots. In addition, a treasury police officer does not seem to coordinate anything with local rescue people. Likewise, the bad guys who could not go to a barn, they really looked for high-tech weapons automatically. <br /> <br /> At first I liked John Lithgow's evil, but this character is not a complete psychopath. Take care of one of his wicked people, or die for all. In the end, I could not believe the character any more. <br /> <br /> Not worth the price of a rental, although it does not take a long time to see it.
