This curiosity led me to the curiosity. Unfortunately, I did not rent, I bought it! The worst thing about this movie is not so disturbing. For reasons that only know, the authors of this film intended to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding? The man gave them a new meaning as the "finger lickin". And with all the flashbacks, I had the story tracked. Totally Jeremy Renn's performance was not bad. "S.W.A.T." You can get caught up in the name of a shameless police officer. However, I would rate it as 1/10. He only scored 1 for Renn's performance. There are numerous books and television documentaries that make a better job of covering Dahmer crimes. Avoid this
