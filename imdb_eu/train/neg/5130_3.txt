Janeane Garofalo has had a great deal of public awareness about this film, including anti-feminist feminist. He also said in the radio show he hates "romantic comedies" because he does not believe in them. I'm very much in agreement with Janeane here. This movie is at least empty. He does his best, but in general, the "romantic comedy" not based on the real world was boring and compelling. While some say they're "awkwardly hanging out", you're tired of having to close almost every time you get a romantic Hollywood movie. Janean's character, for some reason, is usually shooting shadows and darkness, which gives him an early appearance, but Uma is filmed in lighter shades of character (surely Janeane has afflicted and, surely, that movie goes back). That really hurts if we want to buy the movie if Janeane wants to look better. As many as you say, and about other reviews, Janeane is not ugly, but quite pretty. I did not read a review, someone said Uma looked better. That said, Ben Chaplin's character probably seems to continue with Uma and Janeane. Many men do not really like smart women (and many women do not really like smart men) and, unfortunately, Ben would probably stay with Uma. And despite the fact that the director has become an attraction to Janeane, it does not work. Its natural beauty is achieved. <br /> <br /> We care about Janean's great fans like this movie, because they want to think about themselves as Ben Chaplin and Janeane. Janeane is much more complicated than the character he plays here (Hollywood is much more complex than real life), so take it with cold gentlemen. This is Janeane's role, which is a shame because it's not good at the movie.
