I saw this movie with my climbing teacher, and we found the same stupidity as the fault. (Batak, if Stallone climbs up for free, does not make any gear necessary, but I think that strangers have to look like "mountain climby", so throw them away). While those who think that the Dolomites in Italy are similar to Coloradok (when they filmed the film, Hollywood magnates had a much more ridiculous and bad odor to swallow.
