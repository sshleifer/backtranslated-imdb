When I was born in Texas and less than 15 miles from Gilley, I can say that this movie is not evil. Most Texans do not refer directly to the movie. The plot is weak and fake accents are fun and stereotypical texts reinforce Texans that drink beer, honky-tonkin ', rednecks. The fabulous false accent in Texas is what kills me. It is true that some of Texas' Texas are in most instincts, but these people do too much. You can not get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to Texas accents. It just works. John Travolta's disco dance should be stuck in the 50's. Debra Winger persuaded Wonder Girl as Texan.
