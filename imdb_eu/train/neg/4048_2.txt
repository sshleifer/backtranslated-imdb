Maybe not, but it's horrible. The fantastic shot can not be saved. Okay, it started to be fun, but he told me to go down, as soon as the general's house jumped on the girls. Bill Murray was out of quarrelsome and humorous people who were shouting at people who were on the street, but it was not very funny. His character stole a weapon (a virtual vehicle?) And he has come to be a national hero because he knew how many soldiers he had invaded and a killer god to laugh at. The most important thing is that this film shows the shortage and disabilities of the US Army and shows how real and absurd they are, though they are unintentionally. I truly felt that this type of propaganda crap really can be released.
