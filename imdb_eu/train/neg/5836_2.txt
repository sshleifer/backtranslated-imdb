The condolence of Richard Condon's (Manchurian Candidate 1962) story, intrigue and political murder comes. The story, almost told in vain, is hard to swallow. Seeing all the stars, this bad effort is not entirely the fault and the guilty of the crew: the novel was the same version. The story seems to sometimes make a more genuine effort to "Manchurian Candidate". Disappointment for all
