I want to throw lines like this, but in this case I need: The American version of THE GRUDGE is the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters in the last four years. There, I said. And now I got out of my system, explain why. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < That's the premise of GRUDGE, and I think it's interesting. Unfortunately, the filmmakers take no more. Those who find the "curse", in fact, consume their anger and you get all this. Want more? Okay bad Some critics and fans have pointed out that THE GRUDGE's sole purpose is to frighten you. The problem is that when there is no need to talk, great images and sounds can go a long way. Takashi Shimizu, George Sluizer, plays and rescues his original movies and wants to build the atmosphere in the first place? repeated the same scene repeatedly. It develops as much as this: <br /> <br /> -personalising the home <br /> <br /> it flashes something with a camera and / or a strange sound <br /> <br /> -personal research <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ br> > <br /> -ed black to <br /> <br /> Before the listener paves the way for a plot, this same scenario is developed in 5 hours at the first hour. It was the first time that it was quite awful. Each subsequent use made it dark as the film progresses. When the movie was over, my friends and me were laughing if this scene was over "it would cut off a big cry and black." We never proved wrong. <br /> <br /> The movie is not line-free without permission, and some landscapes can be confused by the audience. I have no problem with a linear narration. The film jumps from a period of time without rhyme or reason. Since the beginning of the theater version, I have not seen the movie in that movie. And this storytelling connects all the mysteries that may be the mystery of that film. Do you know that ghosts frighten both characters to death, how is their body moving in the attic? And why should we care if a detective finds out what has happened to everyone who tries to investigate mysterious disappearances? <br /> <br /> Of course, the second weekend THE RING has made it the first weekend of $ 15 million. It's just a calculated costume imitated as a true movie. The most amazing thing about The Grudge made $ 40 million in the first weekend and some people think it's a "never-ending movie". I wonder what happens to those who consume the anger of paying the earthquake?
