I just saw this after I heard it was bad and I wanted to see myself. Actually, if you read all the negative comments here, you will not be close enough to understand this movie really, even though it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen! I have never had trouble sending the comments before, but this shade part really guarantees. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the plot is ridiculous and absurd. The main character's brother (Ben or Arthur, I forget what it is and, in fact, it is not very clear), seeing that he wants to stop all gay marriages that he wants to stop marrying - homosexuality is a wonderful front of Christians, but apparently no mass murder. t. Afterwards, he was trying to try to get married instead of trying to marry another woman with a grieving couple. That does not bring anything, but it gives us one of the funniest lines of conversation throughout the "movie": "I do not make sense? You do not make sense! That's the meaning!" Brilliant <br /> <br /> Then it's the play, it's just that weird. It must be thought My favorite is the recipient of civil rights lawyer, apparently reading his roots, reading something. He said enough. Gay couples would not be persuaded. It is a nonsensical and boring assault, and its boyfriend is similar to the massive cartoon dough. Fat only And less talent. <br /> <br /> The movie "Film" has shot someone who has not yet been able to keep a camera, and the number of errors is amazing. The whole thing starts with a fat men in the bed with boots. Yes <br /> <br /> But, nevertheless, we all know what the great thing is, so I'd like to point out some of the most curious moments in comedy "movies". <br /> <br /> - When raw food is lit up by the church, then it begins to run like a six-year-old girl in the parking lot to escape. Horny <br /> - Smooth! We do not know the relationship with the main characters - they sometimes know it, sometimes they do not, but anyway the scene will appear in a couple. Hilarioa <br /> <br /> - Lawyer receiver. He has already mentioned, but it is very funny to mention another mention. <br /> <br /> - An evil dinner for crackers who think of their guests. <br /> <br /> - Ancient evil brother gay potion. <br /> <br /> - The cats of the evil brothers. <br /> <br /> - I do not end it because it has to be believed because it needs to be believed. But I confess to you, make sure you do not eat at that time! The protagonist / manager / producer of Gantzu is left naked. It's hard. <br /> <br /> Essentially, Ben and Arthur are not terribly bad, but it's the most comical thing you can do for a long time. Literally, there is nothing good about this excuse for a movie. The goal of a manager also starts making a joke in the first place by writing his name about 15 times.
