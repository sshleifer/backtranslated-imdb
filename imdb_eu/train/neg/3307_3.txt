My comments can be a bit of a spoiler, what's worth it. Stop it now enough ... <br /> <br /> Saving Grace should be called "British Old Women to be a great pretext on the screen." This movie is silent. Story music is annoying, commentary on the narration ("Spirit in the sky," for example, Oh! I am!) This is basically a disgraceful Cheech and Chong film. with strict English presence and Brenda Blethyn's power to trigger emotions only by voice voice. Literally people from the High Times magazine could hear what they are saying about the "grandmothers" that are grazing this image. Worst scene Easy Brenda tries to sell her illegal goods in black dress in black dress, London Street. It's not fun It's not an original It's not interesting. It's not a good movie. 7.2 score was too much vote. Do not waste time ...
