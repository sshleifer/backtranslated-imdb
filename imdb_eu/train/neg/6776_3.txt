I wanted to love this movie. How did I not love? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all icons in their own way. However, Suzy Parker was the whole experience of the sinking of the train. His performance was so horrible, and I sat there where the hole was open and I did not believe my eyes or ears. I hardly saw one, which is why it's horrible. <br /> <br /> Cary? Beautiful and beautiful shape. Jayne? Adorable, lovable, and, of course, having a ball. The help desk is in good condition and the city of San Francisco catches its elegant and retro style. <br /> <br /> Next, you will see that Suzy Parker is trying to talk about her lines, that is, a dead man. He just challenges him. Who said this creature? OY VEY, people.
