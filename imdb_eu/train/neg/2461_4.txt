Probably most people are afraid of the dentist, let's say, little dolls or horrible monsters. This is a perfect issue for a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for many years, but when her wife caught her wife, she caught her in the pool and brought her anger and frustration. Well, give a crazy dentist a drill and a mouth, and you can guess what might happen ... <br /> <br /> As I said, it's a great idea but it's not delivered properly. Above all, the end is fruitful. Last Note: See here Mark Ruffalo (You Can Count On, Eternal Sunshine ...). Check out 5/10.
