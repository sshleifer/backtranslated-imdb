This movie did not have a big star, but it was very good to be filled with great actors and before becoming a great star of Gene Tierney. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke, you'd expect more to give away the movie. All of this, I suspect, because of the secondary screenplay, the director Henry Hathaway was the most competent and well-known headmaster. <br /> <br /> The film is in East Africa during the Second World War - before the Americans start the war. The British are trying to control their African colonies, as well as the Nazi subversion elements trying to create native problems. One of the white men in the movie is twice as good as destroying the British empire! But, beautiful Tierney, helping the Sultan's daughter (!), Helps her save on the day of Great Britain. <br /> <br /> American filmmakers have long left the empire, and in the 1930s and 40s most of the empire's films have been seen. Today, due to sensitivity changes, I think it's a ridiculous idea to see happy black deaths for the Queen and the country ... and the roots of both sides would be difficult! However, during this time, this propaganda work will receive support for Britain; Seeing nowadays, she is having long movie scripts and stupid quizzes. The great moment in the film is George Sanders and the latest discovery of the enemy agent. It was very bad after this powerful scene, the film seemed to speak and talk - it lost a perforated one.
