I do not know about languages ​​or plays, but everything about this movie seems cheap and false. <br /> <br /> After seeing Der Untergang, there is a great despair. There is no connection between the different scenes, and the performance is very poor, I can not believe that people can do something that has a great potential. <br /> <br /> And, above all, in Germany everyone speaks English. Great mistake Germany has a certain sound, and, above all, Hitler only speaks of Hitler / when he shouts German. <br /> <br /> I think they improvised it as it tells the story, the characters are empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events. <br /> <br /> Whether I saw English or Der Untergang, everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous.
