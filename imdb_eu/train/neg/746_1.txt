Save $ 8.97 to Walmart to buy this DVD and see the real movie by Steven Spielbergen. <br /> <br /> I am a filmmaker and I had to be a fan of HG Wells. This is expected to be a rest and three hours of good entertainment. Instead, four days have been needed to see this, I could not stop watching over 10 minutes. It's horrible <br /> <br /> Timothy Hines reports a $ 20 million budget for this production. Where was hell? Did you use the most used to buy a new house? Financing your retirement? Or what? Let's make this movie very good. The book remains true and there are some good performances there. I can respect the actors that try to make the movie a good one. But the good performances were horrified and shocked ... and the special effects are awful. Each student can have a better job with his film. With 20,000 million dollars worth of projects to use in the 20 million-dollar project, it seemed to me that cutting-off cards that were used instead of sophisticated CGI software. Applied to this film. I sat down with my partner and I and Ferry was recreating a new version of the scene: software that was worth less than $ 1500.00 and a better five-day scene of five minutes than a better and more real one than the one created by Hines. I've seen better movies with less than $ 2 million. Much better <br /> <br /> King Kong's original special effects were more sophisticated and better in Hines in my film. I know a lot better because of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. Today's technology is not an excuse for a movie to be a B-Movie for the 1950s unless it was intended for this particular project. <br /> <br /> I had the problem with the DVD transfer. The movie was jerky, it was another show of cinema buffs. <br /> <br /> In general, I must say that in 2003, $ 45,000 had been produced by a better cinematography and more special effects than this one. /> <br /> I encourage anyone who loves doing a good movie or is a fan of WOTW to watch this movie on the shelf and watch 50 women's footsteps. It would be easier for the eyes.
