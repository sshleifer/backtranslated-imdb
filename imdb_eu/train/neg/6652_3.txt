It was a curious movie about New York's dysfunction, and the main character (title, Brad Pitt) was located around a prominent character who thinks he is a musician of Ricky Nelson. He really did not have much talent. . <br /> <br /> It's fun to see a woman with a horrible New York-born woman with a horrible concept, and that's why she's going to come in. This damaged my movie. It was Catherine Keener, who was usually a hard-hitting woman. <br /> <br /> Pitt's hairstyle, too pompadour, was very fun to look at. Johnny Depp seems to make this function better. A final note: a movie created in 1992 (except Woody Allen, with a single sound).
