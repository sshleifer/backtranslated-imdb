(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was very curious to see the movie after listening to the light and the spirit. I had to stop half a half because of the boring boredom I felt. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the film would be acceptable: imagining how the relationship between a man and a woman is developed, through all the problems and difficulties. Two people living in a big city can experience it. The film I swore I hated two things. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the films were so grounded, as if the couple were describing the problems that were to be resolved on the day. The base of the day became plain and dull. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the general remembrance of production, with conversations almost comprehensible. <br /> <br /> Very bad.
