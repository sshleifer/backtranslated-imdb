Man, what a scam! There was no good (not as much as I expected), but I was fooled by the DVD manga, the "stars" did not know Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Without a doubt, their names did not appear in the initial credits of the film, much less the rest of them! As a consequence, the only film that links these three actors together is LAS VEGAS LADY (1975). But what do we need to do with CRATER LAKE MONSTER? <br /> <br /> However, I had to pay $ 1.50, and I was in a monster-movie mood, I decided to watch the movie somewhat, yes! In addition to being an unnamed cast and an anonymous crew, an incredible air was visible a thousand miles away, and I can most do it to laugh at the similarities of JAWS and, deliberately, to resistance. two loves of Moroccan owners of two layabouts-cum-ships, often facing the local sheriff who are confronting each other. The same creature? Plesiosaur, that is, half-dinosaur / half-fish? Imperfectly he realizes (naturally), as I have seen, just as THE GIANT CLAW (1957) has happened, this does not seem to make any difference to filmmakers as much as possible. especially in the second part of the film!
