Alicia Silverstone (pre- "Clueless") plays a contemporary crime-obsessed teenager to solve the wild-fright of a girl. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B-Flick, although not particularly well-known, but is surprisingly enthusiastic about its protagonist. Silverstone is an attractive and successful woman who draws an interesting young woman here, although this image is excited to be infused. Supporting work (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad because it overcomes violence in the last act. It's not a fest-party, but it's nothing memorable. * 1/2 ****
