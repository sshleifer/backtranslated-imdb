Here is what you can see with a straight face, so bad script, though Will Ferrell was not there. <br /> <br /> There are two laughs at HOT ROD. <br /> <br /> 1. Punch-dance. Rod "has to go to his quiet place" and anyone can say that Kevin Bacon stirs a fierce stroke of a group that wants to have a bad European badge. > <br /> 2. John Farnham's You're The Voice.

An Australian singer (and real talent) was famous at the beginning of the 70's in Raindrops Keep Fallin 'My My Head, and then disappeared until 1986 with The Big Comeback You're The Voice.

Along the way (as usual in these comedies), he scored a Healthy Chicken (Isla Fisher), probably to delay the chromosome to think of exchanging such a loser. 1976) has done so little in his operation, he has almost called it, and then he thought and hung it. Ian McShane must miss a bet to stay here.
