I love Clash music and I love Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros music. I went to this movie to learn about the man behind that. But I got out of the theater and I did not know much about reading Joe's Wikipedia entry. The film never gets people, thoughts and feelings. They collected small materials that were made, fuzzy video clips were collected, and people had to interview people about Joe Strummer in an outdoor fire. So, most of these people were familiar with the fact that they knew little or not, and the director wanted them more celebrities, "O, everyone has inspired us all." Like Bono or Johnny Depp (a pirate costume that he called for today's successful Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems that the director can not wait until the corpse was cold before he sold it to the "punk rocker and hippie greatest" version, who never lived and sanctified that person without wanting to know it. > <br /> Of course, being an enthusiast liked seeing the group's images, listening to the anecdotes behind the songs and such as, but finally, I could feel like Joe Strummer's 60th portrait. -90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Go see if you are a fan of the movie, otherwise better listen to Clash music or even better Mescaleros unknown, where Joe Strummer reaches the top of his musical development. his death, melting into a stunning sound that causes all his riches.
