Some news and their military escorts try to tell the truth about a zombie epidemic, even though "the government controls the media." The adaptation of the film does not mean that George Romero's zombie films only functioned as his pretty politics behind most of his films ("The People of the Dead"). This satire is as subtle as the brick's face, or it's a bullet in the head, in this scenario. What is subversive or subtle military seeing when you kill death and destruction? What's wrong about the different ads that are cut along with the movie? Laguia. In addition, the play is uniformly horrible, perfectly understandable and inane. Add this and the zombie movie is the worst and the worst since the "C.H.U.D. 2" head was awful. <br /> <br /> My grade: D
