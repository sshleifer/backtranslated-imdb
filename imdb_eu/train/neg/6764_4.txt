NATURAL BORN KILLERS (1994) <br /> <br /> Film Cut: R <br /> <br /> Director's Cut: NC-17 <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone is an unusual image , but when I shot the drugs I read, I did not need more explanation. 'Natural Born Killers' is a dangerous film, crazy and we do not often get it; Strange, psychotic and artistic images. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Natural Born Killers' is basically the story of the mass media reporting and glorifying mass murderers. It's an excellent scene where the interviewer asks teenage girls about Mickey and Mallory and the adolescent says that "Murder is wrong ... but I'd be a mass murderer, Mickey and Mallory. Mickey describes the situation of Frankenstein (monster) and Dr. Frankenstein. Dr. Frankenstein is the media that has become a killer monster. <br /> <br /> Most of them are studying Oliver Stone in America, a country that loves and admires the director. I think that 'Natural Born Killers' mass media, as a consequence of technology and as obsessive as the nation, are more Americans (and most of the world) than mass murderers and strange things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory ) are executed astonishingly by two of the great actors involved in the brutal interests of two murderers. Mickey and Mallory say they deserve to kill some people, perhaps in the cruel theory of social Darwinism (survival of the patient) - Mickey has said he is murdering other species, a man who is destroying and exploiting other species. environment; The script is interesting, but it is doubtful how much this film has a sense of social and human behavior, but the intensity of a 2-hour blood bath we have seen. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the film is held in a maximum security prison; We see hard realities of prison life; The attitudes of carers, the overload of prisons - perhaps Stone questioned the future, the path that society puts it. <br /> <br /> Two other interesting characters; First, she is obsessed with a journalist who is directing a show about 'America's Maniacs' and goes on to get the story of Mickey and Mallory. Another official Scagnetti is Mallory, a sadistic, perhaps sadistic, maid, who has a strange obsession with mass murderers, because Charles Whitman died in massacre in Waco (Texas). <br /> <br /> Cinematography is excellent; Different colors, shadows, styles create a feeling of disorientation; It's green in all colors, it's green, it's like it's like killer's disease (when you're looking for a boutique's sketch shop). <br /> <br /> Camera work is madness; shaking, buzzy, decides to use and accept. Very orthodox, psychedelic and unusual. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Natural Born Killers' does not reflect the existence of murderers, questions, and how publicly we can attribute this attribute to fuel ... <br /> <br / > Although the previous review was very positive, I liked the movie. Quentin Tarantino, originally a scriptwriter of the movie, was not happy with the script and called for his name to be removed. Why i see Sometimes it's very interesting, it's a Natural Born Killers picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
