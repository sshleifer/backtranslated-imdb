Jack Black's character, Tim Dingman, "Dreamer" of Envy, has a wealth and success with the idea of ​​"Vapoorize" spray aerosol, when it gets rid of this idea on a dog pig. <br /> <br /> At one point I thought Vapoorize was a real product, because I was soaked on the "stinker" of a movie and I would also disappear in the air. <br /> </ p> <p> Envy is not the worst movie I've ever seen in the last 12 months (Honor to Cat's Hat Honor), he gets a second honored honor. <br /> <br /> It's not fun or sad or nothing. Real "Stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> <br /> From 0 to 0.2 !!
