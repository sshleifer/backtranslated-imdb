I do not know why he made a Spike Lee movie train, and with Stevie Wonder he linked his beautiful music with this mix of plays forever. I feel so insincere as to the usual procedure of horror professionals. There is an embarrassing exaggeration for ethnic films. It seems that the blue scene and theme or sub-theme do not seem like a university child plays like this. Especially I sing that the two directors do not play stupid scenes without reason and the police come Snipes. The extravagance of portability feels that Spike does not respect his viewers or does not think what a movie is. Last scene, the last scene that justifies introducing a sledge hammer to a point. This movie also supports people's myth in conversations that use the F-word. I hope he realizes that the rest of the films are located in the same pool, because he does not grow up as a filmmaker. I think it's clockwise that Clockeres was in Clockers. It is advisable to make documentaries like girls of four small colors. Shock films do not make an Oscar.
