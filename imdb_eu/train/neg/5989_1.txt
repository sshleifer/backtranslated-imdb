I paid wow Â£ 3.50 to watch the movie. I do not think I waste time. The performance is best and the special effects are raw. The worst case of the Probarly script in my life has been very shameful quotes. I swear to God 'is far better than this. Madonna should win and Oscar. I want an hour and a half back in life. Honestly, people do not see it, even if the child finds that movie that reveals his intellect. This movie seemed very strange to me that it was hard to say the wood, that is, to say the real puppets here. Pleasures do not waste time in this film.
