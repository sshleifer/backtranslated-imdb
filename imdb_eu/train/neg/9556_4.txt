This movie is primarily a chase scenes and special effects. On the ground it is very weak. Most computer conversations were just mumbo-jumbo. I saw this as a great fan of the film's original War movie, especially with computer and real computer terminology. This movie had nothing to do with it. Most of the computer's scenes were impossible and realistic for real computers and networks, but it was just there. It's like writing someone who does not understand real computers. <br /> <br /> Ripley's game was a mud and was basically a video game. It's not real hacking, so what was the point? The movie was boring. Lame the thug.
