Since I do not have such stupid things about this movie I can not name a few: <br /> <br /> BOGART's character: 1. His name ?? Strike McCord (very easy, so I'll leave that. Boy, Humphrey works well.) 2. His long haired, curly hair and dizzy bumps. 3. Raise his black Bart with the elderly! 4. I do not know what clothes are wearing in the shade of the lipgloss, but it's not as fuzzy. , yes. 2. The man has devoured the hat on the whole movie! Could not find a hat to suit him? Even LITTLE? !!?! 3. His pants are very tight on the back. 4. It releases its gun smoke and knows what you mean and I think that you do it. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Bogart or Cagney, and you might imagine that. To see the pace of change in the west, go away and forget about thinking. THE OTHER FASHIONS LOOK EMBARRASSED! (That is, when they're not bored.) <br /> <br /> It's true that Westerners are my favorite genre, but I see much more, much better than this. <br /> At a comedy level or in a large camp, The Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, the viewer must be careful. So see that you need to see a) everywhere on the west. B) You are TRUE Cagney or Bogie completist. C) You have previous comments. Woah ?? ..
