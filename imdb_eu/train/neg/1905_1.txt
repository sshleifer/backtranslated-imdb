I'm one of the biggest fans of comedy silence and I'm sure to review more Buster Keaton movies with more people than any other person. Since the beginning of his career since the beginning of the 1930s, I have only considered two exceptions, so I can say that I am a great fan. That's why I found this section so painful and difficult to see. I love films of this man and "Buster, how?" I thought. Well, when I think about it now, I see the protagonist of this great goddess named Buster Keaton THE TWILIGHT ZONE. At the beginning of the 1930s, as a result of a bad divorce, he lost many of his fortunes, and in his cinematographic career, the main man had a long time gone by. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed money and reappeared for his reputation, that is, for everyone who was willing to pay, he appeared on a movie in Long Beach's feature films and in a large series episode. <br /> <br /> The major problem in the problem is being written and Buster deserves much more. The show is a fun one, but it's not just a tribute to a silent movie, especially Keaton, because the helmet of the time is stupid and with all the slapstick that is badly executed. Get yourself aside, SKIP THIS ONE - The greatness of Keaton's career is imitation pale!
