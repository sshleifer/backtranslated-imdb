So Steve Irwin. It's worth mentioning a crocs, snakes, lizards, apop tons, reptiles and mud, not every day, but a man who wants to throw it into a river full of mind. She never wanted to do it, but she helped her get closer. <br /> <br /> This movie is not included in the universal category of my movie. They have punching their teeth, they have a migraine, or have no cinema experience and therefore mediocrity as calm (nowadays, Disney movies are good for the population). It's very noisy. Well, Steve is very noisy. He is happy all the time and he will cut through the young man (now I can hear: "this movie is so stupid") or the Tylenol code. I told him that he was catching his enthusiasm, but if that were so, I would have a room full of sugars, which has not happened yet. I agree that they are beauty, but I still do not mask them. <br /> <br /> Land can be predicted. The bad guys were so bad, I thought I would shop for a minute at a supermarket consumer electronics store. But the movie was filled with animals, and Steve and Terri, that's why I saw it. This plot (if you can call it, really) was one more reason to throw a truck in another truck. My hopes were low and so they were. <br /> <br /> Everything I expected was a bit of a sequence, where Steve and Terri (because they worked in their theater) had a movie. real animals with more plots and fur. I still can not believe that we do not see Steve. I hope Terri and the kids will participate in the Australian Zoo and at least they will participate in the discovery channel. I can not imagine the crocodile Irwin family member has definitely told me how wonderful it is. Crikey!
