One, THE BEST PEOPLE, is the most effective documentary ever used by bats. There are caves hanging bats, hanging caves, caves that fly through the cave or near caves. It's just enough to be upset: Imagine all of you shaking by your side? And, in fact, it seems that they should have a show-stopper sequence of about fifty minutes, an incorrect and ridiculous sequence that seems to be a bat that rumors assault a police car. . The problem is that this sequence is about fifty minutes too late to save the movie; Most one or more people are around, shouting, their hands are shaking. during his vacation. <br /> <br /> Fear is falling, rage causes sucking, so the vacations are ruined, it is a fact that indicates the initial summary of the PEOPLE reference page. So, it's an effective summary of the movie: a young couple makes a romantic escape when a boy gives a bunch of people. They try to make efforts but begin to be angry that they are much more involved than trying to convince themselves around them, they can not control themselves, and they must follow each other. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < You do not try to give drugs, you do not say what you love, the guy gives space, goes home and test this scenic flight next year. <br /> <br /> But not the people in this movie act like stupid ones, the guy continues to push himself and goes out, he becomes a part of being a boy and he dies a series of indispensable secondary characters. Nothing is wrong with that, but the little budget movie is a Creature Feature and it forgets a kind of psychological analysis. Instead of a monster movie, people are running a lot, this guy is trying to make cold pills, and finally goes to the mountains, because he looks for much more than humans. and pay the planned price. <br /> <br /> What is wrong with the movie in the first fifteen or thirty minutes, it had to happen at thirty and had the movie after it. Become a person, rather than about that trip. It takes ninety minutes to enter the front, with Michael Pataki as an entertaining little police character as an interesting character, and Paul Carr as a late doctor. does not get the message. <br /> <br /> The movie is very boring, it's fifteen minutes long and long, so it's similar to that of Italian horror. RATMAN, I saw it today and it was sad to inspire me after trying it. I and my bright ideas, even though the scene with the police car was howling: if we had not had it very badly thirty minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> 3/10
