Other piece of TV trash! This is an insult to a war movie (I use the word of the film as easily as possible!) I thought that Telly Savalas was a wonderful journey when he made his voice in Burmese, Tarranten on television on television Tarrant. On a regular basis, but then I was forgotten about that! I tried to get inside my subconscious memory, but it brought me a memory of cable television and shouted! <br /> <br /> I like curiosity (laughter laughs!) It's a scene in Liverpool in the forties, but it is revealed at the end of the eighties of the Zagreb cathedral. The commando train steam train also shows clearly the logo of the JZ (Yugoslavia Zeleznice, or the Yugoslav state railways), even though the people in charge have tried to get black. Why not shoot in the UK, where is the biggest part of this film? <br /> <br /> Litter bins and cellulose waste!
