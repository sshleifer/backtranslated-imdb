METAMORPHOSIS I'm working on the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh film. Published in 1990, METAMORPHOSIS appears to be a new version of "The Atom Age Vampire", similar to a similar results scientist. In modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my horror film type. <br /> <br /> A university researcher is working to break the human genome to create a serum that prevents aging. The administration has the pressure to publish its articles; and results in some (or threatening to end financial losses) that the scientist decides to use Cobia! When he began to think that there was no adverse side effect, he suddenly thought that the serum had suddenly changed! <br /> <br /> The performance is staged; and the performances were much less interesting for the movies. The score is pandering. And, science behind experiments, and their discoveries are not only fake; it's absurd; is it ridiculous? at best <br /> <br /> As others say, the final 30-minute gag, which is apparently infinite. Not too far away, I would call this: "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the ancient sea creatures only at home."
