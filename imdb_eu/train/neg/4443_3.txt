Serum Eddie (Derek Phillips) is pleased to learn that he has been admitted to medical school to continue his family of habits such as his father's father Richard (Dennis O'Neill) and his uncle Eddie (David H. Hickey). However, his joy may be short, because he is involved in Eddie and car carries it. Moving to the closest hospital, Eddie's weakness convinces Eddie to save him with his brother Eddie's brother, who will cure any wound. or illness. To live desperate, Richard agrees, but the procedure has unwanted side effects, which has not become a brain of the Eddie brain, such as a good thing ... I am honest and say Serum is horrible, Suero is not a budget horror movie any other Trying to rip-off another number and eventually having a little more fun that you have pulled out with alerts. The script is awesome, the whole Re-Animator (1985) thinks that crazy scientists are trying to dodge the giant syringe trying to prevent death, but it is so boring that it is so boring; nothing is expected to control the running time after Eddie got home a little while away, and her girlfriend, her other girlfriend, argued that her friend and her overall boring audience is tough. Therefore, if he takes twenty minutes more after completing the tedium of the first fifty minutes, Eddie will again cheer up and kill two people, the police will meet him and shoot at the end. Thanksgiving to God. Serumâ € ™ s character is unmatched by a good movie, sucked character, poor conversation, takes seriously, is dull, slow, unforgettable and a horror movie. He is worried about blood, gore or fear. Not recommended, did I mention that Serum was boring? I thought that way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The level of gore does not exist, there is a splurbed blood, a spotted neck, a couple of scars on a face of a dead woman, a couple of scenes where a needle putteth the skin and that's it. Do not expect an animator again in the gore department, if you are very disappointed, as I am saying to be true. In a movie that looks like a house, a restaurant and a laboratory, the film is not cheap and cheap. There is a nutshell scene, but that's not enough to store anywhere. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's not a bad movie, it seems that at least one camera is in use, I can not comment on it, there are no special effects, but overall, the serum seems quite professional. It seems that you were shooting in Texas, or should you read it literally that it was to be filmed in Texas? It sucks the performance, but I think again that there are more actors than directors or friends. <br /> <br /> Serum is a horrible film, dull, slow, boring, with soap. operates in fifty minutes. I do not understand why those who see the need to see Re-Animator or keep track of them again, should give you a serious serum miss. I leave you in vain for 90 minutes of your life, you can thank them later.
