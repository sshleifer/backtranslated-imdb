The worst movie ever I've ever seen. When did Hollywood make a successful film that attacked the Republicans? Why do not they learn? Dixie chicks do not. Left people live in their elite bubble interacting with each other; We're unaware that we understand better than most in America. <br /> <br /> The best Hollywood productions are not shared and rarely political. <br /> <br /> Dan Akroyd's imitation Cheney was wrong. <br /> <br /> Cussack thought I could land better movies. <br /> <br /> It was not funny.
