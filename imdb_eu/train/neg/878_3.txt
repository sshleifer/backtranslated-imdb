I can only believe that Garson Kanin was two people. He wrote "A Double Life" and "Born Yesterday", and wrote "Adam's Rib" and "Pat And Mike" with his wife, Ruth Gordon, and then wrote and / or wrote. He was correct and sad, "graduated mother," "a bit," and this one. Cast is trying, but the script is so tired and the efforts of Brenda Vaccaro have always been overwhelmed. Scripting Janssen's character tests Drives character is not an aggressive gay sequence. A ugly sequence, but unfortunately it is possible to play a movie today. "Ethnic" jokes are quite verbose, but "fag" jokes are still "good, clean, family fun".
