This wow is never the worst movie. The only reason I was registered on the IMDb I could complain about this movie. I never got out of the theater or stopped the DVD, but I have almost stopped this (and I should). but I ended up completing the path to complete the end to be absolutely horrible. This wow is a long time that you can produce everything. I have never seen the first and have never seen. His awesome performance with a terrific plot. Hey look to let someone look at someone shinning with us. And it's sad that this movie was watched forever on a regular basis. That's why I feel bad for people who have seen this junk.
