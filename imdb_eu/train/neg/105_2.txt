In good color, there are tons of good women. But, oh, this movie is naked. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one. <br /> <br /> Ahem. A story in this movie takes place in 1971. So why are the main characters Kia Sportage? Hello Track anyone? <br /> <br /> As you know, the movie was released in 3D Stereoscopic. And what I have ever seen is the most powerful effect. I do not know if someone could throw that job on top of it, but there was no 3D, just double the blurry. I had no problem with the company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Of course, those 3D also absorbed, but I could see a resemblance to 3D effects. <br /> <br /> This is nothing to lose. <br /> <br /> And who's the women who came to me in the ears, who plays yum daughter! I'd like to see more of her. In movies too. Janet Margolin comes from early on. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
