'Gung Ho!' Film: The story of Carlson's Makin Island Raiders was made in 1943 according to the second war of the American nation. It shows a better way of forming film propaganda. The value of this movie is only collection and art. In a propaganda film, it is useless to judge the direction and the actors. See if you are interested in learning how to make fun of a movie that works in propaganda, or in Robert Mitchum's film, in these films. If you want to watch a movie of the Second World War, it's much better and objective. I rated 4/10.
