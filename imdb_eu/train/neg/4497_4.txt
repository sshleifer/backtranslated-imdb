- I did not intend to write something about this movie, but it would be harder than I thought. Honestly, I can not remember much about that. I saw it three days ago and made almost any impression on me. This is usually the symbol of a real stinker. The only thing I remember was the most bored. The novelty of Humphrey Bogart's futility was quick. It would be different if it's acting, but it's a single concert. The death scene was hobbled and there was no suspense found. If you can not see the killings of five minutes in the movie, you must see Euro more afraid. The killing of the casting is a lost one.
