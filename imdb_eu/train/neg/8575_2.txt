Lugosi is a mystic who has the opposite expectations for the successor's luck; Karloff is the principal, and Lorre is a teacher who shows false support, but it turns out that they are both conspiracy with Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kay Kyser and his 30-year-old "children's" group reveal true mood as little as possible. It is not recommended, for all absolutist horror.
