I remember Devil Dog playing TBS almost 20 years ago, and my eldest sisters and their friends seem to laugh after the next day. It's not so bad for horror film on television, but it's a derivative (most of the Exorcist) and the negotiator, because it does not have a better word. You will not be overwhelmed with great cinematography or great performance, but it's not a waste of time either. The type of movie you are watching does not feel like killing a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> However, if you're looking for some laughs, you're not disappointed. Initial scenes, such as Lucky the Devil Dog, Infant Children, as a little puppy, are not threatening, and giant black dogs One (twigs!) They are blue screen effects, and look at Maverick's satanic shades of cover for the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is no horror movie in any part of the imagination, but I would like to do such things for TV as well.
