The Japanese route, edition and music scores must be different than the American taste, but probably this movie could be much more with post production work. Make this film and I think it would be great. It's an interesting and awesome story. At the edges of the city, police, earthquakes, sanitation, and mysterious salt water are just something fascinating. However, this story should be sensible and can be shorter than 40 minutes. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the "sixth sense" effect was in effect in this movie. which was evident from the beginning. <br /> <br /> So far, the toughest Japanese film makers should only bend the movie so boring.
