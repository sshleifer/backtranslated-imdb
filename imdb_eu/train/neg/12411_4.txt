There were many great horror films in the seventies, but this movie is not one of them! Pena la Hija is not a better thing, starting with a decent idea that takes some success in some horror themes. We have the idea of ​​a baby generation, which worked so well in classical movies like The Bad Seed, and then it's a matter of zombie, which, of course, has been the focus of many horror movies. The plot essentially is that the girl loses a lot of people as a result of her mother's death; So he goes to a cemetery and raises the dead to get revenge (like you). All this is good and good, but it is boring! Nothing happens to most of the films, and eventually it takes it with a beautiful gorge; There's not enough time to justify sitting there. The movie was shot in a budget, because locations are cheap and all landlords are dumpster. I really can not say anything about the movie because there is not much. The baby is a terrific horror movie of the seventies and I do not recommend it.
