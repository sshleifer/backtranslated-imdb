Unfortunately, I have to agree with Halops's criticism. <br /> <br /> A short film, cinematography, costumes, sets, sound, editing and everything else is very good. At first it seemed surprising, but I was told that the technical crew members were professional, so the quality is expected. The problem, as usual, is the story itself. <br /> <br /> It's one thing, it's not really a story. To tell a story (in the case of cinema, to show a story) you need plots and conflicts. You need things that are going to happen to the protagonist: events. These events because the protagonist wants something and can not get it for some reason. Tim Watcher has no problem or purpose. It is a supernatural organization that observes humanity. That's it. So, this is just an exhibition of what we have here. Instead of showing a story, Tim Watcher is studying things about this individual. Of course, given the unique nature of Tim Watcher's film and short duration, it's hard enough to get it started to go to the movie's narrative voice. In this case, it is used in the least possible way, otherwise we would not be able to provide information. Actually, if it were not part of the VO, we thought it was just an old person looking at old things. The VO for the worse also explains what happens on the screen! The images that we show are the decoration of the text we are hearing. <br /> <br /> This short film could be said in a band or other video, but the images are not 'impossible to say'. On the left, it seems to serve as a measure of the technical capacity of the crew (not surprising, but good), but fails to discover, entertain, excite or at least show the story.
