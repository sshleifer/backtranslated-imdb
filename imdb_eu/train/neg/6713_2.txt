But this movie was bored. It's a good part of history, but there was no part of the music. I did not even have a single song and I did not hear a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Fake Jesus supposed that "comic relief was not what it was like if John Adams thought it annoying to be annoying, the rest wanted to empt in every scene. <br /> <br /> < > <br /> Hancock and Jefferson were the only unique characters in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Historical quotes and discussion about slavery in their history. The context was quite interesting, but not enough to overcome musical music. > <br /> After a song, you should sing songs, except with a few, there's nothing worthwhile.
