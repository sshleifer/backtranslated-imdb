A rider and absurd-minded rider (a rider, Burgess Meredith) has been riding a Porsche race car over the years, led by Majors, led by Lee Majors. Not with Chris Makepeace. -Wiz who can get McGyver spare parts in a radio receiver at the same time to receive all the frequencies and somehow learn to buy chemicals and use them to make a high explosive in a perfectly peaceful society. Sounds like wizards. Burgess Meredith's awful waste, but Chris Makepeace would at least forgive his second movie.
