Iberia is nice to watch on TV. But why did you see this on the silver screen? Many dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance, your date may be a movie. On the other hand, an hour and a half is a long time. If you want to see good dance on the Silver screen, Bollywood is better seen. They know how to breathe in a long time. Carlos Saura Director knows how to dance old. And it's time to look very good. But the movie is one hour long, at least it should be an interesting time. There are many types of art, everything is not a bigger life and this movie is not too big.
