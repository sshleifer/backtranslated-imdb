No one, no one, could suck the landscape, such as Ruth Elizabeth Davis and "Elizabeth and Essex". Sometimes it overwhelms a part, but see that Raliegh was writing a letter about songs that are being heard on his lyrics: at that moment, Elizabeth was totally influential and resolved! Other times, the script's sappiness is made. When Elizabeth is to be vulnerable, she's weak and it's coming. This has the effect of weakness: its stack blows and gives justice, it is very difficult to take it seriously. We will enter the heart of Elizabeth, but it is completely inept to convey the complexity and evil of mankind. It also does not help Essex write badly. Why is he wanting to empower his queen, though he swears allegiance, is more bloody, than just "worthy" to that rule? And why did Raliegh detect Elizabeth's betrayal and letters of Essex? It does not endanger any, and we know where Essex (and herself) is at the head. So why does he risk his head becoming more inevitable? <br /> <br /> What did Curtiz do for $$$? He does not feel like trying to prove his fighting scenes in the sound phase. He had to finish with Elizabeth for the first time alone in The Tower; All this (especially, Essex and its final scene) is not necessary. The clothes are wonderful. And are you, or does Bette look like Susan Sarandon?
