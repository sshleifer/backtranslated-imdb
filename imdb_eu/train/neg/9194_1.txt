Ok, first of all I'm a zombie movie fan. I love all the movies of Romero and I enjoyed the new work of the Day of the Dead. So, when I heard a single reviewer using this movie, it was still optimistic. I mean, critics have hated Resident Evil, and maybe it's not a particularly wonderful movie. However, I liked it, because it was just a fun zombie, with a plot of land. However, that is a fact. An intense interview, scenes of half-assed land and video game scenes. He thought it was a good idea for someone who thought well. The only thing about this movie (I'm using it roughly) as the captain of Jurgen Prochnow Kirk (Ugh). While the name casts its source from the window, it can be seen that in its performance is a divine film that is horrible and knows how to get it out. Others work like Shakespeare. And I would add it very badly. Basically the only reason that is visible to anyone is to see this monster for the only reason.) You are a terrific zombie and you have to watch the zombie flick or b.) You like playing MST3K at home. See friends and prepare to make tons of unwanted laughter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
