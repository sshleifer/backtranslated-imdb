"Our Gang" completes the 1929-1930 full-time debate, "Winter Tough" has two stories. First and foremost, Wheezer and Mary Ann decide to make some toys at home alone, in a winter's day. Little Wheezer sends Mary Ann instructions from a radio show show. Problem: Wheezer transmits information from different shows and Mary Ann makes a soap in the mix! Fun moments are when the rest of the vaults are shown to pull the hose and get it all over the house! <br /> <br /> The second screenplay is made by Stepin Fetchit, Gang's neighbor. and Interaction with Gang "My hard", I think, has never been shown on TV, even if it's available in the home video. The reason for this is the Stepin Fetchit characterization, which shows a variable, penetrating and slow character. Producer "Gure Gang", Hal Roach, is called a "comic book" called Fetchit, and uses our "Gang Gang" entry as a pilot series of Fetchit comedy series never seen today. Of course, the characterization of Fetchit is currently offending by many people, which explains why it has been filmed. <br /> <br /> Although there are some fun moments with Fetchit and Taffy, it's called "A Winter Hard". effort Although this movie was a positive one, Hal Roach Studios had a great deal of insight and experience in discussing them. The sound of the movie is good, and some of the sound effects are very entertaining. That's why this film from 1930 to 31 has opened the path to the great films "Gure Gang". <br /> <br /> From 10 to 3.
