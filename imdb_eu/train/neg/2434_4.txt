Realistic movies, surely, except that the characters are not afraid. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but it does not look like it. That's why I do not like the performance of this movie. Tom Berenger is again playing a soldier. Emotion, realistic sequences. Not always shooting, it's great. Well shot I hate the helicopter sequence, the only terrorist is that I almost kill the sea bass ... ** and I'm half *****.
