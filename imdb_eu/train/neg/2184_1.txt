This movie is an unintelligible resemblance and a collection of ground-based devices. <br /> <br /> Film History: The director of this movie was a pervert while shooting urban random women. When his wife found film coils, he had to quickly turn a story. He said he was making a movie called "The Burning That Will Not Die." In the end, the wife asked her to show her "movie". That night he shot short films with a friend and he was born "The Brain Blessed". <br /> <br /> I hate this movie! Synopsis of the publication: The fianc√© of the main character has been killed in a terrible car accident (causing the road signs to be clear). He attacks himself to the bottom and revives him. After studying his head, he goes and takes a bundle of prey. This is what happens in almost every movie. At the end, he is fighting and he dies the monster that lives in the wardrobe. The monsters show little explanation. However, the monster stores a ship and I always think that I live happily. <br /> <br /> Side notes: The final credit screen says the movie "does not die". <Br> /> <br /> I hate this movie!
