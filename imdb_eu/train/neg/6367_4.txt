This film has the look and feel of a Student Film project. Yes, there are some changes and some interesting (but gimmicky) shots, but the final result was the youngest. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the director does not say "Look at this movie." He said that he said: "Look at me! I AM DIRECTOR!" <br /> <br /> Small thumbnails.
