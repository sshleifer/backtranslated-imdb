OK, I watched Mystery Science Theater 3000 (that is, I'm a fan of myself), but I'm not automatically a MST3K movie for 1/1 people. Though I hate many movies they play, and I'm getting into some of the worst films I've ever seen, I've been able to enjoy some MST3K movies. That said, I'm one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (It's not surprising, indeed, that MST3K writers have commented that this was worse. Do not believe it? Check out its site.) <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is a good example of non-film making. The interview is very bad, the play is worse, it is a pathetic cinematic (perhaps the best thing in this movie) is bad. <br /> <br /> This store is the worst part of the movie. This movie had to wait a few times literally for the audience to get something happening. Although the minutes do not spend much time, it may be in a movie, especially this one. I'm sure it was a sense of humor, but I was bored. It's just ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If it means "Suspicion of credibility", it means that it is "almost flat in the movie", which is why it has a lot. But THE SCREAMING SKULL is so horrible, I would not think I was interested in everything that was happening in the movie, so "the unbelievable suspension" did not exist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> 1/10
