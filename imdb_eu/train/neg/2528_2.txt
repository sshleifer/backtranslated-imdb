Van is a sensitive movie about a girl who wants to get into her new van. This movie does not fail, the only thing that describes fad-fad in the US in the late 1970s. Certainly, it seems like the amateur has done. It's a trash, but I love it! I must admit that I'm a fan of the trash in the 70s! Let's hope all this arrives to the IMDB 100! <br /> <br /> 2
