I have not often taken the opportunity to write comments, but I have had to do so to warn anyone who watches comedy when watching this. This is not approaching. The premise (color / genre / whatever) is a bad thing (and it's been done, better, several times before), that two black girls are transforming into a white girl, one of the few transformations that it never made on the screen. It would be enough if the script asked me to change everything that the script asked for. However, Wayans brothers have to cut two white women exactly. You can guess right now, they completely fail. I have seen women without a make-up without convincing women, with the best special effects and the people that have given Hollywood. Its horrible Add a basketball player built as a mix building, overwhelming conversation and more than golf courses. This film gets a new personality. And I like bad movies! Avoid plague.
