He has some beautiful sets of movies and Albert Finney works as a fervent father. The movie fails because Jennifer Jennifer Leigh is just as daughy as her daughters and Olivia De Havilland's The Heiress (1949) is a more mature rendering and nuance. The result of the film is feminist, too, against the endless Washington Square writer, and his author, Henry James, in his other novels parrots wild feminism. Hollywood's ancient fan and great literature, this very movie seemed to me to be very enjoyable.
