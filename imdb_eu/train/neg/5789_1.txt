My wife and I really had a lot of hope for this movie, but it was a great disappointment. Mr. Magoo was an American version. Pathetic father, for example, trying to do everything wrong. fishing, hunting, he clearly teaches his family to his savages savvy. His "views" are not only ridiculous, but in the process, his son does things with obvious eyes. The word can not indicate that this movie is bad. Children and wives are very real, which makes the film even more sad. I do not get humor ... If you do not like to laugh at others. I do not know how to win prizes. Save your money, it is not worth renting.
