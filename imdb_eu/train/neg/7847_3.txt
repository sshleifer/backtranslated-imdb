I recently noticed seeing this movie as soon as possible. Well, today, the 5.8 grade is completely understandable. I think that if you anticipate something so much that it makes them serious, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Surely, The Hills Have Eyes 2 has its own moments. The story that connects the very real product with it is very clean and well developed, but the whole thing is so self-indulged that it is so difficult to keep going. And if it were not for the production of this film by Wes Craven, there would be nothing to do with the original remake. <br /> <br /> But you're going to do all the stuff? Is it supposed to be fear or comedy? " ridiculous and ridiculous riotous and stupid moments are under the doorway (IE "A hand is sh! er!" or "Mother mother! er! I kill you all dogs!") and acting (God does not remind me what was wrong. > <br /> STORYLINE: (This part has spoilers, be careful!) The movie starts with a baby with a mutant baby (ooh la la!), then disappears into a black screen with the title and monologue of the movie, then war veterans In some dummies, we will go to this office. In the case of mutants, the tracking of audio feeds has disappeared and everybody dies. After this tone adjustment, you would expect more. <br /> <br /> Then go to this group The military hires training in Baghdad, as the captain defends "Good job with stupidity", his last day training is New Mexico, where he was last in the family desert, stuck in use. they were there In training, things will go wrong, people die and ... should I tell you more? Right now, I have to pay attention to a gold fish here that I'm sitting and writing here. There's no flashback here, and the end is pretty safe ... but with a twist! It's stupid, that's it. I'm sure that the Ultra Ultra Director's holographic cut cover and The Hills Have Eyes 3 card will show all the endings, but I'm not sure at this time. <br /> <br /> So by the way, if you first love THHE, you are almost ignorant of sin, then by the way. Otherwise, then avoid at all costs. It's for your benefit. <br /> <br /> 3/10
