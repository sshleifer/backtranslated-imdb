Jet Li is the world's foremost fighter. He has been in the forties for over 20 years, and in others he becomes a shame. Although Asia is very large, it is almost unknown in the US. <br /> <br /> The black mask is supposed to be an invigorating movie, but it does not work too badly. First, it's duplicate. Although it has a field value (the duplication is also closed and the tone is dull), it is not appropriate to see ordinary films. Secondly, the director of this film, Daniel Lee, has a great job. The scene cuts so quickly, sometimes you do not know what happens. Other times, the camera shakes. The fans see Jet Li's films martially fantastic. However, the director makes the scenes so fast, even though you do not know who is who is half the time! At other times, a scene is hanging (that is, when a jeep starts to cut a hole in the ground, the badguys start gun, two seconds later, and the interest of love is already under!) Other scenes are not so strange, They're overly ridiculous (killer rootkits? give us the stars to kick!). Li, a director with a slower machine cut, and more cinematographic scenario. The rap / techno music added goes well and intrusively. The Earth has the chance, but the cartoon characters that remove any credibility that strives for this movie are lost. And do we really believe that the interest of love would not know Simon, because he has half the mask? Would not the hair, cheek or voice be given? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a Jet Li movie, try Iron Monkey or its classic Shaolin temple. This decomposed mess loses time ... 2/10
