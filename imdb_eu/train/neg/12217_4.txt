As low budget Indians go, you usually get paid, and I just want to say, I do not pay taxes called "Frightworld" ... <br /> <br /> Author / Director: David R. Williams plays -The story of an abandoned park, because the spirit of an assassin of serial killers is avenged. It's not a bad premise, but with low budget mistakes. The work of the camera tries to feel bad for audiences, using fast-moving cuts, to cover those who do not really show or have no fear. This is evident as a result of an apparent event, as we have come to be a murderer, and soon we realize that (dramatization) the greatest thing happens ... after a long sequence of long titles we return to modern times, still the same activity remains. "Frightworld" creates a unique cinematography when the fun-house shows the landscape inside, but if it does not run for a long time, it can not keep that movie from indie average from inside. <br /> <br /> There is roughly nudity, but not so much for the elder, usually the passion for saving these types of films. <br /> <br /> Genuine B-movie enthusiasts may be of interest here, otherwise spend a lot of money.
