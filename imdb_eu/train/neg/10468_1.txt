I do not know what to expect from the movie. Well, I know. The cinema was really awesome. Screenplay, direction and theater were bad. The story was stupid and nonsense. The director could make a clear and thoughtful film, but he did not. I finished the movie sitting in the last part of the movie, because it was so bad. Where was the focus of cinema? Where is this movie? Christians had to boycott this movie rather than encouraging them. Sadly done and my money loss. Do not watch this movie
