At the end of the movie I asked: "Is the movie I've ever seen worse than the movie I've ever seen?" And the answer is ... Really, after watching this movie and thinking a bit about what has been said, you can not find meaning and only remember two violent scenes, unbelievable and irrelevant. Apparently, the director thinks he has tried to put this question into the minds of people: "What are you looking for in captivity and war and destruction?" because I saw the two awesome scenes that were directly linked to war and direct relations (the first scene is a girl who is kidnapped here and at the same time, we are going to hear one of Bush's speeches speaking about the need to start a war). With Iraq and a second scene, images of three criminals who wear a sword in a woman's vagina continue to face World War II archives. But, in fact, I can not think of relative gravity. Through these two types of horror expressions, I was surprised by what I saw and felt.
