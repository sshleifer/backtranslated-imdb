Although stereotyped, I almost missed "no name" and, of course, I was a small budget, I thought that this film was good; Better than I expected. At first I was skeptical - it seemed to me the idea of ​​a virus that could infect these people. But in the end, I thought the movie managed well (although some scenes were some clichés). <br /> <br /> The performance was pretty good, and the two directors thought it was very important. I can not think, however, that Janine Turner is similar to Geena Davis. It may not have been her face or makeup, hair and clothes in this movie but just kept my head in the back all the time. <br /> <br /> It's not a 'must see' or a big movie, for any standard, 'Fatal Error' is an endless film to the bottom of the observation.
