I barely stopped them or just could shut myself up, I could not keep myself, but I decided that something would happen if something happened. Kenneth Herts is a writer / producer / director / special profession, who wants to make a statement about ecological damage in a monster movie. He wanted that anyway, anyway. What suits it is a great performance, a bit hammerish, too much daily and without merit, and it seems that this scene is repeated in the waters of the river (o, and how lucky it is for a woman to be naked there ... even though it has already been OFFSET They are!) <br /> <br /> This is just nonsense, but I think it's not very harmful; It is not a bad thing to write once or twice, we get a semi-interesting look at the "culture" of Brazil (that is, my father walks around the town with his flock or other apparent pieces, "Yes, this is not America!"). But the director casts his hopes on Mitchum or Carradine, loses the worst pedestrian and violent and dumb conversation. It does not help the monster look good and when "action" takes place, it also plays stupidly and only appeals. Usually, I would feel the feeling of a filmmaker with a lot of problems that could end up with a particular image, in this case it took most of the mid-70s, but it was called Monstroid or Monster, or whatever ... <Br /> <br /> If you get double the features of this DVD Elvira DVD (if the transfer is bad quality and bad quality) with Blue Sunshine, make sure to skip this. Although, of course, Elvira is dying, and you can not listen to yourself a wonderful comment; Personally, I'd rather go with Joel or Mike Nelson to take Mystery Science Theater with this turkey.
