This movie is not by the Bible. He leaves the whole movie of Christ. They do not reveal the attack or arrival of Christ. Only talk about it. It's not a scripture mention. The last hour is called a terrible tribulation. The film also shows no bad times. Seven ships, seven rubble and seven trumpets of judgments are made up of new marine magazines. The crisis against God died in the tribulation in three and a half years and thus ended the movie. They were two prophets who succeeded. Of course there was no use of these names, of course, because the truth of the Scriptures was very close. The biggest part was that I really wanted the movie. I wanted to take untrained people. I think it's a bad movie. It's just as bad as it's all wrong. I await the next movie behind the books. <br /> <br /> The second problem of the movie was bad. Bad operation, bad effects, bad plot and poor character development. I've seen better parts of the Miamiko party.
