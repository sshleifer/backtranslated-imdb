I really do not get the whole idea of ​​this film. Mawkish is in vain manipulative and eliminates many problems, that is, the desire to play Nash themes and men with sex in public places. In the context of a Hollywood movie commercial it can be said to be acceptable, but what is it for Russell Crowe's performance praise? Does men seem to be confused, wearing their suitcases and wearing a grungy hat, and somehow acting out? People who have mental health problems know that Crowe's performance is little caricature. It is also offensive. And I dare, to be really horrible on the right side
