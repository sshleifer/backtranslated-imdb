It may be based on historical events, and we know that the makers of this television document have freed them to become dramatic; I can live that way, but it's so bad! I was surprised if there had been a mid-air crisis, everyone seemed to be surely sure that someone would panic and what a smooth flight, a disillusion of passengers ... I do not know about regulations. Today, some air safety features seem like OTT nonsense, but why take your shoes off before landing an emergency, it makes sense to me that it's not a good idea! The planes of these massive planes that run down on this remote airstrip were not fake and fake. Actually, it would be a spectacular sight on the surrounding ground, it seemed proportional to this movie and it probably was the model. There were slides to escape from previous and central emergency doors, but no one left the front, although the drop was much lower. The captain flew back to the plane after landing - why? This was never explained. We know that landing in an emergency is a loss of fuel, but it must have been lit at the bottom of the fuel, and the risk of explosion was very dangerous, but the evacuation seemed to be quiet. , and everyone runs away at the bottom of the slides, as far as I can, as I am convinced. Inconsistencies, mistakes and fake actions. I would like to see a representation of real time in the play and with the portrait of realism of the plane. It could be exciting, but the budget constraints failed, and felt that the plane that was losing an engine was not very important, and it would break you with a little landing, but not. real danger! - of course, a different reality!
