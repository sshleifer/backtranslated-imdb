Everyone who says that it is better than a hostel, speaks the joke, believe me, I'm not a hostess, but this is ridiculous. This is just a shot on another camera, directly to the DVD, which has little idea of ​​your time. I can not believe how much I have yet to see a decent film. In the 80's, bad videos, gore and horror movies were made without budget, but they are a great story and the most important charge for new ideas, and most importantly, the heart and soul of the director. Now it seems that people are trying to crawl people who are browsing a crawler, but if they do not do so, they will be shown. This film has little idea how it has been amazing, the theater is also horrible, the location is absolutely impossible and the soundtrack is so fierce as the beggars of the beggars. The loss of time does not hesitate, if you do not want to compile a list of the worst movies of all time. The best / worst part of the movie when a female character points to the gun to someone and does not shoot if they do not return, you'll see that it does not hide with your finger with your finger. Absolute song
