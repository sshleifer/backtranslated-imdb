I can not make much effort to cry out and cry out to people who praise this show. No, it's really real people will be the perfect life after new homes. <br /> <br /> How can I pay for these families to keep these new mega-houses? And their poor neighbors? As a result, property taxes should be increased. Also, I would be annoyed by the noise. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how much abuse can a TV show? Rubbish is repetitive every week per week. We go into the family suffering, the house is renewed, and then the family is shocked and everyone breaks the boxes of Kleenex. <br /> <br /> The upgrade section is boring, as is boring. The only interesting part of the show is to know how to look like the house, but also to destroy this segment with false confessions and constant crying. <br /> <br /> "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is a show that has a heart but a flat drop. Skip this. If you like reality TV, "Survivor" is much bigger and bigger.
