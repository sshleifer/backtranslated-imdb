Fantastic premise: Berlin Airlift movie. It should all be. Tragedy Suspense. Friendship Rivals Berliner Frauleins and US riot drivers. love and tears. The one already obtained is a movie that is not a predecessor. Heino Ferch wants John Wayne to imagine himself, but fails. It is wood, it must crack at a certain moment. It tries to be hard, instead of being hard! Why would she fall in love with Bettina Zimmermann's character? Did they throw stones in a lagoon lake? Does he bring his charcoal bricks? SFX is very well made. Much too much Is it a scapegoat-force formation against hundreds of more than one Berlin plane, instead of an organized kick-off? as it was really. It's interesting that the White House, Kremlin, and Lucius D. Clays' general's office seem like a dark and dusty look. Notice the same drapes, hanging in the depths of windows, as if it were a secretive protection against nuclear attacks. Why almost all the scenes are dark and dusty inside? By the way, LUCIUS JAINKOA D. CLAY, seen as a small season, does not go global, snack, makes his noble idea confidently with airlift. It was very opposite. So you combine all of the fake individual and that is a movie with no passion, suspense or historical precision. Sad, was it so promising?
