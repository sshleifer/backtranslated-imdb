Ok, I will not look into this film thoroughly. In my opinion, I see many praise reviews and, generally speaking, as I liked Mar√≠a de Medeiros, I have long been an inconsequential commentary - so it has been almost a year. But whenever I see this DVD on my shelf, I feel an inner cry. However, let the overwhelming voices overwhelm! But as for cinematic as me, be careful. <br /> <br /> In my simplest and easiest terms, here is my attitude: <br /> <br /> The political turmoil and disaster that has caused the background of this movie has also been behind some times of my life, I read newspapers every day in my local European center bar. At that time, I kept up the news reports, but I did not completely understand what was going on. Reporters accused of partisan or conservative parties, pushing the groups that lost peace or the uprising of the establishment. In those times, the other uneasiness of the winds crossed Paris, Berlin, Prague and other parts of the US, which I have clearly understood, but the dictatorship or not, as my paper was the establishment of Portugal only - it's not a "nasty empire" well As worked out, to use Star Warren's terms. <br /> <br /> So I read conflicts from weekends, but I never found a smart editor. Evaluation of the socioeconomic impact of history or dictatorship behind, etc. <br /> <br /> So, when buying this movie, I had at least two hopes: to finally understand the details. social unrest, and a well-thought out drama. This film did not give me <br /> <br /> Movies have already had vast knowledge and deep emotions about historical events. And drama - well, as I said, I would like to encourage Maria de Medeiross and the Portuguese film industry, but it was superficial and small. <br /> <br /> I got a copy of the DVD made from France - "Selection Official 2000 of Cannes - Un Certain Regard." The box shows the hair-cradled actors, which is the victory sign that makes me remember the Playboy bunny. After seeing the work, I asked what French might think, although I can understand "natural truth" as a superficial piece of sensitive content, with a natural tendency to praise their "sincere" ... <br /> <br /> Check the back of the box: "Consider Chaleuruex sur la Revolution" - a warm glance? Try to describe Allende's decline and murder with a warm kindness! Try it with Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try out all the surfaces and civil rebellion of all the lines! <br /> Another review: Maria of Medeiros renounces 'with are pays, they are enfance et are histoire'. "Zaborra, rubbish, rubbish! for me the least. <br /> <br /> I love Portugal. Everywhere in Europe, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities, but my city and the town love does not create an empty film. I will take the old VHS hangings from Capas Negras and A Cancao de Lisboa. In the meantime, I'm stuck with section 2 with the title, to go to the trash also.
