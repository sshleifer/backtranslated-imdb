So, you are reading the comments published in this film, and you might think "Huh. Surely RAVE REVIEWS were published on December 30". It's funny, like most of these beautiful opinions come from the same person or another from the small and coordinated group of "Open House" groups. Actually, friends, this movie is really impossible. Because "Independent" does not mean that it gets a free password. If you want to make a music, in cinemas or on stage, on Broadway or in the local community theater, you should surely sing your actors (b.) Your actors can dance. , (c.) you have sound equipment that is decent, (d) you have a well-written score, and (for example) cautious and charming words. Anthony Rapp can not save this. It's one of the unfortunate experiences of going to the movies, I felt ashamed of all those involved.
