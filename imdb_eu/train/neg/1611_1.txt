I think that's a terrifying and directed movie. Benicio Del Toro did not have to work on film production, he would have to emphasize his work, and that's it. Steven Soderbergh has lost the whole point of the idea of ​​revolution, about the ideals and the most important of Che Guevara's life, and so on. The camera is awesome, it's shooting like someone who has 2 days of experience, music ... I do not know ... is it a music movie? I do not recommend this piece to anyone. It's wasting about 4 hours before the TV ... I can not figure out how I can rate the movie more than 3 stars. TEACHING ... SUSTAINABILITY ... SUSTAINABILITY ... IZARTZEN Ignore please. Save yourself from "misery" from that misery
