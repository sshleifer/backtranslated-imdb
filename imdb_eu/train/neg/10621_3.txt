I have not added comments about the plot, it's not very good. <br /> <br /> A very strange orphan in Bala. <br /> <br /> Cushing and Lee at their heights. <br /> <br /> Some beautiful landscapes. <br /> <br /> The good face for the face, and I mention "look your mouth, that is, Cassie, madmen and horses." <br /> <br /> <br /> Otherwise, there is a poor example of the British cinema industry. <br /> <br /> Fulton MacKay was much better at Fraggle Rock, everything was better than Keith Barron and Diana Dors did the best. <br /> <br /> Recovery feature? Before subscribing, it was seen in the Horror Channel. I will not subscribe to this effort.
