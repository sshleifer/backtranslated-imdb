I rarely make comments, but I felt forced to pay the pain suffered by watching this movie. So they are stupid and fake in the overall story and in detail, you can interrupt credibility. The problem starts at the beginning when a government researcher puts you in a new Porsche and eats his team in a captain like a castle, in Washington, DC Facing the Capitol Building. Hah! It's only worse. At the end, when the good guy starts to kill the boys, the second team is so stupid to kill them when they die if they want to clean the gene pool. The special effects are pretty good: they can buy any money from any producer and the main actors have been excellent in other films, but here's the script and the general direction. Many people have asked Paul Verhoeven's intellective backbone (Showgirls, Starship Troopers) behind intelligence, but this movie should stop wondering. It's just a bad thing.
