What happened was that, with some money, many people thought that it would destroy one of the best television shows. Did you really know how to make a big screen again? Have any questions asked fans? I wonder how fans would feel the reinterpretation of the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears or Kiefer Southerland, if they were to take all the music and become a drama. Do you think that I'd like it! This movie does not have the same feelings as the original. Certainly the original was somewhat crispy, but Bo and Luke were always pleasing, they had problems, because they were always in trouble, and their main purpose was to help the people who passed through the village. This does not make any difference to the people who made this film, perhaps they might not see the original show. My main question is, what will they do next?
