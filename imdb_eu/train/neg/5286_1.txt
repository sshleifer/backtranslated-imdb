I'm a fan of Jane Austen and I ordered the Amazon.UK movie, I could see it all without waiting for the US to come. I should save my money. What is Anne's after Wentworth? The whole point of Anne Elliot's character was calm and fine. It's not aggressive and plain. And Mary, did she have a blow or something? His speech was not normal and he did not walk normally. There were no chemicals between the two main characters, so that "love" would be incredible. The last scene, Sally Hawkins, also wore the same Amanda Root dress that was worn on the scene. The same clothes are not the same. In my opinion, they did not see the 1995 version, that is, although it was not a mistake, it was close to the book. The book, I do not even think reading. This is the Persuasion of Cliff's Notes. Donkey without saying anything at all.
