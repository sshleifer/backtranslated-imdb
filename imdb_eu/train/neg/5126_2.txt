I rented this movie because I expected that the whole family would enjoy it. Even though the film is family friendly, my family does not enjoy it, because it gives God a false vision. If you obey God and follow it, you do not guarantee success. Your football team does not always win. You will not get better grades magically. Infertility is not always cured. You will not always get a rise. Sometimes the old car will be stuck. <br /> <br /> God does not exist to satisfy our whim. On the contrary, we were created to glorify him. Sometimes we glorify him most things seem bad for us. He lives in Christ; death is winning
