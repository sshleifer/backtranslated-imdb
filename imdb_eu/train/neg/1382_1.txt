The movie was horrible. The theater was silent, because everyone was ashamed to look at the trash. I guess someone gave Jet Li a lobotomy and caused him to make a script with an interview written by an old five year old. Martial arts are "well", but when you put Jackie Chan on film and "Matrix", it's better to watch one of them.
