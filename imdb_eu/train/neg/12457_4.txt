It seems that Salvadores can not decide what to do with the movie: some of them are very weak (and very very weak) thriller, some of them are an effort to explore the relationships between the protagonists. Two things have been tried in psychological thriller, but in this case, the movie can not get things together, bad writing, superficiality, bad performance and very sad and sad cinematography. I said that Salvatores gave him the best in other genres and other fields, where he wanted to explore the characters without thinking about the plot. In general, a B-movie, which is hardly worth the money ... Vote: 4/10
