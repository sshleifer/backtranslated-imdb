What is an unhappy mix "Shiner". I wanted to like this anti-aspiring movie movie, and in fact I found some moments of strong resonance. Unfortunately, these moments are few. While Calson appreciated something of what he was trying to do, any naked advantage, he did not destroy the film budget with any movie he edited, so he could not get a good movie. <br /> <br /> While the play is a bit low During a budget (and a quote), Shiner has some bad shows that show bad shows. Especially the pair of Linda and Young Guy "straight". These are two misunderstood characters who offer almost anything to the story. The play is so abysmal and the actors do not seem to be able to deal with the smile or the crack with the lines that drop off from the window with a lack of skill. Choppy edition almost feels that these roles were absolutely free and that the movie stereotype could not be thrown as a gay movie curse. Such would be better. <br /> <br /> Everything that goes wrong with this seems to be a series of performances, as Calson thought they wanted to achieve. Especially the story of Bob and Tim. These are drawn by the two richest characters and Nicholas T. King (Bob) and David Zelinas (Tim) offer brilliant performances. Team Boxer has serious problems. Self-esteem is incredibly small, almost a cartoon conceals that cartoon-like arrogance resembles armor coating. Tim's obsessed, seemingly dangerous Bob scary, is a boxer in cats and classical puzzles. When the tables are activated and the hunter becomes a hunts, it is the only true emotional catharsis of the movie. In a truly honest movie (which is wonderful), a character must have this revelation fracture (or as it happens here), and in the final fight between Bob and Tim, Zelins and King allow real chops. . <br /> <br /> As Tony Steff and Derris Nile play, Tony and Danny seem to be the main focus and dare to point out their moments (including a really disturbing scene that shows the obsession with sex / violence). ), but it seems that they do not flee from artisan cartoon and it is difficult to look - or look at a note beyond just one symphony and find nothing more than obvious. <br /> <br /> After all, raw material is the same. This story can be better understood (and should). Unfortunately, it's still not recommended, Mr. King and Mr Zelinas's performances offer something really worthwhile and something worthwhile to see and see definitely.
