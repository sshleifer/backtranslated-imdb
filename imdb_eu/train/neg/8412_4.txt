I saw yesterday DreamGirls, and I was really impressed. Although Oscar Buzz is all, this is not special. Anyone really impressed by this film, he never loves to watch classic music of the film. Except for the great music and drama of Eddie Murphy, Dreamgirls is just a glorified, televised, or glorious style. Just dream a bunch of sweetheart! <br /> <br /> Now, the first half was a good hour, but I was angry that the wonderful raveup shows by Eddie Murphy cut off and stopped me. These were easy songs and best performances of the movie. The most part of the film ", the only part of the film was consistent or impulse, and the rest of the time and 45 minutes were not formatted, the strange disorders were not realistic, not exciting, interesting, and visually sad and sound-like sounds . <br /> <br /> Condon did not try to turn into big shows. In the second half, each number was another, "singing together" among others. And Hudson's way of shooting a great number "loved me"! Condon has stalled around the stage - it's not a drama! God sucked it! <br /> <br /> And everyone warned them all - "conversation dialogue" would work on the stage, but DOES NOT USE CINEMA (see Evita and Phantom's failure.) All of this "I'll do something," "Efff-ieeee!" Was to leave the room to edit the shutter. These are not "songs." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Again, the movie, by Eddie Murphy Except for amazing performance, it was just a glorified TV movie. The megabucks that were to be behind the PR work of this movie! I wonder how much money did the pre-release cost a "beat" Oscar buzz? This film, except Eddie, was about Oscar Oscar's release. (Except Eddie) I would say the following: Grease 2. BIG disappointment, especially after all ($ I'm $) of hype!
