The movie is basically a story of a Russian prostitute's return to her country, to make her a sister / a funeral. There are other minor stories that are more interesting than others, but they are not fully studied. The core of the movie is a funeral, a wake, and later discusses the future of a grasshopper community, and they sell vodka but they are missing artists that sell dolls. Apparently, the movie has not been posted. From the city to town, the prostitute is a train that is endless and walks through the mud. Perhaps it is supposed to enthrall the horrors of the Russian landscape. The same village, such as a widow legion and a man live, the deceased's friend. The pursuit of doll business is the problem of all those involved and it seems impossible in the end. Most of the films are shot with a camera made by hand, in order to boost the nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that the subtitles do not include chronicle songs and torments. Do not go if you do not dominate this movie in Russian.
