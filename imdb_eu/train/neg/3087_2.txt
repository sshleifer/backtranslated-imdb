A group of unimaginable hunts have stalled puppets by the old guardians of the night, who has been in a cinema bargain for twenty years, without any reason. <br /> <br /> Many people know the movie is only filmed in the MST3K film. But I've seen the real movie and I can safely say that it's bad, really, really bad. From a terrific scene of 'Fighting', I never realized that this was a great toy toy for the "aliens" who suffer from circulatory disturbance (My Pet Monster was the most terrifying). It was my charismatic monstrous monster). However, Rick Sloan says "Vice Academy" in some way, and trust me I do not have ideas on earth, much worse. This is not because this film is a mere, because it is not. Just throw away <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: It is not correct in the film nudity, but there are two tits in the DVD Introduction to the film. <br /> <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Extra: Jim Wynorski's presentation; Stills gallery; and the trailer of this film
