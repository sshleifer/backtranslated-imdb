I do not know why I'm spending time reviewing the waste film. If you stick with enough time, when you wait for the satisfaction? good, bad or amazing? no In the end, dialogue and acting is hard, predictable and predictable. The inner scenes are so bright, if you think that the camera has been moving downwards from millimeters, you see clear clocks. Costumes, hair dresses and sets are starch, press and immaculate. XX. Did you think that people of the first decade of Arizona were really alive? The comparisons with other revisions of "Peckinpah" are insulting Peckinpah: at least the director wore his violence in the chaos and chaos context. HARD MEN is eliminated from wooden imagery gore precision nails. Eh ?! Heston thinks he thought that he was doing something worthy of this movie. (He ties his hand with the cold). But Coburn? I never guess why he got his name. As we wanted to see the movie about the end of the West, like the end of what we knew Westerns? Check SHOTOISTIA or DOWNLOAD again. THE HAST HARD MEN is a revelation of the obituary of a western country.
