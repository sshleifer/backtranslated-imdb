This is the biggest piece of crap ever. It seems like time, effort and money have spent more than DVD coverage. I really thought that the DVD changed with someone's home porn, until I knew one of the actors in the lid. This movie seems to have been done with a hundred dollars and a camera, half of which was placed in rats. The image is very clear, but if you say it, if you're doing this, with unpleasant lighting, if you're filming, producing, playing, and a screenplay, if this movie looks like it. worse than an old man Old porn has at least one point. Some PETA members gathered together and the PSA has decided to worry and bite about animal rights and feelings. This is not worth the money or time. It has nothing to do with the murderer of the BTK series, with the name of the murderer and some of the victims. The people that made this movie should be happy, it's still not free, or maybe the following would come so bad film.
