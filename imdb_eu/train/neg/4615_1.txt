You may not have the greatest attention, but I do not want to see this second movie and I also bought it on DVD for its "classic" situation. <br /> <br /> At first the director thought I was playing a big joke, so I was waiting for the solution, something to laugh, something to keep up with, but this resolution never came. Rather than writing a laxative amateur, the movie was dragged and imbalanced as someone cut the length of the TV series. The Academy had to be a drug that had to be nominated for this movie with less than eight Oscars. <br /> <br /> I repeat again. This is what I want to deny the second movie. The first one was "Exterminator". I hope this is really wrong. 1/10
