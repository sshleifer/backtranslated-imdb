I do not know why people were praising this garbage. Bad, stupid, realistic, terrifying, and everything else. The film is a vision of life, racial affairs, prejudices and everything in England. That fails. It does not fit into reality. The scenes of the movie are among many absurd scenes, such as <br /> <br /> A black man with a pistol was running behind a white man, after the black men and security guards stopped and handcuffed by the bracelets. it passes by. <br /> <br /> A man who runs the bottom of a man from the bottom of the roof runs down the same man and the black man throws himself down and handles Rodney King while the gun man runs. Free after a while, only four guards have chased behind. <br /> <br /> A previous opinion has indicated that some black men with 230 kg of black men are down around 160 kg in weight, including 105 busts. Rhymes <br /> <br /> Another major mistake in the movie is that the main characters are not very interesting. Black and scary people and black, angry and still (?) Fearfully. It is almost insult to the people who are both white and white. I'm a white man and I know that I'm familiar with the fact that I'm familiar with the character's characterization of smoking characters and their characteristics for their racing. <br /> <br /> The story that I will now round is rounded up. about three characters A black athlete, the other a black and horrifying little girl, who questions her sexuality, and the third is a confused and horrible man, and then fears problems in the problems of the Nazi. Everyone has problems and adventures, sex, rape, fights, love, hatred, prejudices, racial war, and do not forget about education. All of this is due to the final film. When he comes back to boredom, he's "bad" being bad. Is this sound like a lot of college years? I do not think so. I do not think the director wanted to go to college, especially if he wished to do great wickedness. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is bad, bad and ugly. If you want to see a more detailed or racial issue, see the American History X. College College for more detailed view of your rental car. Just avoid this mess.
