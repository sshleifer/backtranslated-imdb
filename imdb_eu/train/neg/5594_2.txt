The question that should be asked is "What happened?" This movie had to be confused with half-time and totally impossible people (without using the actor's word) and there was no script there. <br /> <br /> One thing that made me laugh about this movie, the story "how to write it" in Victorian said that there was a script in that part of the story. There was no conversation in the entire Victorian section, and a girl was looking for a girl, and vice versa. Make this part of the movie as a screenplay as a camera that stays in a train station. <br /> <br /> It's a good time to keep up the story. He begins with a man who is not sitting outside. Locking O, who needs it? They come here and tell them about the story about the dead. So the story begins in the Victorian era. and here's how the scene (boys and girls are in a field, starts playing beautiful music) (the boy looks at a star) (the girl looks at the boy) (he looks at a boyfriend). That's all about half the movie. <br /> <br /> The conversation about a large number of models that the rest of the film wants to buy an apartment is terribly wrong. So, this real estate agent shows us, and when I say it, I mean, if he were a dancer, he would travel through MACARENA. Not a character in this movie is also nice. The models are very angry, people are not victorious, and the story tells the story of the identity of a sack onion. So, at last, the girls die. And by the killings, I mean a non-drug screen. ooh Did you show a death? and I want to hold my face to death till I make up my blood? amazing. <br /> <br /> The guy also knows this story. He said he saw it. but how? There was no guy in that apartment! The door was closed closed, the window was forced to work as a fireman, and how did all this HELL see? Oh draw holes. we love you. So, the movie ends with the end, "I think that you've done this. It's time you're wasting it," he asked in the first place. Whatever This movie was stupid, meaningless, and it did not make sense to have a lot of holes in the plot. I can continue on this movie, but I do not see it anymore. I'd rather like to spend my time doing something wonderful. As something like something. "Hell's Threshold" goes into more than 2 purgatory models. 10
