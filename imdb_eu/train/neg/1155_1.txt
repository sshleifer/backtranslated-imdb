Never before has the movie been pushed to write a review, but that's just the dire.i that was stuck with it, he chose Snoop as his first serious role, but, in fact, it was a bad choice. He did a good book, but it definitely did not work like a movie. It seemed to me unbelievable, I missed the atmosphere and I found many scenes. He may be a master musician but he is not a serious actor. Dylan McDermott and Rose Byrne were good but not enough to carry them with a weak plot with a weak conversation. Perhaps I missed the point, but it did not fit in with any genre, it did not affect empathy with the characters and did not create any kind of agreement. In fact, I finally prayed and asked to ask deeply. The three main characters slap the desire!
