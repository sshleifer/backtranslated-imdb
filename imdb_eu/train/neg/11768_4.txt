This restart is like a meal in McDonald's, Ang Lee's 2003 "Incredible Hulk" 2003 is very good, but very little. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Hulk "is a movie of the comic book of thought. Hulk takes some time (about 40 minutes), but when it does, we see it in the conflict of our protagonist. He can do the best to avoid loss of control, but as he admits, he likes it. <br /> <br /> Now compare this to Edward Norton's turn where the conflict is not displayed. In his personality, Hulk becomes an illusion whenever he becomes excited, and the pulse rate goes to 200 minutes (not 183, not 197, but 200). For this reviewer, that is to say, the inclusion of mid-chlorinators that are compatible with the "strong" force, that is, by measuring a mystical ability through a blood test. In the 2008 film, Ed Norton's Bruce Banner had everything to do with 200 fewer pulses, as controlled by a device bent on his wrist. For Registry, it is very difficult to run 200 kinds of pulses up to 200, even though it's a great race, especially for a physically fit person. <br /> <br /> Emotions drive Eric Bana's Hulk. He has re-assumed the memory of his mother's death and father's roles. The surface is quiet, but underneath there is anger in the air, when it's enough to cool down when Hulk leaves. But Hulk never disturbed, even the attackers. Mostly, Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) wants to get away. He fights his shots and, in a critical scene, a fighter jet escapes from salvation. There are a lot of action scenes (and many of them) necessary for the plot, unlike the action, unlike the 2008 movie. story, Ed Norton loses how he feels with Hulk. Hulk, an experiment that bent was a dangerous side effect. And Louis Leterrier, the director in the Ed Norton site, fails to add emotional dimensions to the Banner-Hulk relationship. The story can be summarized: The Banner continues and Hulk races, the Banner is pushed and Hulk threw it. Repeat as needed. <br /> <br /> The only thing that went against the 2003 film was not as authentic as the comics of the 2008 release. However, as I am a fan of comics, I'd rather like a movie that is not a true comic book, it's a dream of a fanboy, but in 2008 it becomes more than just loyal comics, and in the factory and the most dismal version. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Ang Lee should read more comics. Iron Man, also published in 2008, is an excellent example of a true movie for roots in comic books and has a heart.
