Nothing to say, but Wow! Does anyone open them up in the open space? Well, this happens 25 times in this movie (clearly, the tactics of directors are the favorite tactics). In one of the scenic openings, a smooth and hot speaker must be a producer to walk in the back seat so the men can sit in front. Almost 5 competitors have arrived in the area and, at 2 in the afternoon, it is clear that the sun is convincing at any moment of the minute. After trashing trash for about 30 minutes, we offer a delay about the history of clown we will see from our previous victims. If you look at this movie, look at the female breast ... your ribs reach the neck, it is disgusting. Most horror films take place during the night, but night-time view without chaos will happen during the day. Some shots on the film were stolen from the Blair Witch Project or ruled by the director's backyard in the background. The film finally regained a matrix that we enrolled at the end, we re-lit and lit up the clown, hysterically laughing. <br /> <br /> Certainly, THIS RENT FILM WILL BE OPEN OPEN. <br /> <br /> SIGNED, USED
