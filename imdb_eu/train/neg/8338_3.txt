This movie is very important because he suggested this reflection: sometimes you want to be sick ... you might want to be a syndrome ... sometimes, for example, Goldfield syndrome ... you can ... I do not remember this boring movie ... and above all, you should not remember Adam "superfluous" Sandler ... sometimes, just what you want ... rent a new movie ... <br /> <br /> <br /> My vote ? From 3 to 10. My suggestion? If you are not a fan of Adam Sandler's dreaded romantic comedy (it's not a fan of Adam Sandler ... I'm hoping for a joke), keep yourself ... save someone? Drew Barrymore. ... perhaps.
