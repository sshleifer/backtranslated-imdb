Baldwin has dropped to make movies. Everything in this movie, music, is lost all the time. <br /> <br /> The sound of FX is not real, they are trying too much (technical gadgets, etc.). To make such films, at least try to fall into this reality and emit extra beeps, because these devices are not really like that sounds aloud. Natural sounds like shoes do not exist, that is, they give it a pure atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The money seems to be OK for a low-budget movie (I expect it was a low-budget production) Although sometimes it seems pretty fun. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters seem empty and fake, they just did not throw this movie well. I would imagine that it would be a better idea if Baldwin spoke Spanish, than the Spanish actor speaks English, we all know that it is a language that is more intense and more intense, that is why it can affect actors. Even if you use a lot of harsh language. I mean, in the end, did anyone realize how a fool makes the English actor speak a bad accent in English? In the long run, the corpse should be buried in the production of films. Did the production team listen to subtitles? This film is once again represented by lazy and damaged European police, as weak and helpless societies. I mean the plot again, "Interpol can not play jack", so let's call it an American international trade union to bring down or what it is. <br /> <br /> Sony Pictures Columbia's same-path treads is just that, it's just hell to produce movies. I would also like to respect himself. Do buyers buy all dirty titles because Sony will do something good once a year? Maybe they should use the Que De Si group - Say I Do. Speaking in Spanish, Paz Vega and Santi Mill√°n make a decent job by keeping the film. Looks better and sounds better! Come to Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
