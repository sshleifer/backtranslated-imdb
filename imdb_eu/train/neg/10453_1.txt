This movie is worth more than 1. But I do, because so many young fans have given up to 10, and score a score that will take 100 top places. It's really not so great, it's not so bad. Its a religious cult classic is so much fan-boy boys, it's ridiculous. These are those who continue laughing at Chuck Norris and still say they are "rick james b! Tch". I am afraid of "I'm tired of sniffing the MF in this plane" for the idiotic who wants to spend a few months now. He practices his crappy plot crap etc. To love his bad movie, but you still need to admit his bad movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the real movie if you are the star of the Sea John Cena.
