Wodehouse. In adaptation mode, THE 39 STEPS are deeper than actual output in Wodehousa. It's a very bad thing because the interaction between Treacher & Niven is so far away. Alas, the movie 'B' mystery troop and forced comedy to grow wearisome also a short 57 minutes. The following year, the continuation (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was even worse, seeing Bertie and Jeeves (of all people!) There was not.
