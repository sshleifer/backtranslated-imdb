Unlike my reviewers, I always see what I see any movie I see. Yes, the quality and lighting of the duplication is abysmal, the acting is wood and the beginner sequence is very calm and quiet with straw vampires. With a drop of blood. Something must be missed in the title "Bloodsucker" in Italian; Almost all producers shot a Vampire gothic story and then changed their opinions, but could not start the dramatic sequence, but added to the film. <br /> <br /> This is a newly released DVD released in 1975 and has its own theater trailer, as it is a bold thing in some movies! Now anyone who buys this movie, however, has already read his synopsis and knows what he expects. In the mid-1970s, I was attracted by Christa Nelli (most often called "Krista Nell"). I found the lack of comfort in many films of the 60s and 70s of Eurosleaze. Imdb hopes the cast character as the name of the movies, but without list of cast, it's hard to connect with the actor. Krista Nell considered "Cora" but I think that underneath this massive style of hair. costume and make-up is difficult to make sure to separate it. <br /> <br /> There is especially a portrait of both parties in their episodes, and no one really stands out. Maybe, duplication is lost. What were the positive points? It was atmospheric music and, of course, there was a beautiful pornographic lesbian. The outside locations used were good and I'd like to know where the castle was filmed. It wants to set "Ireland" (Ireland). In the North or the Republic?) In 1902, everyone is dressed in sportswear. Some scenes I found an unpleasant fun especially sex scenes !! Well, it's nice.
