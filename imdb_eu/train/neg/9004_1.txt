There's nothing left for this movie, nor Superman. Special effects ten years ago were amazing. Better management from actors, it can bring more feelings and better performances. A script can only be fed to the dragon. Plane holes, bad lines, rough paths, reproduction of the same shots of a CGI dragon in the corridors ... ugh. <br /> <br /> Avoid this with all costs. <br /> <br /> <br />
