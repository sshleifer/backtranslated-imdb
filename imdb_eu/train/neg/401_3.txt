That's the reason why I was inept in the three days of the worst excuse of a movie. First of all, computer effects are completely mind-blowing! The authors of the computers must really pull back. The rest of the movie, even though ... <br /> <br /> A character does not play in realism, especially in the third act that was mentioned (I will not give it to him, but I will trust him. It is not worth keeping a secret !). The laughter of the movies is unintentionally unexpected when an invisible man tries to explain what works. Please give audiences more credit! <br /> <br /> Some of the sex aspects of the film were of interest. What would you do if it were ultimately invisible? No one can catch you! The most beautiful issues were dealt with in classics, from 1933 onwards. It is a scene of various ambiguous violence, especially ambiguous, and later it is not mentioned. If you pay more attention, it's likely that Kevin's bacon is more crazy scientist to be more sensible. <br /> <br /> It would be much more successful as a pornographic movie, since the premise could be a unique and interesting way. But this work ... see something else. Or not, and with the consequences of life! <br /> <br /> 3/10
