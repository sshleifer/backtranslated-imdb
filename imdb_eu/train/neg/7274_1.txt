"National Lampoon Goes to Movies" (1981) is simply the worst film ever made, far more than the "Space 9 External 9" so far. <br /> <br /> Three segments, each supposed to kill the usual genre of the movie But each one is landing their feet, there is no reason for these little bands, nor for the distinctive lines of story. <br /> <br /> Another good reviewer on this site has written good points about the movie as nude scenes. True, Miss Ganzel and Dusenberry flesh shine a bit, and they're very nice too. But the managers seem to not have to surround T & Ak with a good story. There's no such thing. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst of three episodes is Robby Benson and It's Richard Widmark. Here, we see the young and eagerly-looking police officer Benson looking at an old movie that Widmark plays. And for a moment, those who are watching this hilarious mocking-action are encouraged by young police and thinking about how the idealist is going about seeing the old story, to purify the approach of that era. police work But it's not such a luck. As we have said, this film is not worth the sale. He is finally falling behind the disappearance - it's longer than it should last on the screen. Apparently, filmmakers knew they were a bad thing, and they wanted to do the least of them.
