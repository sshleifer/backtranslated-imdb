The way to the middle, I did not notice about these characters roughly; however, I saw a little more. Unfortunately, the next day I came back and finished. I would not have to worry about it. <br /> <br /> If you know anything about the movie before *, you know that the character's plane crash will survive - and it gives you a good idea of ​​what the title is. Then it will happen - go phone and call it to the public! "Snakes on a Plane" (another bad aviation catastrophe) was as bad as another movie. <br /> <br /> I know it's an old movie and today's plays are much less natural than today. According to these rules, the play was shameful. They were not the characters, they were stereotypes. I suspect Bette Davis has opted for the career of her husband (Gary Merrill). However, however, I have seen more oaks have shown more emotion. career movement It was not. It was boring. Tiny Tim was a small movie by Trask (Merrill's character) to see the truth about love and forgiveness (even though Tim Tim was less than a child), without the advice of a beloved husband, he relentlessly listened to the wisdom of life and relationships. he just died. <br /> <br /> The last scene, to allow Trask to call his wife Iowa, was so damaged and contaminated at the two ends of the telephone line. I had to pay attention to what those people paid for this film. <br /> <br /> There are many people in this movie. If you find it beautiful, it is very good. Actually, it seemed to me a bad thing. Old Hollywood's Golden Age films were much more written and staged.
