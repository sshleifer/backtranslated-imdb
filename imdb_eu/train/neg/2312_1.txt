It's one of those films I wanted to stop at the bar. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty damn boring. Which story is very weak and pretty much to be invented. The film offers pretense techniques for the camera, which aims to stimulate migraines and resemble a student's film. Did they say that it was boring? If all the characters die at the end of the movie, I would not be able to take care of it, since I have no emotional attachment. <br /> <br /> There are about 4 minutes in this movie, but that's it. For the first time, I never thought of going to the cinema in the theater, but I believed I needed to improve it. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> A movie that swears threats to kids.
