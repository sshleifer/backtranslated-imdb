I grew up spreading more than a few times in mixed-story chronicles. It was my dream that one day the screenwriter would find her child sitting on a large sofa when reading A Winkle in Time and thinking what a stunning movie would do. Unfortunately, the scriptwriter has failed, changing the characters, throwing humor and destroying the plot. I know it's a difficult task to change a very beloved novel into a movie. But why can not the truth of the book continue? Why do you have to change the way people think and act? If you have not read the book, pick it up, find a soft sofa and let your imagination be wild.
