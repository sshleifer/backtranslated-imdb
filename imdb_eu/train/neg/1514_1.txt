I watched yesterday the movie. <br /> <br /> She wanted to see only my girlfriend Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I was wasting my time and money and told me that the girlfriend was the last. It's time to watch a movie to see a certain actor / actor there. I hope I learned the lesson, I had trouble keeping it in his seat. In my opinion, since I had already paid, I wanted to see at least one end, I expected that something would be good, but I did not breathe, and fortunately, I was a victim of such a movie. it's the same. <br /> <br /> This is not a black and white movie, black and black. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as the record, and all sex offenders are depicted as bad and not bad, and bad ones were very bad. Talk about a topic and a typical US phobia. <br /> <br /> As usual, it was the performance of Richard Gere's theater, but the most gentle girl who was supposed to represent her was most desirable. A very convincing job. <br /> <br /> The film is a popular topic, and it's a cheap, dramatic and sensational image, it's just unreal. They only seemed to be free of sex offenders to dying, raped, raped and tortured to act, it seemed almost free. Even though they shoot people that shoot a wolf - how bass you can get. <br /> <br /> The movie will not appear in the US and the DVD will appear live. That is where he had to be in other countries, but they had to show it as Hollywood and Richard Gere. Believe, without Gere, the movie is not worth the B-series movie.
