Basically, take the concept of horror ghost Asian movie once, and in a broken and get this movie. The story is like this: college children get voice messages from their own phones to their deaths. There are some ghostly ghosts, if you've watched the Asian ghost movie, it's not scary now. This movie was pretty astonished, as it was very popular. The bull is the same, another movie. <br /> <br /> The effect was pretty good. Unfortunately, the actors get into a full circle ring-squire, so we did not see anything in the past. The two protagonists did a good job. <br /> <br /> In regards to Gore, there is not much. We get a cool look, one arm that tightens one head (I do not know how to explain it), but we do not see anything except the final result. Sometimes you'll see a bit of blood, including decapitated arms and a zombie (I'd really like it), but this movie is not too bloody. <br /> <br /> There is little fear in the movie and they are spreading. , and it's really not so scary. Sometimes you'll get awesome images, but it's not too scary to me. Ringu, Ju-On or Dark Water is nothing, and I'm not afraid of anyone. This is really a fall (and most of the black horror film), if it does not give them scare, it is not so good. <br /> <br /> Regarding management, Takashi Miik still has a pretty good performance. wool This movie was somewhat detracted from past films. However, she still portrays herself in her confused style. Many images were images like Miike (including a scene with dead fetuses), and the rest of the film Miike seemed much more in the last 15-20 minutes. However, the unfortunate movie is its harmful origin. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this horror film to people from Asia (though, much better I recommend) or great Miike enthusiasts. Beware of those who want to join Miike, this is not his best job. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it 4 because it's half-crazy. If it's been published four or five years ago, it might be worth more. <br /> <br /> I would also like to give you information on Asian horror films. How about Asian horror movie is automatically assumed right here (USA)? Many of these films are in Japan in the 90's, Scream, Urban Legends and What I Did What Did You Did Did You Did. If you've seen one, you've all seen it. And many of these films have too much confidence in their fears and their imaginations, if they do not have the fears they want to offer, then they are not good and they will not change anything. More Asian horror films should be like Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters, if you are not afraid of scaring or frightening, at least excellent stories, acting, direction, cinematography and much more are protected. . Two great films of horror-films, but generally excellent films. More Asian movie horror must be replaced instead of the song. "People wanted to find a ghost to kill their phone / video / house / electrical appliances / water pipes / google search / vibration / food / etc."
