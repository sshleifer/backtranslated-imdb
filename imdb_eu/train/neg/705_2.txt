There's so little in the fantastic book Anne Rice, that's what makes sense here. Some characters - vivid and surprising characters - do not reach the screen, and those who do it fit for their existence for no reason. <br /> <br /> Where is it? The relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where is the relationship between Marcel and Julieta? Why does Dolly Rose appear, since her story has never been explained? Where is Marie's rape and salvation, whose greatest attribute (and fall) can be tough - and Richard's marriage? Why does the film end with Marcel in his father's hands? We do not know that Aglae does not hate her husband; why is not this backstory hated this? <br /> <br /> Regarding performances, it is not better than a mediocre one, but it is likely due to a fake script. The best thing is that Richard plays the role - but Richard is not enough to recover the movie. The worst is Jasmine Guy, like Dolly Rose, although the actress has never done so much to work. <br /> <br /> It's totally awesome. It was impossible to think that Anne Rice's book would make any movie worse than EXEN TO EXEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS looks bad. How is Rice doing this best job on the screen?
