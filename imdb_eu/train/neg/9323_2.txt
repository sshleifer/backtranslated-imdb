What did I see? I have spent 90 years watching one of the best films ever seen. The serial killer clown concept is really terrifying, there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns ... but having a nursery for 300 kilos, reciting clowns of murderers, clowns mock the genre. I still wonder how Mark did not escape from his head ... He's 300 pounds, he's got to be tired. Eventually, he lifted up and aloud he told me "What did I see?" Apparently Brandon is cousin of Denise ... and he approached the middle of the film, he said he was sex with his cousin ... yes, people would see something they want. <br /> <br> </ p> <p> I found another strange curiosity, the clown that touched the woman to the girl and "What did you do?" Well bytch, what do you think just did? We were stupidly the last one, the main character was playing the ring of cyclists and after 5 minutes of making ac * nt, violence says nothing ... scriptwriter gives a line. wrong guy? This movie is not anywhere. <br /> <br /> The movie bought a low budget porn (less than 3, I bought all) and I had no entertainment outside of the sex scenes. I am impressed by the fact that raw clowns could not get orgy. I'd put the movie in the right place. That's why the movie would have an entertainment value like other B movies, but I was wrong. This is a waste litter, although it is not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10
