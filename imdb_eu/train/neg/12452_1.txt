This movie is very bad, I can not describe it. What is blaze pit bad for writers, producers and directors? How did you get the money to get this eruption? The earthquake is not surprising, the play is wrong, the story ... What's the story? The first fight in this movie is fine, but then it continues to repeat until you want to deactivate it. <br /> <br /> I think I do not deactivate this stupid movie in the first minute. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLER ALERTA *** <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie when Scott Adkins was there ... and it's there ... for 30 seconds. ... <br /> <br /> From 10th onwards, I offer the lowest grade of the IMDb. <br /> <br /> Please, do it yourself: watch a Uwe Boll movie ... twice ... it's worth your time.
