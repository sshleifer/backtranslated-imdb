You do not know a secret? This movie is horrible. Well, I do not know if you can really enjoy the live versions of original movies, maybe this movie looks amazing to you (this movie was a plagiarized copy I had earlier this summer).

While they're swinging, slowly (and I mean SLOWLY) they start dying because they know a stupid secret. The only single thread is that all the victims are ordinary high school enrolls. However, I was surprised at how many of the things I was shocked about in this movie (I'm not sure of his name ... blonde character) that resembles reese witherspoon. Another thing that surprised me on the movie jumped several times in my seat. Is this artwork? It was not my 12-year-old granddaughter who had thrown orange juice for my glass because he was "boo'ed" because I was going to go to the guest room ... my 12-year-old director and nephew. ???? <br /> <br /> Do not you know a secret? I'm not sure with you, but I do not ...
