I liked the novel 'The Robber Bride' by Margaret Atwood, and I was glad to see a movie version. A woman is murdered by a police boy, and her friend, a former police officer, wants to clear her name when watching the dead female elderly. Fortunately, the movie's scripts, Mrs. Atwood, has resolved the clumsy, considering the story of these two men, the victims of women's sculptures ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> Welcome to me. In this book, the boys are mentioned and I'm pretty sure that they make the whole movie, I eat a hard copy of my copy. Apparently, the three main characters of the novel are not enough to make the movie. Zenia's manipulations are not very interesting if we do not see men, and if human life fails. They tell stories about Roz, Charis and Toni - to a man. It is not important if a man does not listen. <br /> <br /> The characters in the book liked me. It's hard to see the man's story going aside. I do not usually look for feminist angles in the media, and I've tried to enjoy the movie. If you had not read the book, I'd like the movie a lot more. So if you like police and former police, and if you want to read more about them, you're lucky. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy the prose and characterization of a cover with a plot of land. The plot is the same: he has rocked the film, he ironed it out and slipped it into a man's sadness. Margaret Atwood's revenge is her cousin.
