I rented the second segment, the baby was traumatized. I went downstairs early in the morning, when I started watching HBO, and Raft (2nd segment) was good for me. This time, I still enjoyed Raft, although I could not find out why it was a bit of a nostalgic reason. The other two segments were in the trash. I can not believe a producer has paid anything to make this garbage. I wanted to ruin all my memories of a childhood memory. Creepshow 2 will now incorporate into the list of infused classics of childhood. 4/10
