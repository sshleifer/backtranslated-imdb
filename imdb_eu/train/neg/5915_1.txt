I have seen several Chinese films in Hong Kong. This is the worst thing. No, the worst thing was 'Like unknown'. Yesterday afternoon I watched the 'Platform' and I thought other films by Jia Zhang Ke should be better. That afternoon I was disappointed again. Tomorrow I will not see 'Xiao Wu' in the afternoon, I put all three films in the trash! This film, from ten tenths to one, has to watch everybody in this movie more! Photography was very bad: it was difficult to distinguish between the characters since the work was closed. The language was so imbalanced that I sent it to the end of frustration. I would not recommend the movie to anyone. Give me the day Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage. They are real masters of Chinese cinema, not masculine pretensions!
