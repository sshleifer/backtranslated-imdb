I would like to say that curiosity was best for me. If I only saw a trailer, I would say the whole plot of the movie; In my whole life, I could save about an hour and fifty minutes and a little less than twenty dollars. This movie is a catastrophe that happens and it's a shame of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film shows vivid knowledge of reality. For example, a child's remote control car walks throughout the neighborhood, as well as entering the home. Cloth is covered. Is not it sensible that a remote one is no longer sent in such circumstances? Hollywood, of course, did not think it. The concept of ordinary logic and electronics is the opposite; Without a doubt, I thought the race cars could be reached on the street, leaving the house just across the street. Another non-virtual feature is the lack of intelligence for criminals. Why are all these guys in these movies until they found a rocket scientist until an eight-year-old boy? Does the child want to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of a professional terrorist? Please, there is more reality in Matrix. Likewise, the leader puts on a real gun and "unexpectedly" takes a plastic gun; Apparently, he could not tell the difference. With the glove too, you should do this. Because they are the same, it does not mean anything; then there are other visions. Traps are not realistic; If one of them really worked, the criminals would be dead. But Hollywood wants to "laugh" in "entertaining" performances of our trances. I did not laugh; I slept and dropped my eyes. <br /> <br /> But I'd recommend that anyone watching film is a bad movie. The movie watched seems like Citizen Kane. Otherwise, skip this for your pride. Home Alone 3 also raises a question. We all know the stars in Alex D. Linz, but did he write?
