Yes I accept it. In this work, I have learned about the attempts and difficulties that I have had on sex life in Mexico City. So I expected to see the Mexican movie (age), I saw it and it was interesting. Unfortunately, the movie was totally disappointed. The story tells us two pairs, both of which are very obvious to civilians. When a third party enters the life of each couple, their problems reach important points. Or absolute absurdity. The plot then turns into a sex battle. The attitude adopted by each group (yes, literally, girls, boys and girls) is stupid and childish (I suppose it was humorous). And everything goes wrong. The performances are good (Miss Zavaleta) medium (Mr. Bichir) and Serrano makes his first work acceptable. However, the plots that make up the plot, the one-dimensional characters, the perceptions of perceptuality (but not stupid) perception of sexual intercourse in sex fails the movie. Miserably SPYL has received a warm welcome at the store in the table. Believe hype at your own risk.
