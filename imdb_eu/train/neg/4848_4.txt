I love a good war movie and I'm getting into the category "I've been doing it". So I think my opinion is accurate (IMHO). After watching this movie on the DVD, I can say it was a stack of pile. I do not recommend this film. <br /> <br /> I started to cry out on the TV, "It would not do me", but I soon realized that being a bit of a work experience would be an inconvenience, so I cooled it a bit. But when I got on the wheel of the trailer, I thought it was a planned movie that promised the first scene ... I was right. <br /> <br /> There was no logical scene of EODs. I know that the army team has never been replaced by insurgent patients at the other end of the wire or remote trigger. I left for so long to break my head. Afterwards, when you know the story, Humve guys are driving through the desert. One of the most valuable assets in the theater, driven by SAS company contractors, <br /> <br /> the sniper scene was so laughable. I just had no sense and I wanted to go back. Then, in order to drag so much time, they tried my patience. He started with the "Right to Contact" and went down the hill quickly. If you have a Brit accent, you've fired, but if you're a member of the EOD team, you've suddenly been a great shot and you've saved that day. Then, it was thought, it extended more than once in a moment inexplicably long without adding anything to the story. Still asking to stop watching and why not stop? <br /> <br /> Then we had a milk scene that interacted with each other ... when you wanted to finish another scene. He never added anything to the movie. <br /> <br /> Then, as my life seemed very sad, the main star came out of the wire to catch someone. This was the most amazing scene I've ever seen. He challenged all the abilities to write good language, it was absurd and horrible. I still can not understand why the time lost. Then he just saw the streets go back to the camp, and I laughed at the ground. Empty comedy :) <br /> <br /> It is sad that this story is a complete show, deciding what it really wants. I thought the EOD would be stupid and illogical, but kept going to the tangents that tried to make something different. But it was as hard as he tried to kill me. It was all I wanted at last. The scene was stupid, senseless, mixed with a series of action (ish) stupid scenes. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend any way. Perhaps my work experience has been a threat to delight, but it is also noteworthy that it does not make sense. The only thing that is more stupid than this movie is to have a high score score artificially ... that is, it's a 24/7 work group at the box office that seems to be good for anyone who likes this website. Sorry people ... it's just! <br /> <br /> It is not recommended ... it gets bored.
