The expedition led by Captain Storm Blast (Mark Dana) will go to the Royal Valley of Cairo to find out what had happened to an expedition earlier. They will meet with the mysterious beautiful Simira (Ziva Rodann). They will soon find the blood drink mummy ... and Simira just seems to be what happens. <br /> <br /> Really snoozer. I caught this late night TV. When I was ten years old, I was sleepy! Having watched these years again, I see why. The mum is moving, the mummies will appear before 40 minutes (and only 66 minutes!), Bad (Dana) and REAL bad (George N. Neise) and there is no violence or blood to be found. This movie is based on dramatic secondary plays (it contains bad love triangles) than horror. <br /> <br /> This one values ​​three stars, because it looks really good, everyone plays straight, Diane Brewster's good performance. It's short and the mum attack (three) is not bad. They are not terribly terrifying. However, this movie is pretty bad. Insomnia fire-fighting cure
