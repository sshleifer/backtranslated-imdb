Whew. What can we already say about Gymkata? It is merely a mere halarity from beginning to end. If you want a movie that will keep you laughing on the floor, this is a perfect film. From cabot-covered mullet / sweater combinations to Parmistan (and four thousand million chosen ninjas), everything is about this film. <br /> <br /> It is directed by Robert Clouse, a wicked spirit that has inspired the mirror scene. In Bruce Lee's Death Game, he again shows the lack of talent. You might also like to enjoy other faces that you do not know, Buck Kartalian and Tadashi Yamashita, but you will not remember or watch over them as well. <br /> <br /> Based on a book called "The Terrible Game," I would be interested to read anything of its existence, to see where this was wrong. Instead, the book is an image of Gymkata's imagination. Probably Clouse did something to sell his flexible ideas. <br /> <br /> Choose this and Yakmallah yourself. It's one of the worst movie I've ever seen I've ever seen, and that's pretty much a bit.
