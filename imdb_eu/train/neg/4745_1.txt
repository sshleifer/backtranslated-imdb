No, I can say no more than saying that this film was horrible. The whole integrity awakens to your being because it was a hard sell because of your ancestors. But to the viewers every Chinese knows the history of China, even though this is just the most fun thing to learn. It's like saying all Americans are studying or learning the history of America, the Philippines, etc., etc. In any case it is not incredible. <br /> <br /> The story is stroked. Shin talked about being in a Chinese monastery, then for Chinese identification. However, the initial sequence of the film shows the map of Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime wants to take on areas like Mongolia, given. But he is a different nation and he will also write "Mongolia" on the map. Did Disney Studios miss the 5th level geography? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is superficial, at best, and yet, in some ways, has been linked. His training is just cursi. And, let's keep it behind: everything about this movie is bad. It's bad enough to laugh and cry. They were playing Taekwondo action and they were realistic. <br /> <br /> The evil eye was a matter of cursing. However, this would be the only thing about the left end. They should abandon evil eyes. But to some extent defeat the evil ones. Yey! <br /> <br /> Generally, it's not a movie that deserves a dog's time. Brenda Song should match her to another studio. "F"
