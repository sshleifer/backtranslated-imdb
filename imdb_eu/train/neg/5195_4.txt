We heard so many things in Weeds (and read). I'd like them to like a great deal of other cables (Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men), but they gradually worn out every section that I watched for a while. (without passing through the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> Writing is not original, thought out and the blame of the blacks. The conversation was felt forced, because the writers tried hard enough to be a light and a hyper. I heard a strange moment when I sent a laugh. <br /> <br /> The characters were never enough to take care of them, they were selfish and uncomfortable. I was totally a fan of HAT (what was needed to catch a predator) and sending the removal of the Quinn cloud from the cloud in the Mexican barnet, was so trace and trace. , I concluded that the writers tried the loyalty of the audience. <br /> <br /> The episode after the episode less liked the characters and I could not overcome many technical errors in the story. <br /> </ br> Add I heard about it that the Two Season was not very good, so I missed all the motivation to see to see this. <br /> <br /> If you are a good writer and writer, I think that this show is a challenge that you would like, unless all bets are recorded after the stone has been recorded.
