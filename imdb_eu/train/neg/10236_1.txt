Absolutely wonderful <br /> <br /> Now, when a film-purista legion strikes its lattes, it will be worked out. As I liked it, I have never seen one of the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm the worst film I've ever seen (a huge claim, as I recall, as I saw on the big Daredevil screen). Both directors (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) believed in the best and worse in horror. Of course, there were no Daphne & Celeste single-emotional character and a script that was as compelling as the defense of the OJ. The plot (a bit of a stretch of time) was not there and there were no "gore" scenes that were certainly brutal, irrelevant and calm. There is no doubt that about 20 models (Cuthbert) are attacked, imprisoned and suffer from many diseases, both psychologically and physically. The scene of torture feels like uninterrupted pieces like those that are unplugged and emphasize that it was amazing to fear the audience. Indeed, although they are very positive to get out of this very short film, their features are a huge mistake. In a movie I never heard any more voices. Within twenty minutes, the whole movie was in the points and it remained so. On the one hand, I laughed and I laughed, animated by a film uploaded to the height of the film film. In any case, this is really detailing the accomplishment of the film and detailing a future management plan, not specifying how to make a movie. <br/> <br/> P.S. I did not mention the movie I got free ... so I can laugh. He was tempted to ask for my money ... it was really bad.
