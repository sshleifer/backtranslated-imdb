The thin story is about two small town brothers and the family's honorary fight. David Morse is a responsible and direct police officer and a "good" brother; Viggo Mortensen, a bad boy, former soldier and former prisoner. As an actor (especially in his early years), Sean Penn seems to have moderated the performances under the methodology. Becoming a writer and director for the first and most prolific plays, the script and the characters are made through the same methodical process, the pause slows down to a crawl (in order to capture all the nuances and inflections). This view can be wonderful if you take care of three-dimensional characters, but the photographer Morse and Mortens are not really believers. Worse, billions of veterans like Bronson and Sandy Dennis are expecting more than just anything interesting. The image is sewn with a turgid, confusing argument and a beautiful mix (always pointing to artistic exaggerations). Penn camera cameras show a talented eye, but they are mostly irritation. * 1/2 ****
