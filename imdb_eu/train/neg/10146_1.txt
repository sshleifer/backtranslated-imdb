'Fury of Fury' is a great action movie, but it's not a boring action movie. I do not expect much from a Seagal Film, with the dreadful actions I think I'll be entertained for 90 minutes or so. Even if you do not achieve this low expectation, the scenes of action are very far away, the film (which is absolutely irrelevant in these films) is not complicated and confusing with the holes of great plots, "The act" is really shameful with Seagal. and one whispering One performance statement is the best among those who feel a lot of opinion - it's hard to believe that about 12 million dollars were spent on this expense at $ 12 of which 12 were spent on Seagal's Salary. I doubt it somehow! A moment that is interested in live boys or gay, apparently nowhere, two hot little girls end up in a sexually-scattered lesbian, except those with giants on the screen.
