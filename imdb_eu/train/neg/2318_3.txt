The child who learned from the martial arts academy had a skill to sink baskets. He found himself with the help of the man who arrived at the university while he was looking for a real champion while looking for real parents. The best infinite piece is the act of messing with comedy in general. It seems Shaolin Soccer's basketball hippercase version, but it's a scattered comedy, focusing on more than one Chihuahua with a quad-hour ADD. I asked "what I see". I saw it from the beginning to the end and I still do not know what the hell happened. It's a pity, it's beautiful scenes, some funny jokes, and occasionally, but there's nothing to ever come together, I'd go over it.
