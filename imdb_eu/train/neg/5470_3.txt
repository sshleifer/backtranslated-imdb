Tromaville High has become a desert of rage thanks to the unexpected liberation of the toxic nuclear waste from the nearby nuclear plant. <br /> <br /> Non-violent chaos has absurd violence and raw behavior. It's horrible, of course, a movie that wants to be, the filmmakers blend in with the movie, cutting the rows, making it impossible for the king to allow freedom. Craftsmanship is far from the targets of Troma. The society of honor has amazing snacks and costumes with strange faces. The German teacher who becomes a member of the company has a "tossing kiss" down the side of his face. I'm scampering. The monster toxic at the end of the hundred myths is very nice. br /> <br /> Screen savers experts will embrace us all.
