I liked this show! I think he did not do anything wrong! Spidey does not step on anyone but the show does not have to! Many people think that this show is bad because of this. The story was great and it was funny that other heroes appeared like X-men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! Bad Sandman never appears, but I like it! The best spidey show ever! My favorite episodes are: 1. Turn 2. Spider Wars 3. Hobgoblin 4. Alien Costume 5. Mutant Calendar <br /> <br /> But there are some passions really like: Rocket Racer and The. There was a shame to see. And I do not like Morbius and Hydro Man. Morbius's first plasma instead of plasma blood and I do not like vampires. And I am annoyed that I was the main driver of Season 2, of course, I must mention Hydro Man! It was horrible! I prefer Sandman! The last look was so horrible. And I do not like Spidery as a man spider! <br /> <br /> But I think it was a bad thing!
