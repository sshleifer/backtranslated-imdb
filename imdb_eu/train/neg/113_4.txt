Today, I found "All Laughed" on VHS for sale at a rent. The VHS was old and widely used, I did not have information about this film, but I liked the references that appear on his cover: Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and especially Dorothy Stratten attracted me. I decided to take a little and risk. I searched for the IMDb and a user rating of 6.0 was a great reference. I looked "Mick Martin and Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and ?? wow ?? four stars! So I decided I could not lose more time and see it immediately. In fact, I've finished watching "All Ride" and found a very boring movie. The characters are poorly developed and I have spent a lot of minutes understanding the story. The land must be fun (private gazes that are in love with women behind), but I do not laugh at the whole story. In a big city like New York, coincidence is ridiculous. Ben Gazara is a very attractive and attractive man, as women like Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney are very hilarious. In the end, the biggest attraction, without a doubt, the Playboy center and the annual playmate Dorothy Stratten, died after her husband died quite well, and her life "Star 80" and "Death of a" died Centerfold: Dorothy Stratten Story, "Keith Richards , The amazing beauty of sexy Patti Hansen, always wonderful, even fifty-five years old, Audrey Hepburn and "Carlos Amigo" song. I do not like it, although Roberto Carlos was the greatest singer of Brazil since the end of the 60s and his fans "The King" I called this film in my collection only for these attractions (male Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Muito Riso y Muita Alegria" ("Many laughter and happiness" )
