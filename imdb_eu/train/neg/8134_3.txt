A man wakes up from a nightmare about bats. He and his wives enter the desert to get a picnic on their honeymoon. It seems that he hears a strange noise, and he is angry at seeing the bat that scans his picnic over the blanket. She wants to go round a cave, something that she is doing is related to work, but she wants to enjoy her honeymoon. He left They turn around, but they leave the team. It slows down, caused by insects. It continues. He hears the strange noise again, and it seems that the bat is approaching; She joins her and her hair goes in. He throws himself out of battle and attacks his brow. <br /> <br /> They leave the cave, but when they enter a gondola in a ski resort, they start the crash and they have it. hallucinations or bats approaching people attacking. When that happens, it gets angry. He can not drink alcohol. His wife is worried about rage, and Pasteur begins to treat it, but reacts strongly to the injection. <br /> <br /> And then some people die. We change the parts of mankind into one person. It does not seem to be thinking. Whether it's a bite that makes these changes clear or not, they already had some symptoms before the bite. <br /> <br /> Although the title seems inappropriate, the same thing happens to another person. It's not a very good movie, but I liked deserts, caves and sloping locations and some of the strangest scenes. I do not think it was as bad as the others, and I did not think the 1999 Bats movie was considered to be very bad at others (I evaluated 5/10).
