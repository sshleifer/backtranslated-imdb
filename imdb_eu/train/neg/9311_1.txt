The cover of the DVD and the record is awful, if you think about a twisted black metal, which is still an excellent idea, but the worst actor in the movie Benen Pearl Harbor, movies have a better quality. and better actors. I bought a DVD, but fortunately I rented it for the first time, it's a plot and a huge handwriting, it does not seem like anything to go together, really the movie never makes sense. The attempts to scare back flashback scenes are worse than those used in sitcom shows in the 80s and eventually hit the wall of your home.
