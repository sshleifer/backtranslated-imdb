The film was very disappointed. Especially as directed by Priyadarshan, it felt sad to see these states. Incorrect recording (it hardly exists) and kill any star that can offer at least one song for every minute of the song and song at a time. Some scenes were fun, but they were probably only 5 minutes long. The edition was pathetic. Dismal! Generally, the movie was disappointed, the story was clearly lacking. In fact, there were few people left to watch the movie after the second part. <br /> <br /> You should not miss anything if you do not watch the movie. It's not worth the money to win in these films. wait until it appears on TV ...
