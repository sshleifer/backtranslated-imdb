The collection of templates that made the production lines "Babe" was never made; It's enough for the writers to expect to discuss the animals they expected to keep the movie. It is not. Eddie Murphy sells again as a physician who recovers his childhood neglected gift, to understand guinea pigs, tiger, rats, dogs and pigeons for continuous and absurd whistles. The voice is a huge achievement (Albert Brooks, Julie Kavner, Reni Santoni, John Leguizamo, Garry Shandling, Ellen DeGeneres, Paul Reubens, Brian Doyle-Murray) but the script is so unthinkable that it is charm and depressing. Bin cane pretty quickly.
