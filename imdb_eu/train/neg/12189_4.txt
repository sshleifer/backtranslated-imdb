It's amazing that this movie is very well rated, although I would go with a typical 71-level scale, but maybe that's fine, but this movie is just a typical thriller, but boring and unstoppable. It's not a typical thriller that is realistic, but it seems that he was trying to do it, and yet he said he was not charged, because he did not want to cross a court, even though he would put him on his way. He broke his arms out of the dog and forced his life away, but he protected the lawyer with feelings, but he also protected the random people who did not even know about the family. There was a similar problem with the movies, there was a live movie, but there were some moral questions that Kady had to kill or beat before doing something illegal. When Kady proclaimed himself, Kady assured Kady that she had reason to protect her dependence, since she asserted that he was raped, he would be nonsense. So now I've just made this stupid movie of my life a bit, so ignore it, so at least your life is not waisted and so my 2 1/2 hours or so something has brought something.
