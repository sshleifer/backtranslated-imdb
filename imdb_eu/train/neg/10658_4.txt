On the way back to IMC6 (San Jose, Calif.), Five (we remembered, three of us, Kamal enthusiasts, three) unanimously achieved; VV was a harsh fan and thanks to the movie, we had a fairly pretty Monday. On the other hand, we managed to get out of theaters the following year. <br /> <br /> I do not believe Kamal's fault here because he has left the last interview in Madan, a cartoonist (Vijay TV). . He said something similar: "Tamizh Cinema'la Photo, Edition namba munnera'na maadri Screenplay, Direction, Acting'la innum namba munnera'la" (Tamil Films Photo and Editing has grown, but we have hardly improved it, the script, Regarding Direction and Conference "). While you're watching VV, these words are very true. <br /> <br /> Now, here are 10 reasons to hate this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Harris Jeyaraj. <br /> <br /> 2. Harris Jeyaraj. <br /> <br /> 3. Harris Jeyaraj. I do not know if you are here here for exploitation, but HJ has mastered all the wrongs of the last movie (remember 'Anniyan', ' Ghajini ') with a heavy kakofonia, a secondary musical invoice, which I pay for a transplant of the next ear. <br /> <block> 4. Songs Do not play songs, it helps the narration move spatially or temporarily, and they do not sit down and Warning: The movie has four long songs, with a few scenes It's like pockets. among them. <br /> <br /> 5. A short distance went too far. It should be a short VV short story, not 2 hours plus "thriller". Here's how to use a topic, like Energizer bunny; in this case you just do not want to. The last part of a movie is a great drag. <br /> <br /> 6. Kamal-Jothika pair They closed two ice cubes that could lead to this lead spark. There is no reason to bring them together. As each film joins the second part, narrative is very irritating. Hailing to say hello, but Kamalini Mukerjheen's 10-minute romance makes Kamalek and Jothika more than in these films, in "Thenali". <br /> <br /> 7. Kamal Haasan's accent Kamal never speaks this pretentious accent in India or the USA; and it's not new either. This has been done from Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae. It just gets nervous. Imagine what could cause his unfortunate accent in shooting in the US location. He does not even leave immigration. It offers a dose of advice to men (Keeranor, Sathoor and beyond TN police officers) in Kamanglish's caste ("Here is the worst policeman"), of course. nausea effect <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Gautam does not make sense with the pure performance of the Department. The senses about Mr.C.P's commitment to the love of his streets to talk about issues such as life and commitment to life. The scene of the theater was so bad; We could hear people behind, to challenge the heroic intelligence coefficient. "Is it stupid, can not Mermaid or Light be used?" (In a busy Madras road, Kamal-police-police Jeep follows a bicycle like the ordinary guy!). "Can not just use his gun?" ("The guy in the bicycle" starts walking and Kamal is a long way to go for a long time). I have not voted for it later, but I try to explain myself internally. <br /> <br /> 9. Gore and violence. If I want to see women being raped, when they blame their throats, I would like to see more women forced into the bush and with true veracity, to sit in the house and see "Police report" or "Kuttram". Using excessive violence should be a way to expand the story, do not be overwhelmed! At the bottom of the line, Gautum confuses what the extensions (rapes, killings) are and what is the basis (the story)! 10. A double spresso kick could not get out of her head.
