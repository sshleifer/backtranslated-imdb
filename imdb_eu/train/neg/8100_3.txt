Vanities of Bonfires is a soaked flop sweat. I can recall that no movie that is so hard-pressed, provocative and important, but it has failed, however, consistently. It's like a comic book that does not laugh, but it's impossible to leave the stage. It's trying harder for the movie, the essay of each laugh is terrific. The disappointment that the film is so bright is that it is almost pity for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> The movie only laughs twice. Once Geraldo River is faced with what is considered a renowned, arrogant and passionate television journalist - because this is funny he does not seem to think he is playing himself. The other laughter scene is the latest "big moment" of the film. There, Judge Morgan Freeman gives a holy speech about morality ("what your mother teaches!"). Momentum pompousness is becoming absurd. <br /> <br /> However, it must be acknowledged that it is a noble endeavor. If a strong or misinterpreted group of actors is trying to get rid of thin card characters from characters. The film looks professionally and the small cinematographers who love solo director Brian DePalma are apparent, especially if they are not effective. But he wants to have a commentary on moral film, morality and modern ethics, never generates more than cartoons. It needs a satirical style. It requires farce energy. Although sitcom time is required. However, the best Bonfires are a disappointment. In the end, you do not want to laugh, you want to turn away.
