Kurt Thomas plays a star like a gymnast while Jonathan Cabot prepares a special game that wants to hunt a group of ninjas, but these ninjas do not have the chance, especially as Cabot is a gymnast! Gymkata is a bad movie, a theater that plays a role in theatrical genius and a very small director, the standard gives human quality. However, the movie is very awesome. I mean with the dialog box: "I know I'm a stranger!" or "Ha! through you!" Gymkata will only add the mock image that it will get at that time. (Honestly), apart from that, the hero is a gymnast who finds things that are going on at the moment.
