STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Alice, after Freddy finished the last film, that is. Now trying to adjust his life again. But his unborn child has a demonous presence-Freddy, trying to get his world back. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the directors of the film directed by Freddy for their big breaks - Charles Russell (The Eraser, The Mask) Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Goodnight, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) and here Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space, Predator 2.) But while Russell and Harlin work hard, Hopkins IMO has done something to do with this entry, which should be forgotten. <br /> <br /> The story goes on here, it is clear, that Freddy owns himself and he's the horny humor of the devil. About an hour and a half, everything is quite tiring and, of course, it's not terrifying. <br /> <br /> "Bon appetit, puta" capturing phrase is another just another memorable one. very forgotten entry. *
