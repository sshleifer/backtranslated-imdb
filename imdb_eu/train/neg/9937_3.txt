First of all, it is very dated, which is not based on the exhibition of the political revolution of the left. Honestly, the only way to say something truly revolutionary is to stop being an intellectual intelligence (because of its absurdity, when I come to being an intellectual answer, I am reduced to despair); As if we were to return to being in the name of equality, everyone is ridiculous. Our intellectuality is just one of many human qualities, but this does not mean that we can educate ourselves to the highest possible level. But definitely, this educational message connects Godard with the use of rock music; That's why The Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The song 'Sympathy for the Devil', whose birth is a witness and the name of the movie, is nothing special. Since the sequence of the Akorde sequence was not particularly original, Led Zeppelin's 'Thankyou' (Led Zeppelin II) was a much better effect. In addition to this, "Sir" Mick Jagger declares himself as usual (Bob Dylan) - note how the first melody phrase for completing verses is repeated over several times. <br /> <br /> In fact, the Black Panther that appears in this movie is, I do not know what they are doing, the most interesting scenes include equations related to fascism and pornography; A message under the 60s and today's sexual liberation (a message that breaks the behavior of Rolling Stones on the behavior of the film). <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the DVD was released for free with The Sunday Times! For the deep historical exhibition on the left-hand side, listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece, 'Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore'.
