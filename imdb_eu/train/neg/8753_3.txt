This movie reminds me of Mary-Kate and Ashley. It's only worse. I think that although Alysons's actress is a rich sister, Amanda Michalka sometimes enjoyed this movie, but Alysons was playing with a rude character. I think that after the music of the high school they had to come up better at night and, definitely, it was not. The storyline was not very good and I think Taylor and Courtney should get two other people. I'm not a fan of Alyson Michalka and this movie did not like me better. I think singing definitely hurt and not having seen this movie alone (unfortunately I did not)
