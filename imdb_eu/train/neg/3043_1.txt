This movie aims to be a "lighthearted" story about Santa Claus and his "magical and mystical" wonders. But instead it's a dreadful shock. There are two things in my mind that are incredibly terrible in my mind: how it looks like Santa. - Have you ever seen Santa Claus look so terrific? and 2) Repulsions of "Satan" wickedness are rare in Pitchen's dancing. See the movie if you want an MSTed version or a good laugh. I can not believe it's a children's movie.
