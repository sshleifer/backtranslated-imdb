When I saw this movie on FearNet, I thought the movie would be terrifying. Apparently it was not. I have no idea how the movie was left on that site. FearNet is a site that shows horror horror movies. <br /> <br /> The actor is wonderful at all actors. I hate the story. The story was stupid. It starts with a man engraving with a movie symbol. The stamp breaks up and some catastrophes occur. Water turns blood, oceans turn off, the moon becomes red, etc. <br /> <br /> An embarrassing nature of women too. It did not make much sense. Just like when he watches a piece of paper in that period. Coincidentally, the birth of the child is the date it is expecting and begins to be aware of it and begins to investigate and ask religious questions about what it is. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler alert * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. inserting in it. <br /> Here it happens. The deceased person of the mind dies and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore enters the hospital in the midst of a large earthquake and is born to children. It touches the baby's head and afterwards it dies to the baby's soul. Then the apocalypse stays. <br /> <br /> Why does God suddenly change the heart? It is angry that when the governor allows the execution of a mentally-delayed man, will he apologize if a lonely woman stole a soul from a solitary woman? <br /> <br /> * Finish a Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty stupid. It is the end of the religious piece of world propaganda. Demi Moore and Michael Biehn's performance and all others are excellent. That's all. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 stars in 10. With great nonsense!
