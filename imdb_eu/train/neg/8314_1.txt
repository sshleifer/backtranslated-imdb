When I first saw Chan Is Missing out, it's been about four years since San Francisco or New York. It was a few years ago, but this movie seemed better than the city's essence and the people I saw better than it was (not even). It is based on a specific community - the Chinese - but that's fine, because it refracts the city's soul in its settings, faces and perhaps all the voices of the characters. <br /> <br /> This is not a tourist 'San Francisco. The settings are modest and everyday: taxi cab, Chinese restaurant, Richmond neighborhood houses, small Chinatown apartments and small business offices, docks, one of the oldest in the Philippines. The city is a look and feelings of everyday life, with people who live there - now in the urban reconstruction of Silicon Gulch. Unlike Harry Dirty (for example, a great San Francisco movie), everything is filmed at street level: we understand the views of the characters from the point of view of their environment and not fantastic fantasy. filming <br /> <br /> Apparently, Wang filmed in B & W, because it did not have any money, but it is a natural light that gets the most powerful visual elements of the film. The quality of the sun's light, often hard and hard, is one of my closest associations to San Francisco: It seems that it shows everything, buildings, mountains, other milestones on a small scale and, in a fun way, the people you overcome are on the streets individually and potentially closer to others in a place. Wang's picture is perfectly transmitting, and it helps even more stories in points. <br /> <br /> Wang captures dialogue and dialogue style with Chinese and other Franciscans, I think it's more than anyone else. If there is an "accent" of San Francisco, it's the "taxi medailon" broker (I think) that is what you hear when talking on a phone in a single scene (hear the person calling in the other direction). already dingaling! "). <br /> <br /> The story is an Olympic and, despite a few very bad steps, it makes the heartfelt attempts to appreciate the hearts of people living in former immigrant communities, such as political, ethnic and small ironic resilience to help them feed Well, all of this is briefly reported - maybe the respondents think why this is a series of films here. It's not enough to find out more about Chan's search for cyclists. <br /> <br /> Chan is missing out with a Chinatown travel sequence. From the 1930's (I think) in San Francisco and all its crazy diversity, it's an American caricature, but not quite a brand.
