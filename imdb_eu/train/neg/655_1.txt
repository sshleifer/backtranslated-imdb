I waited for this, I would not leave more than twenty minutes for the movie. Although I thought it was a bad restart, I kept a lot of hope, maybe ... maybe this time someone would get it. Unfortunately, Prom Night is the same level of release, with the new version of April Fools Day, a bad script, a dire direction, an overwhelming touch, and a horror over general. a dozen with eye rollers. We have seen all this and we have seen that we have done it a million times better. If you go to the Prom Night in the theater (say DVD or PPV wait), prepare to laugh at the audience and laugh. The laughter of a movie that is not so fun is that they are not so bad at the time of the "exciting" film, if you see the latest installment of Scary Movie. Seriously, is this a remake or a spoof? The filmmakers were so badly marked here that the number of spectators in the theater I attended was halfway through the movie. In retrospect, I would like to do it. But I did not have to torture myself and I would continue to improve. Needless to say The "Horror" scene is a joke, even for acting, but directed, script, "special effects" and camera work. He watches the film as a fortune to produce films, but still comes with a micro movie quote. In the middle of the store shop labels I had to see some sections and I continued to think that anyone playing a star in a cast. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrifying, if it's a horizontally horrifying future, the horror genre is doomed.
