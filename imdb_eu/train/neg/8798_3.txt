I like a movie with at least one story. This is not happening in this movie. It is a series of non-cohesive championships. <br /> <br /> There are scenes from a person that collects pineapple cans. A woman with hair will never remove sunspots. This woman is thrown at the beginning of the film with other people and we never know why. After about 30 minutes it completely disappears. There is another woman constantly cleaning a man's apartment. There are endless stories of fast food Mamas & Papas 'California Dreaming' (which I liked for a long time) (I liked the song). Interview, especially food (pineapple, cooking salad and order drinks?) Caring for them. I think that most of the actors got a lot of weight in the film because they consumed a lot of fast food <br /> <br /> There is no passion story in this movie. Certainly, this is a love: it's not such a thing. I wonder why I did not get Fast Fast forward. Do I wait for something to happen? It is not. Perhaps this may be the only consolation for this movie; The scene changed so quickly that it was supposed to be revelation to all nonsense.
