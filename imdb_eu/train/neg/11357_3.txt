1. Good news. 3-D spectacularly made and have not gotten any gimmicks from Gotcha. The film is based on the true story of what is in the history of human history, and is also a real participant in this story: Buzz Aldrin. <br /> <br /> And now the meat of the matter: HEGALDIA. to make krissakes! Big eyes, googs, human eyes, fly real, but fly, anyway. Do you remember the movie "Underworld" compared rats vs. cockroaches? This was not a kind of praise, and I never thought of carrying it any way. This has even less empathy. Haughty pasture Ugh. In one of these strange unions of a Hollywood band, this one was on the drawing boards, along with "Space Chimps", in space. <br /> <br /> Rent a "Apollo 13" and see the REAL space program (RIP) being about 9 in the movie.
