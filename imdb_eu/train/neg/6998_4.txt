Hollywood always had trouble connecting with a "religious image". Rare burden is no exception. Although he is using the talent of a great video, created by a good portrait by Robert Planck, the movie fails from credibility. Perhaps the reason is that the film is so realistic that sudden penetration of fantasy elements prevents spectator action and the fate of the characters. It was difficult to be still sitting amongst all the metaphors, parallels, and biblical references, and it was impossible to know everything Ian Hunter knows as a picture of Christ. And Boston, Detroit and Providence at least agreed with the censors. The movie was banned. Some Boston / Detroit / Providence councilors denounced or traveled to other cities, because Gable and Crawford somehow participated in the "image of the message". Everywhere floped. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, the movie has been a great revival of television. The atmosphere of the house can be seen to welcome the audience in the film. However, although it has been named as curious or curious film, the plot of this Cargo Strange has many predictions and moralist lines that will make the main characters discover how they will reach their own destiny.
