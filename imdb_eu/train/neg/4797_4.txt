The team of Vic Moretti (late Anthony Franciosa), with Derek, cheats on his driver / Vietnam, and guesses to the patient, Derek finds himself in jail and needs to fight. a corrupt escort, a prisoner brother of Vic's prisoner, and the unlawful experiments made by a CIA agent (the main cause of the genus and the first director of the Saxon) to become a superhuman invasion zombie for many prisoners. Of course, things are left, and with Derek and other unpublished prisoners, those saved by the infected people will save them from prison. <br /> <br /> John Saxon is a talented actress and Saxon director ... he is a talented actress. To say that this film (just one short John present), there is a certain flair about it. However, the movie is not entirely well-off. The dialog, though stupid, may sometimes be bad. Unfortunately, this is not enough to be alone in the movie on the coast and it is necessary forever to enter the movies themselves (that is, the movie is too late). So, I recommend this film, most of all, if you're a fan of Saxon (that is, precisely), it's worth a clock, go with the lowest expectations and you should be fine. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dana Lis Mason and Tane McClure topless <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
