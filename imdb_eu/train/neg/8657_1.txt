Now I'm a lover of the movie genre B B, but this trash finishes me with no end. The first film is the star of Lizzy McGuire, who looks for a lost 3-legged dog. Please, please, what kind of stingy mistake has a three-legged dog carried out by the divine crocodile, please, I ask you? And he's thinking about something else, why do they show the backdrop of the Dinocroc film box horribly and truly in the water? I think that the memory was spent 2.6 minutes in water, and there was only 6 meters tall, that is, a heartbreaking mind. The features that they got to this movie were so bad that they almost died that I laughed because I wanted to play a bad performance for death. But it is true again this thing for the preparation of super-crocodile battles created by other military examinations or the evil of all such things E.V.I.L Corporation. And let's not let the characters see # 1 in the middle and middle (who does not know how to behave), women WOW! The only thing worse, when the heroes talked for 2 hours and they worked on a long way to kill the dinocroids, the heroes failed to kill a normal 15-year-old in a normal way. seconds to get out. This movie was completely beyond gay, in the back of his random musical opera and probably from the CGI monster ever made, and, of course, it did not contaminate bullets and bombs (otherwise it would not peel). DUH military have been made!). Until now, when the best scene was introduced by the late brother Lizzy McGuire, he ate the dinosaur that he would cleanse himself with the noise he would have. I think it's better for you to watch Dinocroc watching yourself watching. And in regards to the director, I think I'm hanging around to get a bunch of people and we all turn around to shed a sock for an hour and a half until I finally die, and then I'll continue. live
