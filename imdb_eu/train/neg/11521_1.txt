This movie is really one of the worst landfills. It is surprising that something that can be really huge. But if you're mindful in the plot, in the development of characters and in the direction, you can get a shot of a so sound band that is so funny. The movie is incredibly quick and quick. Anyone who participates in this movie would give it some consolation, because their career was probably ruined by the participation in this movie. If you finish seeing this movie or have already seen (I feel your pain), these words have come too late. For anybody, be at all costs or notice that the movie is so bad for 2 hours of your life. Then, at the very least, you can clean it or watch something.
