After seeing the poster of the Smother movie, I knew I was one of those experimental films that I wanted to take my eyes. However, I felt a little optimism, as I thought the movie I thought. He will rescue the movie. Unfortunately, that did not happen. Amaia is a horrible movie, but it is not corrupt. That's the best thing I'm saying about it. Licensing Wed, something that explains something to write talents, has the same mood and predictable humor. Sometimes I did not laugh at seeing this movie. Wasted.It's been behind a huge amount of garbage (for example, I said, as I said, as incredibly monumental and insancible), some people might think that Diane Keaton's route is shutting off. However, it is impossible for me to forget the performances. He has been dealing with films like Decade, Annie Hall or Baby Boom. Smother makes his best efforts with his performance, but he makes his character so stupid and can not do anything. Dax Shepard has given me a good impression on her strength. Screenings for Baby Mama and Idiocracy. However, he does everything he can with his character. Mike White also makes a lot of effort, but it does not reach too far. The scriptwriter is very talented (as shown in the movies). such as The Good Girl and Rock of School), so I'd like to see it as a screenwriter of this movie, instead of just acting. Liv Tyler suffers the same status as all the actors mentioned before: wasted. <br /> <br /> The worst of Smother is being completely boring and unpleasant. It's just a collection of stage scenes and comedic scenes. Sit down in front of this comedy.
