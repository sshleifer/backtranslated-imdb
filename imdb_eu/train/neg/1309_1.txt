This movie was very boring. It requires at least 15 minutes. The dying images of children have been worrying. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write comments, but it was so bad that it was good and excellent. In this case, I think the honest valuation of this title is a step forward. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? I slept sleeping 3 times. After 4 hours I spent 4 hours after I had slept. I think the point is the same. <br /> <br /> There is no conversation between the characters, except 2 sentences, finally. <br /> <br /> When you sleep, once you watch it, do not try to postpone it and bind yourself again.
