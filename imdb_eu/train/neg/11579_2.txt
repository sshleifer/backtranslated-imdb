I have to admit, I do not remember much about the characters or the story, although I am not sure, I felt the anger of that movie, which is why I was very hard on it. How can you call the movie "Keys to Tulsa" and then the movie in Texas? The flat desert wilderness around Arlington (I think it was on the spot) looks like green hills around Tulsa, and Tulsa's celebrities will be more enjoyable in the neighborhood. Of course, there was no one in the film. Tulsa would otherwise have noticed that there was nothing in the movie. Did not nobody see at least Rumblefish or Outsiders? I know this is picky, but I can not do that. I saw this, I love James Spader, and it's also common for Eric Stotz. However, these two interesting agents were unable to encourage the meander and the average story of people entering TULSA. Sorry, it can not be more expensive in Oklahoma. What would happen to "To Live and Die in LA" shot in Toronto? Was that sucking? Well, it does.
