The Piece of the American Pie traditionally deceived me to rent this movie. I've got a piece of Jackass-like junk with Jackass's movie as a citizen-like movie. <br /> <br /> This movie with other movies he regretted that he was rewarded. From 10 onwards, I can not go under it now, just like the bad movie, it's just as bad. <br /> <br /> I've really activated it after 45 minutes and I rarely do that. It was boring, stupid, interesting, and useless. <br /> <br /> It is not possible to believe that some people really reward 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? When did you just fall for a child or the first movie you ever saw? It was so you did not want to compare anything? Are you still a virgin and are you ever thinking of breasts? Something must be wrong at least. <br /> <br /> My advice: leave this one. Even if you do not think it's necessary a simple movie Be it, choose something else, or you're sure to regret it.
