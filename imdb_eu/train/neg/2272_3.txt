I'm not the regular viewer of Springer, but I see the show in the shows, and I think the show is a good way to kill it for some time with a pleasurable culprit. So, naturally, I hope I've seen this movie "Jerry Springer Uncensored" I hope. First, Jerry approaches about twenty minutes of the film. For another hour and twenty minutes, we are building this stage furture, trailer trash, jealousy, incest and deceit. Jaime Pressley (a hot look as HELLLL) is a trailer-trash slut that suits his son (Michael Dudikoff is an unusual look, the most boring and drunk string). Mother knows her love, they fight, they want to take her to the "Jerry" show (that is, Springer does not). And then we have a parallel story with an African American couple. They take it to the show "Jerry". The characters collide. Bla, blah, bleakin! The trash was rarely this BORRRINGG !!!! I wondered why Springer has millions of fans, but none of them has been filmed. Well, now it's totally obvious! Whether you love it or hate it, you hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a whole mess of a movement (if you call it). It's very badly edited, with just the non-connecting scenes, and after a while, the plot will almost disappear and it's just over the map! Think of what the planned soap opera becomes a fake comic. Rarely laughs <br /> <br /> My only positive note is the girl-girl's hot scene. That's just as dangerous. I'm not writing badly, the scene is quite dangerous, but if you look at the overall movie compared to Springer's material, this great-looking farce is very satisfying. <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (10)
