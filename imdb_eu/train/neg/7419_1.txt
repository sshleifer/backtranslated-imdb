This movie was awful and shocked to the audience. Heavy writing, bad smelting, endless boredom. <br /> <br /> In the traditional customs of Hollywood, the United States government is always wrong. Hollywood Communist sympathizers, most of whom are silent as a rocket box, love Eugene McCarthy as a lonely nutcase and thinks he is a great leader. Actually, at that time, the Soviet Communists were nominated for a frank character who was worried about political gain. <br /> <br /> Yes, well, and the United States brought evil nazies. Like Werner VonBraun, we would not have any spatial programs. He really loved to be an American and became a great asset in the country. <br /> <br /> And yet, irony is that Hollywood fantasies, many of them living in fantasy life, still believe that the Government needs everything to do. and give us everything we want. And yet, the same government is constantly portraying these iniquities.
