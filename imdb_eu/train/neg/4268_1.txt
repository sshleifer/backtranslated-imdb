Since I was a child, I remembered this show. I could not remember too much about the little things about the characters. For some reason I remembered that it was really alive. Besides, it really started early in the morning. In the end, after a long period of time I looked through the web, I found a section. The first section is not the least. Criminey! The show was so huge. Of course, he was playing the lollipop and he liked to have fun. The show opens with Bhodi Li saying to her mother "My names do not Christopher, BODI LI-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" then, we're forced to sing the song "on foot" for children playing Lazy Tag. and not just a little quick, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh thinks my brain hurts. Yes, and I did not get worse, you can not see the lasers on their tracks. It's like the "loose foot" that runs on the whole song. Later, in a bhodi space or where it never goes up, they will make a laser gun with Phil Collins's "su-su-sudio" song. Oh, believe me, you do not want to know the rest. what can I say ... THE LIGHT shines !!!!!!!!!!!
