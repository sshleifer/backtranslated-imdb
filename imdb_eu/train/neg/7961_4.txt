After five years of original Creepshow, George A. Romero and Stephen King wrote another groundbreaking sequel: Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories that are five. None of the three stories is really original or distinctive. The first story is a basic element of horror in search of a vengeance against a murderer of his owners against a wooden statue. The effects are very good in this story, but it's known to be quite credible. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamou are the owners of older shops. The second story, "The Raft," is a story by Stephen King. Four teenagers are about four pennies about a pallet on a wooden pallet. Soon children scream their lives in an irrigated stain without apparent reason. However, instead of being suspensory, children have saddled bad conversations and mumble behaviors, it prevents us from thinking about what is going on next. In this segment there is an unwanted mood. The third and final story is "The Hitch-hiker". There, it is a restart adapted to Creepshow 2. Lucille Fletcher filmed in 1953 as a black film movie. Then, it was adapted to Inger Stevens for a famous episode called Twilight Zone. "The Hitch-hiker" has the best three offers, but it's not a problem. Lois Chiles is a spouse who cheats, which ends the running of the bulls, or thinks it. However, we do not know how to sympathize or condemn him. Like stories of that kind of story, characters are just a matter of telling stories and turns alternately. There is no room for translation of stories. Tom Savini appears as a "creep" installment. The good thing is not to keep track of it. * 1/2 star.
