Seriously, I have read some of the critics of this movie, and I ask people who were watching the same movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I'm giving a lot of credit for the managers. The vintage style of Los Angeles in 1930, but what? <br /> <br /> Not a character is nice, the story seems correct, Karen Black is not a good actor. Donald Sutherland is just the wrong one. (and I want to have his animated character "Homer Simpson".) Doh!) Then he was a great actress for children, Billy Barty Creepier, and so on. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films that love film lovers and the rest look at each other and we will go "What the hell!"
