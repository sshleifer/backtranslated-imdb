This movie is awesome if you pay attention. The perfect movie is if you watch dancing on the screen of the image colors; which do not have a seemingly compatible connection to the next one. I rented this movie because I'm a fan of David Bowie and I'm very grateful to the musicians. In the end, Bowie filmed for ten minutes, and the songs and dancing sequences were silly and they wanted something. The moral of the story was really shameless. It is likely that there was no sale in London in the 1950s about racial issues. During the first half of the film I was buzzing, but I liked the "belly of the" not selling "message. When the blackbirds began to die, I thought my tape was getting tired. Can I rent half of two different movies? No, there was a song "Keep Britain White" and a dance sequence. Sorry, but World War II is not something you write about music. At least it's not music, as it could be described as "campy", as I've done several times. In general, I would say that this movie could do a lot better, if you take it into account and better cast your actors. (And put David Bowie for longer!) My grade: C-
