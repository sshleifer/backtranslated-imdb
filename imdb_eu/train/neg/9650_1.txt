Maaan, where do I start with this horrible movie god? Write a bad story badly. I do not know what the director thought about when he made this movie. Namaste London was a nice movie to be honest ... although the soundtrack was good. But this ... my good ... a movie that is supposed to be a musical ... the songs are soooo bad. AR Rahman should be the music director. <br /> <br /> After two big actors, the director should do a better job. Even though the first half is awful, the last 30 minutes of the film are fine. The performance of Salman and Ajay will lead to a great deal of disaster. <br /> <br /> Look at something better if you do not. I have watched the latest Bollywood movies (and I see a load of them) Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
