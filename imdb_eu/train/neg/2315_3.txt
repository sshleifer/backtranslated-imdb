Years have gone by when Don Wilson was planning to destroy his martial art specialization, and he also married the blonde reporter (Stacie Foster) in the first movie, now there is a new conspiracy, similar to the droids that draw our two heroes, and which involves a corporation that governs the world (this is not much delay) and Cyber ​​Tracker 2 turns the virtual movie of the first movie. I have purchased the DVD I bought from AM, the PM, the cheap entrepreneur (like this) in specialized entrepreneurs, the explosion tone, the small stories and, in general, the weak errors. Some of these titles (clearly) were enjoyable (Last Man Standing and The Sweeper); However, Cyber ​​Tracker 2 has lost the charism of Don Wilson. Compared to the likes of other similar efforts, Jeff Wincott and C. Thomas Howell are the names of Oscar nominations compared to Don Wilson. Another indication that Richard Pepin directs it seems that Joseph Merhi does not seem to create sequences of action that are more expensive than his budgets. Again, again, both C. Thomas and Wincott probably get more expensive. Cyber ​​Tracker 2 is a chapter with better movies such as Robocop, Terminator, Universal Soldier and Halloween III! There is so much Richard Pepin trying to promote personality sense pedestrian material still without intelligent ideas or at least a superb zipper, Cyber Tracker 2 is a flat fall. Literally, there is no good idea that there is no better loan for a movie and too much loan cast. The only exception is that Tony Burton has a better mileage than the material. In addition, Stacie Foster seems to be much better. However, Cyber ​​Tracker 2 is mostly noisy, bland and dull. However, if genuine martial arts sequences do not return, however, there is more than a lot of cars, and that's just not the replacement. here is the ambition. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 4- (Poor).
