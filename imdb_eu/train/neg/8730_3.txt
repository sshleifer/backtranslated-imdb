This film is one of the things that stand out in my mind (unfortunately) is the entrance to John Berlin (Andy Garcia). Passing your Mercedes over a winding road, through a forest full of Redwood trees. It's beautiful. <br /> <br /> Andy Garcia plays a character with a surname in Berlin ... Andy Hispanic / Latin is also free. Perhaps a Caucasian father married his mother with Spanish for this story? Who knows But I can say that when you enter a village in a village and village of the farm, what stands out is windy, especially with an annoying accent. Yes, I know, great? He is still a good actor. <br /> <br /> The title corresponds to a killer series that evokes his victim Jennifer. All victims are blind and disassembled. The murderer has taken the hiatus but suddenly a blind witness (does not ask) again appears, Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman). Thurman makes a wonderful job for blind people, I think. Lance Henriksen Sgt. I was worried about Freddy Ross. Henriksen played a rather curious film, especially late. I can still not forget the Pumpkinhead blood in the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Berlin movies L.A. as a detective in a small village town. He began investigating Jennifer's murder after finding body parts in the landfill site. When he found a blind man there was a great splendor. * SPOILER * Freddy's hilarious irony, with recording and similar names. I was very confused about eight "Jennifers" logic. And as the cause of the murderer was surprised, he did not have much punishment. With retrospect, this movie is surely a much more complete life, because the mumble person shows a person capable of murdering, because they have become a bit of wacko over time or perhaps because of looney toons. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich plays a great job at Garcia's quiz! They would be converted if the police did not allow someone to hack hard and give up their egg. As for the end, the surprise is a bit, but it is very controversial, like silk-screen printing. Murder of ross The murderer decides to go after his victim, I think he writes instead. I will not miss the end, alas, it's a good surprise. Then, probably, as you say, "the boy was lucky!" 4/10
