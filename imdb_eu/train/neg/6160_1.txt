I would not say * bad movie *. Unfortunately for me, I feel how much you know about fences, the worse it gets because they become completely realistic. I have dropped out of my fifteen years, and this movie is very bad. F. Murray Abraham is good (and seems to have a scene back), but most other actors, especially students, seem to have lost.
