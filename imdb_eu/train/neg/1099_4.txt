The plot of Tigerland fascinated me surprisingly. The fantasy of liberty was how the military should be. Colin Farrell's character was forced to swallow a conversation that allowed the principal authorities to flee. <br /> <br /> I think, "Hey, there's a reason why it's a tough field, it's a condition for the soldiers to fight and become a cohesive unit. There's no place where the attitudes and the men do not obey the orders." I was encouraged by Bozz, who had the danger of his soldiers throwing himself away. I would not want to fight someone like war, because he was worried about people's feelings, because he was doing the most necessary to protect his unit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
