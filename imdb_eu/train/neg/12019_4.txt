In the book "Mr. Scarface" I have read some good comments, but for those of unknown genres such as Italian gangster movies, the image is very sensible. In fact, after the initial configuration of ten million lira, deceptive, the routine became a vengeance, with Rick's (Al Cliver) character in the slightest turn of the character. The gang's warfare was confused for Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but it is the only one that is prevented by many attempts by violence as it has been said by other viewers. It seemed as compelling for me that the waiters who followed Tony were not in the streets of Manzari. They did not actually trace Tony before putting his hand on him. With regard to all the character of the title, Jack Palance has been wasted without being wounded in the nearby cluster, the title of the work of the United States, but "Mr. Scarface". I have seen enough espagnetic Westerns to find out that they do not work; In this case, at first glance, a spaghetti gangster movie did not work quite well.
