I found the biggest misogynist film of all time: Darklight. <br /> <br /> The wrinkle of the movie - Lilith was Adam's first wife and was defeated by the Imperfect and he was exiled from the garden of Eden, because he was playing Adam. They liked the same and refused. See, I took these words directly. Then the movie continues and, despite the fact that the heroine of the film is the only time it becomes acceptable, it's when it's made by men! The film ends with the control of Faith, the whole group of men! <br /> <br /> The script was predictable and the FX was awesome. In addition to the hate of women who are very subtle in modern film hateful women, Darklight is nothing original.
