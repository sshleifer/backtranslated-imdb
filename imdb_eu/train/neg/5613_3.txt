In my opinion, this film does not advance the new thinking. It seems to me that I like to take a spear on a spear. The director seems like an agenda! Duh! I find it's rational for you, there seems to be no room for alternative vision. I am normally in the side of the Naysayer, but this movie is not credible because it is based on fantastic men and women watching on the street. If you want a credible alternative to credible belief that is really worth 2000 years ago, you must make an effort to make the difference by allowing other parties to voice their beliefs. I am not sure but at the beginning of the film I felt like an attack on Christian faith, I was not believing myself, but I accept the beliefs of others and I do not want to be ridiculous, but I will try to understand and understand.
