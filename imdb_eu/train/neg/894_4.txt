I watched the Sao Paulon Intl Film Festival yesterday. Before I went, I came to see how they valued it, and at 7.4 a nice rate ... <br /> <br /> I went out 15 minutes (I never had this) but I was ashamed of the movie producer As I did in the projection <br /> <br /> I did not like it, it's going to be in the midst of conversations and from nowhere; The characters are less than in conversations, nothing. Wherever you go, and worst and worst: Siemens and Organics are all about the film. Although I paid for the movie to go through and entertain myself, the main character still was on the Internet and Siemens mobile will always appear when I have to bomb it; or having another character in a bath or cut your hair on the screen when you see the Organics shampoo! All this would be sustainable if the plot, the characters, the romances, anything good, but bad, really bad! "I do not know how to do it" in the sex city. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money.
