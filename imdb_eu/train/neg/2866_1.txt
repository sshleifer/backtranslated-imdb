There's no word to describe my hate for this horrible interpretation of BTK's murderer. This film reviews the movie that makes the unfortunate excuse that came from ten films. From the beginning to the end, there is no noticeable. The whole thing came together; script, performance, drawing, lighting, direction, readability, factual information, ACTIVATION, to name a few. Many scenes literally laugh, very funny, because the whole thing is atrocious. This review seems like an unfair and noisy attack on a low-budget movie, but it's not like this. When I think of a newly-watched movie, my blood starts to boil. I never knew that this film never gave them the rights to production. I am tempted to recommend BTK really, really paternal and terribly terrifying. I can honestly say that this is the PERIOD in all the years of the movie. MOVIE Never I was wasting more than a few hours of life about this unnecessary garbage, and I would glide over the building I had most gladly knew, what I knew. ZERO TEN.
