I like the series "Toxic Avenger", but the weak offer from Troma people did not make any sense and I got out all the time. <br /> <br /> Nuclear plant (and growing). next to it) The young Tromaville High makes walnuts, and that's why it causes the inclusion of a gang in sex, bursting and whatever. Also, high school education is a certain school ... my God, the movie is wrong. <br /> <br /> The actor has left many more efforts after this and they needed it. I was nervous about the planned (5) minutes ... <br /> <br /> Disappointing. 2/10.
