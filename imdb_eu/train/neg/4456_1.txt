This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The story line is pretty bad, it's about 100 times worse about football violence. <br /> <br /> I started to look forward to discussing the premise of this film, but writers Elijah Wood's character Matt Hooligan was apt enough to introduce the scene when it was enough to open. <br /> <br /> But the movie determines after specificity. In the middle of the film, each one makes it harder than before. <br /> <br /> Clear out a few things: Hooligans do not have their own pub until it's nearly shredded - thousands of leagues in the game; they do not start to die one another; They do not wear Dresses for Stone Island (and others for people, hooligans or not). Certainly, they have not excluded a new company member from trotting, crushing and crushing companies against them. And I would like to meet the hoolean company that would go to the farm company with her lawn. (You can make a mark that says what I say by joining it each time). <br /> <br /> I am not wrong, I still do not see a movie. It contains some fantastic whimsical content, but this is a cluelessness for Fuel. <br /> <br /> I found ironic that Wood's Nemesis in America morally condemned his character as cocaine users, that is, a partial part of the British hooligan part. The film does not choose the challenge of Wooden morality, and instead let it be clear to any company that uses coke. <br /> <br /> I'd go ahead, but I think I gave my opinion. <br /> <br /> With regard to the earthquake, it is very unthinkable, and I am sure that I did not regret the whole movie and, above all, what I would have invented before. And believe me, I was well in front of you. <br /> <br /> The film is aimed at men, with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional problems. <br /> If I like it, the authors have completely failed. Realism is not a pleasure to enjoy anyone who knows the scene, and I can not curse a character that is damaging to the type of woman she is looking for. <br /> <br /> Is there a good point? Perhaps the fight scenes are well-choreographed and filmed, but I am rarely impressed by slow action; Undoubtedly, if there is no fight, a rocket is just enough. <br /> <br /> Some are funny, unrealistic moments. She smiled at Wood's school trip. But little and funny moments make up the entire factory for two hours. <br /> <br /> You're avoiding the British as a plague if you did not know how to misread the scene. If you are American, you can enjoy it, adapted to the market. But no one can be weak, predictable and eventually removed.
