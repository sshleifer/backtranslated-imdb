Crash The movie was not good. 5-year-old moods will not even be red-breasted. I mean, surely, some parts were fun, but most did not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actor (and a bad singer), and better films should work. The movie must be presented as an original Disney Channel, which is FREE. <br /> <br /> The only well-done work on this movie was music. Nothing like rock soundtrack to brighten up your day. These songs are very good. Above all, Alyson and Amanda's Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter, the Beach Boy song, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> If I gave ten out of 10 out of ten, 9 of them would be music and 1 would be the movie. You do not want money, but it's a soundtrack.
