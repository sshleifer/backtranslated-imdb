Drew Barrymore has had bad times not only in her career but also in her personal life. After being a humorous actress, she entered into the dark with a low-quality movie on cancer. While recovering from this dark past, this movie reminds Drew Barrymore of the worst day. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an interesting premise, which reminds Brian De Palma of "Raising Cain"; with a plot of multiple personality imbalances that sets the story of a horror / thriller. Barrymor's is Holly Gooding, a young woman who wants to make a living in California, after a traumatic event. There, another identity has killed his mother. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, he returns to his past. He has sought out his life in the life of his evil identity and the new love he has found in his new life. In the midst of chaos Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) is trying to find a new boyfriend Holly to face his past demons. In most cases, it's almost a minimal movie, it's never a movie that does not end it, and it's been over in the history of the film lately. Barrymore definitely does not do his best but maintains his dignity with his average performance. The rest of the pieces, however, go through the most mediocre and the most malicious plays that go through their minds, although they will be among the best of Leslie Hope. it's quite obvious. Despite the fact that the film is about to create original literary references in almost all lines, conversations are sad and woodworking does not work well. It is naked and careless for reasons and excessive use of special effects. <br /> <br /> Make-up effects make excellent KNBs and are among the best of the movie. However, the extra-curricular use of out-of-use effects when out-of-context reduces the impact of the work of the KNB and reduces the impact that another would have on the film. <br /> <br /> This is B -Movie is not an excuse because it's a low quality, as a better and more coherent script could be an interesting movie. Unfortunately, the second is a shortest movie here. Barrymore is worthy of beauty. 3/10
