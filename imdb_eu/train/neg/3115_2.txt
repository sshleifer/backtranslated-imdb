I rarely write a review for this site, but this time I have felt. The night listener is definitely one of the strangest films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was nothing wrong with this film, however - I did not care about the characters, I did not buy the whole mystery, no matter how it was finished ... nothing. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no comedy, there is no action, no excitement, no suspense, anything. They are noteworthy (without spoilers), a man climbing the male window, a dog barking outside the hotel room, a car with some rough terrain and a truck carrying a truck. <br /> <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "One Hour Photo" and I expected a mysterious role in Williams, but unfortunately, he was very much in love. The more disappointing I am, I'm sure, there is a good movie; It was an interesting idea and I had to feel the attitude of the characters, but it did not work for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Maybe I would give it 1/10, but that score is reserved for Producer Recovery
