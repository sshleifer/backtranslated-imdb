I only comment on the likes I usually like, "they fit everyone's taste," but here I want to make an exception. The premise of this film, which is directly disturbed, is that the two self-assured adults have the right to go to Las Vegas, to drink, to marry and to have an unimaginable suffering on their gods. kids. A culturalally sanctioned offense allows you to undo the sense of responsibility and responsibility that will wake up the next morning. In the end, "love" is important, right? Duel with all others. Is it really the thing to "end up doing"? Indeed, it is irrelevant. The fact is that appealing to others, especially if they are young, and especially when they are in a state of dependence, is reinforced and enhanced by this film. There are many more innocent behavior by "parents", which would bring down the head of the army of social workers.
