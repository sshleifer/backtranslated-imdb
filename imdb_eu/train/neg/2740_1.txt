I still do not know why I needed myself to sit. This "movie" was not burned by Memorex DVD-R; I thought I was watching the end result of a team of middle school who steal the camera for parents. That is, to date, the worst movie ever ever made. At the bottom of my heart, I really want to sue Aaron Yamasato for two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> So, apparently, it will be supposedly evil; However, if you end up in hell and forced to watch 90-minute coil, you will see that Yamasato is really hard trying to make a wonderful movie. The actors try to play theatrical performances with Crimson Tide, but closer to the sea. <br /> <br /> A terrific iceberg is just nasty. Camera angles are awesome. The story is C-movie, most - the plot is not good enough to qualify for a B-movie. It tries to be a dynamic and spiritual conversation, but it's like everything else. Rumors say that it really attracts hard copy copywriting. Also, techno score is annoying ... it's not techno, but it's not STOP. The reason is that music plays a background in full TIME, acting as subliminal sublime remembrance. I do not care about any liability, I do not buy. BOTS was not doing wrong for this purpose, because he was very serious: a joke. <br /> <br /> "This film was a very low budget, but that is not an excuse to set its record factor. Big films create a substance, not a budget. BOTS did not have it. <br /> <br / > Allow me to articulate the tremendous power of this lost 90-minute time: I am facing three television and blood with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel: it came about with Samura, I would not have a faster decision than Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> Certainly Without it, some people will try to defend the movie, two, perhaps three, they say, "grindhouse is chop-socky!" or "cheesy way!" or "it's so bad, it's good!" These people are idiots. , or it's a bad thing, there's not a bad movie, but there are some idiots that have fun movies, do not worry, movies that are not very high-quality and entertaining. It's a slither. It's not a BOT. <br /> <br /> This suckfest is about eight and a half hours, and my go On the shelf, it's 90 minutes long. The best part of this "movie" is the DVD cover; So you'll see that you're next to the Wal-Mart Dvd Checkout. Look it out - Do not touch, just look ... and relax.
