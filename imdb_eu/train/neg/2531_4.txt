The title of this movie song ... it's never written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> When I first watched this movie in 1978-1979, when I subscribed to the cable. In 1979 the cables became the usual place for housing. (or at least when it happened here, when it happened in Missouri). <br /> <br /> This would be the first movie I watched in "The Movie Channel", the first movie would be "The The" Star Channel, then changed the name "The Movie Channel" in the early 1980s ... .. "The Star Channel" I received a free month with my new cable subscription, which was a great rotation of the time "The Van". <br /> <br /> At that time I realized this movie and that it was a typical original movie I thought (in the same lines) other films for medium-sized youth ... ... the plots are about nudity and parties. <br /> <br /> I was completely forgotten that this movie I saw recently so far did not see this movie again In decades ago (I found a copy of it for the sale of cheap DVDs for sale). I acknowledged it and I bought $ 4.99 only. <br /> <br /> It seems that this movie was much better than it's been remembered. , then seeing it was a very different experience no (30+ years later). <br /> <br /> It was fun to play children's music, cry smoking and watch the sex on their backs. fancy vans (many at the same time). This is a good movie for young parties. <br /> <br /> There is not a big plot that fantasizes about fantasy with sex with sex. saves her college money to pay attention to buy a deceived Dodge Van (tapestry wall walls, mirror ceiling and water bed) and eventually get her sexually. But the opponent's opponent reveals it and looks for the next match (so they can both drag their vans differently). He and his arch rival eventually destroyed one of their vans and did not steal them. His bride, her rivals, the girl (an attractive child) earns the heart that most of the films will decide to come on and make it more attractive / better and finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has fun moments. But seeing this movie 30 years later, the trip goes down the road. Although they can still remember the atmosphere of the puzzle, we also brought memories in the pinball arcades, a little town, while we burned our pails, while we would shout good girls and know how to get them. We plan to share the little girl with me and push her to the back arrows, I also remember a lot of songs from this movement (when they were new) ... the film serves as a capsule suitable for this time. in those times (it has brought a lot of memories) <br /> <br /> In the cinema, this is the only thing I can imagine in this movie I remember ... I never considered a time-consuming van like this film is very popular at that time I remember that it is very well, and I do not want to be a wheel, young men, 70-year-old men (including cars), Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy. Camaro or Ford Mustang is a hot rod, but never a van. This movie shows the van as one of the most popular elements, and all the young people wanted one (this was not true at the time)
