The main complaint of this film is impossible to say who is who it is. There is no racism, but these Asian ones look the same! I can tell a little bit about the story, but it's just as bright as it is. Peoples' identities are not a mystery, if it were a mystery, I'd look after them. Instead, I did not exit the ASAP screen. <br /> <br /> Long movies and emotional silent faces take a lot of film. Heck is boring, not only do I not know these people, but they are just sitting there. <br /> <br /> The typical Chinese production is John Woo, a video clip of blotched video videos. This is much better than Andy Lauren's "Fulltime Killer" (it's been a great movie). With a decent budget you would think you could look like Hollywood in the 90's. I did not know that the Chinese had beatniks of that time.
