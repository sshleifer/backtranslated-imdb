"Over body murderer" is much boring, I'm really sitting down for my actor's shame for actors. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria proves she can not take the movie in this terrific romantic. comedy, and even more, it really has no time for comedy. The psychic spirit reminds us of a ghost that comes from the widow who comes from widowhood. The children play Paul Rudd, drippy and charmless. Lake Bell is a psychic who plays the anemic energy of the film. I really liked Bell, but it seems that it has some comic abilities, and it worked overtime to make the material work. Sadly, Jason Biggs is an insurmountable piece of movies that can withstand movies and drags him down at the end of the "Titanic" Leon DiCaprio. <br /> <br /> He really left me "over the dead body", due to his laziness and pure effort. I began to think of all the interesting projects that can not be financed, since they are taking such a huge amount of money unluckily. Actually, is Hollywood like this movie? What stupid people do they really think? <br /> <br /> Grade: F
