If you miss a couple of hours and see if 80% of this time is unbelievable, I can give this junk by the year turkey turkey, no problem. The plot was incredible, it's a great explanation. The truth is, I've missed to describe this sweetheart's word. The characters are not completely and completely completely original (things like this have done much better in 'series killer movies'), but the performance was correct. Those who pay for this, I hope to return the money, for those who have paid for it, I hope you will refund your money. Believe us people are much better, much better. Go see
