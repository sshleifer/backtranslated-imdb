Universal Soldier: The return is never the worst film ever. No, honor should go to a movie that tried to make such a statement or try to accomplish something artistic, but in a pathetic or offensive manner it failed. However, the movie that I've ever seen has never been so hard to do, and Universal Soldier: The Return has completely achieved. <br /> <br /> This film is a science-fiction actor, who hardly recommends anything. Playing is as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The land is horrible and predictable. Special effects are pathetic. In short, anyone with a remotely connected movie should be embarrassed. US: Returns Van Damme's earlier fares seem to be an innovative masterpiece of cinema. Some films are so bad, they are good. Believe me, that is, I'm not saying any of them. I really do not know what to say here. Certainly, many people thought he had not seen this movie, but in that case: no.
