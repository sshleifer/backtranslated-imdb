Sorry but pathetic. The little girl was a toy, and they were not absorbed by pleasant characters and plots. Moreover, there was no movie to believe in. If you look at a whole narrastun guide, it's really a crocodile, it's not a fellow. Of course, they did not have to hire a real animal expert or that they should know that it is crooked. The excuse for a movie is sad. Especially the end. I was almost sleeping.
