After seeing small budget quotes from the low budget "Soldier Universal", Van Dammei Luc Devoreaux repeated his role as the second Unisol movie. Well, it seems that this response was answered, but I did not expect the way. Universial Soldier 2 is just intense reading poetry in your local library. No, that would be even more interesting. The sequels of fights are top-level, the only factor that Bruce Lee has, the whole pathetic excuse for making a movie picture. That and the hard guy of the WCW were condemned by the criminals "Goldberg". However, the lieutenant of Goldberg Seth would be better. <br /> <br /> Most of all, we reported the movie itself. Like some movie school students broke it off. Land drills are larger than Kanye West's ego, which they've actually made. For example: Luc's daughter, Hillary seems to be at least 11-13 years old, and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago. How is it possible? Tell me! Luc's partner died and only the section Unisol was wrong! You mean you said you had an experimental universe under the experimental film UniSol under the initial film. Pull up The director could have a longer time with this first movie and closed all the floors. But oooh nooo! <br /> <br /> Talking about the plot, BECAUSE! Compared to the first movie, Universal Soldier 2 is watered and does not work. Where is Unisol recalling his latest remembrance when he remembers his supermarket in the supermarket, or who thinks something like that in the desert? At the dawn of the millennium, you would attract more spectators if the future gap had occurred in the dystopia / orwellian area. Corny is an adjective to describe this sad, sad and sad part. <br /> <br /> Since I've seen: Double Impact, Under Siege 2, Robocop 3, and hell, even class-1999's "Terminator" class is more entertaining than that!
