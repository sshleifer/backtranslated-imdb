Covering art (a man with a horrible movie) seems like a martial arts film. (Hardly.) <br /> <br /> It is very interesting that the true title of the movie is Trojan warrior. (This is a brand of trojan condoms in the United States) This film has homoerotism. If you like this thing, this movie is not really bad. However, keep in mind the following points: <br /> <br /> There are many reviews of actors, groins and butts (a scene is also played when one actor is shot in the classroom). The movie is also amazed. Colors like lime, peach and red. From the cinematographic point of view, this movie is a queen! There are several scenes that appear with other people, sometimes they listen to it. Also, the cousin of the hero likes women and is trying to kill any other of the movie. Is there a message to be filmed by filmmakers? <br /> <br /> Is it necessary to fight in battle scenes? (Yes, some private parts of someone are caught up in a fight.) The fighting arts are short and bad. There's nothing here to wear here, just the standard moves you see in the old Chuck Norris movie. There is also a car chase scene, which can be the first access to LOW speed.
