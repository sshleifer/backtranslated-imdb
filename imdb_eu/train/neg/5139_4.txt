Many horror fans seem to love Scarecrows, so I think it's very well-known to be boring. This was an interesting idea, but it seems that dragging so much. I think the main problem is in the dark. Sometimes horror movies can work (for example Humongous), but Scarecrows is in the darkness. It's hard to know what's happening for a long time, and although some shotgun flat shots are awful, most were hard to see. If it was used a little bit of lighting, it would be better. <br /> <br /> I'm not worried about shooting my bugles knowing, Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend this to Scarecrows during the day.
