"Love of the Deadly Look" is basically "Fatty Attraction", attached to the back of the two backs. The end is not surprisingly anyone who has seen more than two or three weekly films. It's a new story about the temptation, and nothing adds to the genre. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Brett (Vincent Spano) works with a beautiful woman with a trusting background. Anyway, he'll lose everything with Janet (Jordan Ladd) on the sides that are disturbing. Janet, the blonde in Cedar Falls on her face, was not very hard on Brett, and she did not take it very well when it was cleared about compromise. After the wedding, Mrs. Brett, who was married to her new husband, died in the main bedroom of a large luxury house. When he asks the police with Brett, Janet immediately picks it up. After arresting, Janet seems to be quiet for a few minutes - it is not the first image of stability. His defense lawyer (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and is not intended to prove it. <br /> <br /> Have you done it or not? How will it end? The answers to these questions will be released next day "Love of the Deadly Love" at your local exit. And do not miss the moral of this beautiful story: men are pigs and women mad.
