The longest 35 years I've had to endure for a long time, Al Pacino seems to be sure of the exact exercise. It's not typical tipecasting, it was nice. But his character was really pathetic. Certainly, someone is misunderstood by neglecting appointments, while realizing that Hollywood's social life emptied the energy of his life. But I'd like someone in this movie. And for some reason, all the characters in this picture said: "I do not know why I love Eli", Al Pacino's Christian, and I could not even get close to it. <br /> <br /> All other actors played their usual styles. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff, and Bill Nunn had nothing to do with setting up on television or in previous films. Kim Basinger did not even give the movie something similar. <br /> <br /> The movie story was not a boost. The scenes are never the story, but only the factoids about the characters that were playing at the end of the event. He had the potential to build on the story. <br /> <br /> What is the point of the movie? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz think "Once Hollywood is you, you can not get it out." Yes Yes! That's why so many people shoot in Hollywood.
