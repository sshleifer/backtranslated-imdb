Ok let me first of all tell you how I am surprised by the plots, <br /> <br /> but only Steven Segal movie Steven Segal omg !!! /> <br /> The anticipated low budget action scene is not really shocked yet I was burned 90 minutes really in this shit !! <br /> <br /> Just rent a Jacky Chan movie or go see WWF more fun and it does not have and supposed to not be in the plot! plz plz plz avoid !! The btw actress is the best goldberg player, and that's a great deal! <br /> <br /> And it did not work very well, I said that I'm plck pfff, but I still do not think I missed 90 minutes and spent 10 more minutes writing! :)
