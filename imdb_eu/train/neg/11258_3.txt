I said in other reviews, without a story, you can give the audience the smoke and mirrors you want, no one will be cursed. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have a great eye. Art Deco in the 30s (I love it), and I think that all digital and other uses, such as the idea of ​​using it, could be a future wave in the production of films. However, it is evident that the director was interested in the digital rendering of his film, but he wanted to shoot many scenes that could take a lot of movies. (SPOILER) Loudly crying, having forgotten evil in these things! They're okay, but it's been twenty years since the movie's been filmed. Conra wants to be evil. As for the action, let's see that Sky Captain (Law) launches ONE robot, two or three wing planes (Dex (Ribisi) has stopped firing before) and a couple of robots before. , but especially spent spending his time and looking for others struggling with his battles. According to Paltrow Polly or Peggy or Punky, this movie is totally wasted (comments about him and Law's chemistry are so lacking), and I've been thinking of seeing the shots of the top of my camera. USE DOES NOT LIKE ONE OF THE LOTS, both of which at the same time lacks waste, a very fun one, quite fun, even if it is 70 years old. Except for Law and Paltrow, there is no noticeable time on the screen anytime, and the movie is a real mistake. The viewers do not identify with the robots; They need a hero for the root and hate the invisible and pernicious nasty. However, all the stories in the world will not help.
