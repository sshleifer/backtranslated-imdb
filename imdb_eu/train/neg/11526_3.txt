I saw the previous movie Ittenbach, "Burning Moon." But despite the rough and rough film, "Premutos" seems to laugh. It's worthwhile, although Ittenbache admires how he made his free money in his spare time (and he deserves a DVD documentary to see it), I was constantly fighting so I did not move on to the next gore scene. Of course, there's no gore, and if you want it all, go and enjoy it. But be careful: there is a dreadful comedy and a dreadful story. Many are comparing with Peter Jackson's films, especially "Braindead." But Jackson's looks at what happened to similar "Bad Taste" budgets, it's clear that Ittenbach is missing something from Jackson. 3/10 (to have a good and abundant effect and to get the most out of the limited resources - but I do not have to pay any money)
