So I was eager to see this in production. However, they left the largest. It's far from the strange world of Dr. Seuss. It was ridiculous and dissatisfied. I do not think Seuss should admit it. How Grinch stole Christmas was much better. I understand some subtle adult jokes, but my children still do not have to be caught. Hat The Cat in vulgarity because they'd like a lot of screams than they've caught. Seuss with Dr. Seek really bothered me for classic timeless how he flushed out the trash in the big screen. Who is. Dr. Seuss hopes to do justice.
