Rather than renting an Asian movie, instead of getting an American movie experience, nothing worse. <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion, but the good thriller depends on the implementation of intelligent and intelligent characters. In terms of likability, Say Yes's characters are a bizarre married couple. Do well. Unfortunately, think they are stupid. Let us count the way a stalker frightens you. <br /> <br /> 1. After threatening to kill a self-styler, be sure to say what the hotel you place after staying. <br /> <br /> 2. Beat the stalker out of the day and dozens of witnesses to hit the attack positions. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not worry about the police stalker, and just think, apparently (without good reason), the police were knocked out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4. When trying to get away, leave your mistress in front of your eyes as soon as possible stalker to ensure that he is kidnapped. <br /> <br /> 5. Once someone has been robbed of your wife, after receiving help, be sure to send it as soon as possible so that you can face it. There is no problem, right? <br /> <br /> Now, I would never expect any mistakes in the stress conditions that would be in trouble, but Say Yes's characters are so intense and they make such unbelievable mistakes, it's really impossible. to protect the viewer's security, as they are themselves victims. This removes the enjoyment of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you ask, scriptwriters did not stop with dark characters. He is surely wrong to write this crapfest; In this way, they decided that realism was so absurdly realistic that the sense of reality emerged from the window. <br /> <br /> 1. Does Stalker die inside a police officer? The protagonist is, on the other hand, less than ten meters. <br /> <br /> 2. Stalker carries out a lot of activities throughout the day and amongst people, but no other married couple takes into account their extravagant behavior. <br /> <br /> 3. Stalker's nonsense of violence that would kill any human being. <br /> <br /> 4. The "Suspicion" scene was no imagination. In particular, some scenes were extracted directly from American films. <br /> <br /> After all, it is just a decapitation nearer than the one that caused her. It is very bad for the filmmaker to leave the stupid end of the left field. <br /> <br /> They really should be ashamed of the Keys behind Say Yes. Better yet, they have to go to California and work with people who do work and quality and intelligence without movies.
