SAKURA KILLERS (1 + outta 5 stars) Perhaps, in 1987, this movie could look good ... you have never seen a good ninja movie. The music of the 80's in the cheese market ... the sad night ... the performance of the cartoon ... and the heavyweight martial arts sequences. One of the most beautiful scenes in the beginning ... with Chuck Connors playing golf on the beach ... many black-faced ninjas try to get in front of him and he seems to prefer to notice the ball ... Suddenly he enters his golf bag and ... naw, not I'll spoil you ... If you're sorry to see this movie, I'll thank you. The story is nonsense about a video that's nonsense or something. The bunch of heroes with a brilliant Caucasus have been trained in ninja mode, because they can "fight a ninja with a ninja" or train something like that. It seems strange that these guys do not have a better deal with previous training ... before the movie is moving pretty quickly. Fighting scenes may not be very good ... but there are many ... and excessive sound effects come out well.
