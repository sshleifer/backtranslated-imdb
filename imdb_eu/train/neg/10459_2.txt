Inappropriate script, unlit, bad atmosphere, poor photography and management ... it is very clear that the first effort made by commercial films made by the good TBN people is very clear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But "The Omega Code" is an unfortunate miscue. As a Christian who supports TBN and many of his programming and who love "China Cry", I still do not recommend this film to anyone. They do well with their ministry, but that's not an example. Do not waste your money ... rent "China Cry".
