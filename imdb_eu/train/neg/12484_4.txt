Woosh ??! Man ?? What can I say ... <br /> <br /> <br /> The opening scene maybe? We can see a series of Mongoloid-Barbarians jumping from the ruins of disasters. They enter the area and attack them with a innocent girl. The grandmother escapes, the Mongoloids continue, and one of them seems to be forced to rap, but reveals so much a breach and kidnaps her. Then dude (still running) sees a horse and tries to steal it. Suddenly ?? Apparently, there appears a divine hero with bad luck, "That's my horse!" Mighty Deathstalker made his appearance. When Mongoids arrive, Deathstalker kills (including fists) in the melody of the relatively poor western scores of Mexico (that is, Swords & Sorcery, which is 'arriba-trompettos'?) And then the Little Girl goes to the young girl and both breasts explains them He starts rubbing them and seems like a little girl. She likes her lips and falls in love with Deathstalker. When they arrive, this ancient old man could have stopped the end of a perfect Deathstalker day (and the end of a short film may be the perfect one). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tell me? Is not it a feminist that deactivates the movie, or the point that any other male viewer says: "It will be a good movie!" The earth is just as simple as throwing a kitten on the balcony: Deathstalker needs to get the sword of justice and steal the Amulet and magic quail from the evil sorceress Munkar. <br /> <br /> Aside from decapitations, dismemberment, random bloodshed, backward fist fights and a shame fighting sword, this film also features many t & t & flat $ I initially wanted to add an extra point for this movie for every nude boobie that I counted. After 9 points (not even in the middle of the movie), I had to refrain from counting it. He took me away from the movie. And he deserves the rest of the movie. Completely mad Look at these cats / worms that Munkar has as a pet and nurtures his eyes and toes. And here's an interesting question: What would you do if you would try to kill a man who would fit into a woman's body with a knife? The answer is simple: you're playing a bit, knocking knife and trying to rape it. Then you know that it is not really a woman, so throw him out of your bed and tell him to leave his room. It works well, I'll tell you. Deathstalker also makes Deathstalker-way the right way! <br /> <br /> DEATHSTALKER is a wonderful movie, as it has been shown in other comments. The evil are evil. Women are delicious. There are blood, sex, violence, rape and tasty chicken. There is no tournament without points. It only has a bunch of barbarians breaking and breaking down the trash cans that pull them apart. The favorite weapon used in that tournament was a wooden hammer, a bad raw material to overcome the bloody dough. And my favorite competitor, surely, was the only wilderness with Warthog-head (that is, a reminder of the guard at JEDI RETURN). I will not show how the movie will end, but it will tell you how to delight me to delight four-way demo film in the climate. <br /> <br /> And, of course, there is a wonderful display of Ineptitude throughout the film. See the guy who was dragged in front of a horse on the dirt road, and in the next view, the grass is overrun (no road). Watch this awesome tattoo on the head of the witch to change the sides on the same scene changing (throwing itself on the left and the other on the right side). Well, after all, Munkar is a magician. That's right, or this movie was shot in another universe, where things like "continuity" do not exist anymore. <br /> <br /> The other 3 liked me so much. In part of this series, I let it split enough enough so we do not let this film go by. However, I was ready to give me a minimum amount of the minimum amount, but I was able to get rid of some more points to keep the smaller segments. DEATHSTALKER CONAN may be delight, trashy and sleazy, as well as boring film.
