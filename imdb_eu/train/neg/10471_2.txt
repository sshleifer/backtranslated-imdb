Actually, the Omega code is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was sitting in the first 30 minutes to decide if I had to ask for a refund. But first, I did not see it paying (it was good), I thought it would be good for me. And I did not think it could be worse. <br /> <br /> He did that. Soon I will go through the bottom line (some spoilers enter): Casper Van Dien Gillen Lane's immense mess, motivating speaker with two doctors. The characterization was not consistent; For example, Lane, despite its credentials, is completely empty. Then there is a modest representation of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecy; The sound of new social soundtrack is visible along with the hilarious print on the computer of the translated Bible code. Also, the awesome "action" sequences: Lane runs out of difficult situations without explanation, and Lane seems to be in danger for a long time, it will become a dream sequence! This is very nice for grammar writing, but it's impossible to plot on the plot. Pacing was a bad thing: after a long opening, the movie changed the first third of every 90 seconds. Later, stimulation improves, but it is not necessary to overdo it too much. As someone else has said, years are still passed, but no one (even Lane's youngest daughter). That was confusing. <br /> <br /> But there are some good things. The quality of the film (for example, short grain) is high and very attractive. The exterior shots were well done and the location shoot was added to a realistic touch. Also, for a moment in the final movie, Lane calls for Lane to call God (at last) - this seems to me to be wonderful, even for me, as someone who does not accept Jesus as a personal savior. But I really liked being the only real scene in the movie. Unfortunately, it was incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Characters, conversation, direction and performance were completely wrong. Michael Ironside did not do anything, and Michael York was strange. I think that the producers wanted to do too much; If the earth were tougher and more rigorous, and if the characteristics of nature were more demanding, movies would be much better. <br /> <br /> In a word, it worsens the Omega code. Certainly, do not pay to see that. I give ** from ten stars. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
