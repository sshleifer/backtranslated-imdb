someone had to pay for the car ... this is horrible ... Jean Claude's cyborg disappears from the wind ... I could sue for an hour I could sue ... it caused me a serious drowsiness. ... of which I slept. how can this actor of this caliber cause this dog? I'd rather spend passing algae on the side of fishing boats than being scary of genres. I use DVD as an assembly now on my coffee table. More than $ 5.99 in Walmart is to be spent on this movie ... if you really need it, wait a few years until it's frustrated when you're not picked up and thrown in the store. br /> <br /> Please, let us stop the love of God that this movie died in the dark.
