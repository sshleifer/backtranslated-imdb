First of all, I do not know how to make the movie on the big screen. There is no small budget in the SCI-Fi channel, it's horrible too. Action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. I love them and my friends This movie was seen for me by this movie Transformers with dragons, mindless entertainment. We've got all that bad and we've got. CG was not as bad as I expected, but the plot was so huge as the play, he decided to do that. Basically a Chinese leggeline with 500 years of dragons ... Rain of Fire looks like a good version? No, he wants the horny to be deeper than the earth's plot with holes, but with magic, and a very small war between dragons (but large snakes). The director tried to add a bit of humor to the movie. I and my friends all laughed (with all the audience), and we could not afford to spend it for that. The short television trailer completes most of the rest of the action. I have seen B movies, Reptilian, The Cave, Spider and others, but you want to watch this one without a moment's laughter. <br /> <br /> Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Symposium: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I do not drink ... but it helped me watch this movie before
