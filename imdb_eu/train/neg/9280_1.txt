Honestly, I do not know what fun, this terrifying rematch or comments on this board. The master's criticism was tearful, so funny. In any case, the movie is among the worst movies ever, and definitely the bottom of the channels. I had the name "Omen" in the title and I saw the HBO this morning, but it is another three faces, especially the original. It seems bad at classically, but my favorite juggler is in the fireplace, at the psychic fair! good times! This movie is from the Omen series for "Scary Movie" for the whole genre. Avoid getting a good laugh.
