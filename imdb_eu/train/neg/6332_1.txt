When I saw the movie I saw when I came out, since I was a fan of SNL. When we watched my friends and me, people from the start show shouted: "Do not waste your money!" But of course we needed to know ourselves. <br /> <br /> There were some funny little things (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), but most of them could be very deeply edited. 1 hour fun show. It was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When Opera singer started, many people got up and left. This laughed me, I realized O'Donoghue's film had only been pressed by people's buttons. Otherwise, it was insane. Whatever you do not have time to miss, it's bad.
