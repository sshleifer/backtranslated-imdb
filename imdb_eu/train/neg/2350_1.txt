This show was laughably bad. A suck of writing, a sucked conversation. The guy that played Craig could not get out of rough paper. Being Thursday night was definitely a great sight to see with some glasses. Delightful music, performance, bad writing, came to interact with everything. <br /> <br /> It was a comedy / drama comedy. I do not like what happened to the characters, boring and boring. The first five episodes were the worst, because they could not reveal who was the victim, when they had to write that conversation, which was great. I mean that the fascination with that funeral was ridiculous. Actually, all the scenes that have happened today were horrible. <br /> <br /> So check it out. Everything that happens right now is sucked. He absorbed scenes, writing, conversations and Craig's flashback. Music decided.
