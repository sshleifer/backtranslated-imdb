After 50 years after World War II, the United States was in a state dominated by major economic interests that prevailed in the main sectors of the economy. At the same time, because of sketches and wars, everyone served or had someone linked to society. <br /> <br /> This enabled a mini-genre based on the American notion of ability. rugged military machine. Sometimes this machine was not a US military, for example, in a state of war in prison. After deletion, there are stories from other machines: science fiction and corporate, but this military genre always refers and, in fact, the testosterone action plan also mentions his comical brother. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I think maybe it started in comics, part of Amrican, "The Great Escape", immediately by TeeVee children "Gomer Pyle" and "Hogan's Heros". Then, "Catch 22" and "MASH" will launch the second wave, both of which were real life, then books and then movies, and MASH, then TeeVee. <br /> <br /> But before that, "Phil Silvers Show" was about the Sergente of Bilk and "Mister Roberts" continued. A happy man, committed to no harm, and then only responding to a complete gross system that tried to limit his life. That was the TeeVee show on the important day. You have absorbed them just to talk about how to take it to carry it. In any case, he was not very clever, excepting that exception in control and freedom. <br /> <br /> Americans were thinking of forgiveness as a great area, a lie in the military context, and a place where our political party was also here. <br /> <br> /> Because it's big size, sometimes it lacks. "Stripes" was a pretty fun one. They were really defeated by enemies who were under the influence of evil, sometimes as "fruggy" folding. And sexual adventure. <br /> <br /> Now, that is, before widespread cultural wars. It tries to touch this sweet spot, like Steve Martin's other remake-like manhanded ones. They're so inadequate, you're really going to make the army a stronger player. How to continue how to handle military power handles <br /> <br /> <br /> Ted's Assessment - 3 of 3: You will find something better with that part of your life.
