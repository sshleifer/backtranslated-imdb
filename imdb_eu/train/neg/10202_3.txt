Murder By Numbers is one of those films made for television, but not. Bullock is the only actress in any note, although it seems that Michael Pitt is making bigger and better things. It is not surprising that this movie quickly disappears from the memory to replace more important things. Like ... remember to block your door when you leave. Or when clothes go out, they put on their clothes. <br /> <br /> Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather with a police personal problem (not everything). With a new partner (Ben Chaplin wet), he is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. There is nothing curious about the fact that there are pairs of young perps when they think they plan and execute a perfect murder. As a result of the investigation, a testament arises between Cassie and Richie Haywood amongst the main suspect (Ryan Gosling). <br /> <br /> <br /> Here the problem is that there is no guilt. Bullock, though it's a very nice look, Rodney Dangerfield (really, it would be better!). The role of a hard-core cynicist is very credible. Chaplin, for his own sake, does not have the entire entity, and I feel that I feel that I need to put this film into his curriculum in the effort to enter Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt are supposed to be supposedly successful. As a portable one, they were not enough bad, a story that somebody sleeps and prevents (but is not false) to finish the film before filming. <br /> <br /> <br /> "Murder By Numbers" does nothing, but Bullock does not get rid of a bare scene. Well, a little but still not enough to save. Unforeseeable, predictable and redundant. This is a movie that does not carry out the genre of the police. Cassiek surely said, in his next case, there is nothing here. Move, move ...
