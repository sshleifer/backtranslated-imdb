That was the loss of time. Risk: If you see it, you will remove your DVD from the wall and leave it away from the window. <br /> <br /> An amateur job: a terrific, repetitive and empty conversation; paper thin line; wooden performances; Lucy Lawless was pathetically hateful. <br /> <br /> A serious, serious story, the characters are incredible. The worst case of cinema and television. These are: (1) twin wicked, (2) amnesia. No cry <br /> <br /> "Twist" on the plot? It's incredibly simplistic and obvious - a train that runs down the track in the middle of the day looks like a watch on the watch. It does not fix properly. The evil is not punished by original crimes. <br /> <br /> Please, please, do not observe this, even if it's free to go to a synagogue.
