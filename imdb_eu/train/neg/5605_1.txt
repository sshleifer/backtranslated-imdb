I was very bad about this movie. Thelma and Louise's friend's crime waited for more than one movie. Instead, this fugitive female prisoner had no loyalty to each other. Hiena was a very common group, one after another, one after another one, and even more in lesbian rapes committed to other films. escaping and finding money hidden, women who flee were selfish and evil, for a long time of mutual trust. These women did not release them. In the end, loose canoes can not respect themselves or go one after another. If you like anti-war movies in the 70s, skip this bomb and watch The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
