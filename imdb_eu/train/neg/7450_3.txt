Many years ago I watched the film movie in film, and one thing surprised me so negatively that I could not see the virtues to hang around: Dennis Quaid was never smiled or smiled as a police officer, as he smiled and smiled. two marks Danny Glover was bad, but again, the imagination of the audience is not enough to believe that role. Likewise, Jared Leto was not credible as a medicine study. The tension was not there because the murderer was very early on. In the end, however, it was not dramatic and tense: no one was thinking around me about what would happen to me. Everything we could wait for the movie was over. In the end, the desperation of the night in the cinema.
