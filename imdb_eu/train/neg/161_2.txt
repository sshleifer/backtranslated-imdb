If you imagine Mickey Mouse, Pimp on New York, or John Wayne as a communist spy, you would believe Pat Boone as a young Delinquency in Kentucky's uncle's farm, and you could enjoy this movie. <br /> This movie is so stupid, even if it's a love story for the mid 50's. And the problem is that Hollywood did not deny that the wife of Pat Boone's wife kissed the problem, which the viewer would not have allowed Shirley Jones to kiss, so she might not think of "screen consume". their love It's about seeing a western one, Cowboys does not see guns. <br /> <br /> The story is nonsense. The title song is also listened to with enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The worst part of April's Love film along with Ishtar and the 9th Plan.
