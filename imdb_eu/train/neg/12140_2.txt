It imitates a long title and finds ways to approach brands in the 90s. The beautiful set is one of the values ​​of Hamer's production, but it is an unexpected signal that struck the fog of Paris. This story is obvious and can be summarized in twelve words to prevent unexpectedly more than 5% of anything expected. <br /> <br /> Theater theater is heavyweight, the actors are as sticky as wax figures (well this is a Hamer feature, sometimes only better in the whole package). My conclusion: the movie is trash, which is not worth the time I spend in the afternoon. The eternal life is boring and I was hoping that the film makers of the film would be better acquainted.
