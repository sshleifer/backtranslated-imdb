In surprising apocalypse, the world suffers from double zombie and vampire plague, but it seems that no one is worried about this Grade Z film similar to Sheridan Le Fanu's mother lasagna. recipe Drunk guards still run gas stations and doctors still call home and the police are still helpful when radiator fluid appears when needed. Land, and I do not use that term, with "general" father and daughter, whose daughter is missing, she tries to break into a church to kill a vampire, very well, a father and daughter. I must confess one or two moments of genuine humor in the unpleasantness of the wide range of humor. The film also has enough nudity to be interested in 14 young girls. For the elderly.
