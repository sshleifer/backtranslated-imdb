We are here: arriving in the land of two remote worlds of the future ... it is desperate to preserve a life; The other is a machine that is a crucial part of eliminating the savage from removing a woman from a race. . <br /> <br /> So what can we call this murder machine? It's almost a kind of devastating or nearly eradicating ... a killer or something similar. What do I look for ... something that ends things? Hmmmm ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < be it Uhhhh ... "destructive" kills some mortals and steals his guns and clothes and then tries to find a woman in her workplace and looks at the threat of the eyes and tries to repeat his name with the threat. <br /> </> After a race of survival begins, it seems like death and an unstoppable exterminator, the pair gets out of the countryside. At some point, he can get boots and a motorcycle, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, at a wonderful end, he will steal under the wheels of a large truck-truck. ... acid. Then the truck will fail. They are saved ... but not! Then it will be created again, as strong as ever. He will kill the sponsor and get the girl in a meat packing plant. There, in a huge finish, it will penetrate a large part of the cutting machinery and definitely destroy it. <br /> <br /> But maybe I'm extrapolating too much ... After all, I stopped watching this movie. When Protector kisses Sean Young as he kisses a bar, he says he was born 3 days a child. <br /> <br /> Costumes and effects are very good in this movie ... I've loved to see Star Trek for the first time: Next generation! Sean Young plays a major role as a Replicant invaders, and sweat sweats by Stephen Baldwin is also Young's Fat Cop Boyfriend. If you are not sure where you would enter the plot ... can James Cameron be an importation of different films?
