I could not see the movie! So I finally got up and I was quite disappointed. For beginners, the film has said so little about New York, just a few confusing buildings, streets, bridges and cafes. Focusing on the magic of New York, it really is not. film set within this film. I know it's a remake, but it's not a French style. However, here you will see elements that remind you of French films, such as long, clumsy, unfamiliar scenes or, of course, everyone is burning to French! The story takes a lot of life (too much for my liking) and in the end it seems like a link. It seems to me that there was no dedication to the characters in the stories. The movie is short, so everyone can be happy. In any case, we can see about 30 minutes for about 5 minutes each. And you have 120 minutes! If you are interested in conversations and active scenes, this is not a movie for you! I love 4 I love New York and I love cast!
