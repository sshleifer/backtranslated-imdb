The third part of the film could have been cut off for ten minutes and without having to try the audience's patience (and resistance) <br /> <br /> I saw the movie Saturday morning afternoon. , with the audience of the film festival; A more adventurous type of crowd, in an interview with more experimental or atypical films, such as unexplained conversations, shorts and foreign films. Approximately 275 seats began selling crowds near the theater in the first half of the film and, while staying in the "big" majority (when it was not really), I've never been around for 14 years. At festivals, experimental, gay, and other festivals, they saw a lot of people coming out of a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has dropped more than half and was easy. Also, it could go in different directions, it was still shorter and much more effective. <br /> <br /> As it is nowadays, this is not recommended or something could be. want to see it again.
