The movie is boring, the characters and scenes are not realistic, incredible, ridiculous. This movie is a mess. It seems that the action begins in music, with the most visible breakthrough running. Or the voice was singing with Mr. McGregor or more, and he changed his voice. There are not too many conversations in this movie, and he's very bad at everyone's name. The movie is a great sleep therapy. The fight is wild. Eye Disease Modeling Disease Drugs was a Feminine Womens Drug. The bad man was a joke and his character was poorly developed. The main criminals were used to explain the story through the questionnaire, such as (SPOILER) "CTX (its designer's drug) will be a supply of water," he never concluded or even discussed discussing random batches. again in the movie This movie is highly recommended.
