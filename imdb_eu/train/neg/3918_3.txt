This movie gave me the greatest movie I've rented based on reviews of critics. In general, I only found this second movie. <br /> <br /> Leslie Cheung is definitely an anti-heroic way and Ma Wu handles his character with a cheerful ability. On the other hand, Ma Wu's make-up (facial hair) is false, because they are fake, and I can not take it seriously. It seems like an overweight teenager overweight with a $ 4.95 per bar. <br /> <br /> There are so many special effects, even if the "dead" barrel were pretty good. The tree language looked like a monster lightning stroke in the 1950s, though the POV resembled the skeptic look of Sam Raimi's "Evil Dead" last trilogy. Pyrotechnics were whirlwinds and the last fight was pretty dull. (In fact, he reminded me that "Lost Spaces" were caught in a stormy sand and ...) <br /> <br /> The plot was not original and it was said a lot. European fairy tale forms. There was no suspense and no plots. In fact, you immediately know the good character, who is bad, and who will survive. <br /> <br /> I sat down for a movie after I came back to Netflix. write a review. The first thing I did was check the day. Yes, it's been said in 1987 ... I did not think it in 1967. And this is quite summarized: production values ​​and FXs are common in the 60s. Plots and actions seem much older, because Hollywood produced some interesting films and challenges in the 60s. <br /> <br /> ** away
