Richard C. Sarafian's disaster struck the Japanese theaters before coming to the states and immediately threw them into the video. He never saw again that Turner needed more than infomercials until 3 to 6. ribbon at the bottom of his boat. The name Smithee is useful when the studio is extracted from the movie when the director does not want to retain his name. But I'm afraid Sarafian does not blame his studio. Actors, especially the most recent "Overacting 101", enter a line after another. The Earth is confused. Special effects do not stand out. Non-apparent parts are boring. The script or book had to be good - why would they otherwise agree with Palance, Matheson, Boyle or Heston? But something went wrong from the page to the screen. Summary: Avoid. It's not so bad that it's so bad.
