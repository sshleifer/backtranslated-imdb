If you want to know the true story of Wendigo, I suggest you get a copy of the original story by Algernon Blackwell. This movie was bad, but it was not related to the book. <br /> <br /> I had a movie based on a movie that I loved when I read the baby (EM Freeman's "Campfire Chillers") and was very excited. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. It's another thing on the computer ( Politically Correct) that excessive ringtones were not available in the movie. When the book was written, the PC did not exist. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is not to waste your time or money! If you see it in the video store, DO NOT HESITATE it.
