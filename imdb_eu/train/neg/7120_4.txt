I first watched this movie on MST3K. And despite having laughed at my back, I do not think this movie was very bad. It was probably difficult to understand that it was a very small budget, but there was a similar plot in Hitchcock, and I can say that when I saw the MST3K version I was really entertained. This movie is looking for a Hollywood remake.
