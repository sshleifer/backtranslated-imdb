After reading the good reviews about this film, I saw that it would be time to go. Well, I do not know why I worryed. Basically, this family is entrusted with carrying a huge old treasure hidden by the Temple of Knights in the War of Independence. Apparently, it was necessary to keep out of the British hands. First of all, why did the Knights raise the treasure from Europe treasure? How did he explain that Nic Cages was a 'Charlotte' boat? How are the traces and riddles that represent a minute? And how could two friends suddenly be the best robbers and rob the world that robs the world? Here are some plots of non-featured Hollywood pieces. Cage has participated in great events - 'Face-Off' and 'The Rock' - so why did this fall? Is it too old? His character is really annoying: in other words, this "ordinary guy" steals the Declaration of Independence, robs him of the robberies, the FBI escapes and generally seems invincible. The whole movie has not been meaningless and totally disappointing.
