Actually, they gave me a premiere that they lost me two hours, according to the fascinative opinions given by Steven Smith. Did they write their friends? The action is balanced, the music is hard and it is used, it's just the script and the actors (except gardener) in the best case. I think that we should help a young filmmaker, but when it says that it is not excellent, it will encourage the same mistakes again, that is, following its writing scripts and other actors. Yes, his first movie, a small budget, and so on. I have picked it up, but it is also worth buying it, and it does not fail.
