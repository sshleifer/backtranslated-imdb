Outer Space is a foreign short film that explores the black and white foreigners who explore the galaxy Gayniggers until they see Earth. In addition to being gay, the goal is to have a simple male universe, because people are gay. Therefore, those who live in the Earth when they know women or "women creatures" are afraid at the beginning; They eventually decide to eliminate all women and to release the male population. <br /> <br /> An abusive story, racist, homophobic and sexist story, but surely, as a satire, this film gives it a bad value. However, there is little substance under it. As another reviewer stressed, there are few jokes on the names of the characters (eg ArmInAss); I think he was laughing every time he laughed. I think I got the point of the movie quickly, the satire of the evil science fiction, but then I had enough; I wanted to finish the movie (and it's a short film!). It is not great or very written.
