(BEGINNING TUTORIALS) <br /> <br /> "Rosenstra√üe" is a movie about the heroic women of the Nazi era. But it's too long, it's not touching and sometimes too boring! There are several topics and there is not enough representation. <br /> <br /> Storyteller (story) is bad. As in James Cameron's Titanic, an old woman remembers live events. Good, we have a point now. There is also another woman. It's confusing to remember the events of others! Come on! This is about missing out on basic storytelling ... How can you know the fate of the girl's wife Riemann and her questions, for example? <br /> <br /> Scenes appear poorly sorted and you rarely know when it happened. For example, a scene proposed by Riemann Fabian. When did that happen? The scene appears in the twenties ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Riemann's character is a talented pianist, of course, even Baroness! Wow His brother returns from the Eastern Front, has received a "Ritterkreuz" in some scenarios. He is a war hero, and he is still a good man, who has kept his conscience. And he knew the massacres of the Germans. He also made some pictures! So clicking on the clicks is clicking and the movie does not work. <br /> <br /> Basically, von Trota's something that could have been a little movie. And in the end it's very easy. Riemann finds how to get Goebbels to bed - is it! - everyone is free. This is not a historical fact, but just imagination to claim the "true story" at the beginning. Like "Sass", the truth is based on an event. <br /> <br /> It's sad, but it's true, this is the typical German film this day. It's bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
