If this film is about a fictional character, the film can hold itself and objectively judge. Sadly, the viewer is based on the "events" that direct the film to Ruben Carter. Many of the smaller events were discarded (Carter is NOT a murderous hilarious at the time of death, there is no evidence that a friend had been keeping him from a child's molester in his youth), but some of the bigger events seem to have stolen Joey Giardello's "racist judge" It is impossible to see the fight against the tape and to those who are totally insolent Giardello. Why does Hollywood feel that a hero feels the need, problems, problems and much greater risk than ordinary people (they won women who were arrested more than once) is strange to me. Ruben Carter was never seen during the 60s and, at the time when he did not want to talk to his son, a person who can take care of people. Everyone knows that he can direct the Jews and Washington can play, but why they chose this story, because the vehicle is beyond me. Is Hollywood so much a need for a black hero to be credible for the truth to be folded in all their biopics? (Here is a suggestion that Denzel plays a movie about himself - hopeful inspiration now.) Based on all the details of the film, I'd like to move on.
