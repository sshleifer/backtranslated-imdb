Watch this movie? I thought a lot of garbage. These girls must be brains to make them a part of them. Looking at the loss of time, I only hire wonderful skies. The performance was below the standard and the story was unbearable. Anyone who is watching this movie save your money. The film has no credit. I'm a real movie buff and this is "Attacking Green Tomatoes." <br /> <br /> I hope you have only one piece of trash that does not cost much worse than done. Money would be directed to homeless people around the world. I just hope that there is a sequel in the pipe.
