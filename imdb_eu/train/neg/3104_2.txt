I have made several reviews on the IMDb, and this film is unique, I have never seen the whole movie. It was terribly foolish and insolent. I did not sit through it - although I tried. <br /> <br /> <br /> The main problem of this and Mel Brooks is called "Mel cozientea". In other words, the better the movie was, the less you would see in the movie. Imagine - Producers and young Frankenstein were great films and hardly any of them. BUT, movies like Life Stinks and Space Balls with Mel and nice movies (yes, I do not like Space Balls), but it's not the place to talk about it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, besides cancer, rectal itching and mental retardation, I can not think that the topic is not fun than homeless people. This is just a comedy breaker. Think of it, people. FUNNIEST (?) With the scene in the film Mel, along with Leslie Ann Warren in a robbery! And that's funny, how?
