The latest film by Johnny Weissmuller, "King of the Jungle", after 16 years of the film TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS, has no disappointment among his fans. At the age of 44, the former Olympian, one of the most active members of the Hollywood party, has had a relatively low athletics track record for younger athletes, and was tired (even though in the past, TARZAN AND HUNTRESS). . <br /> <br /> Not only Weissmuller was too old for his role; Johnny Sheffield, the "Boy", was a senior age (17 years old), so he wrote it as a screenwriter, with the excuse of "out of school". Brenda Joyce, at the age of 35, appeared on the fourth film "Jane" (the transition from Lex Barker Tarzan to the 1942 TARZAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN), and as always as sexy. > <br /> Sold by Lesser Sun, RKO, lower-case, cast and crew cheaper labor took place in Mexico. Although the location was decisive in the darkest part of the African scene, the veteran director Robert Florey used that country, including the cliff diving and storytelling in the Aztec temple. The young girl on the island (Tyrone), the future bride of Power Christian, Tarzan rescues in a river in the jungle, learned that almost all the local priests (George Zucco, the most persistent people in the film) threatened to pay for a "living God" they make an order. The girl became a "God" wife, so she fled. Can you say "this is a monster plot or what is it?", The priestly priestess of the Nation has kidnapped her and returned to the island, and Tarzan, then Jane, a Spanish-born "Benjy" character (John Laurenz's character). who sings many sings), and a government commissioner will take over the gods and their priests (the poor Cheeta remains behind). After some discoveries ("God" is just a mask of Aztec, dressed as a priest, who rides a rich pearl on the island), action brawling, and Benjy's comics and songs. Expected wonderful effect. <br /> <br /> Strongly, TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS offers a score of music by Dimitri Tiomkin, a movie that is much better than expected! <br /> <br /> While at the time of Weissmuller's film he would unhappy end up in Tarzan's loincloth (he immediately continued to play Jungle Jim, Ape Man's most eloquent, kaki). The talents involved took the general product more than the minimum mix upwards. <br /> <br /> Tarzan was trying to overcome and became much more sex ...
