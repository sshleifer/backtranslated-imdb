From the first moment, this "thing" is a very short blurry camera. Although the plot is for a thriller, the story is so bad that I can not buy it. From the middle of the movie, the actions of the characters do not make sense for me. Do not read now to avoid SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> For example, when Ed had a coffee after Edna had rolled his son to his arm, Edna's idea is that which is below the supposed experience; It's just stupid ideas. If Dominus does not question the fragmented orders of Claremont Williams, he reflects on me; Was not it long suspicious that they would be Williams? The FBI agents seem to show off all the melee of the outside mafia with a single helicopter. Additionally, if they save and spoil information on Cigliutti, it causes a great deal of murder; Justice is saying goodbye to me, if the FBI does research. In fact, they should solve a case when they act. We'll see an auto accident, usually at least seriously injured, even though most passengers do not die, but it all looks at a few of them with a blow. Conversely, the accident immediately follows when Domino makes love with Choco, that is, from the point of view of Domino, it is only generated by previous events, but it is drugged before the eyes. From the Claremont Williams phone, I'm going to see it as dramatic as I want. Combining this with a terrific and uncomfortable camera, he plays a piece, I call the movie. Sorry for the efforts of the main players, talent is doubtful.
