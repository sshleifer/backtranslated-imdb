I read somewhere a remake of the 1949 Noir movie "Criss Cross". The latter seemed like a disappointment, but it was better than this. <br /> <br /> This movie is a "neo-noir", which is today and color, two things that would purge the Purists for the situation of black cinema. <br /> <br /> In this respect, the biggest negativity was not cinematography (that was fine) but the story drawn. Hey, in the 40s Dashiell Hammett stories were similar, but I did not even look after some of them. Here the filmmakers did not help with the situation, in three minutes every time they seemed to flashback in the story. It is not surprising to keep this story. It was ridiculous! What happens with the 45-minute mark, so much confusion is not cared for by anyone. I know not.
