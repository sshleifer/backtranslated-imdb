This movie goes down from the fourth to the fourth, without working with numbers 3 and 2, through the grinding of the final b-film grinder. At the beginning, it is the easiest and most clear part of the movie. This is worth seeing. The Harlow scene happens in the bathtub so quickly, maybe it's lost. Without a doubt, everything is worth the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in the TCM intro, to this unhappy and medium confusion. There are no real conflicts, and all the characters in this rude society are saints - especially the incredible person, Al. I ask myself a job in Cincinnati?
