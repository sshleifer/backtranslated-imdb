Uh oh! Another gay movie. This time it is showing the black side. Bet your last dollar will be an unfortunate end! But why? If there are less than half a dozen exceptions, all gay movies must end their death or end their "addio". It is similar to the 40th, 50th, 60th and 70th European Film Festival. The head ... male or female must be killed or neglected only when walking. Why do writers, directors and producers need to allow the viewers in the name of God to let the theater feel? After all, it is supposed to be gay ... not rewarding. Perhaps a horrible film would be changed. It is a huge percentage of male relationships and couples get together with the sun! No doubt, anyone who writes or produces, only shows the bottom of gay life and gives a bad impression of gay life. I only show this movie. If you hire a DVD, take an antidepressant, it comes with a 'gay' movie that comes next! This is wrong!
