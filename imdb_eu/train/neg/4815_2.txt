Like most comments, I saw the movie The Witching, a title for the same. It seems that the original Necromancy is a better one, but I doubt it. Most of the witch's scenes still have most of the scene of necromancy and are still bad. In many ways, I think the nudity of the witch has added at least the value of entertainment! But do not be fooled - there are only 3 scenes with people standing upright and nuances. Diabolique rumpy pumpy is not involved! <br /> <br /> This movie is so terribly awful it's hard to criticize first. The horrible conversation is straight in the Troma locker room. At least Troma tongue is in cheeks. This is a live face bored. The play is changing with Pamela Franklin (a girl from Flondos who thinks Flora!) It's the worst with her high-screechy voice. Welles seems to expect her to pay her salary. The other woman's head is so frightening, so I do not know why she thought Pamela could trust her film! And the doctor is too bad. He also looks like Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> It looks like it's changing and editing without reason for movies that are not filmed. It's a copy and paste of witchcraft, which is not so subtle. The lighting is only ok. The sound is horrible and it is difficult to listen to a great new soundtrack that never closes. Mamu's mother is equally rough, but the actress is so funny that she is bad, at least involuntarily laughing in her performance. <br /> <br /> Really this movie (at least witchcraft) is only for the surprise. He can not be very absurd, because he's not quite strong and I was really boring! <br /> <br /> The best thing to do when they were throwing credits - they just said, just to make it better to say better to PRAYER!
