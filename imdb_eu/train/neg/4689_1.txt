Ted Tetzlaff's great director-made film director. Just enough looking for the movie, but a bomb-time movie without any tension. Ford, as he does here, even though his legs are shining, this is his distinctive smile. There are some details around the Canadian army or the RAF, a bomb confiscated war, left his wife - but none of these back stories are added. Bomber himself is a complete mystery. Why is it being thrown into the mines? Certainly, what time we're doing here? WWII or post war? This is the reason why the bombardment is even more noticeable. In general, it's just a horrible movie. There are many good bombs to denounce this. Check out the "Danger UXB" episode one of the most exciting around the same time.
