The story of this movie is very interesting and, in general, the plot is not so bad ... but the details: writing, directing, continuity, walking, action sequences, stunts and CG use a lot and breaks the movie. br /> <br /> First, action sequences. They are totally annoying. Most people stand up and shoot, running around the world all the time, fighting, avoiding or trying any time. Sequence in 2004 seems something bland. <br /> <br /> CG has a well-interpreted and animated effect, but they are used as cheap ones. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Pacing: everything happens too fast. For example, "Elle" is prepared to fight for a couple of hours, from the beginning to backstage, etc. Why is it so acrobatic? This is not explained in the film. Like Lilith, he would not have had to go back - maybe he could not have since he had wings. <br /> <br /> In addition, we have sequences like a car in the head of more than one car. , and rising and leaving the empty exit empty and looking at a mirror, then thrown into the throat, without apparent cause, and without the care of the spectator (and this is only one attack), he felt the effects of another explosive car ... "Are you okay?" He asks the driver "Yes, I'll be fine," says bloody and disloyal. <br /> <br /> I saw everything, however, because it told me that it would be an interesting entry ... but eventually I wanted to run Poverty at any other time: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, although the vampire was Jackie Chan, a comic relief movie That, they could interrupt my credibility, but the director wanted me to wake up. give the writer a good word.
