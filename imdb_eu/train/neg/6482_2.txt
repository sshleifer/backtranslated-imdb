Disney still has a movie that can track at least two tracks. And this was not a bad story to get people from Disney up for a quick exemption. In some way, although I did not pay for payment, I felt I was seeing. <br /> <br /> Ariel has grown up now and had a daughter. However, she does not allow daughter to enter the sea due to a bad threat caused by the deceased sister of the witch's sister. So we'll go again. <br /> <br /> Her daughter is deceived (of course) and she helps the sea witch. After a glorious battle, he has been defeated and mermaids and humans live in harmony. Yawn <br /> <br /> There is nothing to see. Return to life "D"
