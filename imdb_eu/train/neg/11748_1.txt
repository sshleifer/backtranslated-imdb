This movie has been the worst ever! The story of the language might be that if the movies were financed more and the writers cut me off the scenes of illness and disease, my parents warned me ... if they had it. If there's a kind of movie creator, that would create that. They reminded me of a lot of fast movies that were shot in the 1960's, with scripts and poor shooting. <br /> <br /> The only sensible characters in the movie were barman and bullshit. The rest of the movies could easily make the middle children. This movie gives me a rating of 1 because it's really awesome and I feel that I've completely misled my family. My advice-Do not see it !!!
