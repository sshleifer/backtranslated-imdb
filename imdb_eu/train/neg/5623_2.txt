Jack London's Hollywood adventure in "Jack London" is not a bad idea; undoubtedly, led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life. This movie, however, is stroked and seated. Most importantly, integrity is missing. Michael O'Shea (like London) has several lectures in London; and it's nice to have his bearded Jack, "Wild of the Call", after a bit of quality in the snowy mountains, with his dog "Buck". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very nice. The film draws an unhappy "Yellow Peril" between parallelisms in London's life and World War II, strained and insulting. <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (2013/11/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
