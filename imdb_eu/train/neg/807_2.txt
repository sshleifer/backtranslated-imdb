I did not expect much from this television movie. You need to have a smaller TBS movie bar than any of the protagonists of Antonio Sabato Jr. However, bad film has not been disappointed. <br /> <br /> Each scene was Rote, someone who linked some dozen movies and TV shows to the script that is related to business conspiracies, looks back at "My job is done". It's all about Klix's, all predictable, and even worse, they make it look like the actors are serious (even when the plot is a huge development). <br /> <br /> Please, do it for yourself. See if you want to make paranoia "X-Files" They manage better. Also, let's find out that someone is "serious mistake" sitting there.
