IMMORTALIZER, it was interesting. Certainly, he did not kill me for hours and a half, but it did not make me even amazed. A mutant mutant has strayed on the streets of the extreme streets (a scene that convinces a smaller headless headless film) and leads them to an elegant suburban house. Here, Dr. Divine and his team are doing brain transplants for rich, brain-rich people so they can have young bodies back. Hey, this is a calmly remade big budget a few years later as a FREEJACK! Who did you know when transforming the body of an old person into another body when his new voice is like his old voice? With all this talk about the use of pineal glands and bright green serums, you can watch the BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR productions at the head of the show. Production literally is not daring to get out. I never understood why, when someone makes a low-budget horror film, they do not fit into the edge of the frame with a gore. The play is uniformly horrible, Dr. Clarke Lindsley As a good price contributor. She laughed badly. The only thing that warns of THE IMMORTALIZER is that many older people do their stunts. Actually, the majority of the cast takes old people into serious blows.
