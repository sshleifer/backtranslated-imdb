The movie is so horrible. So bad, I can not afford to spend a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it's horrible. <br /> <br /> All the details of these crimes are not renewed correctly. Slaughterhouse footage. Rare cuts and changes. Plot no continuity. The play is the most beloved I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A bomb of a movie, of course, was in charge of making some money for the accuracy of its content. Camera work focuses at all times and always shakes. He seems to have filmed the video. <br /> <br /> In fact, now, when Dennis Rader lives in jail, they put men who carried this horrible movie to prison. . <br /> <br /> Really, do not think about watching this. I can not give a negative star.
