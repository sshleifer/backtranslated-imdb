Okay, first of all, I did not sit down to see the premiere of the "Star Trek" series, flying a cowboy in space. Thus, how an ordinary Enterprise Activity happens <br /> <br /> 1 Archer finds its nebula or its lines and looks closer but can destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2 sends a bus into the nebula and a shuttle is damaged ... <br /> <br /> I've seen all the episodes All problems arise due to the stupid mistake of Archer. Did you see the preview of a section that Kissed Archer and T'pol?!?!?!?!?!?!? I wanted to see this section, but then I totally gave up on Enterprise and I went directly to the TV. Come on !!!! This is a star trek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Also what was it with a banana slug ?? In a passage, Hoshi had a plain banana, but he had to leave behind the stupid reasons. Okay, a little boy in the space to bring a pet slug, but whatever. I thought it was good, until they left in a desert planet !!!!! BANANA PURPOSE DOES NOT FIND DESERT !!!!!!!!!!!! How do these writers work <br /> <br /> in any way, just say: Enterprise on DO NOT NOT WATCH IT !!!!!
