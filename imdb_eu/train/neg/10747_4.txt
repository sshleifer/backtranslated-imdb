Camp Blood III is a great improvement in Camp Blood II; Because it is mostly in a good place and in a sharp plot. This time they get farther from the parking lot, the other two movies are shot, it's a good move and you can no longer hear a remote desert listening to the cars of the past. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> This is not nearly a new idea, I have seen at least three other horror movies, the same premise that the real murderer himself has, but at least this one has a plot, instead of people who randomly touch a knife. > <br /> Unlike two other series, that is, at least, it lacks little. I like what I like about how to start a sound effect and how someone gets angry when it comes to people like ghosts. <br /> <br /> I do not know why they would like to make the third Camp Blood movie, I think it would be better to start from scratch, but at least they tried to do it. A half-naked female deformity was much more for me. It seems that they keep track of their clothes, because their clothes took 5 dollars as a second movie. They still do not think they were not cut a sack, but it's a Camp Blood movie, what do you expect? If you like drunken movies, you'll have fun.
