Let's start with simple lines. On the part of the audience, there are "good director details", some of the most beautiful films. Special effects are good enough, good performance and good scenery. But the story is very easy. An elite army shares how the unit of the team shows up and sometimes dies. It shows the war drama of life. When my movie's experience was serious about "serious addiction," I missed that click that stuck my eyes and my head on the screen. It's good to say that one of the things that must be presented in a movie is good for the viewer's capacity to immerse himself in the reality of the movie. I did not happen. I was "conscious" because of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> By honestly speaking, I believe that this film has earned its reputation as an "unconscious" appeal of American patriotism, a feeling that is healthy and genuine, but it is not appropriate to create a film reputation. More than one movie about war, on the basis of enrichment. <br /> <br /> A simple thought: the second world war or I was a movie, changing time only, everything would remain the same. have you given it to me? Sure not Why? Because they are excellent people who are getting up there. <br /> <br /> Compared to the rewards of the Oscars, I do not think that all the winning prizes have been awarded well.
