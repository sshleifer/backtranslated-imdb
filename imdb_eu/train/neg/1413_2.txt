I love Morgan Freeman. Actress Paz Vega is attractive and attractive. I'm sure there's a good movie like that. It's nothing. Short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes long. After an hour of frustration I searched for the remaining 20 minutes. Horny <br /> <br /> Freeman plays an actor, who has not worked for a while and could play a part in a supermarket. He visits the supermarket that works. Nothing happens. He has decided to go home and go for a car wash in Arby, Target. Nothing happens. They talk about life. Nothing happens. Never <br /> <br /> I do not get it. But I do not get Bill Murray "Lost In Translation" and "Broken Flowers" movies too. If you like these movies, you might like this one. Many people find such extravagant, charming movies or - for the reason they escape - they find a wonderful conversation. In the movies of this episode, the ordinary device is a long stop / silence after a line that wants to be a significant actor. We know it's significant because there are no two minutes on the screen. Sorry, I must be a Philistine. I do not know. For me, these types of films are not funny or charming or thoughts. It's boring. Why? No comedy It's not a drama No tension No laughter There is no suspense. It's not an action. Seeing anything In short, I do not even go to the movies. It can be free of charge. In real life I see some extravagant and extravagant characters. I will go to Target and I will clean and fast-store restaurants. These items do not film, even if the stars do things. I pay for entertaining to pay. <br /> <br /> If you're mad at Morgan Freeman and want to hear nothing about it, have fun. If you want to go through Paz Vega, you can look and listen. But nothing happens, I promise. Total snoozefest.
