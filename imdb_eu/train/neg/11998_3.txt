This is a horrible and horrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> first, long TOOO. The longest movie I've ever watched. <br /> <br /> Stories Is Exaggerating Mostly !!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> comedy was not a comedy !!!!! it was not any fun ... <br /> <br /> the story is so foul and misleading that characters do not matter if the characters live or die ... <br /> <br> <br> <br> I had hopes ......... but my expectations failed completely in the first minutes ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie The only thing that was good about MUSICA was ... and, of course, Vidya Balan. gives the best play and stands out among all the elderly actors ... it's just new, but it still shines and the rest of the pieces seem so pathetic !!!!! Govinda and her Blonde also help her to love her love to save this harmful movie. Govinda agrees with the driver's role. and Blonde also gives a very subtle and consistent performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A talented actor, Ayesha Takiya, completely wastes this movie so priyanka is !!!!!!!!! Akshay does his job well, but it seemed too high !!!!! Anil and Juhi are totally wasting ... <br /> <br /> All this is an impossible film with the mystical script and TOOO Masla, that story is based on stupid comedy scenes. Imagine how stupid this movie is !!!!!! <br /> <br /> 3//10 is four long hours !!!! Think about it and come to RETHINK before going to the cinema !!!!! better avoid !!!!!
