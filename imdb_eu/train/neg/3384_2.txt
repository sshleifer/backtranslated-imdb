If you only had a movie-based trial, the "A Chorus Line" Pulitzer Prize and Broadway's 15-year Broadway Broadcasting Committee were given a lot of heavy narcotics. This film is definitely NOT. <br /> <br /> Everyone who finds out that Richard Attenborough could imagine that it was suitable for this material absolutely mestifies me, but it almost completely makes music about the movements on the screen. an earthenware component. <br /> <br /> With the original partition, there was no content originally written, someone decided that the movie really needed something to give the movie. So, Oscars (!) We're surprised by "Surprise, Surprise". Surprised, surprised, sung, and even a movie. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
