I do not like children's films, but this is not just a few gadgets. M.J. Fox Stuart was a great voice and the rest of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie can be fun, but this is not an option in the movie. It's sugar-coated sugar and does not look like it's nearly 7 years old. See Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or instead of Shrek. 3/10
