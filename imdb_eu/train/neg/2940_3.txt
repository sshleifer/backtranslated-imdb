When I saw this movie very little. Far more, it's one of the most curious films I have ever seen. Now, usually, I like the extravagant movie, but it's been too much. <br /> <br /> There is no movie plot. In any case, it starts like Toy Story, where the toys live, and Raggedy Ann and Andy start their new friend, Babette. From there, madness happens. Greedy, Looneys, a boat called Gazooks, and a bunch of pirates singing melodies of shows, all of which are just weirder films. Also, I can not feel it, but I feel that Babette is annoying and it's a bit stunning. He certainly did not help the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, even if you did not like the movie, some pieces were cute. I liked the camel's song. Although she was a song of loneliness, she felt a delight. Then Sir Leonard was there. Although most of the Loone were common walnut, Sir Leonard was very interesting and probably more entertaining. It was Kubi Koo who looked like a bad-looking Koo Koo doctor. It was also Raggedy Andy's song, No Girl's Toy. Without a doubt, it was a good song for boys who wanted hard work. But to be honest, these things did not make the movie any better. (But remember, this is from my point of view.) <br /> <br /> Personally I would not recommend this movie, although I have to admit it, it has its charming moments. See if you're interested, but if you're willing to do something "really" as usual.
