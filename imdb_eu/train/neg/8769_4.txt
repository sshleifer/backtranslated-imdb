This is a movie I can suggest to my American friends. But after 4 attempts to watch the movie, I knew I could not see this closed thing. You are almost certain that the real war is not long. Others question my patriotism to criticize such a movie. But flat, you can not go to Save Private Saving Ryan LOC. Forget movie inequality or viewers - prevents a director from making the movie intelligent. The duration of the films is not so bad and repetitive, they attack the same hill but they give names. I thought the LOC pitch was horrible - this hill seemed like my backyard. Sequences for the character development (soilders' flashbacks, before looking at their last moments, before being disseminated) must have been throughout the film, not just in a long memory. I still have to finish today. But the movie was better (not much said) called Border.
