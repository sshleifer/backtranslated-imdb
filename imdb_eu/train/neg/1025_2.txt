That's the only question I am. Why did he suck the movie when he had such a great deal of time? Why was it so bad that it was written so that the audience did not leave the characters completely connected? Why was not it any sense? Why did the studio take good premises and "Hollywood" when all this was necessary, that it was a smart, intelligent story? Why? I never understand why movies begin when they are released when they are released. For the sake of Freeman Spacey, I hope that Oscars have never been released to big American shows. <br /> <br /> As a person with a graduate degree in journalism, the whole story is absolutely horny. I just ... I guess the script had a potential, but the execution became a topic and that's why it was horrible. Just Zk
