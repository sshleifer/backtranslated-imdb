See where you start ... acting; I am not sure I would call this because it reads more according to the unpredictable script. The actors also did not seem in their sections, and seemed quite alive and quiet. Make sure one or two scenes were not nudity, but this could not save this movie for disturbed characters. <br /> <br /> The rapero's main character is insulted for the people who really make it. The letters were rhythmless or flowless and looked like lines of nonsense. <br /> <br /> Quote? Has this movie also been a quote? They seem to have used less money than I've seen on a YouTube home video. Bad lighting, playback, sound post-production. Bad special effects, if you want to call them. The story might have been good enough, people seemed interested in doing so, but life was not life for that; I do not care who directed it. <br /> <br /> Last year I saw very bad grooves and this is definitely at the bottom. Do not waste your time or wish to hear this review. Check the ratings, you will see that the 1 functions are exceeding 10 fluffed, almost nothing short. I wanted to look a little closer to losing time. What is the taste!
