Can anyone make CGI good movies apart from Pixar? I really told him that the animations were outdated by the 2006 rules and the 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe Hugh Jackman spent the whole budget. Regardless of reason, the story really sucked. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Hugh Jackman is a rat - a radio that broadcasts a toilet. I know, it seems stereotyped. But then the sewer London imitated the path - partly. You'll get the promise of the jewish booties (????) and the evil (??) frog and a pathetic attempt at entertainment. <br /> <br /> I would like to have something entertained. Maybe the movie link? Or perhaps a happy rat relations. But nothing was done. He had a talent, but he started wandering. D-
