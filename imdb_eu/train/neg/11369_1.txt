That is pretty ridiculous, I hope there are a lot of people around the US, the US and around the world around Muslims. Religion has more than one million followers. I'm a native of America and I'm a job and I've been taught through religious teachings and classes to help bring my country and society. I am dedicated to the descendants of my religion and my teachings, so that I can translate into the world of education and training to achieve success in education. I know a lot of Muslims around the world and have traveled to countries such as Pakistan ... I have to find somebody who thinks we should hurt or accept other religions except the people in the media ... why ... It's also sad These extremists are those who use the media to represent the whole religion. It is a million people religion, and less than one percent. I am sure that other religions do not like KKK, IRA, and many other similar, obsolete and old-fashioned figures that are represented by many others. respect literary passages from books to their revelation, who call oneself or their business-making religion
