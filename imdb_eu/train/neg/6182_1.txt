This movie has a Robin Hood costume, which probably does not replace Robin Hood, a man's boy, and excludes all of his personal belongings. This movie blames Wendy for stupidity. And the captain's poor Hook is a full clown. And, of course, all Disney cartoons have to have a character with too much head, they made a lost boy. The only character that is not ashamed of this movie is Tink. The only star is for him. <br /> <br /> The story itself? Darling's parents do not even realize that their children have disappeared. Probably one of the most significant points of the original story and it was damaged! There is also a famous nursery scene between Peter Pan and Wendy. There are no hedgehogs or bums. This original story is very unique. It is surprising, even, he lost his shadow and helped him stick to it. (Although he has his shoes and does not make sense for me.) <br /> <br /> The destruction of such a great story should be legitimate for children to be amused. So, know if you do not know it before - this version of Disney does not have any significance with the original story - that is, it's not really a story for children, but a wonderful and great story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is just annoyed me at the end.
