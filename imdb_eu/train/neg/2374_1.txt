Actually, they do not, but definitely trying to think of a special line when summarized briefly by this series entry. There were a few moments that could have been good, but they mostly became a lost opportunity in their searches, and I did not start badly. <br /> <br /> The missed options are quite obvious, but I'll shorten them if anyone cares about it. Anyone who has not seen the movie is really recommended to stop reading at this time. The first and potentially unnecessary option was Freddy's long-lost plot with his child. Now, I am threatened by Freddy's severe mental illness (and I can abuse people with fewer than those who have a mental illness), HEREDITARY is why the mystery type slasher Lisa Zane's character Freddy does not dream of killing the young but later murdering is it just knowing we're doing everything? Do you think land is a good idea? Of course, he was above Talalay's and De Luca's heads. <br /> <br /> Then there is a trip to Springfield. In it, the total population of adolescents has been eliminated and the rest of the adults have a kind of psychosis of mass. Pretty enough, he said, the mass psychosis was depicted in a realistic and convincing way, although this is quite reasonable, we're never too much to show. For our understanding and uncontrolled reasons, we provide quick explanations of the massive connection with the reality that can happen to the pain of each young person who dies. The key issue of this land is, however, that the town is too fast to leave and without a response. This collection of scenes would be far away for ten minutes ... to explain the honest citizen to visitors, why showcases Springfield's horror show. <br /> <br /> Of course, horror films are never mentioned. For the development of the characters, unless John Carpenter directs a horror film, but how do we really kill it is not the person who knows anything that is dying? Wes Craven at least took the time to set up the original characters and used a few tricks to draw the audience. In a nutshell, it's probably the biggest problem with Freddy Dead: he just tried it all, let it be hard enough. <br /> <br /> I feel like I feel with Robert Englund, now that it is more related to Freddy's nature. He has played much better in the best products (for example, the "V" science fiction ministry), and the man who played "Freddy" always gives it a fair amount of time. It seems that the mold of horror films will never break. As for the rest of the pieces, I think their performances are here. They are worth less than a template for less than horror props in B. Although Yaphet Kottok does not escape, that is, his character is written in the history of B movies. <br /> <br /> At last Freddy's Dead got me one. I would throw it down, but this does not support the IMDb. FD is truly a testimony to how a writer can make the most use of a concept, not only an impossible film, but also a complete franchise.
