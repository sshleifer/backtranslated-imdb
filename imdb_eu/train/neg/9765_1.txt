I do not often distribute "ones", but if there is a film that deserves such attention, "Gas!" Da This is a trivial car that comes from the M * A * S * H ​​atmosphere, and the flat one drops out. <br /> <br /> I see what he will do in Cormo - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to play Gould's death without a similar plot in the original version of M * A * S * H ​​("Whiffs" - See here on IMDb, http://www.imdb.com/ title / tt0073891 / for more information). <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould brass ring were closer to "Whiffs" than Corman did with "Gas!" but it's not reached. One of these films is not the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> What happens "Gas!" -With it? What is not No one approaches it in a role-play performance. Presumed production values. He mentioned the other person who reflected the light here, regenerating magic, and is missing more detail. Nothing is done in this film as it is supposed to be, and nobody cares. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" he really slept. It is not safe to cure insomnia, but very close. Sleep Induction on the scale of the cinematic "Gas!" "The last year in Marienbad" and George Clooney falls into the version of "Solaris" (that is, Mosfilm was more boring than the original, who intended to adhere to the sensible publication of the audience's attention in the studio). <br /> Editing the guy "Gas!" About twenty minutes. The result would be significant, but more than the original movie. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad, but they have a compelling quality worth watching. This is not one of them. Do not waste your time. It's not fun too bad.
