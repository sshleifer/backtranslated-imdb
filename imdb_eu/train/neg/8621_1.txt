The previous poster, of course, made the movie. It's a joke that's bad and nobody would have done this as it did in reviewing this type of film. All the names of the actors and what they were up to date are a kind of relationship. <Br /> <br /> Cinemax is right now and I was sure there was a movie where the star (Ava called the most beautiful and beneficial one) had something to do with a crazy tax. <br /> </ p> <p> Additionally, when I first saw it, I was sure that it was done in 1986 and I was born in the 73's, so I thought I was talking about it ... but it was ... it was made in 1993! Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> Although it was so bad I called one of those films. It's like watching the train's disaster.
