It never surprised me to take a great actor and cast it into such a movie. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but he did not save the movie. Indeed, his character is similar to what he played in Cape Fear, which is really good, but I can not stand up when the actors perform in more than one movie. I think it's getting older, and that's what happens here. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly in this movie, but the story has been said a million times before. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player, and he thinks it's a character in his character. De Niro plays an obsessed fan, but his role in this film is not entertaining. <br /> <br /> However, because De Niro is a movie, he makes a raffle if you are an enthusiast (if he fails.) who sees everything that he does. But to see De Niro's best, see "Midnight Run", "Goodfellas", or "Cop Land", or even go back and look "Taxi Driver" or "Godfather II." Do not waste your time with your driver. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10
