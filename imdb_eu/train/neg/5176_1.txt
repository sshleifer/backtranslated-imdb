When the movie is independent and not rated, such as Hamilton, I expect from the rules, cut off your heart's violence. I know that good movies do not always have blood and violence, but I have read opinions, visited the website and even persuaded my friends to pay $ 9.50 instead of watching me scary. When there's a Horrorfest festival, I'm afraid of it, not with Dawson Creek's non-ravaged ones. My expectations were very small for this film, but the movie was filmed by the slightest hopes that we shot at the hell before we had left an hour before leaving someone's finger. There were too many pitfalls and they left too much imagination. I'm sorry for Happy Feet. I think maybe it could be violence and gore in Hamilton's movie!
