I read somewhere that this movie is supposed to be a comedy. after seeing it, I would call it. The point of this movie is not escaping. The conversation is very superficial and nonsensical, many of the groups seem to be the following thoughts, and despite nudity and implicit sexual content, there is nothing erotic about this film ... it asks me what this hell is all about. ! The premise of the title can be a fun comedy (if it's politically incorrect). instead we have treated cheap, amateurish, finished sketches, depravity and extravagance on their own. I want to buy grace jones cd.
