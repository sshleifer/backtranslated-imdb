Err ... sucked the movie. Many <br /> <br /> I have read other reviews. It seems that a lot of people think about Woody Allen's things that can be written or starred automatically ... <br /> <br /> I've seen several movies, because there's a lot of hope in vain. But no, they just suck. Bad litter The characters are very stereotypical (but stupid). It's earth ... I think they think it's mysterious. You do not know that. Mr. Allen's character ... is Woody Allen, counting on his other movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Woody Allen, go to this movie. If you are under 50, do not worry. (If you are a fan of Woody Allen. If you are under 50 under age ... well, you're strange. I do not know what to say.)
