Pathetic ... worse than a bad TV movie. I can not believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this movie. For some reason, Morgan Freeman's character is constantly speaking and says "pussy" about NSync boy girlfriend. Morgan Freeman calls her a "pussy", it's just hard ... What the hell was in the movies behind this movie? In addition to suggesting excessive nuisance suggestions, the camera's angular angles, generosity manuals, generous and precocious music music, this movie was absolutely unbearable. <br /> <br /> I've rented small flop hopes ... but. .. well ... it really sucked.
