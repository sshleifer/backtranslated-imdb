I'm a fan of David Lynch. This movie, however, has been a desperate experience. In addition to surrounding music? What really sets the movie mood? I have almost all the features I have come to meet Lynchen. The visuals are blurred, at least, and the dialogue is vague and monotonous to make it interesting. <br /> <br /> This tries to make a film as a bad student, trying to make an art dogma movie by a director of experience rather than work. I have watched amateur movies, landscapes, sound and scripts with amateur movies. This film has almost artistic qualities. As I'm watching one of the Davids home videos, I feel like I'm traveling with friends on weekends.
