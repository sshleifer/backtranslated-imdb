I put this movie into the hotel to enjoy my morning children home, I removed all the toys. (Kids do not like "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View".) At four o'clock I found a scene fun, but the rest said it was "very stupid." This is four years old, people. Anyone over nine years old wants to kill their TV, just to let them play it. <br /> <br /> Saying this bad movie is like saying that the Holocaust is a bit of a mistake. This "movie" is not really a ridiculous and overwhelming word. The play is awful, the plot is stupid, and the script is not very curious. Being a comedy implies that filming evil can not make you laugh even worse. Bronson "Balki" is the worst Pinchot with a strange false accent (like Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun), but all the characters are horrible. At that time I did not see a true movie by Laurel and Hardy, but I know it's a better way than that. What do you want to ruin a classic comic duet with ...? <br /> <br /> Bottom: bottom line. Avoid at all costs unless Bronson Pinchot is a huge fetish. 2/10
