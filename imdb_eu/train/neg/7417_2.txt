This is a very bad film - interviews, storytelling, actors and actors - everything! - It's hard to imagine that we will see a worse movie this year or in the next few years. "Love's Brother" (located in Australia's Italian immigrants) offers only topical Italian culture news, and it is well-known that both Italians and Italians speak Italian. The message from the movie - to marry the ugly person to marry an ugly person, the beautiful people must marry the good people - it is really painful. Giovanni Ribisi is pretty good in "Suburbia" or "Lost in Translation", but here's a pseudo-Italian accent. Watch this movie at your own risk. Trash to Trash!
