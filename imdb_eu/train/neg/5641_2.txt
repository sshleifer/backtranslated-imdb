Predictably, the story has been telling us thousands of times among traditional drama, some beautiful and magnificent sex scenes mixed with a paranoid character, a horrible horror movie violet in the 70's, sometimes comical. I could not scream myself. /> <br /> I like Defoe in general, and it is important to say that the performance is not too bad, it's time to develop a "plot" at a reasonable pace and continue to guess from time to time. That's just a very predictable, but I felt that I was doing a new TV show instead of watching. Maybe the director is the style he wants, but the version I read before seeing the movie can only be said that a reviewer can write his own production. <br /> <br /> I do not expect too much, and if I throw the clock, I could not see it in the cinema. I was waiting for the postings in your video store, I'm sure they do not have a long time.
