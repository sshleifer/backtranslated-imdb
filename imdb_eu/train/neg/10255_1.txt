Christopher Lee has giant bank computers that make up the 1970's television noises, which appear on the screen, have radioactive isotopes that do not shine in the dark and emit sour harsh noise. the evil aliens disguised as monsters! boats! earthquakes! burst the cars! blast coffee machines! and as a climate, the entire planet is broken. How could this movie get too enthralled? The answer, my friend, is that it sets 90% of the film's shots, most of which include long tracks, pans or zooming on cameras, or occasionally three, that is, they do not make a crew. The endless shots of our protagonists drive, they leave and leave the cars, they drive again, walk around, drive cars and drive ... I sat down when I saw anything strangest in the endless parade. Someone just said something ... DO something ... anything ...! "" <br /> <br /> The conversation, when it's reached, is horrible. <br /> <br /> "Maybe a few minutes are measured on a different scale". It was usually a senseless line. The script destroys the world in stock, justified by Lee's speech, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < "<br /> <br /> This is the writing of the Neanderthal SF, which is a type of motivational type of Japanese movie theater gear for 7-year-old children in the 1950s, since Buster Crabbe retired, is the most divine line in the English SF movie, I gather things. It's worth mentioning that this movie was released in the same year as the Star Wars and the Close Encounters. <br /> <br /> Lee, who has become a smart and well-known actress who knows his limit, gives his lines to kill his agent. I intend to enter this pile of piles. I do not blame.
