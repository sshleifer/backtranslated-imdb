It is absolutely incredible to me that anyone can comment that this film is not preaching. It is not very oppressively preached, but absurd, stagebound, remarkably straight-jacketed, and painfully overwrought. Apparently, it feels like an 8-year-old boy who feels "becoming a fascist" on the blackboard, 100 times. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that it was done altogether. According to World War II, Hitler wanted to be a courageous rejection and was a terrible suffering (anyone could happily apply it) and I am sure that he has captured the mood of the day. But in a damned way, it is clearly presented as a sledgehammer, as an artwork abysmally fails. <br /> <br /> Here, Paul Lukas performs a good performance that honors and gives him intensity. an antif fascist, a role as heroically relaxed; and Lucile Watson's grandmother is a wealthy grandmother, and she is aware that she has slowly become the world. Although non-radical education is subject to all sorts of difficulties, children are shown as a robot in a silent way. They are not real men who are remotely similar. And Bette Davis, a great actor, every time I was on the screen had an unbridled nobleman. In all his words, every gesture that his husbands himself must do, and what he is doing, and what he is doing, in the KAUSE IMPORTANCE, and what he understands, should be a cable to receive a painful electrical excitement. He admits the doubt or shadows of his portrait. <br /> <br /> So, yes, this very important movie, but not very good.
