What I'd probably like about the new Star Wars movie "Phantom Menace" will blow up the "Titanic" out of the water if you forgive pardon for devastating boxes. office receipts, thus eliminating from the first position. Anyone who says "Titanic" is the greatest movie I've ever seen at every time I hear it, I think "You do not see a lot of movies, right?" What a travesty You can make 50 good films that are much better than "Titanic" and for the same price. <br /> <br /> "Well, he won many Academy awards, he really loved a lot of people." someone can say in his defense. Well, many people like Spice Girls and millions and millions of people eat at McDonald's, but this does not mean high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans may be wrong. <br /> <br /> I confess first, that part of the problem was the mega-hype of the movie. I waited for a month or so and, after all, he was not faced with previous expectations, which paid more attention to the stupid love story. True, "Phantom Menace" will most likely get a fate. but <br /> <br /> James Cameron's "Titanic." a) Short film of the young act. b) Three-hour epic trailer with the best moments. c) A love story beyond love or entertainment. d) something that is preferred to documentaries, I'd like more. e) The arrogant movie in accordance with the level of the actual vessel. f) I will never return 3 hours of robbery; Therefore, it is the greatest motivation for a time machine. When I know someone you have not seen yet, I say, "I can trade with you at the place." g) Any face that is a victim of facial hypothermia. How long do we think people can get immersed in cold cold water and still complete comprehensible sentences? h) Fortunately, a film that has not been accepted for theatrical achievement at the Oscars. i) technological achievement of cinema and a few other things. <br /> <br /> The only reason I publish this as an anonymous comment, I definitely do not welcome 10,000 thirteen years for the rejection of Leonardo DiCaprio fans. Come up with his defense, and I'm not really interested in listening to Titanic's story, interpretation or long-term defense.
