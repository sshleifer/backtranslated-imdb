First of all, to see my taste in film ... <br /> <br /> I liked 2007 comedies: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Glory Of Glory <br /> <br / > 2007 Comedies I was hated: Evan Almighty, Solomon Brothers, Good Luck Chuck <br /> <br /> I had to follow my first year and turn off "Hot Rod" after about 20 minutes. At that point he knew that the movie was not laughing at all. The script is totally wild - I do not know how to get this monstrosity on the 6th. Anyone with over 10 years of age who has enjoyed this must be defective. <br /> <br /> Nothing comes with Will Farrell, and it's clear that Andy Samberg can not do anything more. 5 or 10-minute draft on YouTube or SNL. I do not know that they have run with Ian McShane and Isla Fisher to make this movie ... they need to do something good or something. I knew that it would be a stupid movie, but I thought it was fun at least. I did not smile. <br /> <br /> I usually do not comment on the IMDb movies but it has been so horrible that people have warned me. This is only the fourth movie I have ever seen in 10/10.
