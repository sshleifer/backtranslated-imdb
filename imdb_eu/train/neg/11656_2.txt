Scary Movie 2 was a disappointment. It's just a reference to films like Mission Impossible 2. The movie opens up quite white and pale people and James Woods Andy Richter's excellent use. Cinema is sadly the movie comes out of it. The play is horrible. Tori Spelling looks and acts completely. The film is shaped together and has a slow pace. At this rhythm of caramel, there were longer gags, joints and the aforementioned Tom Cruise movie, they were not fun for my theater. The film, fortunately, stays in 83 minutes, is no end. (I'll tell you that it's moving because the end is not ending with humor). I do not know what else to say, but at the end of Miramax there is a sharp set to make money for teenagers. In general, a very bad movie.
