Fish Harriss (seemingly amazingly funny) and Ed Harris short, that Connery does not make sense in her role, and finishes on the driving behavior of an old 80-year-old man. In fact, the script does not make sense; imagine 60 min. The end-to-end line plus the sudden turn-in attachment plot with no argumental structure. It's more an accident than a script and may be suitable for research purposes. The more you remember the details, the more impression this gets. The punishment of death is not the problem here, although from the outset it has been a subject; it disappears without any other means. Good subject and environment.
