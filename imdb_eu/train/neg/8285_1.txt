This is probably one of the worst movie ever I have ever seen. Jessica Simpson does not have a play, but the scripts are very profound. You really hear a serious conversation: "I love you more". "No, I love you more." After the first half hour I saw the movie (online), I could not take it anymore. His "southern charm" does not work and is very annoying; His slapstick humor attempts to fall flat and scripts read books off the page. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Please, Luke Wilson. Did he not read the script to make it happen or to make a big win over Papa Joe (Jessica's father and film producer)? Fortunately, now he knows better than doing such a movie. Luke Wilson is a good actor. I hate seeing her face pain while undergoing a bad conversation. <br /> <br /> I also think that commenting on the previous commentary from the 8th to the 10th was probably the best part of the film, as well as the participation of Pope John Paul for a better film rating. No one in this regard finds this movie. <br /> <br /> Jessica has a lot of money, right? Perhaps some theater bought?
