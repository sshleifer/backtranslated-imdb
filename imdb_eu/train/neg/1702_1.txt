Actually, this is the fact that no one has ever bought the sole reason that one has reviewed it and the only reason why anyone can benefit from it is David Lynch, and you want to be David Lynch's children. But what invented? Even though David Lynch can create a shit part. <br /> <br /> Maybe Lynch wanted to overcome normality and want to absorb absurdity in the experience. Perhaps, dumb sounds, cacophonists, and images of torn chicken in the world of humanity, our real relationship, implies something about nonsense. One thing he says to me: I lost $ 20. <br /> <br /> As a result of the offensive, I would be offensive if I wanted Hansen to turn the heights and cut my ears. I wanted to take a dump on a plate and observe it for 33 minutes because I was absurd for absurdity. <br /> <br /> Dumbland is the only free quality - goal, a fun goal. That is, it's so bad, though it's not so fun because it's so bad. That, however, is fun. <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, buy Dumbland. If not, save yourself an agony.
