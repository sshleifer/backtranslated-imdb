Che's charisma and appearance seem to coincide with its iconic nature, since it has inadequate information on the propaganda on the left (for example, this film). <br /> <br /> I do not know what's wrong: Catch a Che's murder team or 4 hours usually to sit in Soderberghian rubbish. The question was not why this pet project was born, but it took something so long. "These", I am referring to the "secret" love of Left-handed Hollywood and Marxist (Lenin, Castro ...). One of the few liberal directors in Tinseltown has been in need for decades, so that the propaganda project is candidly favorable. In those years where was Oliver Stone? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbra Streisand too? It's a mystery. "Artists" are exaggerated as opposed to similar policies, but somehow Che Guevara's most popular and popular communist is not yet subject to these films. > "Gerrilla" has all the features of the American epic story story. Here are some other similar factors, such as some other political stories about political budget such as "Malcolm X" or "Gandhi". Filmmaker Del Toro is a renowned Argentinian revolutionary. However, the actions of that controversial and criminal man could not be taken away by anyone: he was an intelligent manipulator of a wealthy family. That's why it adapts the Del Toro invoice visually. Del Toro can be an interesting and charismatic actor, and Guevarara can physically resemble it, but it does not give any intellectual qualities, which is why Guevara is a primitive person. Babil, Philips and Franka Incompetente, with significant competencies, emphasizes that the director does not evaluate well. <br /> <br /> Most of the movies are very slow (not surprisingly) and visually impaired. A brilliant director like Kubrick would also consider publishing a movie that exceeds a 3-hour mark, so Soderbergh says that he has only made one or two solo films and will only think about it at the beginning of his career. His Grandness of Oceania was the task. The length of the film seems to indicate that a large part of Che's life has been shown here - then think again. Soderbergh Che focuses on the final phase, and a lot of films is a boring jungle filled with the idealism of Guevara. (Psychopaths do not have any ideals.) I do not ask what this esteemed director should think about himself as having to think about his life. Was he really thinking of no interest? A massacre of 600 people is not interested in the audience, right? Amazing. This would be much easier than just a few more than two biographies, much better than this mockie-mumble movie, in a 4-hour movie. <br /> <br /> Soderbergh, in some way, does not turn complicated by never negatively directing negatives. dark side - more than 90% - Guevarara. Expanding this type of historical accuracy, ignoring consciously blind truth (because God does not have the holy image of Checo), Soderbergh is not a humanist who reveals: most Hollywood and pop musicians are a very fake figure that fights their career. Keeping it - but the opposite: only cares about people who have tried these ideas (for example, in a cobay). Soderbergh and the like are the elite who are the worst kind; such as people often conceal "contempt" that supposedly reject the "proletariat" (what stupid term). <br /> <br /> Half of all students around the world use Che's image in red and orange tee shirts. but why not know. When he faces a fierce man, he becomes an iconic figure for young people who think that "intuition", intellectual, hip, or interest seems to appeal to them. In reality, only the T-shirt tee shirt emphasizes the general and total imbalance of personal education. (Do not you know that you want a person to start to face the world before). From now on, the Che in the dressing room is best to have a cup of coffee with Bart Simpson. All "Che-wearers" probably know about Marge's blue hair, about reading about the murderer of Fidel Castro. After doing everything in the name of Marx, we would think that these "ideals" would definitely rest. It seems that humans will never learn. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Pol Pot, Castro, Milosevic, Ceausescu, Iron Curtain, a hundred million dead, more than a million physically and / or mentally spoil ... so it does not matter, huh? <br /> <br /> Del Toro won the Cannes prize, just to surprise and surprise how Cannes and other European festivals work. Suggestion: Sean Penn was recently a jury. <br /> <br /> For my music rumors, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/
