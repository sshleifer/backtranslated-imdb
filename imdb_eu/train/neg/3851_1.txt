I never thought that "Lisa Picard Is Famous" was worse than the movie, but that was pretty close. As many comments are repeated, it was predictable; You will see that you will know whether or not you know five minutes in the movie. This movie mentions "Panther Pink Revenge" on "Mary about something". Writing Greg Glienna (Meet Parents) needs a new material. <br /> <br /> A boyfriend / police officer who is followed by internal problems, but this option is wasted. Seattle Space Needle has a lot of shots and is required to reveal Canadian shooting. Some of the worst drivers in the car make the vehicle pass through the city to make the most of the trailer. At least, turn at least one wheel or put the brakes on. Selma Blair's crime is inert and short. $ 3 million from Jason Lee, what? Guess skateboarding! <br /> <br /> So, here's who should watch this movie: Bee Gees fans want to hear the two actors 'Islands in the Stream' wrong; People with no Julia Stiles. 1/10
