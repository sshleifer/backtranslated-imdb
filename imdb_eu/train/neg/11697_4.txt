I am not among those who believe that King is a great writer, the books are very distractions for a few hours, and they often have interesting places. However, in my opinion, you think they are breaking fast enough. <br /> King's movie King's story is pretty accurate. If you have read the book, there are no surprises, no changes, no changes in scene or character. King fans are a movie for fans of King. <br /> <br /> With the rest there is no fear of this film, "Gypsy Curse" is horrible, curse has curse. Many people want to become thinner. The last third has serious structural problems and a bit of a shameless end seems that the gender rules break a bit. <br /> <br /> There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but maybe read the book, there is nothing new here ... <br /> <br /> <br />
