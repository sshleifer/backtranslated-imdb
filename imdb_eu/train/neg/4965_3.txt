For a classical story of the past, where the location (Grendel) was disappointed. As a writer, I guess I could not play a dramatic rhythm. The club's story column is very useful and would give a new story about classic literature. For a strange reason, they wrote me as soon as possible. In order to find out if he was shot in 21 days, he says "sharp" and unfortunately shows him. Now we have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I talked about FX, I can really crappy CGI but the script's rock and this was just slow, lacking in the spartan and drama. I would blame the actor, but ... I know it, it's because of the play, I'm caught up with my partner.
