I'm probably a little read by Stephen King's book. After reading this excellent work, I was not able to watch the movie version. After watching the movie, I was totally disappointed. The only thing that matches this book is the titles and characters' names. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character has been put on a show show. The main objective is to survive. But it's not on the field. He's got involved in the city and he has to get away from villains (I think you'll call them) villians, who do not like movie characters. This premise created many tensions and suspensions, and he achieved a great end. The movie was an absolute garbage. There was no cinematic. Arnold Schwarzenegger fully respected as an actor, but he confused it.
