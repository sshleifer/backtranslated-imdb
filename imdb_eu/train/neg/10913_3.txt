Marvin (Rob Schneider) does not have the dream to be a police officer for his whole life. But his luck varies with a car conversion (very bad) and a doctor has found it. The doctor must use the animal body to rebuild it. From that moment on, wild behavior begins consciously and becomes the best police ever. At that time, changes are realized and the animal instinct begins to take its human side. Meanwhile, he finds a beautiful girl and wants to be a perfect knight, he means controlling and civilizing himself. I'm not fun at Rob Schneider. In fact, this is my first movie. However, I can easily say that it is the best person to lose (see Ally Mcbeal's part, it's really fun). There are some good pieces in the film, for example, goat flirting. In these films, the main problem is that the script seems to be less of a viewer's feelings. I am sure that this film does not work well. But it is very sad to make these films very good at the box office. The animal is not the worst movie I've seen so far, but it's not more than just *.
