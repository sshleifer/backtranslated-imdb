I'm sure the worst film ever made. If a 13-year-old boy can not laugh at humor, you should give up on comedy forever. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chose it differently. They are very dangerous with some of the films we predict (some of them racist). Especially memorable doctor's main character tells the rabbit is dead and pregnant (as I write, I can not believe that the truth was a scene). The man goes to a dead rabbit at the doctor's desk and tries to give his mouth to his mouth. ROTFLMAO! NO! It's a line of drilling that says what's wrong with this movie: "I knew I should be on top." ha ha ha ha ah ugh ........
