In a single word ... abysmal. Hippie sex scenes and eye candy give women a star, otherwise I forget it. Corman's greatest efforts, no breaks. Ben Vereen must constantly strike his name. I can not believe that this will be on the DVD (05/02/15) with "Wild In The Streets". With the other retro stinker. I woke up at night with a cold with a patient, I decided to watch a movie to encourage a bit, scan digital channels ... The premise seemed pretty interesting, I see B-movie science fiction, hippie culture and rebellion. teen movies Somehow I was acquainted with Ben Vereen in the theater, I thought ... why not? What a great mistake ... my day was a great start. <br /> <br /> I only know why I know the identity I know in the newly-born brain. I remember remembering the 14-year-old people I watched for this movie (45 years old), in Sombrero in the early seventies and mid-twenties, there is no longer a local art theater. although I heard this movie aloud aloud. Performance: immense story: horrible, cinematic: almost horrible, music: horrible, sound: awesome, correcting: a joke. If you choose to see the warning afterwards, remember ... "So I told you." <br /> <br /> "Gass-sss" is the perfect title for this movie ... then you feel "gased". You see this putrid film - or maybe you should take it to a "gas" chamber to keep your brain from wasting it. I watched the Super 8 films that make this film shameless. Without a doubt, it is a new addition to the top ten films of all eight of my time ... with "Tentacles" (there, below). <br /> <br /> Ted Gilbert, AZ
