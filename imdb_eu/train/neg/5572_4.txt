Other colorful preteens for men in the rubber outfits to fight each other. This time, future travelers arrive in 1992 and collect some people together with them to prevent them from returning to 1944 and preventing the destruction of Godzilla, thus preventing a Japanese future from destroying it. After this task, they reveal that they are a series of living creatures that transit the time-trips and stop Godzilla? Eek! Everything is very stupid, and probably it is, but the plot is surprisingly decent and the final battle seems pretty good too. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual effects are just dirty, rather than dirty, and the movie is as sad as its predecessors. Look at Spielberg's joke shaking.
