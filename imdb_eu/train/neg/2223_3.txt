Trit, the interview stroke and graphics (the same thing we saw in all fantasy movies of the 1980s), the numbers that are painted by the hokey and the characters are exiting this running of the bulls, but most of the hardcore fans. <Br /> <br /> This film looks like Bakshi's works, mottos, and Frank Frazetta taught him to draw the same animators himself. This is Frazetta ... in motion. Violence is spectacular and art direction and animation is similar to other sword and witchcraft of that time. <br /> <br /> I like to see the sound off when I play Conan's first sound.
