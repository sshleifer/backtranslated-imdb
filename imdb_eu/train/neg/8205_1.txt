Acting very badly and very superficial story. Even the decent B-Movie <br /> <br /> The events that were most astonishing as human beings as a foreign ship were boring and very bad. <br /> <br /> This is the worst thing. the science fiction I have ever seen. I watched 5.0 stars and I wanted to see what I like the genre, but it was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Now there are not many good ALIEN films, I think most of them have little budgets. <br /> <br /> I give it 3/10
