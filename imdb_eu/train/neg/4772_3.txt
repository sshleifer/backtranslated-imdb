Before seeing this movie, I had already seen that it was a complete copy of Saw (a shack and a black man's hand to pull out a little hand to pull out his hand). In the name of the MJH movie I would normally turn out (ugh, can GROSS say?!), But I still tried. <br /> <br /> To start, I was a bit interested. The performance was totally horrible and the character (especially the "Sulley" who played the character, I was laughing at almost every reaction). MJH was worse, but I kept looking at him. <br /> <br /> <br /> However, the end was the biggest joke! I was hanging on the minds of the storm: "That was the end! This is a comedy ?!" <br /> <br /> I thought that this stack was more fun than the one called "Scary Movie" and that really is. !
