An interesting idea of ​​a movie, which shows the last dragon on the ground, and the struggle that tells one's own and the evil side. When he was younger, he knocked Einon in the heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the dark gentleman who gave him half his heart. Now grown up in Einon (David Thewlis) he is now a king of selfishness and evil. In the meantime, Bowen is using a new friend Draco the Dragon (voice of Sir Sean Connery) to win the "death" pennies. But when Einon Drakus listens to his half, either of them feels that one of them is hurting or dying. Pete Postlethwaite also stars Gilbert of Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs Lord Felton, Julie Christie Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud King Arthur. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Must see!
