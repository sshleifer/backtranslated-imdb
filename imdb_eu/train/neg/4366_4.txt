When X-Files was an attractive and intelligent thought. A large part of his appeal was that writers looked at folklore and science according to their ideas, linking them to the terrific side of the real life of the plot. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I was careful about the 8th season when it was in the air. Shows already had two good episodes ("One Son" and "Requiem"), and in the 7th season, there was a notable increase in the number of minor, inevitable, or inexpensive episodes. nonsense But I thought, yes, I'm giving it some hesitation, maybe they're going back because they have great ideas, <br /> <br /> "Roadrunners" was really amazed. "Patience", at least for the vampire's folklore, offered an interesting angle to avoid the show, the episode sees a strange rat (stranger?) A Parasite, worshiping the backs of Christians. Oh, and they think it's the second coming of Christ, but you only find it in the last two minutes. Serious There's no such sense to explain what is slug, why something is happening or what's happening. Even in the early years of the show - especially, then, you would expect a deeper, background or otherwise the opposite - a bit of mystery, what is something about uncertainty. <br /> <br /> Scully, however, kills him. You can face premature disturbances, but the character that has been developed for seven years has been a rational skeptic, a joke that is evil, it only transforms to progress in the plot. Do you think you are seeing a horror-stroke of teens, a woman of the thirties immersed in a lonely and isolated community, just like a rojiblanco who has spent more than a decade? stereotyped hicks or their safety is completely indifferent. Oh, by the way, Doggett, the new Mudler, is not around. Scully walked through the desert, without looking for a wild killer. Finally, he reveals himself to save the day. I can not remember why - but it's not really there. Again: seriously: <br /> <br /> In summary, the overall script for other shows or a pet's extreme project is already similar. The long-term show was more vulnerable at one time. Maybe working on a smaller show, where the characters were archetypal and the audience expects less. X-Files went well, and Scully was one of the strongest and most idiosyncratic televisions of the 90s. Star Trek decides to change the nature of a story that he has to do for fifty hours.
