JUST CAUSA Sean Connery is a profile of Harvard law, Kate Capshaw (still works?) His wife (mild difference in age) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist police (and!) And Ed Harris's main revelation. The fundamentalist fundamentalist of the Southern series. <br /> <br /> Throw jewelry, but it makes the movie more serious. (Do not read if you want to watch this movie or if you want to see this movie really ruining). First and foremost, I felt that I was turning my eyes before the liberal stereotypes: they are sadistic policemen, and that frame makes this black man, without evidence. He also collaborates with the coroner, the witnesses and the accused's lawyer (he accused of the rape and murder of a young girl), who is black. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The guilty man has approached his grandmother to defend and reopen the trial. <br /> <br /> The small public servants and the IL club boys are deprived of Connery (hijacked ...) but finds that. In the case of Blair, the alleged murderer, nowadays killed by the death row, was all manufactured. The main evidence was that his confession was eliminated. <br /> <br /> A black police (!) administered a black police officer who confessed to Russian roulette. Connery has murdered another prisoner of the death row and, after several arrests, as Harris, Hannibal Lecter hid a weapon concealed as Harris. <br /> <br /> Try again and Blair is released. <br /> <br /> I think ... shot over ... <br /> <br /> Suddenly! It turns out that Blair is a psychotic psyche that uses "guilty white" to be a member of Connery. Harrison released a story with Blair, who took Harris out of the murder of Harris. Last 30 min. They are a strange movie directed to a dramatic law, Connery and Fishburne in the Alligator house in the whitewashing battles in the series (yes, right reading) in Everglades. <br /> <br /> It was a strange movie. . <br /> <br /> So, the entire system is corrupt and unhealthy, the police are just litter bins and the torturers of Abu Graib, but the criminals are really psychotic and worthy of frying. <br /> <br /> Really depressed in all levels! The system is completely corrupt and the types of PCs of white guys who are challenging are also deceived. <br /> <br /> Two fingers down. Connery, of course, had to pay for a mortgage or do something.
