The story was fine. Akshay Kumar was just as good and it was the only thing about that movie. Kareena Kapoor was bad. There was so much nickname and weeping over its size zero, but it did not look good. I do not know why Anil Kapoor made such a bad role. In the film he had nothing to do with it. Because Yashraj is a movie, it does not mean that the actor has to accept the role. Ali Khan said well. I think Indian directors and producers of the time begin to think about Indian customers as smart as they are. What are we? fools !!!! What they think, they will show us 2 men who will take a SWAT team and we will think. The Indian police are so stupid that they are trying to catch some criminals ... They take up 100 + police officers and no one has to surround the palace. The action was shit and I never saw bad action. Akshay Kumar had about 30-40 police circles around ... and shot him. The police did not touch the bullet, but killed all the police. Crap CRAP. <br /> <br /> I think the director of the fight that he thought about this scene should retire. <br /> <br /> THIS FILM WILL NOT BE USED.
