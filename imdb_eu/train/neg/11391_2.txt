When I started to see this movie, I was looking for some subtle metaphors, but I soon found out that this film was about the trains that were people. Interpersonal relationships are similar to those that you see on the street and it is sometimes a more interesting situation that becomes a trumpet and boring conversation. It's not a movie that makes me try to figure out how people interact, this movie is very boring. If you want to see and analyze these types of relationships, you should buy a train ticket and look at the trains for the public. It's realistic, but you would not go to the movie because you were watching the movie.
