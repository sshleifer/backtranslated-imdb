SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER, for example, is an example of a "horror movie" that goes hand in hand with extreme people. Produce any output, production, script, FX, etc. to create a "shock-value". Now I'm not misread: I'm a connoisseur of the "shock" movie and sleazier / gorier / nastier is better, but it's still nice to see some SOME creators involved in SOMEONE cinema. <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC explains the life of Harry Russo, a freak-show druggist, his ventriloid, who orders orders to kill Rubberneck. He rarely dares courage and other random people, and he thinks he hates "hoo-uhs" (that is, "New York-Do not talk") and how he hates him ... He wants to rap on his donkey, we have a lot of necrops, very few, and a few naked to mix some things, but nothing you have not seen in a good movie ... <br /> <br /> <br /> That's excluded The only thing I can find in this movie is often (deliberately). Most horny, our main man, Harry. Everyone dies and wants to donkeys, and it becomes a bit more comical. I almost think I'm going to attack this movie homo -It's a temptation that I think is something like this, with all the donkeys and all the continuous Harry's shots with dong hangin 'out. Honestly, this joke is more understandable in this film, then some T-and-A (and some full faces , to the right extent). SCHIZOPHRENIAC It's nice as an hour clock, but I really recommend that you just say SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER movie. Honestly - the title, so far, the best thing in the trash ... Command 3.5 / 10
