A mysterious road with more horror horror items; fudge overall <br /> <br /> A female sex partner starts with a nightmare that comes out of her bed, crying into the children's room and killing her. He wakes up Then, that man is dying in a hospital, pouring blood. His unknown daughter has arrived and she helps her get in touch with her dreams (I think) and she wants to know how to kill him before he dies in his grave. <br /> <br /> It's not too much about the mystery, or even how; Most viewers must figure it out before they can be revealed. I am not sure how to work in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> In any case, horror elements include penetrating autopsy, the recurring nightmare of the man who killed the boy. They turn into an eye cat that turns their eyes and decomposes the various shots of the man into the nightmare. <br /> <br /> At last I was surprised to see Fulci's dedication. Clive Barker! Interesting.
