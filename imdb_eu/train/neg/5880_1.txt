The film begins slowly when we get to the cinema, it was pretty good, but we've been going through the video for about 5 minutes and we wondered what the movie was like, and I did not like this movie and I would not recommend anyone, the best part of the night with the alarm and because the lights were shut off because the project was broken, we all thought we were going home. We have to be one of the worst movie I've ever seen, we got bored with the mind, and most of the movie people are throwing away the doors at the end, it was rough. I am surprised that no one had ever gone before. If you go and see if you're sure to be busy, better still go and see nothing.
