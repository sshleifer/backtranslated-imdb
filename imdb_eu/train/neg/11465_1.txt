Without a doubt, this is one of the worst photographs I've ever seen ever paid. The kind of film you choose for Christmas holiday on Christmas holiday, if you missed the opening hours, but still watch the dead movie! And that's how I got this bomb ... <br /> <br /> In three decades, I can smell the coral fish that make up this far-off story. In the unbelievable plot - the killer whale has a rumor against a blind person - it's horny. And all that is, except for the "love subject" that exaggerates the finishing touch of a movie without a love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is beautiful (in a two-dimensional role) but Richard Harris just makes the scenery. Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) was not, and this is not "Jaws." Honestly, I get rid of the most and I've been on the TV ferries right away. "Risk, Will Robinson!" See the current t.v. Watching commercial brides and whales ("I love Orca - Orca ...") has finished at least 60 hours. This Flick represents 92 minutes of my life, I will never return.
