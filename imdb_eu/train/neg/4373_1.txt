I think that "Virgin Mary's Infertility" is a guilty grievance of disillusion. You already know that you do not expect a master of cinema to look like a title similar to this, and proudly say the headlines and confirms the first impression that only the production of a Japanese movie in the 80's. Nowadays, there are many filmmakers and filmmakers in Japan active, but Kazuo Komizu overcomes all their trilogy, completely depraved and aggressive sex and the sadistic abuse of young girls. Although he is not trying to tell a story, "The Virgin's Infections" is a nuisance that raises the UN's semi-pornographic sex and likes a horrible horror horror in the 80's. The images of many photographers and their fashion patterns are intensified, as they are exchanged with images of rough sex with a young perverted thin pervert. He spent a minute of fruitful ending (typical) and asked him to stay, even if he had to share with other women. I do not know. Is a masculine fantasy represented? It's really topical and wrong. Anyway, come back to the hilarious and smart photographers. Surprising by the dark clouds on the way home, the team will enter into a country house where they have a huge sexuality and eventually become a victim of a hilarious demon to kill them all. The plays are amateur, inane and primitive dialogues and Komizu's direction is weak and inspired. I can afford it all, including a similar imbalance to the sex of the woman, but I was too close to extinguish the movie, that is, in an awkward sequence of strange wars. Among men, one of the girls knocks, throws, and throws a man, and calls him a dirty little bitch, until he stretches his panties and shakes. This sequence, in my low opinion, is an absolute point of view of Asian exploitation cinema. Avoid a boyfriend.
