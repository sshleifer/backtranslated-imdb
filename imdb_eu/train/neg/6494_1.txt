I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor, so I was very interested in how he was doing as a writer / director. I could not have been disappointed anymore for this movement. The movie was so imbalanced and I got the point where I wanted to get the cinematography wall. The actors were very good, but they lost talent. Not everyone writes a writer or director, and clearly Mr. Hopkins joins this category. The movie is the worst movie ever I've ever seen in 50 years. Please, ask us, Mr. Hopkins, and make a brilliant decision, you're excellent, and let's write and correct it with great talent. I would definitely give it less of this movie.
