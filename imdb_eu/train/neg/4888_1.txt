Nick Millard had only had enough time to make 10 years of "Criminals madness", Nick Phillips, to spend time and effort before releasing this terrible goddess. Less than an hour after the "Kriminally Insane" origin was longer, it might be that he offered everything he intended to escape, but TONSU decided to use it. This also includes the original footage, as well as the recycling of the original credit sequence. Sadly, quick aging Priscilla Alden did not save. This flick looks like it was filmed with a camera camera rented with the original footage! If this film cost more than $ 100, I would be very surprised and I would be astonished if it was close to that amount! Avoid this and see the original!
