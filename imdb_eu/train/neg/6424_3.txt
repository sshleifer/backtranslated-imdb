It would be a broken screenwriter and forced into a self-storage facility (horrifying and dangerous director) (Ron Perlman) who would be his agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross). In the city, "Costume Killer" (because he has been tagged, after his victims have been injected with Windex, he has dressed in stupid clothes). He convinces him that he will create a wonderful movie of his life, and film directors (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) will meet and find out how to make the art of making movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Our losses (and all the actors, who do good work and deserve better), have a great black comedy, but it's a pretty nasty joke. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Ron Perlman. It's worth it to get its performance. His comedy is a great time and can make some great impressions (he did not realize that he commented on the movie Hellboy, saying he needed an intervention to enter Jerry Lewis). It's only fun to see this. <br /> <br /> David Dukes works with two (but essential) keys.
