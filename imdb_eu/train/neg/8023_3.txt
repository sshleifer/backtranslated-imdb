After watching this movie on DVD, I saw the trailer. Voice describes them as surrealist films. Well, there are surrealists and surrealists. <br /> <br /> It was a part of the film that really seemed surrealistic to me, but, of course, the surrealist was confusing. Other unusual imagery, especially on the ground, is that the scene of lunches were so absurd because they did not make sense. I do not like an image that has no image, but these scenes seemed unimportant. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the director was an attempt to express the internal monologue of Logan. I do not know what would happen. Sadly, I saw something that Logan told me about what he was thinking about, what his vision was, or even his emotional state. All I could say was that he was not particularly pleased with his physical appearance, and he loved the heart of an elderly boy. <br /> <br /> In the end, I pointed out the relationship between boys, but not much more. Those who directed the ambiguous scenes were more correct and more than one police officer seemed to be an artistic decision. <br /> <br /> However, it was as tiring as the content was as easy as me, a pace of change. I liked Madagascar's skin, and I felt that this movie was going to get this sort of narrative, and maybe even style. He was not approaching. For me it's not so much a question: this movie deserves an A's effort, but an execution is D.
