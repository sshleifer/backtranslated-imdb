The worst movie I've ever seen. How to define the "worst?" I would rather take out the two eyeballs, and then I have to click to dance again, ever again. In any case, One-Hit Wonder Zwick manages a movie dedicated to fans of Elvis, Mary Kay, Las Vegas, gay, FBI agents and other humanities, a rough farce that is necessarily compulsory for this purpose offering Elvis Presley Enterprises can give me permission to use "Elvis Presley imitador bueno muerto Ãºnico" as a premier movie movie that seems to be a must. The worst part of this mix - which takes a bit of work - is a mangled script: in 1958, he would mention Elvis's words and songs in the 1970s! The worst special effect? This Oscar, in Elvis, the most photographed or known tomb in the world, decided that he could go to moron, resembling a pyramid over a gold record and somewhere in the middle of the park. Potentially, the biggest viewer of this film would be Elvis fans. However, stupidity of stupidity (Nixon gave him an Elvis DEA trials, not credentials of the FBI ... and I continued) under the usual wisdom wisdom. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe the stupid movies. This is a horrible and horrible movie.
