Down to Earth is Lance Barton, about a black comic that plays a truck. He goes to heaven and gets another body. Lance gets a white body from Charles Wellington. So Lance does things in the body of Charles. The movie has some laughter, but nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar is a 2005 animated comedy. This movie is good, but Chris Rock has done better things. The whole movie will make you laugh 4 times. And it's not fun to laugh at. You will laugh at yourself and you will react, but you are definitely not laughing at the ground.
