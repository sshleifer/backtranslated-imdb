I feel bad for such actors. Undoubtedly, high school drama classes can do a better job or at least a job. The actors thought that it was a great opportunity to work on a movie, it certainly was not there. In addition to the horrible performances, the stories were boring and they were mostly predictable. Remote control also had no sense. For the wrong reason, it was the best premise. <br /> <br /> Everything is a good option for protecting low budget movies and new filmmakers, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult. viewer Here I saw here for good comments. They had to plant people who are related to the film. When you see people, you should deceive them, but you can not see them empty, to see what they like. <br /> <br /> I gave him 2 instead of 1, because at least the boxer's story was to be heart-warming. He probably failed, but he tried. I have booked that the worst thing is 1 worst. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a side and jump on this. I wanted it.
