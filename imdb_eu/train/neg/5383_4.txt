I think that I should start by saying that almost any work style can have entertaining parts. Whether the actual test is good at the beginning or end, that is, the analog title of this review. Most of us agree - I am also like me, who enjoys reading a lot of blogs - blogs can not compare with the good writing novel for a variety of reasons. Similarly, the FEM can not compare it with good films for many reasons, and I think it's a bad example of independent filmography. From the beginning to the end, it is like a vlog that is designed by FEM. (Fish, even MySpace gets some seizures). If I want to see Lonelygirl15 one hour - I do not see it. The FEM, because the bubble of the media is more evident than the gum atmosphere, is very interesting without an interesting story. It's like seeing the world of life, most of what I think is a boring way. However, we want to applaud the FEM's creators, a postmodern film about making a movie. Take my effort. <br /> <br /> In the end, I will not take any responsibility for that. I am impressed that I am really interested in the time of writing the review. It's not that FEM is totally bad because it is not there; Sometimes I create a smile or think maybe - just - something interesting. That's just a mere sense ... no fuss. However, I find it indifferent that I am practicing almost an axillary: indifferent indifference. <br /> <br /> I hope to release the creators of the film / "actors". Perhaps one of them will be needed when one of them progresses and continues with life. <br /> <br /> See if you lose this movie and do not want to do it. otherwise, overcome and not worry you have lost a lot of talent and strangers. You do not really.
