The worst movie I've ever seen in theater. I watched this movie at the austin film festival in 2004, and I thought that this film was approved for the festival. The premise was interesting, and it seemed that he could go somewhere, but when he tried to do something he disappeared. First of all, if you want to make music, find someone with music talent. music played the cursory of piano, as they were playing in a stereo in the room they were recording. The letter was very written, and when there were no rhymes that were evident, they stretched the groan-inducing rhymes where they tried to make feature films. and do you think you would find people singing music? in this case no. fortunately, they only sang half half, but when they sung, they frightened me. especially when they tried to sing in harmony. And that's just music addresses. Some of the performances were pretty good, but there were many conversations, as well as most of the scenes. Of course, they did not have enough coverage in the scene, or they were just a bad editor, cutting the line and using soft options to cut the movie. At least the director admitted that he was willing to add that no one had ever become a musical script. I hope investors make sure someone can type music again before making the same mistake.
