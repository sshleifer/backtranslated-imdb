Well, what do you say? GOLDEN CHILD goes into the category "so bad, good". Eddie Murphy is having fun (and sometimes quite annoying) fun, but still entertained. Chales Dancing is never worse than Sardo Numspa's role (what is that name?). <br /> <br /> Who should watch GOLDEN CHILD ... hm ... it's hard to say, but my guesses would be people who are more embarrassing, and bad performances, bad drawings and conversations can be shameless. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/>
