I wanted to watch a low budget movie, but I expected much more in Alex Cox. The great performance of the two great men was, above all, white. An Oscar would have to win both of them. I really understood this movie in the jokes of the film industry and in other jokes and they laughed aloud, that is, it's strange. Without laughing at these moments, I'd give this movie 2/10. What happened to the classic 80s with Alex Cox? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I made some questions after the movie had finished. Why did Mexican fonts go home to others? What did her daughter say about her last job, about 100 people? Why did she break her stuff when she was crazy? After the movie I would have to go to Q & Ara, but I did not get up at 10:00.
