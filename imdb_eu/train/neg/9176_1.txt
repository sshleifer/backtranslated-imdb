You know, when you're in trouble, the initial storyline tells you essentially when it's alive. That goes down everything. The unmatched "Matrix" bale-time camera is caused by work. Without video game gameplay. Old sea chapels and sea sailors. They become trained fighters in a gesture of an eye. Zombies are even boring. <br /> <br /> At least it's "so good" I expected a zombie movie, but this is "those who are so badly involved do not want to ever make a movie again." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
