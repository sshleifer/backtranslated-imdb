Before seeing this movie, I read a review here, when I can say that this film can be one of the best films ever possible. ha ha scene scenes in Tense ... the annoying characters of this film. The little girl is talking and the little boy trying to thwart the little boy without any warning (and who was the guy who talked to the boy on the beach?) ... it seems to happen. In this unanswered movie. As I saw, it seemed to me that it was a movie in one direction, it just did not go anywhere, but rather in a new direction ... and more ... <br /> <br /> The effect is great, but it's a great writing . Each character in each scene says or does something extravagant, realistic, and the reactions given by others are extravagant. There is no resolution about the problems over the film that are confusing and eventually end up losing time.
