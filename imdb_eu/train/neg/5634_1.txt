This poster, entitled "Plotless and withoutless", literally, was used to refer to my subject line. The only thing I want to add is "passion." A movie made by a real husband and wife, and a great number of sex scenes, this film must have a horrible situation beyond the cold ice. Dafoe and Colagrande get bored in the sex scenes, and the viewer can also take a Valium and do it. Also, many viewers have watched over time, and Willem Dafe really needs any type of therapy that is activated when watching the bloody tampon taken from her vagina. <br /> <br /> The movie's key (there is) is the restaurant scene, where a server describes what Dafoe is constantly asleep, what is "damaged jambalaya". (All the ingredients of the plate are separated together). "This is a thriller destroyed." All the elements are: the house is horrible, isolated, spouse, magnificent scoring, favorite goalkeeper and the like that goes by, car accidents deaths and death, characters with a secret past. The thriller-clicks you can basically think of, but it's NOT coming. Everything sits on it and never enters a coherent plot or entertains an artistic mood. In the restaurant, Dafoe goes through the "destroyed jambalaya". The future buyers of this mix would have done well to abandon this unfocused thriller on the low arcade game.
