Let me start this review by saying this: I love Vampire movies. They can dirty (they want to punish them), and I still love them, because vampires are cool films. Van Helsing, for many, thought that the shit was volatile, it seemed nice to me, because they were vampires. You can ask: "What is it related to this movie?" The answer is: I mean that this movie is really horrible, like movie theater (vampire) like vampires, and I can even underline such films. <br /> <br /> The film Van stars Helsing, a university professor does not persuade. He is an awful actress, like all others in this film, and he wrote, adding salt to the wound. Honestly, I do not want to offer it, and I'm sure everyone was having fun doing this movie, but it was really painful. I do not know why I saw everything; maybe it was an evil fascination, like the train's strained crash: it's horrible, but you can not force yourself to look away. Its main fault is simply boring, and its plot is so ridiculous, even for the sci-fi horror movie. <br /> <br /> But I digress it. By the way, Van Helsing has sex with his mother. Of course, he did not know at that time; He thinks one of his disciples (that is, it's illegal and everything, but not as scary). <br /> <br /> When I was Van Helsing, I would at least get an Oedipus when I learned it. I made so much crude. It would be a fun thing if he made comments but not. The point is not to create any kind of character. If the writer did not even think about it. I would laugh at least one character and would like to say "Ha, you had sex with your mother", that is, it would be quite humorous (even if it was immature). It's possible that I'm running out of the room, so if you want to undo other words, never watch this movie: a vampire ninja is fighting an old man. It would be fun, but filmmakers are looking forward to taking them seriously. It's not for watching the movie to see what's worth it. Stay away, if you're far away, if you value it all your time. <br /> <br /> I'm going to say something positive about the movie: the guy who plays Van Helsing is just as bright as his knife. There is a long minute part where the knife swings around and performs good tricks. It would be boring in any other movie, but unfortunately it was noteworthy.
