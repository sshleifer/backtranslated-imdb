If there is a hell, it has a room for screening, where GRAND CANYON plays again and again in an eternal loop. We hope that Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker will be supporting the presence of so many wonderful actors that Mary McDonnell (whose penitence would see her films look like eternity). . But no. Apparently, other actors were injected with McDonnell's serum. The whole thing is apparent, evil, insulted (if you're a cape or anyone you know, prepare it with your blood to cook a TDD noisy scene). GRAND CANYON is full of evil invaders, but it never gives us any reason to understand them / sympathy or even tolerate them. As a rare exception, they are untiring lies to get a better genre pool. There is no need to give any word, a personeless development (people do not develop EVER), without any arcless performance that you will find in a short film. About GRAND CANYON? Its title. This is a big HOLE movie.
