This has always been the greatest and crunchy holiday film I have ever applauded, and that is what he says. I know Mexicans have extravagant ideas about religion, mixing ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But the day of the dead is not terribly frightening in half of Santa Claus's taking. <br /> <br /> So ... Santa is not an alcoholic red-red rich (see these pink cheeks sometime!). On the other hand, he is a skinny pedophile pediatric heaven (that is, the sky), which is harder for kids than in Kathy Lee Gifford sweatshirts. They sing traditional songs of ancient songs, wearing clothes in stereotype, I was surprised that the African-American black face was not black with their face 'Mammy'. This Santa listens to and listens to everything, listens to and listens to everything in "heaven's eyes". That is, who can be unhappy or nice (by twisting those who emphasize, I would bet) <br /> <br /> There are no Claus, goblins (what does the elves have when the child's work has been achieved) and mechanical reindeer toys They are. This whirlwind monster fits into a cloud, supposedly because its cylinder is tight. <br /> <br /> Santa's brother ... Devil? What is this, our Lord and Savior? Weird Anyhoo, Satan sends a minions to him, a mincing, prancing devil called Pitch, to try the Christmas screw. Do you want to get this right - the power of the most deprived criminals is to make commercial breakthroughs and delirious vacations? It seems to be redundant, is not it? <br /> <br /> The pitch is not completely effective. Some kids try to get it bad, but it's not a luck. The story of the little girl, Lupe, was hardened, the family is very poor. Everything you want is a Christmas doll, but parents can not pay their money (they spent all their cards on the house they built their home). So Pitch tries to encourage her to steal dolls. Indeed, the only way that a poor girl would get a doll would be to be holy and pray to God and Holy Saint did not really work. Lupe confronts the temptation and tells Pitch to follow him, so that if he wants to know that Chucky's sister, the doll will be so penetrating. <br /> <br /> Pitch stuck in a tree on the way to Santa (uh-huh) since Merlin saved her! Merlin You have to be kidding! When did they create Druidic mythical Christmas Christmas tales or something related to Christian religion? And is not God allowed magic? They had been embarking on merlin for a hundred years ago, because it was not asked to save one of God's part (or I suppose it must be Santa to raise up against Satan). Is this movie HUH long? from beginning to end, and you will be asked if there is not any drink you drink or something. Most likely, this movie is like a huge DT giant.
