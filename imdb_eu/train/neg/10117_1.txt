Wow I went to a nightly video store, because I was a bit afraid of a B horror movie, and I found this gem. I looked at the cover and thought that it was just my humorous movie. I got home and put it. <br /> <br /> I did not watch this movie in the horror movie B. This was much worse. I had a bad movie but I got it, I did not know such a shit man. He wrote and directed a 5-year-old movie, and it's nice about it. <br /> <br /> I am an absentee director and the movie strikes me with someone who really penalizes someone direct movies. The garbage needed to go to landfill. <br /> <br /> If you think about renting or buying. I'll tell you the same thing that someone would say I was trying to commit suicide. "Do not do it, it's not worth it!" I really do not say anything about this movie. Do not do it!
