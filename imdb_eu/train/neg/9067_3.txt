Although I have little expectations for this film, I especially like Jason Segel (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared), but I have to say that it's one of the worst movie I've ever seen in the last memory (Loser and Dr T). and women are on the list). <br /> <br /> Yes, there were a couple of hilarious mumble times, even if the movies were much better. The premise was not to cheat fraudulent artists through the university, when they find someone who finds their discovery. The problem is that the characters were so hard that I did not care about them anymore. The talented Jason Schwartzman's talented singer was a psychopath, it was not fun to watch it, especially if he was not funny or charming, he was totally risky and really dangerous. It's not fun to watch. The editing of the film was difficult to monitor - it continued to cut between fantasy and reality and it was often not very clear. The plot scams were shown only two or three, you just have to take the faith they were, in fact, they were cheating artists - it would show their scheme to make a better movie. The so-called love story was nonsensical and unbelievable; In fact, he was stupid and misguided and corrected. I'd like to keep up with the shortcomings of the movie, but you get the idea. Do not you want a $ 4 rental or movie store worth the money you need to drive and rent your car?
