I think Micheal Ironsides must be a professional career, forcing him to become a kind of star-shaped star. He could surely have done better this time than to ruin it. <br /> <br /> This movie can be a lot better, if you have a good budget, but it shows it repeatedly through the movie. There is a scene at the junction, which is outside the front of a train station, and I think it was. <br /> <br /> There's a scene to make this movie 3 and show it. A space craft crafted over a lake surrounded by forests. That was fine, but the rest of the film has been forgotten. <br /> <br /> There is another scene, like an engineering plant, which I bet and does not look like in the red space. to say the character. <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid, low budget, does not make sense and God helps Micheal Ironsides.
