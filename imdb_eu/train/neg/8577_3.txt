I know my summary would get you. How is this movie like Pet Rock and Disco ?! Well, unless you live in the 1970s or 80s, you probably can not understand why it would like a new Coke or a Pet Rock (and, actually, at least in Pet Rocks, I can not fully understand it.) At that time they seemed to be sensible, but they were just a couple of things that were really mixed up by younger generations. The same thing can be said by Kay Kyser and his team. In that period (most of the 1940s), they were well known and featured in the studio with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre. However, if you were not living at the time (before it was in my time), you wonder why this "entertainment" liked it. After all, Kyser and his teammates are very ill and their humor is very broad (that is, non-commercial and cursive). The truth is that I have not been able to play their own theater and I have not had more music numbers in the movie. As a result of these factors, a double support was given to the rear seat and surely the enthusiasts of these actors would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie goes to Kyser and the band goes to a young house. Aunt lives. In it, the bridge is cleared and rare events begin. In the end, they try to make Sally's lives and attempts. Laughter plays and is not a horror movie with cast. <br /> <br /> In general, entertainment is the right one. Like Lugosi and Karloff fans, I'm sure I deceived Kyser and his knuckleheads.
