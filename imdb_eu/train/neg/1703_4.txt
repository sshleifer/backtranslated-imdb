A Viet Nam veterinarian has decided to take an underwater village and get rid of anyone who goes on his way (including women). It was released before the "Star Is Born" at theaters, when it was activated around its career, this action-drama monster with Kris Kristofferson is very awesome, thoughtful and fast. Filmed in Simi Valley (CA), the results are really unknown, the topical roles and compassionate violence most commonly taken by George Armitage. Armitag has received one of the most curious films of the 70s, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters, and a little Loni Anderson; However, in the center of everything is Kristofferson. It's worth pointing out, I'm supposed to be a completely simple thriller of the universe, but the bad ones (and incidentally) cover the entire project as a mad scape. * 1/2 ****
