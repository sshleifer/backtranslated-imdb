The movie was moving, incoherent and invented. The portrait of women was very light. I rented it because it was listed as a comedy (this is the spacing), and the cover said that Andie McDowell was making a storm. It was not. I am Galilee, I saw this movie with two men, and we spent an hour exclaiming how bad it was. <br /> <br /> NOTE: TERRITORY SUMMARY Below! RAMPANT SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a plot about a elderly woman who takes her along with the young man, with her girlfriend with jealous criticism of jealousy. He wants to marry a man who is bored with their age. But he is so happy that you are linking to his puppy and he decides to marry. But his girlfriend's harp, accompanied by an involuntary, creates a plot that he deceives our hero to think that he's cheating on that guy. It works He has a fight with him, he left the house and stepped on a truck (remember the movie title?) So now he is dead, two thirds of the film. Although our heroine is a school director who is looking after boys and girls, birth control and pregnant women have forgotten. <br /> <br /> He has already broken relationships with his girlfriends, because they were not so good. She decides to marry only one and compassionate, boring man. Do I admit that the Minister is boring or dearly beloved? She asked her to get married (nice, right?), But now she says she will marry her and apparently does not contradict any way around her. But the girlfriend saves them on the altar and drives them home, because they do not fully acknowledge them, especially because they wreck their love for life. Has a baby In the final scene, they have left home in the home, drinking, smoking and cooking at the wheelchair. I do not care, it's bad. I left the ridiculous moment of lesbian and red-bellied cancer.
