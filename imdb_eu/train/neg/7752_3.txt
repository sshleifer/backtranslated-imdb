She is talking about a devilish sabretooth on a playground where she is looking for teens. As there are no rules, they enter a building and start to die. Deaths are cursed and silent. But at least it had a better effect on sabretooth. I gave him three because Stacy was there and I loved the movie Sabretooth. I thought it was good, but some deaths were out of the screen. There was a silent scene where the two teenagers kissed and sabretooth pulled out and the boy left behind his girlfriend, who was totally fake to look for red bodies. Then, sabretooth drowned the grid and led the kids head off. The final death of the owner was completely false. They were also stupid deaths, who crossed the mouths of the states' teeth and suspended there, and there is a scene where a goth girl loses her contacts and does not have to find her. The movie is stupid and it's time to lose.
