Pardon me about the obvious, but some good films and some bad films. Of course, these two broad categories are included. The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars are in good condition. At the other end of the spectrum there are movies that do not need to mention that name. Sometimes, however, someone creates a wonderful movie. A movie that must be a movie that can be horrible. A movie that's over evil. This movie is Maiden Voyage. <br /> <br /> In short, Maiden Voyage is a luxurious cruise ship that kidnaps the evil owner and the bad guy who claims abuse. Of course, a table is an American hero, with a sculptured jaw and a breast sculpture that saves the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production that places new depths on it. Everything is bad. They breathe the play, the direction and the plot. In short, it is an insult to the mind of the unhappy spectators. An American viewer would be angry too. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's bad. <br /> <br /> I'm going to face the temptation to write down a list of things that were annoyed about that movie. . However, it should be a good example of what I mean as a result of his ending lie. <br /> <br /> Imagine being evil in your mind that you are malicious and leave in a peaceful sea in a calm sea. You meet the heroine that plays the bombs. The hero said he would throw the bombs and dive into the boat. What would you do? I do not know for you, but I can throw it as far as possible to the sea. This is not it. Our hero swims away and then tries to disarm the results with unfortunate bombs (for him). He said enough. One of the deaths was worthy of mention in the Darwin Prize website and could be a good conclusion to the production team's lifestyle.
