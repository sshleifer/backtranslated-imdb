After about half an hour the film that stays is worth it. In a bar they start entertaining conversations and the story is fun and good. Well, I can say it will not come. For a few minutes a movie that reacts to your patience and the actors will be ruining a movie that is embarrassing, it will probably not be happy to witness it. <br /> <br /> I heard a conversation that the director wanted to point out in this movie the feeling of loss of personality, as he himself says, most people in this globalized world experience. I was surprised to hear that. I live in the same world that lives? I agree that a lot of people walk with me with the same clothes and the music itself and all of them, but that does not feel like I'm losing my personality. What do you think about Khrzhanosvky, the clothes we wear and the movies we see are more than just what we are? Is it a headache or is it? <br /> <br /> My vote is good: the good start of the movie helps 1, 4 a decent one is my conclusion.
