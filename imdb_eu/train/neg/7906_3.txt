It's not a blow to Korman, which was very funny at Carol Burnett show. Mel Brooks was also a good-natured character in the movies ("Anxiety great" is recalled). However, there is no person who can take a movie with a movie that has less. This is a "Gremlins" basically based on the traditions of "Critters" and "Ghoulies". It was not very good, it was paired with "Ghoulies", but gave a lighter pitch to the movie, which is as dark as that movie. In fact, this one is very light and smooth and, unfortunately, there are many jokes. Although I scored a score of 3, this is a worse "Gremlin" because it is also a worse movie. If you've seen Mystery Science Theater 3000, you know what you're talking about ... "Hobgoblins" wicked. This one has found a small creator in an underground space (I've seen this movie once and for a long time, I do not remember everything clearly) and it's kind of fun. However, this creature becomes pleasant and, of course, it is more and more that is the movie. More than one stroke of the Template section is missing, and it's really a shame to play Korman's evil brother. Let's jump sooner, but you can only watch it for the shots.
