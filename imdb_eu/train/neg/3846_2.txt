W. Somerset is a Classical Englishman of The Human Bondage in Maugham. If so, there are many versions of the missing movie here. The appealing feature of Phillips (Leslie Howard) Mildred (Bette Davis) is very inexplicable, so that the scenario resembles a subsequent relationship with a human relationship. Being a family lawyer I've heard a lot of accounts; He describes himself as a noble and always righteous man, and the woman is an infernal who is not intended to be human. <br /> <br /> In fact, the filmmaker's unwillingness to laugh at the hypotheses of a society, is an uncomfortable movie to watch. Phillip will also give Mildred a precise relationship with a baby, but a real big point when Phillip leaves Mildred annoyed, he is angry with the result of his apartment, with the results that can be predicted. Bette Davis was a bit attractive for her five years of life, but it did not happen at the time. Specifically, the character of Baby Jane, who played thirty years later at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Howard's character is always dressed up and in perfect attire. Phillip tells me he wants half-respectability. Someone like that could not run a woman with a Cockney accent race quite quickly. Phillip is a student for most films; Such a person would be more believable if he was younger, and they often reflected the low income and self-esteem (English Raskolnikov). And Mildred is balanced by giving it a charm.
