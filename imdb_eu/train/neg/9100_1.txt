Christ, God ... He was surprised, because we see it unbelievable and surely wrong, because it extends with all the abilities and abilities of the Galapagos turtle turtles. Are they such things? Does this movie really exist or is it the unknown guinea pig of some international drug companies? I do not know that coffee is unnoticed with a dangerous hallucinogen? I have seen a lot of movies and I've seen a lot of bad movies, but I have not prepared them; at the end, I was a bitter and crazy boat, they put my teeth like a dog on the carpet, the claws of the walls, until the wounds bent. I asked him to be desperately looking for mercy (I did this, I do not know), and he was eager to wake up with Ozu Yasujir≈ç's soothing bubble. Jesus wept sweet, memories ... they sometimes go back to me. When I am able to handle at least one of the most vulnerable in my presence. I get scared, I break tears, I cool my nails until my hands slathered with blood, but I can not quite banishing huge flashbacks until my mind. I'm haunted I'm damned. I'm a man's shell. <br /> <br /> Here I suggest users that I am not only experiencing this terrifying experience, that is, only two things can be said: a) movies, in fact, or b) I am the international conspiracy of the synonymous proportions I am a victim of one legion. Certainly, it seems like some people have liked it, or at least not let it be traumatized. They may be part of the operation. God is cursed, maniac! God forbid all these Hell !!!!!!
