If you are studying Welles and you want to see how far you want to get to Kane, it will prove this movie. The excitement that maneuvering for self-centered protagonists is inexpensive, not to explain how the half-baked model has fallen, from the revelation of the absurd absurd theater and the wondrous explanations. Do not take it as I had the high score of this movie in db. I guess there are many old Welles and Hayworth fans.
