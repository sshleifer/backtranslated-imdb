It's okay. I really tried to get the real EVP movie movie out of the way. I reasoned hell, I do not believe in vampires, but I still like Dracula, so I could live it. He is capable of acting and acting, but he does not really catch it. There are several "leaps" moments, and I have looked and I thought "yes, I did not expect" at least not jump. <br /> <br /> In addition, the resolution does not make sense. The strength behind this seems to be capable of doing things, why should it be okay to use a proxy? Moreover, the final caption was absurd. They clearly put "give film as a part of a true claim to credibility", but working for it must really be in the beginning. But they can not be put off because they leave them on the plot ... sticking to the end appeared like a rod.
