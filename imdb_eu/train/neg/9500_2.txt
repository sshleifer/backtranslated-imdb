This movie is very bad. The play is very strange, except for Michael Ironside. I do not know the story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two Mc-Gangs. He comes to a town and suddenly chooses to fight against the indigenous people who want to land. He said that he was an Indian who came home to the home, I did not hear the movie, if it were not, it is clear. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco was a bad actor. Hard and ugly She also liked her lines. And we would not talk to Sean Young, it was not my favorite actress, but she plays Indian women who are in love with Bolt (Grieco). It's shameful. <br /> <br /> When I rented it, I chose Amber Pays and Subterfuge. I chose Michael Ironside. Perhaps I should take Subterfuge. <br /> <br /> Do not see this unless Richard Grieco looks like a sneaker with sunglasses. <br /> <br /> I will soon get you in the list on the list. I have it at home. I wrote when I saw the movie.
