This movie is very bad, with a script full of memorable lines and bad performances. Special effects are also bad (I do not see the worst thing I've seen) and they're so believely listening to music. Two short subjects (30 seconds or more) are constantly repeated throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In the end, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
