this is the only movie that I have ever shot. bad performance - bad plot - bad smelting - bad management - bad cinematography - those who plan to make a bad image could not do a better job. I hope they will be proud of their turkey. It's amazing that anyone ever associated with this movie was ever hired in Hollywood. do not waste your time!
