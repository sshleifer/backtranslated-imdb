Thumb idea is not the winner for the second time. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb Wars. Especially, I think Mr. Oedekerk works much less in the shipment of the Titanic. Unlike Star Wars, the Titanic movie (still?) Is not a cultural myth and references to much less have resonance with the audience. <br /> <br /> ThumbTanic's holes are full and there's nothing wrong with jokes. For example, the hero is not the promotion of the hero that cleans along the scene at "the end of the boat" - it's not fun. But think about yourself: "Have I missed something in the original movie?". There were too many of these baskets without rooting (cf arachnid). <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the shipbuilder's shipment sentiment and fun. It was also fun to have the movie blocker want to go "faster", as it was running like a manioc, "everything" could be "faster", the ship's sinking and dying. Such a joke meant something in the Titanic context and humor was given to the Thumbtazy. <br /> <br /> "media" still has fun, faces and voices. Props and sets and CG animation are worth it. Generally, ThumbTanic demonstrates that ferociousness will only work, but the film still retains fun and anger at the end.
