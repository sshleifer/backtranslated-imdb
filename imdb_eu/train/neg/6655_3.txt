The salvo of this rugged melodrama is the southern French landscapes and the voice of the song Nana Mascouri. Stephanie Powers is not a treachery and betrayal of a false accent. As it has been indicated, is it too old to play at the age of 18 and how old is the young universe with a granddaughter in college? Lee Remick is good, although he has not been in his last years. Joanna Lumley is used with great talent and she is always looking for a young man whose elderly son (Robert Urich) is finally married to Amona Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's incessant arrogance asks you what women have seen. I do not know how the viewer could be with his excessive portrait? The most credible performance given by Ian Richardson, which looks like the rest of the works. The beautiful man born of this emotion is still a terrible event, they must wait patiently to endorse their affection. Anyone who thinks that Robert Urich, the only excellent Stephanie Powers, had admitted her endless wedding proposals for some decades ago? The WW2 commitment between the Wehrmacht and Markesa is plummeting. First of all, the Germans did not occupy the French provinces until the end of the war; Vichy was controlled by the French puppet government. We have seen an attack on the French resistance at Mistral's house, after which, under a bridge under a bridge awaits a heavy Nazi soldier waiting for them to be struck and destroyed? If you want to see a good series set in a foreign country, do not see Mistral's daughter. A better alternative would be The Thorn Birds.
