There is no review worthwhile, except for warning potentials. The ghost story about an actor who is shooting in the Second World War is a bit generic. There is no fear, there is no suspension or surprises. A surprising moment that seems astonishing. The visual style is very flat and dull, although it may be beautiful. The story never comes together, and the movie is just a bust. 4/10.
