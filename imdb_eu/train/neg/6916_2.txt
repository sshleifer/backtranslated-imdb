When I heard that I had great hopes back in 2001, when I read "Devil and Daniel Webster" I had a child and it seemed very interesting to me. They changed the story they did not have much sense. In the story, the famous lawyer Daniel Webster was a new lawyer. He is a film editor. A lawyer is more interested in being replaced by Jabez Stone's devil (a man in the story, but a woman in the film) on a trial in their souls. As an editor, Daniel Webster does not seem to have a dexterity. <br /> <br /> It's a great time except Alec Baldwin and Dan Aykroyd. These are two of our favorite actors, who made a great job on this movie. They thought they were making a comedy, but the movies were more than a comedy. This is partly because the movie was filmed with a specific vision, and another was re-edited. That is why it's amazing that it has been consistent. I was surprised when I watched many of the SNL movie members, who believe that it was originally filmed to think they wanted to be a comedy. <br /> <br /> All I did not say was absolutely terrifying, but it was not very good. I can return for half an hour and do something else. The end was particularly disappointing. As in the original story, Daniel Webster defeated the devil in the trial. The owner begins the movie again ... literally, we will return to the first scene of Jabezen, and then the movie ends. The first scene of ownership seemed to have been reproduced again and was called to the end. There is no indication for the benefit of the knowledge or experience gained by the owner, so who should say that he has not repeated his mistakes, and perhaps an endless loop repeatedly? It was very disappointing and had no sense. A decent boot and everyone's performance except Baldwin and Aykroyd, this is the only thing that does not have a whole sandwich of beans.
