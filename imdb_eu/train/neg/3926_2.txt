This Italian movie is a skin-care TV series. <br /> <br /> The VHS box said it rated "R", but the real ribbons inside said that it was "X." This is a much more meaningful one, because there is a short moving scene that has been moving and, in the dark, Marishcka Detmers, the Dutch actress, could have found out about all the sexual intercourse - and, yes, I could see her penis in her mouth. I read somewhere, I said it was the first time I made the "main actor" on that screen. <br /> <br /> Detmers does nude in the parade in several scenes, but his face was better than the body, it was beautiful. Unfortunately, the movie is ugly ... it's lost in real time, and it's definitely not advisable to look like Detmers.
