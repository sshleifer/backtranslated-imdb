It's fun, when you stop and think: fans of horror fans have a high-end love and perseverance for those who scare the lights of the sun. Texas String MASSACRE can give birthdays, but among us (the faithful) does not feel the true love of Gunnar Hansen's love of BRUTAL MASSACRE, or Ken Foree, the deciding original hero of DAWN OF. BIRTHDAY? Remake woke up with his camera and encouraged me (like Tom Savini's kameo); I do not love you. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you're wandering (unless you're down the wind ...). These are the Horror Heroes. Many of these collected in a single movie show is hardly ever known (I think, at least, in my opinion). If the writer (author) had such a huge role. Maybe somebody else, on the line somewhere, will try again. Provided that there is no half effort (for example, SANTIAGO CAPITAL, for example).
