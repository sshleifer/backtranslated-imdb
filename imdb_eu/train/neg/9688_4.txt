Greenaway's film is clear, nonsensical and innovative. However, its style and grammar originate and reminds viewers of films during the First World War of War: Frame composition, use of the central film, static camera. This is a great way to go against major films, but it's not new. Maybe TS Eliot is like another "innovator", it draws more from the past, as if it were a real innovator or rather than progressing forward. <br /> <br /> However, Greenaway's biggest blank does not write. His dialogue and plot is a mechanical and logical structure, but Brecht has no other dramatic logic. As this weakness is evident, its humor, that is to say, makes sense and logical, so the joke is dead before delivering it. The result is tedium: if it's not funny, it failed: ask a comedian to justify his action if the viewer does not respond. Perhaps the reader's director Freud can learn something from the mood. Eventually, as with Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated her actors over the years to operate like clones. They talk about lines that are bored and dull in the air like a teen narcissistic. <br /> <br /> Although this film looks like design and lighting, it's wonderful.
