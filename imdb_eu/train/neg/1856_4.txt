I'm so happy and amazed that this movie is very interesting! Jack Frost introduced me to A-pix recreation and distributed movies and, without exception, everything that this company deals with is crap. First and foremost, that's very important, never watch this movie as simple! Why do you want to? Unlike other bad movies, I feel this was deliberately bad. I can not figure out how the snowman is fake, and that's why it's always short-lived, the way it's best! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaaay better than Michael Keaton's crafted piece, which is a good movie, and it's as bad as that version.
