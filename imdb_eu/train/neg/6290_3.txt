Summary: It's Ron Mel's marriage. They love it deeply and they are sure to be perfect for each other, even though they have been filled a few months ago. Todd, brother of Ron is not so happy. Fear is that the wedding is threatening to be a cushioning for the family business and decides to organize Ron's bachelor party. But his real plan is to put Ron in a dangerous situation, he will receive evidence and Ron and Mel will raise them. <br /> <br /> Notes: Being a sequel to classic comedy, but not funny. Especially as a puberty spectacle and an excuse for young women to offer women's outfits. In fact, it is almost impossible to say that there are many who can be there, because they are everywhere. Unfortunately, this can not be accepted as one of the signs of his movie. Even though it is not enough. <br /> <br /> It has three rich points, but, in truth, three better actors than the script. Actress Josh Cooke is really impressing with a common sense. I know Sara Foster has a lot more talent than such films, and Emanuelle Vaugier seems to have a lot more talent than this movie. <br /> <br /> Kindly absent jokes. Actually, there are few jokes too. It's not fun <br /> <br /> 3/10
