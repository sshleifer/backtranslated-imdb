Okay, first of all, Steve Irwin, be quiet. Many fans love you. Now ... the movie was not at all a movie. "The Crocodile Hunter" was a television show that was playing, teaching bad guys and bad leadership when Steve captured or taught us. It was funny as a search engine / specialist. It lacks millions. But the whole movie was a big mistake. The plot was so broken, it was hardly there. The casting was horrible. The performance was not even worth the elementary school-level actress. It is necessary to pass the direction. If you do not get decent performances from your actors, although it's bad for the script, you should not be good at first. I have written a better writing. I have never wanted to watch this movie. Of course, I saw $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son). With friends they emphasized Scooby Doo Live Action instead of watching this. My son, very discriminating, liked the movie well, but he has never wanted to see it again. If you want good memories of Steve Irwin, buy her series on DVD. Avoid this movie like plague. When I was Steve, I know I would not want to remember for this movie. Honored him: Avoid this movie!
