New York, I Love You, or rather Manhattan. Sometimes I Love Your Love At Your Love Love, telling a story and telling the situation is an example of difference. However, look at the two segments of the movie, Ethan Hawke cigarettes a woman on the street and conversations with sexy talkative talk, and another is trying to get a movie along with Orlando Bloom, his director has a great request for Dostoyevsky two to read books. The latter is not an excellent story, at any moment, beginning, half, and ending, at least as it tries to get composers, Dostoevsky throws it on his lap and eventually helps (and maybe even). something more) to a girl talking to herself and the director. The scene of Ethan Hawke, however, is nothing like it, and it feels like adding or directing a filmmaker who has added or directed a filmmaker (or indeed, before Sunrise and Reality Bites) to Hawke). <Br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Another one (ie Bradley Cooper, Drea DeMatteo, Hayden Christensen, Andy Garcia, James Caan, Natalie Portman ...). There are not so many films * Manhattan * that are almost always located, not Queensland or Staten Island or Bronx (though not, for example, Harlem or Washington Heights) in New York, which is missing a lot of diversity. some No imagination is found in Spades in Paris better or worse. Mostly unrelated to New York, except for references, and the worst (Julie Christie / Shia LaBeouf segment) is not incomprehensible at the enormous level. <br /> <br /> So, first of all, wait for television and do your best to get in and out of the movie: that is, three scenes: the Bloom / Christina Ricci segment is charming; Brett Ratner's segment (yes, X-Men 3 Brett Ratner); With a very funny story, a girl goes to a girl on a wheelchair; and an elderly old couple Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman to celebrate his 67th anniversary in Brooklyn. Everything is missing, although Natalie Portman's first feature was directed by a brother Hughes (Allan) on the screen. A mixed bag will be lightweight: it's like having to search in a bag of stuffed peanuts, to find just a few almonds left.
