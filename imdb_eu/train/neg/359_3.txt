I have seen the endless thinking and final considerations of the movie, but I do not remember that I remember any movie that has been suicidal. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers clearly had hope. The big tour would surprise all of us ... and he did it, but maybe the director did not expect it. I was amazed that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had a lot to do with this turkey, either individually or collectively. <br /> <br /> The film was created until the last thirty minutes and I liked it. The story happened and the film was a general character. But when it was turned, plots and incoherences were obvious, misunderstood the reason behind revenge, and the way that Bobby Earl was so well executed was very scarce. It is worse, after the tour, the rest of the film was completely predictable. <br /> <br /> Harris gave him a great performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman, who never gave up bad performance, even though the movie is not great! So everything starts well and reveals the interest of the audience. In the last 30 minutes, it is one of the most memorable nose in the history of cinema.
