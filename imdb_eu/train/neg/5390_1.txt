Do not be afraid, it is not afraid, nor a movie. I recommend continuing to see the 82-minute defeat. The only reason that deserved a star was the presence of Chris Pine. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. Wait patiently, flashed on a twist, you have a surprise trace, a hope to emerge from the ground - but not. <br /> <br /> <br /> The characters give their rhythms in their actions and they still do not have time to develop, vaguely editors and shameful writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful (bring teen rock rock ) state. The only thing that could make a mistake would be to add "ethnic" ethnic lies. <br /> <br /> Their encounters are short and confusing obstacles (whether human or physical). <Br /> <br /> Chris Pine keeps the surface above the surface while a miserable lightweight is drowned. Lou Taylor Pucci was not able to have a dryer going on in the desert after Keanu Reaves Navada in summer. <br /> <br /> Watch 'The Road', watch '28 days later ', watch TV per day ... but this one; I confess to you It gets bored, unlike the one you believe in the film, this movie is not cured.
