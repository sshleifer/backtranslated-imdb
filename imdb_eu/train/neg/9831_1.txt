I tried to watch this movie without being able to really sit through it, because it is supposed to have a good message; The problem is, of course, that it arises from a particular interpretation of the Scriptures. An interpretation, in my opinion, will deceive many people. In addition, I'm a movie maniac and acting on this movie was totally unacceptable. I never wanted negative scores about movies. So if you want to constantly preach the unmanageable ones, by the way, get this movie. This comment warns people who love or love scifi because the title will deceive a lot of people. This film was unfortunate, because it had the basic ideas and the possibilities failed. For the only quality of the film, I realize that this "Time Machine" would probably appear before the strange behavior of his future.
