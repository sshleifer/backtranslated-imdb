Here again is another Diane Lane movie, where her husband cheats. Is this the only role to play? This time it was established in 1969 and the husband blurs the blouse to the man. I'm not surprised, because it's so predictable. Then her husband crazy and throws milk. I would not be amazed if I had slept with milk. I would not be surprised when I slept with the ice cream man, because this film is very boring. Then, after throwing the milk, he feels he feels and he blurs the man again. Duh. Then, while he is doing it, his son falls asleep. My mother always told me that the wasps nest was not thrown into the rocks. The mother of the children did not say this time, the blouse was busy with the man.
