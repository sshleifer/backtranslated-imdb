I was looking forward to seeing another good role with Amanda Peet, after renting the "The Whole Nine Yard" recently, easily renting, by the way, but this is not the case. <br /> <br /> I remembered it. The trailer called "Whipped" was somewhat fun and that three New Yorkers overpowered the three plots for twenty years and it was well worth the manipulation of Peet and the charming manipulation. So, in the afternoon I persuaded two people to see the movie with me. This review is my penance. <br /> <br /> In the first act we have three ring chops, and we conclude them in a dinner. It can be fun or at least say it's pathetic. Was there a promising quality about three men and their encounters? <br /> <br /> [And I'm not happy to consider movies that are commonplace, I wondered why no one was at the table when they talked about sexual and scandalous details. Do they do it every single hour at the same dinner? You think someone could complain. Oh, wait, I forgot: two other dinners are noticed in a scene. But this is just a configuration for a stamp. All other people in the restaurant are deaf.] <br /> <br /> The second action is that three rings fall into Mia and then they are developing brain rot, which occurs between those that really do not ask what they are asking each other. . And I asked myself, as I saw, what kind of quality it sees with a longer date than it? Does it develop with brain corruption? Eric's character, married friends, wanted to become something more than just this actor. Its mission is to provide advice on getting married. But why do they worry about not talking to him? And his advice? Sheeesh! <br /> <br /> The third event decides what plot is there, but at that moment I was looking at my watch. My friends told me that they were waiting for something fun to happen and I should be in agreement. Everything explains the Scene that was appropriate and explained all the questions about the whole movie and mysterious conversation sections, but we came from the list. ("Oh, I agree, that's why Brad and Jonathan say this ...") <br /> <br /> What we did laughter was more fun than the plot's stupidity. The credit-outs were not very fun too. In the end, I do not want to leave anything except to applaud this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3
