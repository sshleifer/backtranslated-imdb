In a recent biography of Alec Guinness I could not find too much about Paris To Love. I'm sure Guinness made the movie for a trip to Paris. The film has no other reason for existence. <br /> <br /> Of course, Paris is photographed with Guinness and the wonderful opening of her son, with Champs Elysee and Arc de Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately it's down. <br /> <br /> There is simply no chemistry between the girls who sleep a little in Guinness and Paris. According to Guinness's latest biography of Piers Paul Read, Guinness did not like the girl, and her behavior was not done. With regard to what Odile Vernois was thinking of as her co-star, there is no record available. Both sprouts have as much neutron cats like two. <br /> <br /> Guinness has a good moment directly from her Ealing comedy movie, when she tries to retrieve a badminton shuttlecock from a tree. But I did not have to wait for the movie. <br /> <br /> At least Alec traveled to Paris.
