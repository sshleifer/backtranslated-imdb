When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was a musical. Like "The Harvey Girls". It is not. It's too much cooked milk that knock on the kitchen ceiling and they were pried off and crushed. There is no music, not a period, but it is not possible. <br /> <br /> The patriarch James Woods tells her the eldest son of her three daughters, a little child who has been Barbara Stanwyck, to keep her family name. and the house <br /> <br /> So we think it will be a historical tale of generations. And in a short time. The cold fighting lawyer George Brent becomes a story of fighting against Stanwyck. Why is it so dead? Well, why? As Stanwyck learned in a curious sequence of flashbacks, he thought he could finally earn money (his sisters and even, of course) marrying. Brent was the country's principal lawyer, someone accepted himself <br /> <br /> He thought he was eight years old when he was thinking of the child's child. , yes ... you know, the wedding was in a hurry and they created together for a short time. <br /> <br /> His sister loves Gig, a painter. Young, played by Gig Young. The other sister wants to take her. Etc., etc. <br /> <br /> It's messy and unengaging. It's just behavior, but logically or credibly.
