Okay, I overcame a great performance. Lil Kim overcame some cannon and did not move my arms or hands, I overcame them, I've gone through colored contacts. <br /> <br /> This is what killed me: Four roses arguing on the scene sitting on the table. Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun got up and then Lil Kim got up to break the hostilities, saying "Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, hold. Leave CHILL OUT here for the hot season." I am a fan of the Western film genre, and I have never heard such speakers in one of Clint Eastwood's films. <br /> <br /> If anyone thinks he deserves more than 1 movie worthy of it, tell me another movie. It's worse than Roses de la Gang. <br /> <br /> I am.
