The film industry is a delicate business - decisions must be taken and all involved have a private life. The thesis of this intense attempt to make an "intuitive" film film is very original. And indeed, there was no better evidence of industrial stupidity than Anouk Aim√©e and Maximilian Schell were caught by this pardon. Thinking about talking about heads: "Do I have to pay a lot for a study or an indie article and the role of my artistic art?" "Make the latter please." Or: "Our relationship is not only a professional but a private one. It's a complex situation to handle, right?" "Yes, dear." Dialogues include palm trees, hotel portals and movie posters for Americans (there is no Croisette film in the US). Recurrent sleep is inevitable, feeling like a 100-minute movie. Jenny Gabrielle is not impressive in the framework of justifying her presence.
