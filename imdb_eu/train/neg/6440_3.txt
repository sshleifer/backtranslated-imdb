I've seen this worst Wrestlemania. It really was not stressed. The card guy, I thought it was pretty good, but all the games seemed short. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit vs. MVP one of the best matches. He took Benoit. I just did not think that MVP was very good, but saved Benoit's game. <br /> <br /> Kane vs Khali Wow, these two boys are not mixed. Or maybe Khali and any other person does not mix. Awesome match <br /> <br /> Melina vs. Ashley I am not a fan of fighting women. <br /> <br /> ECW Originals vs. New Breed I was excited about this game until I saw it. . Really, really disappointed. Edge vs. CM Punk vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy vs. Kennedy vs. Finlay vs Randy Orton So far MITB is the worst. Simply leave a huge giant, ring many people. It's just live. <br /> <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley vs Umaga O.K. It's not very spectacular, but not the worst night. <br /> <br /> Batista vs. Undertaker was perhaps the best game of the night. Very, very, very nice to see something good to change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs Shawn Michaels I think this game is worth the end. People make a case for Batista vs. Undertaker, but this game was just as good. However, I'm angry at winning every Cena game. He's old Now, I must say, I think this match is the best of the night, but I'm a fan of Shawn Michaels, and I am a bit of a supporter. Batista vs. "The taker may be better, but I'm a supporter, so ... sorry. The last ones, definitely, were the best games of the night and everything else was overcome.
