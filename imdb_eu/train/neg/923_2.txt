For some reason, many young couples passing through the Alps of Italy split up to reach the first outer appointment. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters into a cave, finds the skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and has the spirit of "Tyranus" when he puts a helmet on his body. Afterwards, during the rest of the films, he goes through the movie to hunt his friends and cut off their legs and add fuel to the demonic "Demonicus" deadliest. Full Moon release of this movie is stupid, meaningless, with a stunning performance and sounds (Los) Angeles National Forest is a bad example of Italy. However, the scale that is necessarily laughed is quite high, above all thanks to its lead capacity. They were spoiled by the ridiculous faces of the Kenyan, which were wounded by the weeds that were brimmed with sunlight, or the neurotic latent Latin measure with demons and resurrection. Well, at least not all the rest of the rest of the boring cast is most.
