After reading another comment I had to write review of this movie, this is Sidney Poitier's best movie. Poitier returned over a decade in the movie theater, and it is clear here. 11 of his films are quoted on Wikipedian and do not include them. They are once again in the list of 100 AFI 100 inspirational films, including none. Berenger and Poitier, rube and city slicker, began to catch a dangerous psychopath ahead of Canada's crossroads. Some of the comedy's essays on this film fail and Berenger and Poitier's links were dull and misleading (with a completely innocent script). Kirstie Alley (as kidnapped) was underestimated and almost completely ignored. There are some attempted trials, for example, if you intend to guess what the killer of 5 men in the fishing trip is (all of them are cast types). I understand the appeal of most outsiders. I invented it, and I did not feel like it. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Berenger, see the Sniper (1993), even if Billy Zane tries to taste her things. It's much better. In the end, I'd give it to Shoot to Kill 3/10. It's not daring, and it's very easy for me.
