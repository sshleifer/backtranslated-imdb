This is the second movie that I watched Horrorfest last weekend. They were better circuits. I only see that production must be quite limited. I will confess that the story was interesting, but eventually it sparked for me. Each of their rudimentary features was even more annoying when we were not able to understand or understand the characters. It should also be mentioned that a 12-year-old boy was performing as a Sheriff. The only reason that was sitting around the cinema was to know what was a secret, all that was not interesting. Some family reflections would help, but they did not seem like a family at first. <br /> <br /> For me, this film is very amateur and I can not see it too. On DVD The four score could have the initial potential of the story. He was with Horrorfest.
