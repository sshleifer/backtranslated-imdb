The reviews that say this movie are very good with the boats. This movie does not pleased Leonard's 6th team, Battlefield Earth and Gigli. These movies were incredibly fun, but this dinosaur star is a pile. I have not had much pain since I saw Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before the review, tell me the story. Theodore Rex is a $ 35 million bust that he did not want to put on the New Line Cinema theaters. Videos directly reduce the losses that live directly on decades during direct video engagement. Whoopi had to be in this disaster after a great check. <br /> <br /> Argument: the millionaire was able to kick the rockets that killed the sun to kill the sun. Katie Coltrane, a female police officer and a stupid dinosaur named Theodore Rex, are grouped together with enthusiasm for stopping the death of a friend from a dinosaur. <br /> <br /> We will give you the movie that robs the plot early. the whole mystery movie Then you have to face that this movie is really horrible. Whoopi is seemingly disturbed and is trying to fly, but in vain. Theodore Rex is annoying and uses sharpened thin behavior five minutes on the screen. Most jokes threaten people and threatens people with the tail (in the accident and deliberate). I thought it was a bad robbery, but back-back to Theodore Rex: The worst movie on Whoopi's career. <br /> <br /> Let's not let anyone tell you that monsterity is pretty nice to be pleasant. I did not see it when I saw this movie. Everything I saw was written by people who had just been admired by Howard The Duck. He is humorous at this level and is Theodore Rex Barney's cousin. From the beginning to the end very painful.
