Dragon Fighter's first 45 minutes is absolutely admirable and surprising. The characters are credible and interesting. Cloning laboratories are high technology. Then everything breaks down. They start playing stupid characters, and a new subtype is created from nowhere, a critical fusion reactor (which is supposedly "today"), whose only argument is justification to kill the dragon - it just does not. The finish is very weak. He started thinking about a wrong boss. <br /> <br /> Except the characters in Dean Cain, the Russians play it. This creates some strange situations and details, despite the fact that the character that plays Vessel Dimitrova, "Bailey Kent" (and, above all, * Spanish!)! Thanks to the start, I used to upgrade this movie 5, but it was much more depressing than that, so I only give it 4.
