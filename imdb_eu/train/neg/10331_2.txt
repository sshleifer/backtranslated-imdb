God, I was bored when I saw this pilot. I expected a long time as a fan of James Cameron (and I did not have a "Titanic", maybe I would add it), and I thought it was a quality guarantee in the name of the credits (then again). He also wrote Leaden Strange Days ...). But things failed approximately at about two hours at any time. At that time, he went beyond almost two lines of synopsis, and I would be very hard to tell you about the coherent plots of all the parts that have not taken anywhere. In addition, I do not believe that acrobatics exceed the regular "A-Team" passages. As for Alba, it's very beautiful, of course, but the whole movie shows one single-faced solo show (sharp and fluffy), I'm going to be bored that I'm bored very soon by a "attitude" of his favorite. This, Mr. Cameron, can count you!
