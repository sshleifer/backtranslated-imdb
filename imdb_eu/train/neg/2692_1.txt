Nacho Vigalondo is very popular in Spain. The bad showman that feels evil is ... Very embarrassing. Nacho made some television ad. I remember Nacho Paul Mc Carney looking around Madrid (Mc Carney's CD collection). <br /> <br /> This little movie is like Nacho's commercial: bad story, bad management and awesome performances. I can not believe that such a hideous movie was at the Kodak Theater. Poor Dark ... <br /> <br /> Nacho made his film for his wife, for those producers of 7:35, who were in good relations with Spanish TV men.
