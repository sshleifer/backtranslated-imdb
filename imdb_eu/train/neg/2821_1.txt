I only saw this movie once, and that was enough for me. The film does not give any kind of plot, and it seems that there are only a few scenes of sadistic psychic violence and nothing else. I wanted to see this movie because Zoe Trilling starred in the second "Night of the Demons"; and I wanted to see someone as normal. Unfortunately, the writing of Tobe Hooper is hardly ever started and Robert Englund has the scenery and landscapes and massive drawings of the film. Zoe, I know where you are going now; hiding this movie!
