Action, violence, sex and harsh language are things that make the characters in the whole movie. And all they do is done without reason. Mark L. Lester (not) is known for his violent films (for no reason) (Commando, The Base). The story is strange but stupid. Actors are very comfortable playing their stupid characters ... I do not know they are stupid, but I mean they are very bad actors. A low budget B-series action movie is unknown. If you saw anything similar to Delta Force, Drive, The Patriot, Sanctuary or Misbegotten ... do not rent ... and, in a way, do not rent any movies that I mentioned ... 1 and a half.
