I really wanted The Pillow Book. An interesting story, the scheme of interesting characters, Ewan MacGregor is completely glorious. Unfortunately, I hate each minute. Greenaway's film was so special and not for the best of film. I do not even get into the deep conduct of Vivian Wuen. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on the 4,000 million visuals that show the lyrics of the window and the calligraphy at the bottom of the screen. It seems that he has presented his own story and has lost sight of the development of the plot and has been included in the ornaments that have nothing to do with anything unrelated. It's like presenting a portrait of John Singer Sargeant "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" Sparkling letters. <br /> <br /> This movie may be the loss of the director's author's situation, instead of worrying and incredibly beautiful. In the hands of another director (Jeunet? Coppola?), It could be a masterpiece. By Greenaway, it's down to fine arts, which are considered very important.
