Here, many other reviewers, including those who respect their opinions, are in dire danger to Europe. Personally, I did not like it. At an atmospheric age there is an incoherent attempt between sex and violence. Jess Franco works very well with her best films. Unfortunately, the honest explorer Joe D'Amato is not doing this. D'Amator's most popular films are harmful to their great coefficients. He, in his first movie, has no continuous disgusting scenes known for his notorious "Anthropophagous" and "Beyond the Darkness". In the end, it is an inconsistent film, which does not involve any way in the viewer. Not a sleaze factor, it's very boring. As I said, others have had this movie, but it seemed to me to be an excellent example of a very lazy writing. <br /> <br /> There are too many sides to the movie. Ewa Aulin ("Candy"), looks pretty hot and is often naked. However, the worship film Klaus Kinski is completely wasted in a filmless movie. He seems to be bored with the role and does not experience the incidence of his manic intensity. Music is a nice piece of play and there are some funny moments that are unwanted fun. However, this seemingly boring movie is a success. (3/10)
