When the boys and girls sing along with their love / relationship, this time only the pendant and the correct arrow are. Do you like movies really like movies? Does the fans have it? I have to say, moving the mind ... "Grease 2" is really a lame, which does not boldly, moxy or crosswords even fall into the memory of its previous ("Jaws 2" or "like" Exorcist II) Crying is dying and often dying. It seems and feels cheap, the cast is lost in the midst of manipulative and unfocused directions. For the first time Michelle Pfeiffer could listen to a lot of people and, despite not embarrassing himself, is a role to forget The lowest levels of Misfire. STARS NO ****
