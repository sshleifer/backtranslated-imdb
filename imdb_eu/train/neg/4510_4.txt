I love Geisha souvenirs, so I read the book twice; It's one of the best books I've read last year. I was looking forward to the movie and I'm afraid that reading the book may lose sight of the movie. I was not expecting a bad movie. The best parts of the book were deducted from the movie and the worst characters were Hatsumomo (Li Gong). When I have not read the book, the movie would be confusing and understandable. The graphic summary of the film "Nitta Sayuri shows how he has overcome his fishing" Forget the movie and read the book.
