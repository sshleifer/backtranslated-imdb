"Damner in Distress" is not one of the best Fred Astaire music. Although Astai's bad film also had some good times. <br /> <br /> In "Damsel", Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an amazing London music star, in a personal tour. Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine) finds herself a beautiful English successor who criticizes a lover's escape at the back of a taxi. <br /> <br /> Alic thinks Alice is that Alice's wealthy aunt needs to get married. He tries to save him from his family farmhouse, but soon he realizes that the housekeeper is making bets, where Alice Alice will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner), a lover of admiration, and Albert (Harry Watson), a young boy at home, each turns their turn and sabotage Lady Alice's romance to win Jerry. <br /> <br /> This has a lot of music problems. First, there is an argument, P.G. according to the novel. Wodehouse (wrote the script). The story is slow, painful and round. When Fred is not dancing, combining together with Fred (Joan Fontaine) or (b) Keggs and Albert together, we need to (a) run Fred's annoying scenes. <br /> <br /> Butler and home boys are particularly angry. One-dimensional stock villain characters are kind of kind of you want to punch in the mouth. You should go down on the screen and let Fred dance. <br /> <br /> Astaire is also in harmony with his regular partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is the main character of this movie and is immersed in a music scene. He has a sensible character with beautiful faces and beautiful smile. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen walk around Jerry's publicist and his secretary. The couple adds some chemicals to the plot, and Gracie has fun lines, but sometimes it's too annoying. <br /> <br /> George Stevens's film director is not right. Sometimes, cinematic cinema is a horrible and focal point. There are many outer scenes in vanguard streets to persuade audiences in London and not in Hollywood. (They needed to use tons of ice in this movie). In a positive sense, the songs of George and Ira Gershwin are superb and they have become the standard of classical songs. And, of course, the movie dances are extraordinary, thanks to Astaire and Hermes Pan's choreographer. <br /> <br /> But music and dance numbers are badly used and badly worked. Sometimes, the cast seems to start singing and dancing, yes, the time to start singing and dancing. Music numbers are randomly inserted. At some point, the boardroom goes out on the outside of the house and does not affect solitary clear grounds.) The numbers are:  "Dancing and I can not be disturbed" - Fred danced well in London full traffic. He likes a "cannon-rotary" with a double umbrella, but the number goes faster when he jumps on a bus that goes through Fred. (In Broadway's music, "Crazy For You", "Harry Groener made a much better version of this number with a group of choir girls.) <br /> <br /> " Put me on the test "- Fred, George and Gracie, English trio They dance with a trio. George and Gracie agree to step by step with Fred, but the number goes wrong, everyone does not reasonably oppose each other. <br /> <br />  "Stiff Upper Lip" (The Fun House Number) - A fun home in the amusement park, Fred, George and Gracie, are enjoying a rotating floor, swinging barrel and fun home mirrors. The movie is the best number, but is repeated regularly. <br />  "Things Are Looking Up "- Fred and Joan Fontain make their dance together in the film, dancing around, after-farm woods. Luckily, the number of dances is very simple, as Joan is not a great dancer. <br /> <br /> " Cloud Fog London Town "- Fred is on the night The mansion runs around the mist, breaking the day with the butterfly. When he first met London. Sometimes it is not certain what the path will explode. It seems the same musical number as the same. <br /> <br />  "You can get a nice job" - An excellent song is badly used in the film. In a public entertainment venue, this song Fred becomes the face of singers who are singing. Fred went in each time, as if the other singers looked at him. (Again, Harry Groener has made a better dance with the song "Crazy For You".) "Drum Dance Number" - As Fred and John are running away, Fred stops and needs the last dance number . battery group As usual, there is a large number of dances. But there's no need, except for stretching the movie. <br /> <br /> The best moment in the film, Fred decides to lift a tall stone balcony when he decides to leave a high-rise stone farmhouse to prove his love. Joan Fontaine. As he jumps from the balcony, he finds a convenient trap, that is, a trapezoid - hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather Fred's clothes actor) takes a trap and flows from it. It's worth having colors, dance numbers only on the DVD, but you owe it to the guy. He invented the remote Fast Forward button. >> The FF button allows you to jump through dull scenes of the movie to get the dance numbers.
