Well, the reason to watch it on the screen was a preview, otherwise I would never see the slogan this awesome young teenager. Do I mean we do not have enough? Scream and Scary Movie, at least, did not have serious cars! The plot is horrible, and I've seen the play. (Godzilla can only compare, that is, the only one that films the worst I've ever seen). <br /> <br /> There are many holes in the story and the girls are so much the same, you have not killed those who do not, and who does not. (And you do not care.) Denise was the only one I knew and the lesser talent I ever saw in this worst excuse of a movie. <br /> <br /> Keep away from this movie. (2/10)
