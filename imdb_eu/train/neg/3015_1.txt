This is a bad movie. Not a bad thing either. This is a bad thing. It was really painful to see. He was a huge manager, jumping a lot and the green and yellow colors that were used throughout the film make the characters sick. Keira Knightly was not persuaded as a tough dog, and I can not believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed this criminal waste celluloid. The script was horrible and the plays were like hand-written fingernails. If you have not seen it, no. You do not need anything, and you'll lose only two hours of your life watching this noise. I've seen bad movies before and have been much liked for the mistakes. That is, it's just a waste of time.
