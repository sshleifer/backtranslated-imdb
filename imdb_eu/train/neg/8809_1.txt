A couple of women who can not buy around, talk, smoke. Another woman is hiding on the wheelchair, because it is deformed, and sometimes they kill someone with some fingerprints that can feed some of this kind of human food. We do not see anyone die. Suddenly there is a body in the ground covered by a sheet of blood. I can not eat Spam through a slab, that's why. It's just a page that thinks of the Spam cover when it comes to trying to get the whole movie out of the stupidity it covers. Sometimes the chair of a "hunted" randomly inserted scene dares to torture the guy who is in the basement. Why did the guy catch him and how to sit Sit-On-The-Couch Sisters has never been explained. The scenes of the "Superhuman" are also incredible. It gives blood and fists through a wall, but who is it, or what is wrong with it, is neither exposed nor linked. <br /> <br /> There is no action, no special effect, no story. If you want to see some boring people, you need to discuss anything deeply, sitting around and eating ham and smoking, then it's 90 minutes away, for a little gun just in the corner of the street and the one that plays the aforementioned. random scene, absolutely NOT happening. (YAWN) Oh, I'm almost forgotten, you'll see some things moving, including deformed sisters, when they've just opened their apartment. There is one sitting on the couch or lying in bed.
