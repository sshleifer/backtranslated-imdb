It may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. The producer of this movie has stolen me and half my life and I want it! <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan is fun about 10 minutes. His great voice and his guilt crazy begin to age, and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse. Films were attempting to get into an old SNL line. Some have been brilliant, some have failed. It's not much in the middle of this category. Although Chris Farley is excellent, then I agree, and then not so much fun, and then dead ... so I think he has hit the whole spectrum of the whole career. <br /> <br /> Do not get this movie like a pestilence << br /> <br /> c
