The instructions on the IMDb must indicate if your comments are "spoilers". <br /> <br /> Well, the whole movie is a spoiler ... it's a story that warns of what warns, a story of a lost young man, where he does not know where he will go. <br /> <br /> I've seen this at the Tribeca Film Festival. This movie was not bad, it was very bad. <br /> <br /> Efficiently, the characters are a profoundly low-key offer, and farnsworth's performance has been particularly bad. <br /> <br /> From accented accents to a line of absurd lines, to "graphic", to repetition dialogues and scenarios ... the second is sucked. <br /> <br /> I think that "drug-based cowboy" was more demanding and more up-to-date with "touching natural killers", but it is not sensitive to first-person characters and not so. amazing (out of a few frat levels) as a staircase. <br /> <br /> more than anything, really someone needs A) edit the script <br /> <br /> (there are some things to build and in a clear way <br /> <br /> offers. ... if you try.) B) edit the movie. If it is cut to a core, it may be appropriate. <br /> <br /> I'd be less than 1 ... like something in the Kelvin ...
