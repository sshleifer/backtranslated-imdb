Feeding masses is just one of the films of the last generation film after you've won it. Suggestions? Keep high-priced dollars and let's say ancient theaters have been one for the group. Guess what land around you? Taking Zombies This time, for its originality (?) This film takes place in Rhode Island and, incidentally, I am not sure about shooting a zombie based in Rhode Island. A television controlled by the government maintains "normal" broadcasts, because the rest of the people do not believe that there is a problem in the world, that is to say, who looks or goes abroad. However, I would like to say that some of the announcements that this station broadcasts are probably a more fun part of this film. This story is quite a bit, but I do not care about it, after a while, it will not matter to you or you will sleep. In any case, it's absolutely awesome, "before seeing everything" before the camera. Believe me, you can find many other things to watch out for. 10 to 3.
