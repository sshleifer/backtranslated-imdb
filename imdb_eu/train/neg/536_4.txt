The death of a woman's (Ann) story in bed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her past thoughts. Flashbacks An Ann young girl talks about her weekend weekend at her friend Lila. At that wedding he will meet Harris, which will have an impact on his life. Through his professional life and family fluctuations, he remembers his true love. Her daughter Constance is older, she is "more responsible", she has both mums and things together. Nina is a boyfriend and boyfriend and works for work and does not have the direction of life sure. <br /> <br /> First of all, good. The film period is very large. Dresses, hair, cars, etc. They really put you in another place. And the film is very good quality. Vanessa Redgrave is very good at portraying the main character and fragile mental state when life is over. Claire Danes is beautiful and works great when she was young (and she is a great singer). Hugh Dancy brought life to Lila's brother Buddy. <br /> <br /> Now for the wicked, unfortunately, everything else. Things constantly interrupt the story as it is for us. A great chemistry between Ann and Buddy. They dance and dance. Then ... do you think that he really did not love more friends than loved and he was surprised by his pining alone. And I thought that everything "could be gay" was out of the blue and did not meet a goal. <br /> <br /> Then we have Harris. The character is made of wood and a great deal. If you knew of another genre, Harris might know that he was a serial killer. It is unbelievable to think that all the girls love each other so much (but they portray other boys as they try to make it as pretty as the mud). <br /> <br /> And the most serious problem. Why are not Ann and Harris joining? They fall down together. This great sex scene is in a muddy old gardener, after returning home to Buddy's tragic ending ... <br /> <br /> Nothing <br /> <br /> They'll meet a few years later, looking at each other , and I was not asking why. Why? The movie does not explain why they had to get married to others, and that's why I hardly felt for them. <br /> <br /> The current story is pretty boring. A good daughter and a bad daughter. Nina changes during the movie, but I do not know why. I do not know what convincing to change his life. There's a "touch" scene, where daughters link, that Ann tells a butterfly to follow. It's really mud and shy. <br /> <br /> "There is no mistake," Ann advises us. The statement is not true. And it did not appear to be true after watching the movie and not losing the talent of good actors.
