This movie is very bad, I can not believe it was filmed. People who voted for 10 or 9, 8 and 7 years are also insane? Have we watched the real movie? Or I should say it. Everything is bad in this movie. The story (is there a story?) It's not going anywhere, completely inconsistent, the performance (some interviews are just ridiculous), music score (what is this?), The edition, and especially artistic direction. a mere disaster The old film makers reminded me ... To give an example of production amateurism, the mermaid costume is a bag hanging on the pavement. I'm not joking, that is, indeed. <br /> <br /> Another example of the great mistakes we find here: in a scene, you see a woman with a pound of 200 pounds. mobile. The next shot, located in another location, will allow you to see the same woman, still speaking on her phone (!) Yes, she is far away. <br /> <br /> The money is huge and huge. Useless
