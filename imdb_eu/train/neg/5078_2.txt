The 1977 "Exorcist II: The Heretic" 1977 did not make any favors, it is hard to imagine what this incredible show of Richard Burton performs in this exquisite exercise. Before seeing all this: he plays a writer from Burton, who has the power to move himself by means of inanimate objects (and "Carrie" has no impact on Hollywood!). Although adapted from one of Peter Van Greenaway's novels, Medusa works like recycled paper, although the ending effects of the cathedral are solid (if it's typical). Dr. Lee Remick is somewhat presented, but otherwise the help is very weak. Burton is sick but tired ... he can not even save this telekinesis at this time. * 1/2 ****
