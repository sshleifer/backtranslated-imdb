This first film did not write anything to me: the main actress of the charisma. That was chemically absent, and he returned to share the screen with his main man. Romantic scenes also featured. The director could influence calculating what the actor needed. I do not know. <br /> <br /> But can it be a script? What was the chef in love with? His cooking skills and restaurant, and ultimately, himself and his farms seemed to be in love with the youngest, no one or anything else. He never persuaded me that he had fallen in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed in this movie. But do not forget to name an Oscar, so judge yourself.
