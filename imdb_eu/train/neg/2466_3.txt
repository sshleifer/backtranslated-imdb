In recent years he has been in fashion with zombie-related films, often, such as no, and other deadly people who have been eaten by meat. "Fido" is a movie that tries to avoid this movie, that's just its statement, or both ... and it enters the category of ironic zombies. Here is the joke that we find dead in the context of stereotyped, clean and stereotyped throughout history (we are a result of a great Zombie War and we are being slaughtered as slave creatures). 1950's neighborhood version. <br /> <br /> The concept is totally fun for itself, and perhaps for a five-minute comedy sketch, but it can not contain a single movie. It is repeated once again the idealized version of a small town with rotten convictions, and it loses its effectiveness. The soundtrack tunes sound continuously while the people are cannibalizing people. The word "zombie" is included in a household line that is constantly known to get a cheap laugh attempt. <br /> <br /> "The extent and artificiality of the nineteenth-century decade of the nineteenth century can not be hardened, so stylized," inspired by Pleasantville, "is so stylized that the movement of its markers in the 1950s is evident 1950 and 1959 with all the similarities that may have happened over the years, as if they were to open up the film in the 2000s as they open up more Earthly and higher levels. <br /> <br /> As the characters pop-culture in 1950's "types" represent a broad representation, It is difficult to develop large emotional investments, each of which has its character characters - Helen looks obsessed, and Bill loves golf and his death has killed his father - but they remain quite dimensional. The Billy Connolly Fido area, in the tradition of Boris Karloff's "Frankenstein", is a great green monster that does not really speak which gives it a stoness and sympathy. <br /> <br /> There are few allegories around, fetishism, racism, classicism, war paranoia, etc. really stick anything. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie does not "Look! Zombies in 'Beaver!" stopping small and medium jokes.
