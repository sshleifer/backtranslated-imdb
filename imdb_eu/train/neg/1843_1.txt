Wow It's wonderful. I was a fan of the original movie, and in the second half, I was 3rd grade, an improvement. 4.5 and Freddy's Dead were pretty bad. However, it's not as bad as Freddy Nightmares. Freddy Rod Serlingesq works as a host of this anthology series. <br /> <br /> I can admit that Freddy may have a punishment after another, but at least Freddy's appeal was filmed in films, but here they are wrong, they seem like high school productions of the horror series. The actress, if you really want to call it, after this show, of course, the paid one was in detail. I'm sure to spot two types of actors. The Hollywood stairs started from the beginning, because they would take part in the pornographic work they offered last week, or when the good actors hit Downtown Hollywood. They offered last week to not have to take porn jobs. <br /> <br /> I expected half Dana Platon guest star, but it was already dead during this production. <br /> <br /> Nancy's line for the original paraphrase of Elm St: "If you're not trying to tell me what's going on, see that."
