I can not say Wargames: The Dead Code I have ever seen is the worst movie that I had at one time or two, but I can easily say that I have ever seen the most transparent movie. A land based device was not invented 10 minutes before it was introduced more than once. There was nothing short of the movies, no obvious intelligence behind. The intention of the word or written line was completely apparent, it was impossible to "enter the film." <br /> <br /> I thought it was a lot of shame, and the audience's promises were made. much more often than I enjoy with the movie.
