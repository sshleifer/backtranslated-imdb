Skippy plays "Family Ties" like Eddie. His favorite 'metal' favorite singer, Sammi Curr, dies, stamping all of his wall murals. Later, when he gets an unknown record of his "metal" deadly idol. The first one enters revenge ideas, but then does not want Sammi to take it. This is not really the case with his main victims going to the hospital. This movie is very awesome and relates to real metal such as "Rock Star". OK, maybe much more than that piece of garbage, but I get that. And how ANYon Skippy can "fool" a guy who plays "Family Ties". I have no idea Gene Simmons's camera is OK, and Ozzy Osbourne gets consistent, which is why I applaud, but otherwise I'm not skipping this. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elise Richards gets topless, a topless extra at a pool party
