Outdoor Space Gaynigger is summarized by its name. For more than 27 minutes, the Earth man describes a space of gay men in the Earth to free women. While I see the importance of the crust, it's not really slim. It is given a comedy / joke about society and science fiction. I found myself laughing several times. So it's a success. <br /> <br /> The special effect is horrible. The ship over the territory, the stars go zoom without apparent reason. The early asteroids are fake, the equipment of the ship does not make sense, the errors in the texts are wrong, the actors do not persuade them, the characters are wrong; In general, the whole thing is not taken seriously. If you overcome all the parties that make the movie bad, it's very accessible and easy to see. Some parts are fun. But, in general, the only thing that reminds us is that it was never one of the most ridiculous concepts. <br /> <br /> If it's a short film and has some fun aspects, it's not the worst thing to watch. . But its not logical and has a long-term low value. I can not really recommend; If you see, do this for a specific concept, not for quality.
