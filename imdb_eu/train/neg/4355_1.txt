Amazing. I see many users see what this comment is about. It's really Wanna-Be-Friends - Taiwan in knockoff. The jokes are raging ... and the plot is ridiculous. Actors are struggling to have fun and, possibly, adhere to these horrible lines (if you say so). Most other users who have commented, of course, are from other planet (or at least the other continents). It is clear that due to reasons for canceling television companies, then, when they do not perform well. Does it make sense? However, clearly - even if it's raining, and there's nothing else to do with the planet ... instead of rain - it's fun.
