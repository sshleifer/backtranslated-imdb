I do not know why they made this version of "Persuasion" with a small series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I think they wanted to make a length version but, of course, a lot had to be deleted; Oh, what kind of hope was in the room floor, it was a very ingenious and beautiful nature, because it was a melodrama, rather than a fun exhibition of English habits and customs. <br /> <br /> In addition, the characters were skinny and interesting. Anne's poor streets and the captain Wentworth were just as dirty as a modern teenager (and if you are reading this modern teenage teenager, let me tell you: a man like a man like a man is NOT cool). This is a good woman from Napoleon's time he would never have done, and he certainly is not the hero of that level. <br /> <br /> Some people have said they have found this discovery; My reaction was not laughed, but the attack. The idea of ​​a corruption of Austen's work is under the scorn. <br /> <br /> It was an illusion.
