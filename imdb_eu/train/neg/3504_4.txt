I gave this show (I only saw seven episodes) four stars, because most of their jokes / configurations fail. Some are not funny directly, but some are fun, like a 12-year-old boy. Painted on a canvas, New York painter, he calls art and sells a lot of money. Silverman has got it, including a kitchen sink, while stating that some things are stuck on the wall, to try to make fun but to make it different. <br /> <br /> However, what is sometimes "not enough" is not enough, as the type of tracking continues to succeed in the good comics, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> The whole company is like potato sugar.
