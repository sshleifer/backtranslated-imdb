It's been re-edited and often confusing, the original version of the Man On Fire screen was made for at least ten years and the past year did not make any better. This is to pay attention to the movies produced by the producers who have too little money and less experience and others pay their extra pension or their drug interchange, rescuing Scott Glenn's guard for his 12 year term. A year old man, kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Italian family. An interesting job - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce have all done better, he's a bit slower and slimmer, and John Scott's excellent score (only part of Die Hard's final record) only impresses positive Tony Scott, the original selection of the director for this version, is a remake that is an improvement.
