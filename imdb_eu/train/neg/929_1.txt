My horror and horror movie, my wife and I, are really stupid to rent and make fun of our friends. We saw this in fullmoondirect.com and I decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say that movie is terrifying, I say it in a good way. It's just about everything, about acting, camera work, stories, costumes, low budget and low, but that's so good. In a scene, the actors seem to be in a place. I really hope that those who did this film would not be serious, as if it were, then it would be sad. If you want to watch the horror movies really stupid, for them to have fun, I recommend this.
