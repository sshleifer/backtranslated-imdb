Madhur gave us a powerful film in the past in Chandni Bar. His next film was one of the worst movies of all time. Apparently, he tells the story of some of the top Indian people. A man who watches another man for a movie that stops making a movie stint for sexual reasons. I wanted to write and break the DVD. With a pure story. The movie was why scenes of child pornography and disturbance. I talked slowly and I was terrified when I saw that the baby was naked. It was a very worrying thing to say, there was no need for a child to be completely naked. One of the wealthy guys kidnaps and sells foreign children to foreigners, the British man in this movie. I'm amazed that this movie is in some parts of India, Super Flop in the United Kingdom, the US and Australia. I am in the United Kingdom, and such things I get sick do not need to be released in the UK.
