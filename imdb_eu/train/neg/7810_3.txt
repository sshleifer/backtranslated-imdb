Against All Hope is a very bad film, sometimes so difficult. This is Michael Madsen's first movie, and shows that it's not very good. Some would find an abominable story; an alcoholic man realizes that his life and his family are far away, so he calls a preacher for the last aid. After telling his story about the preacher, Jesus Christ is in his heart. <br /> <br /> I really found a lot of religious scenes as Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to church; Cecil also liked knowing how his life is moving away and trying to get help, but he can only help him to help him. In the end, God helps us to go back to life without having to drink it again. <br /> <br /> This movie is not well done. Playback is bad, scripts can use some jobs and are worse than my home videos, but it has a good message. Now, being a Christian does not mean that you can stop your dependency automatically or you can cure your broken family, and Cecil will realize it and continue. In general, you are grateful for your Christian beliefs of Christianity, and if you are not, you are called to know more about faith.
