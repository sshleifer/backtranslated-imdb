The 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival did not feel like watching this movie. I have participated in this festival over five years, and sometimes I have seen poor movies. However, he has achieved the small movie "First Bite". Although shot in some beautiful locations, with its splendid and exquisite food, it captures a lot of movie plots and awesome characters, until they've been asked to finish. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Additional sub-plots, such as eating disorders, were so poorly and completely developed, and did not fit in any context that showed the beginnings of this film. <br /> <br /> Mysticism was a bad attempt. To hide the movie that does not achieve anything, it is nowhere to go and completely disrupts.
