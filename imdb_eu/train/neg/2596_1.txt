Dear God! I continued to wait until the beginning of this movie ... I then recovered ... and when I was not there, I was sitting astonished: 1) It might be bad, and it could be 2. ) I was wasting a couple of hours in plain stupidity. I had a belief that Drew could not be that bad movie ... and boy, I never lost faith! Do not worry about this! Drew tried, but the movie was not well-written, misunderstood and misunderstood! I can not believe that script ever financed! That idea had something to do with a million (the word "concept" is too big for this film, even if it's right!) And STILL is not going anywhere! It's wonderful! The other reviewer did not have the worst idea, it blends me! Believe me, because if I get worse, I wrist before I finish it!
