One of the worst films I've ever seen with a camera, the use of wonderful filters, the film was grainy, the script was awful, I mean, it was a long-awaited battle ... <br /> <br /> I've had some fighting scenes. .. <br /> <br /> <br /> Some scenes were so bad that it was comed ... So sorbo a horse and eventually riding ... LOL I mean really ... a horse? Do not forget about how the killer goes wrong on the same vehicle throughout the movie. I think that after the death of the fake federal authorities and the federal agent, ETC should continue. ETC, ETC does not interfere ...
