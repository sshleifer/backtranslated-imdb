Now I realize that I was watching this movie, I've never lost any valuable moments in my life. This movie is not only inadequate. It has never been rememorated by any commercial black statuary. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia thinks it's a race problem, like people who do not like "whites". because he has no white actors. Dear, I think that nobody likes to see dry paint is much fun and fun, and then this drivel stack is much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> Please let movies make movies.
