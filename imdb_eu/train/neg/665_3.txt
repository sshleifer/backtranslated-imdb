In Bridgeport, Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is an obsessed teenage student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow). He will check that he dies with his family to stay with him, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison forever. Three years later, Donna traumatized feels better, but still has psychological treatment and pills. During his nightly show, Bobby, with Scott Porter, and a couple of two friends, they will attend the Pacific Grad hotel. Richard, however, escaped from prison and slept in the hotel at the hotel, at Donna's hotel, shaking his hotel friends and staff. <br /> <br /> The "Prom Night" bar has been forgotten as a collection of topical originals without originality. The stupid story is superficial and foolish, as Johnathon Schaech's bad performance is the role of a murderous mad cowboy. The preview script is amazing, as it will happen in the next scenes. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Death Invites To Dance" ("The Death Invites to Dance")
