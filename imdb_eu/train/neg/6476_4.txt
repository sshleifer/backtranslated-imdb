I had so much hope in this film, because I loved the origin. Apparently, Disney is trying to improve the art of direct effects on DVD. They deserve a razzie. Several, indeed. I thought the idea was a merit, but the music was totally horrible and the story was not much better. What happened to Disney's great music in his films. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and Beast, Lion King ... even Hercules and the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Over the years, they have made so many great films, they are saddened by the fact that they are not enough secrets to perform in plays. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie is this. Not the things that come to Walt Disney Corporation.
