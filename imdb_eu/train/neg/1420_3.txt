[Later I watched this movie in a public television, so I do not know whether it's in the video.] <br /> <br /> Shirley Temple is a "Baby Burlesks" (sic). It was made at the beginning of the 1930s. It's hard to believe that letting some one of her daughters leave this small movie that takes into account this current "movie kiddie". <br /> <br /> Shirley Temple has an average of probably average. 5 year age. They are all dresses and instead of alcohol they are in the berlin that uses milk. "Cash" looks like a lollipop. <br /> <br /> Shirley speaks of the "femme fatale" sashays on the bar and talks about the suggestive comments about her (!). But Shirley does not really need her lol / money, because her bag is full of other "men". <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a small black boy makes a suggestive dance at a table in the neighborhood (!). <br /> A strange movie. . . using adult loyal role-playing conversations with a baby. Who thought of such things?
