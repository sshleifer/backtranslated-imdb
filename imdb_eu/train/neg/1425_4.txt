I do not know what HK films have been watching other reviewers, but Enter the Eagles is not at all at the top of the HK. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be glad that he could get jobs in HK, because he could not leave his paper bag in English. Shannon Lee is a good looking and fantastic fighter (even better fighting legends than his father), but his acting skills are also sub-par. In fact, all the English conversations (90% of the movie, more than Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I changed the bad conversation of the Mandarin audio and saved the misery of English redundancy. Subs. Of course, there are some decent shots (but nothing we've seen before) and good cinematography, but the visual effects are really diminishing. <br /> <br /> That said, the price of admission is worth Shannon and Benny "The Jet" for liquids. It is worth seeing and worth watching. <br /> <br /> In the end, you can see some scenes that seem "familiar", especially an outcast on the outside market (think Matrix) and Fitz diving. black helicopter covered in black (think: 2). It was worth thinking that someone thought it was at least a few things.
