A young genetic basketball player conducts research on genetic sequencing using human fetuses. He wants to be able to heal all diseases and aging. He has published his research because he has not published it, so the university remains in trouble to justify its financing (I think). <br /> <br /> Immediately kill a monkey making a shot. Then he tries himself. He starts talking to a very simple boy and very annoying mother; he asked for the results of the research. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, it does not seem like an effect on the injection, except for some new strengths. Then he remembers that he has little memory and begins to remember what happened. It also begins to appear very healthy. <br /> <br /> The film is called metamorphosis, which eventually becomes something else. You will not believe your eyes - to figure out what happened when it became, or when the costume of the actress was completely immersed. Horriblely, there is another change in the store - the end of the movie is really absurd. <br /> <br /> The only thing behind this movie is that Laura Gemser is there, but she's a small part. <br /> <br /> I once saw a video with a covered plastic covered cover. Perhaps, perhaps, there might be some electronics there, maybe when the eyes are lit (the eyes of the main character become occasionally the same in the film). I looked at him, he had a box, when he was removed from the plastic glue, he had removed them. The skin of novelty, if it still exists, would be the only reason I would have considered this movie; I will definitely throw it away.
