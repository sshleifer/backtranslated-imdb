There was a body that smoked Misty Ayers, and that's all this movie. Pure fake exploitation. I started to play with myself, counting the times they put into spare orchestra music. And, of course, music is totally unrelated to scenes. In this case: by chance he went into a room and crossed the "Hello" Roman music epic. I'd like to know why released the movie released 11 years before. I learned from this movie: small women's panties existed in 1954. I'm talking about Sigourney Weaver in the Alien original movie in the pantyhose. At least 20 minutes from the first 30 minutes, Misty is pleasing and wears his clothes (except for the outfit and panties). He has awesome dubbings, "Look out! Godzirra!" effect
