I'm using the Year IMDb and I wanted to take part in the comments I have not had in the movies yet. This documentary has so many problems and I do not know what to say. I'm not a Muslim, I'm not an expert in Islamic studies, but I know that this documentary relies on the eye-catching eye view. <br /> <br /> It's a documentary about the problems of this movie. I have seen most of the documentary that I have linked to some of the points of validity and then surround the points that surround the controversial interpretations and misinformation. This is undoubtedly the case of Islam: what the Mountain needs to know. Yes, there are fundamental fundamentalists around the world, some of which are Muslims, but the construction of a documentary about Islam is a bit deceptive to a small percentage of radicalized people. This is really fundamentalist Islam and nothing more than a documentary. <br /> <br /> For those who want to study some of the issues raised in this documentary, there are several points that can help here. <br /> <br /> There is nothing positive in the documentary about Islam. <br /> <br /> The documentary is based on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside of that region. More Muslims live in China, believe it or not, than in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of all Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> The translation used in the Coran documentary is doubtful. I saw the documentary as he was watching another translation and the differences were exciting. I was warned about the translation used in the documentary and now I know why. Surrah 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary suggests that Surrah believes that he will go to hell. But as I read the translation, he says: "Those who deny the truth about the people of the book and the politicians of truth will be in hell of hell." The difference is that those who deny the truth are those who know God and God's Truth and, nevertheless, decide to exclude them. <br /> <br /> The film mentions that there is no reflection of Islam, but this is not true. The truth is that many of the Qur'an and Hadith, Islam also knows the concept of 'Urf' or 'normative behavior'. It is clear what normative can be interpreted in many ways, but "Urf is a good behavior," what would mean a person's average correct or wrong. <br /> <br /> The documentary presents Shar'ia (Islamic law). as a unified set of knowledge that all Muslims follow. This is just the truth. There are many Islamic Laws that go forward and modernist, in essence, as they interpret laws. <br /> <br /> Hadith tradition is similar. There are thousands of Hadiths and each law accepts others. If you are not determined by using severe scholarship without the Hadith, which are specific, authentic and applicable, select and select separately, are you referring to the history of referrals? This documentary did. <br /> <br /> People think that fundamentalism is a problem, not Islam or any other religion. Christianity has fundamentalists who shoot abortion clinic doctors, etc. I know this is not a suicide bombing, understand that the basic justice is the problem. If you think the answer, others must be wrong. But if you think that the answer is AN, you can work with others on politics, religion, God or everything.
