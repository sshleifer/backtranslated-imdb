MY BEGINS! In God's name and all that is holy I have seen this FILM! What medications are you people! This can never be the worst movie! I felt like I had a bad acid all the time, I should call a therapist to face the trauma of this epic catastrophe. From the beginning to the end, the string roar is a profound masterpiece of satanic cinema. When I thought of watching this movie with my Jewish friend and his family, "oh, this could be fun! We thought it would be probably bad, but still a bit fun". How bad we were, we were not ready for that. It may be a movie. As soon as all of my friends finished the movie, they were lined up in the lobotomy and during the film's career, one of my friends tried to hang on their belt while another tried to tighten their bracelets with a wooden spoon. I wanted to see the ring video, so pain and suffering would end within seven days. For those who want to watch this movie, YOU are NOT preparing! You can think that if you think it's a "tough" one, not only will you rent it, but this movie will break, it will take you to the ground and you'll beat it.
