This is the worst adaptation of a classic story I've ever seen. They modernize without need and some points are really ill. <br /> <br /> Songs rarely move through the story. They seem strange The scene with Marley is nonsensical and playful. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've ever seen is the worst music I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Surely it's just a classic because the story "A Christmas Carol" is so classic. Since the original story is not classical, it does not mean that it is cheap.
