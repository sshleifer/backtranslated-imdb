It's the first time I saw a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I bet it's my last. I could not see why it was fun, even though the public people thought it was very funny when he made the face of the camera, or "I've taken it". <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot is completely predictable. The bad man comes after the guy. A good man has a woman, so he's a bad man. Inside, officials cuddled. The latest scenes are incredibly incredible. You spend about 2 years and millions of dollars, but you do not have to work your home to solve the trivial enigma? <br /> <br /> There is not much play, there are not many lands or stories. , and the shoot is made with MTV style. Do not miss out on this money. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
