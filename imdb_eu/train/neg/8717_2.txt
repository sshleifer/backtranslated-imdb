This is the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched a friend tonight on DVD on DVD, and we could not stop laughing at anger. finish <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough: terrorists capture the weapon without permission from a convoy with uranium grade, but they really do the men who eat dinosaurs. Easy to make mistakes. An immense incompetent group of special forces of the Navy to face prehistoric beasts. Colonel Rance is directed by Scott Valentine; There seems to be a man who has perfected the "Smell the Fart" activation, as Joey's Friends advocate. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of gore and shooting, but unfortunately Rance seems to have a problem. weapons in the direction of the giant monsters and the headaches. Likewise, the light always seems to be when a Velociraptor attacks (we can not always see how bad it is). Given all of this, we all had a lot. It would be a bet that someone would bet it was fun. <br /> <br /> As an adventure for the Jusassic Park / Aliens, the film is making the movie worse than the dinosaur cross, but innocent, cheeky. The entertainment is a huge success.
