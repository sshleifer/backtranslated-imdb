First of all, let me post this message saying that I'm a fan of Star Wars MOVIES ... First of all, I do not read books, play clothes, wear clothes or eat cereals (if any). I'm just a fan of the movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, people see me as laudable as this movie. Taking these films, and comparing them with the most predecessors (EP 1, 2), I do not understand how amazing a movie you can say. Due to the wonderful mistakes in the script: a cheesy conversation, a scene that is played (that is, R2 is suddenly bad, and long behind the scenes with the strongest CGI, with little human touch), theater cancer, and plot ... how is it good ? ? There was no real dilemma inside Anakin; Apparently, the change was switched on and suddenly it was wicked. For the last 20 minutes I was not interested in the movie (ie, "NOOOOOO!" Until it destroyed the scene of Frankenstein). Crying the CGI screen with a lively effect and if you fill the gaps with simple single stars, and when it's said and said, this is NOT a GREAT GOAL. For a "dark" tone, for a film, the talk on all the characters was too soft. <br /> <br /> I ask questions: from the beginning to the end of the film, what was really urgent and important to the truth?
