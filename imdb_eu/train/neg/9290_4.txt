STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> For a long time the prisoner Twitch (Kurupt) gets transferred to the most demanding prisoner. He opened it again in Alcatraz. She's saying she's approaching, but the real reasons are a little bit bigger. In it, Burke (Bill Goldberg) has a large office that prides itself on prisoners. Twitch, though it's a small muscle, is like a mouth and it's pretty much the same. But a group of war between black and Spanish prisoners who enter a desperation against the prisoner is created, when blacks kill the gang's heads and their fingers attack Burke. But real hobbies really hit Cortez (Robert Madrid) as the real murderer and the Hispanic man, when he was taken by Twitch's girlfriend and kidnapped daughter of Burke. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does not follow (he'll be very informed). Under the idea of ​​Under Siege 2, and when he decided to only accept when he left the film company directed by his film; So, despite being a DVD drama, this time he will star in Bill Golberg. (Steve does not even feature the first episode of the first movie). But for a reason he has not done a lot of work since Universal Soldier 2, because this is not a big actor, and there is more than one action star, because he manages a character that begins to make a very dark and murmur, but falls into the lie of the standard hero of action it becomes Assistance, veteran of the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, have just jumped on the extra work. <br /> <br /> The original style is a movie that tries to go pretty well. Dark lights, dark shadows and rap music play a great deal. That's pretty good, unfortunately, he can not fight with the innocent hero, they create an apathetic story that makes up the same evil cards and the makers. **
