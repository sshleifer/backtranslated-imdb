This movie is played dramatically, written, directed and produced. But it's so tight that it's really a half-clock. That's the SEMI clock. <br /> <br /> The story (there is little) does not make any sense. Barney Drum character is the only real relief and 30 seconds of tear. <br /> <br /> Many Canadian supporters can find TV commercials. Nobody knows anything. And, of course, Sly Stallone's brother less talented ... = Curiosities: It was filmed almost entirely in the small town of Claremont, Ontario. (About 20 km from Northeast of Toronto) I have met many local landmarks / crossings / buildings. I think Drive-in scene was filmed during the demise of "Oshawa Drive-in" and was canceled.
