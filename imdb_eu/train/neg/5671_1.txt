If you want to see dirty animals alive, they break their heads and the dogs will be blasting by my men, and this is for you! But even when it is normal, you do not have to watch the footage of animal cruelty, overcome this. This movie tries to prevent the viewer, and it surely does. Initially with the animal tobacco, and the murder of the baby in the movie (at least false), it was enough to turn myself off. Before that, show slaughter footage (BTK movie) and such footage is not allowed in a horror movie. We see gore and horror look, because we know make-up and special effects, so we do not sit down watching the movie and see the murder of real animals. We did not rent a movie. Regardless, there would be a great warning tag in front of these types of garbage films that people would be surprised. As a horror hobby, it turned my stomach. All movie crew and crew need to be aware of it.
