Do you know when you look at the collection of your videoconferencing films and you realize that you only see a few or two and you can not remember seeing them? Alibi was one of those films; I found it recently and I decided to give that opportunity. I am not sure I am happy with my decision ... on the one hand, the movie really, very bad, on the other hand, now I have another free tape ... well, you get it. The land is predictable and has no origin. The rhythm is bad. The play is a bad thing, but it's not surprising that the two protagonists play opera soap operas ... they are common. Characters are misguided topical. The movie also affects the easiest way of moving me (through the film): court scenes. Even though they do not have a single emotion against or with thin cardboard characters. The movie is just like true quality fits ... there is also a bad conversation. The thing is that it is full of so rich news. And that is what rises above the 1/10 score: this is a relief from many clich√©s and stereotypes (albeit unintentionally). I did not pay much attention to the cinema, but there was something to laugh at when I looked at the screen. Last note: I thought it was a summary of "Tori Spelling", but everyone knows that, so today I chose this because it gives more information. In short, if you have a bad movie, but not the worst, if it's on TV. With a little laugh, if you can sit through it. 3/10
