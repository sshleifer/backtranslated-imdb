Yes, as a hobby for shows like alive and student, this show is pretty bad. I do not like the first shows, but then I realized how pathetic everyone had to have the show first. Alex and Aaron's spirits gave men bad names as they deceived or chose. The first option was not really the show to look good. <br /> <br /> Ryan, you can be sad. The voice I ever heard on television was the most annoying, and definitely the most intelligent girl (but very expert media, but much more I doubt it). <br /> <br /> I have not really seen any of the shows, apart from the temporary inter-day television upgrade. I think reality television aims to be an "entertaining trash". See something like you can laugh, and you do not have to worry about it (I do not see CSI tired and amazed by TV like reality, but you still have to think about it while watching it). > <br /> Some reasons for some thought show. First of all, "telling the woman all", "Amy, who learned a lot about her," commented that each scene had been tried as a bar and club scene, because they did not know a guy and why they did not. Hey Amy, how to enter a club Get a hobby? Do you work for charitable work? If you want to change your work you will find another man? Well, I know that you can not go to a bar to meet a future partner. <br /> <br /> Amy and many other girls It seems that the idea of ​​collecting a "perfect man." Ladies' traces: it does not exist. There are, however, many great men who would create a marvelous husband, which would be your right one! It might not be six figures per year or JFK junior, They are the superficial show of this woman, very incredible. I am still a young man, the woman I thought was gradually growing on their skin, they were getting older and theirs More realistic about future partners. This exhibition is proving otherwise. <br /> <br /> In general, this show confirms many stereotypes that women see in social society. It's a great show and I think that all kinds of shows should be done. Blind Date and The Fifth Wheel are the best dating of one mile in a country because they are fun. There is nothing more "couple" than a simple night between people. In graduation, it unfortunately takes it too seriously.
