I received a movie in a $ 5 bin in Walmart. I would not recommend moving the movement. I could give myself to one of my companions when I was angry at them and wanted to stay for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the cover and looked at the summary and I thought it was a war movie. I would like to know how it would turn this movie to be boring. It was my mistake to think something happened in this movie. It is about a group that walks from one field to another. The drill keys try to deal with the soldiers and try to stop fighting the main character in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Well here's what this movie is about. This movie is slow and tough for me. see It was just one of the films that you put in, and you should stop watching it, but wait for the chain of hope to end. It does not. After finishing the movie, my T.V was behind. I was angry when I saw about 2 hours of my life and another 10 minutes to write this review to warn people.
