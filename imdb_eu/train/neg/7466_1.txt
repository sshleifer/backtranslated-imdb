Wow They let me talk about some missing movies. Without a doubt, it was one of those films. When I went to the theater, there was no word for me. All I had was a great threat to the last hour and a half to knock the head of the theater against the wall. Unfortunately, it did not work. Honestly, this film does not recommend anything. Humor was the first level, at best, the performance was very absurd, and the plot was astronomically far away. Chris Kattan or any other partner of SNL I have never seen any movie that I have never seen.
