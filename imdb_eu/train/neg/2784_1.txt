My husband and I are the parents of a boy with autism that lives as an autistic film. It was very bad for the JCC to take this Jewish film to its film, due to the way it portrayed Frankie's mental disabilities. When we got out we watched theatrical scene in the local theater. We asked for money. We would like to encourage scriptwriters to share part of the JCC Achad software. <br /> <br /> We did not like Frankie, a mental impairment, and maybe a teenage autist, in a joke. He keeps dropping something from looking at the orphan's breasts. <br /> <br /> It was not sensible to say that Frankie's nature was different, "well, the mental impairment is very fun." Challenges like Frankie are serious issues. Families like me really suffer. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriter must explain himself. Does the family have children with disabilities? Do families with children with disabilities watch it once a week at the JCC pool?
