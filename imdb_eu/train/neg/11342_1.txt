He explained to me why I gave him "art" a star rating from 10, because it is simply difficult or near impossible to make an unvaluable assessment. Probably he would be 10/10, if he would still have explanations. <br /> <br /> I do not like films with a senseless film like HOSTEL. Terrible (in all the meanings of the context), but since I've seen this movie I've known it is a genre called "historical drama" - and it would probably be a case of 10/10 and Tarantino. He would be happier with him (and Kill Bill 3 would spill more blood here than on the screen to prove it). But the thing about the "historical drama" is that it is a subcategory of "Romain Trash", where Romer was dying when the emperor dies and can not automatically be rated as default. The movie - because these films are bad and you can not really realize if it is a bad moment or it was just bad. It's a bad performance, a bad script and everything else to enjoy it. And even with some thirst for faith, I am one of them. They are days to watch the movie very bad and they are days to look after the trash and you will go here - the day will be saved! but that's definitely my opinion and it will not match ". <br /> <br /> If you want to see the great movie that I wanted to say, Casanova's Fellini will be definitely a chance. But listen to my advice and not Rate it by default.
