In the sixties I began to see the original TV series and I grew up and told me one thing that could immediately tell me. This movie was absolutely ridiculous with a flying outfit that was alive. He took a different shape from a martyr. Something peculiar to a child would have had special effects. On the contrary, the original characters were developed and the viewers developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only highlight of this feature was, really, not one, when Ray Walston finally appeared. He wore gloomy glasses and paid tribute to TV series for 30 years on this planet. But the real uncle Martin could not even keep this turkey.
