This is never the biggest insult to TMNT. Fortunately, Venus officially does not exist in TMNT cannon. It's not a huge turtle, it has taken away from 4 tragic stories of the same mutant mum, because their families never have a family of their own, never disappearing. The biggest mistake was to cross the Power Rangers with TMNT, with a great deal of passage; The turtle's voice was wrong and they all belong to nature. They could do a better job, better design and animatronics and VENUS. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about people ... it's wonderful material. It was a slow and natural look of the lip cap. they were totally destroyed. Bad master, some dude of the dragon. The turtles hanging on their bodies, what is raph's thigh? hollow sculptures looking for plastrons! <br /> <br /> It seems normal to play with the character and to get rid of Venus, kiddy cartoons were stolen ... and writing could be better.
