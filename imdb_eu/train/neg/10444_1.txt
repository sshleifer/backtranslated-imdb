The only thing about the movie is the title. In this case, it is an example to judge the book "Snake On a Plane", the title does not say about the film. When I went to the theater, I was not expecting Citizen Kane, I expected the Independence Day, the Pure Popcorn was a fun movie, but instead I got that great movie called "Li Turbulence", Roy Liotta. . Soap is better than its title. And it's not a humble title of the movie, nor a snake "or" plane in a 40-minute movie! What is false advertising! If it was not a title, SOAP would be a cheap and unforgettable Summer B-class. And R rating? It must be the merit of the R movie of all ages! The film makers add just a few words, that is, all violence keeps pg-13 levels. Do you know what it really is? Review Superstar Edge! Seeing Summerslam's snake's money instead!
