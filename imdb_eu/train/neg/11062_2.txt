To go the way! You've only made a touching and compelling story of Necrophilic in a soft and soft theater. Of course, a movie called Dahmer would be two types: fear, or documentary? This was not. There was no specific event close (indeed, it had almost no substance). In truth, it was not an evil or scary or did not try to worry. (You should try !!) What the hell was this writer / director thinking about? There is one of the most real examples of serial killer diseases of the time and we are misled, gay bar roof ravages and long drunking flashbacks in his old home. I think Jacobson was really trying to present / display "soft" j.Dahmer's.
