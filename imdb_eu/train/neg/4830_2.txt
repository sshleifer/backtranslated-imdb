WELL? BENETAN ???? I know if you make a political war movie, but it's just a waste movie. In every way it's awful. Inaccurate in many ways. I have a quicker time with the United States President, flying an aviation fighter and attacking aliens. It is easier to identify certain things that are appropriate. I saw someone dropping my jaw, someone said the movie was the best in the last 25 years. It was predicted, seemingly insignificant deviations, and sometimes it was doubtful cinematography. <br /> <br /> X-box, YouTube, ACUPAT utilities ?? Have you checked in 2004 that these things were not? It's not like a lot of research, just five years before the movie was released. I'm a warlord in Iraq, if you spend a day with your infantryman or a straight EOD, you would realize BS. this movie is. To compare this to Platoon or Saving Private, Ryan is crucial. Why not even throw Commando and Red Dawn? I think these can be more accurate. <br /> <br /> For some reason, if you can see it as an unbelievable plot, history and facts disagreements, this movie may well be. Nothing else If you continue to listen to "Oscar Buzz" and add your most enjoyable review, go ahead. As for myself, I'm writing the director, I can get it 131 minutes before.
