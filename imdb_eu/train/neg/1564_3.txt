... I was, in good conscience, saying a great movie. Thirty minutes before I started thinking about myself: "Wow, that's pretty bad." And, to be honest, I'd give this movie a star for Esai Moral (although it had very little screen). The movie is just a role to play, because it's shameful, I like the clown of Gilows ... or at least I thought I did it. <br /> <br /> I began to think back thinking that it was "Shawshank Redemption" that was not very good. Problem: it's just a prisoner / hard-working man, it seems like an act; His conversation came as it was doing a very bad impression. Do you ever know someone who speaks like he was supposed to be? I definitely did not, but maybe he needed it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And, worse things To do it, they inject a little of the prison philosophy and invent it. That rhetoric "rasta" seemed to be so angry that it was because of nature. <br /> <br /> Normally I would not have shot such a movie, but when I saw the movie it was pretty good. favorable review I felt like I was scammed and lying, and I thought someone would have to keep the misery of having to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I say BOOOOOOOO.
