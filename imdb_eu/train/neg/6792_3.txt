Here is a good cast of a film and a nice look, but it just works. Richard Brooks should be a bit tired at this stage of the game; How much better was his PROFESSIONALS! The horse and the rest of the actions seemed to have stopped during a slow movement. This movie had to be exploded anyway. This young horse gave me a terrific look, and in the desert moments of the desert it seemed like a bad feeling, lazy. inadequate work Bad. The actors did it right, but I've definitely seen everyone doing it better. Ben Johnson, however, is always a joy. For the first time I saw thirty years ago; Then he was disappointed and 30 years later he was on second inspection.
