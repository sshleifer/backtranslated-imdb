This movie was very bad, I do not know whether to laugh or to cry. This year I had a great deal of hope with Horrorfest, the first time I went to Horrorfest, and I have to say it with Horrorfest and all its films bring false advertising to a new level. I'm glad to say goodbye to advertisers that many people have cheated on spending money and watching that movie in that year. The easiest thing I saw on Hamilton was the worst (I saw others Unrest, Dark Ride and Reincarnation). The film covers and trailers have seemed to me to be an interesting plot for the many cannibalists who fear the neighborhood, and I must be disappointed that the transition from a boy to the "age" story. vampire That's why this drama overcomes drama of horror. And to make the plot even more ridiculous, they will add a "snack" that they can not wait for among their grumpy twins and add deadly creatures that are locked in the basement. "If the secret was not revealed at the end of the movie, I would take it to the theater in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> Spoil the time and money. It was cut off for 40 minutes from this movie and included in some shows like Smallville or Charmed or Supernatural and much less than this. Absolute rubbish So bad, two years later, I have to go back to the IMDb and I have written a review about it in my memory, because it is one of the worst films ever seen. Also, while you're reading this, hide Horrorfest movies in the future. Most of all, you can do everything from Blockbusters or watch somewhere online. Horrorf offers movies from independent filmmakers that can not carry on to the big screen, and "all the things that do not show up on theaters", all tricks, no blood or tripod ... the movies were around them. Because they are awful. Think of Horrorfest as an unknown version of Sundance Film Festival, but for horror film. <br /> <br /> Sorry for "hate", but the next time you think twice before fraudulking customers.
