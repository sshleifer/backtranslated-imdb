Dolly Lung's acting cheezy movie. He is a former military retired at Lung's teaching. But the neighborhood changes and the student body has frustrated them and decides that it will hang. Things are eliminated, when more than one of the arrested students are seen, thieves take some escort as the base of the school operation, for theft of car armored. Against the evil Dolph who are fighting against death. Jaw drops back to grindhouse late in the era exploitation films where punks dressed up bad and some women have bad day shine hair. Stupid movies As a way of getting it, I can not make people do that way, that is probably the action movie that was condemned before the small budget, the decomposed falsehoods and the lack of action in the eyes of producers. See how the cars later fall into the security tower (do not ask, because it looks like a prisoner, then a baccalaureate) that breaks down the car (they do not ask) during the school, and breaks down the shape (this does not seem like in the foreground). What have the gods do bad movies? In reality, this is what Sydney J Furie is doing, I am very happy, that is, the good directors that made The Boys in Company C. Company. His ability has failed, or he has not expected it and did not succeed. even wrong? It's turkey. It's a clock but a turkey.
