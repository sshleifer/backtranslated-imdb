A real movie about Sonja Horowitz (Ren√©e Zellweger), a devout and fertile teacher, Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). It's the unhappy man. Mendel's brother Sender (Christopher Eccleston) views it and hires him to work in a field that has an already specialty. He also begins a relationship with him, then goes on with a Puerto Rican artist, sank and betrays his family. Sonja's brother is a sub-robot who speaks deadly to her, and apparently takes on the shape of a female beggar, but why it is unclear. Much is not clear, what is happening with Sonja, why he tells Rebe that he is inside the fire and maybe it's not for the god, what he means, and what does a magical woman's beggar mean. However, the situation of women with orthodox stories is horrible, but Sonja is not released. It's not so well thought out that the one sold through the love of another racer. The title comes from the biblical definition that deserves a good woman, but, nevertheless, Mr. Sonja mentions the weed. Zellweger struggling with the fragment; Western Jewish in the West and sometimes its accent is flat and sometimes it incorporates social characteristics of Brooklyn. His best is when he is hard and responsible, but in the end the movie is wrong.
