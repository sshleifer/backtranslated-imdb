Despite the well-known names of "Related to" called "A Man Called Sledge", there is nothing extraordinary about the movie itself or its performances. In fact, the only thing that separates the television series from the 1960s to the 70s is a TV show like "Rat Patrol" and is much more violent. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the biggest star, and he seems to have tried the comedy he had to do with all the light stuff ("Maverick", "Help your local Sheriff" - "Gunfighter", etc.). Unfortunately, he plays against the nature of the earth, which writes to Sledge Clint Eastwood's reputation as the western spaghetti character. But Eastwood's things were not very strange and interesting. <br /> <br /> I think that "A Man Called Sledge" can be classified as spaghetti western, however, it's slow to adapt to that sub-genre. "Combat" series series enthusiasts feel an immediate connection, directed by Vic Morrow and wrote a script with Frank Kowalski. Let's move on to a slim and solvent fashion that caters to themselves, rather than trying to tell the story. <br /> <br /> The plot is the "big heist" standard (enter "The War Wagon" here) Sledge will deliver $ 300,000 of gold delivery. His team is made up of Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is when the shipment is carried out while 40 men are in custody and is stopped being locked in a vault inside the landing area. I think that "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" have a section with the same plot. <br /> <br /> The story would be a decent television time, but it quickly grows old as a long-running feature. Garner does not get any charm in his characterization and the movie is not enough to keep the audience interested. <br /> <br /> The thing finally strikes and smokes after the robbery, when the team carries out a game of real and non-logical cards. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
