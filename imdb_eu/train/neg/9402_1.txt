Why this film was made? Notwithstanding the generous tax payable by Australian Film Investors, no reasonable explanation can be made through this film. For good, the actors in this film are Aussie b-grade (not actors, people like John Michael 'Hollywood', Howson, the original drummer Hey Hey His Saturday and countdown, which can still be seen , not worth the attention of the brain: no, the script is bad (although it is a self-recognized b-grade horror) and the quality of the theater and film is worse, it often seems to be a home movie, but home cinema also has a "reality" with Australian cinema. Anyone interested, please, for God's love, never made this film ever.
