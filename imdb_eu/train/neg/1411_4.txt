This movie was very good when I first saw it when it was called "Lost in Translation." In any case, Bill Murray, Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson, Paz Vega, and Tokyo became a curious Latin female Japanese and became Japan in Carson. There are 10 annoying items that we liked in the translation book instead of significant conversations and silence. We translate characters that are thought to be introspective as they were in translation, and they give us insights on non-ideas. How can a person with a hundred-dollar shirts and a person who has never been targeted by Target stores advises workers how to prepare for a woman's conversation as an assistant administrator? Do not think stop. If he does not give advice, he tells what he is eating. The most dangerous part of the movie was supposed to be in a hurry to take an appointment, however, the characters are still on the other side, trying to clear their car or stop at Arby or return to the list. Those who love 10 or less and hate things. I would cite them saying: "Would not you say you need to be somewhere? What's the hell? You were almost a minute ago, now you're eating roast beef and thinking your life!" Until I saw this movie, I never really understood "something that could be stressed to himself," but I think that this movie is doing exactly that, and therefore, perfectly. The interviews make a crunchy and nonsensical character, because both actors have signed up for this project.
