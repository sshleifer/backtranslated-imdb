Actually, his story is very weak - a Walt Disney movie is his total garbage. When Robinson appears, movies all over the place, I was surprised how poor it was. It's wrong as in Alice in Wonderland! As if there were a few ideas, some of them were stunned to try to get together and not. Then I sat at the end sitting. My young brother got interest and was confused with the story. The characters are weak and after robinson appearance you do not want to end it, you just want to finish the movie. She has to forget her movie and forget it quickly. If it's free, do not miss it.
