The topic of the soldier soldier from the war home here is a sad treatment. It's amazing that an excellent cast, according to the limits of their great talents, can not recover the return of the soldier, from the impossibility of moving the spectator to emotional involvement. The best moment, as noted by another reviewer, will come on the Glenda Jackson screen; But even though Jackson's cinematic motion is not good for his film, he does not put his chestnut in cold chestnut and never warms it. Ann-Margret, often accused of having sex-kitten reputation and acting capability, finds her real and profound ability to be missed here - although she speaks with a sharp accent in Middlesex. Scoring scores, a red television miniseries that many believe to boost the emotionalism of the sacrament, leads to the emotional detachment of the script, the direction of blockade and the formalism of excesses. Apart from his intricate script and direction, his "Soldier's Return" is correct, but fails to work together.
