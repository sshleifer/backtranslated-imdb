Leonard Maltin, often trustworthy, says that "beautiful romance" is because Sanders is "excellent". The Maltese had to confuse something else. Sanders is snide and droll and superb, as usual? You can think of adultery, "Sometimes the wedding chains must be three times as heavy," but they describe this movie more dull, woody and dated. Storyline himself, along with Sanders, makes his own jewel, with Francois Eugene Vidocq, the head of the police, but can not deal with stunning jewelry, is quite entertaining, but the pure treatment of Hollywood history is like that. such as Marie Antoinette *, and, undoubtedly, epic * forever Amber * (a fashionable remake that screams). However, in his defense, Sanders tries to add more to his character, everything is not. I am a fan of Douglas Sirk, but this one is in 1946 and Sirken is one of the first Americans to try to determine the potential of breast cancer, without many signatures. Sirk stops at the foot of the house and, in the next ten years, he has made many impossible films until he won gold with Magnificent Obsession *, and made a stroke, just like bombs with estrogen. , * Wind * written, and * life imitation *. But in Paris the Scandal * is not the best work? a pretty budget, cheesecloth and uncapped effectiveness.
