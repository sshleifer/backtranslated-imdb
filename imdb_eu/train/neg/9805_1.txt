I have never understood Saban's Power Rangers show, it was just the second-rate super-popular super-Japanese super-popular Japanese version of the last three decades! Something about Japanese version has been lost in the American version, characterization, special effects, etc. <br /> <br /> Of course, many children will say that they are the greatest power rangers, but it would be wrong. /> <br /> I'm sure the Japanese are talking about, they will learn how much super is better in the American version. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers is absolutely huge, try Super Sentai instead! To find a better show, try Voltron The Third Dimension!
