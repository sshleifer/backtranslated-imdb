Placid and Alligator, Godzilla (1998). <br /> <br /> As a standard for a horror movie in the 1990s, every single female protagonist does not wear their clothes at least once. . The female leader does not, of course, have a better agent. <br /> <br /> The whole film surrounds the shooting of a monster extreme sports called "blood-surfing", where the surfers cut sharks and the sharks are surfing in infested water. In this film, salt water is also a huge crocodile. People eat. The movie ends. <br /> <br /> I do not like horror movie bad, but I really hate black horror film, which is definitely this.
