Imagine, her, say 12-1am - your home, your bored, not tired of you. This scenario happened in 4 years or so ... I said. I turned on the TV and I moved on some channels and saw that this film came out. OH MY WORD is the worst movie I've ever seen in this movie! A stopper that can not be stopped (by cutting brakes or by doing something) by removing the freeway - what will happen? This movie was very bad, it's really fun. I think stunts would cost around $ 2; For example, a baby / baby is being removed by a helicopter - to try to captivate the viewer - the well-positioned bridge is moving forward ... CINEMA IS NOT PRIOR TO PREVIOUS - it shows that the child is short of the bridge, but it seems so bad - you can see the look of the used portrait - small budget quote! I can not remember the end of the movie, but I bet GREAT! <br /> <br /> I'm happy again that this film will show again, so I'm glad I could see this trash!
