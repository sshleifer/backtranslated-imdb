I was surprised with some reviews of this film. The only place that it does mean is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is horrible. Plots are very lazy. It's not terrifying too. People who believe that Sarah Michelle Geller is out, of course, to forget The Grudge. This movie is like Water Dark, which is more predictable and slower. I was very disappointed with this movie. He did not even fear me. Let's see, this type of plot has been killed at this stage, for example. The dead are trying to get in touch with life - Dragonfly, What's underlying, Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, Changeling, etc. It seems that Japanese and Korean are the only ones that are currently writing original horror films. Films that go out of Hollywood, such as money making exercises, with little respect for the audience. They are being eliminated
