I watched this movie a long time ago (while the movie's production company was working on the trailer) it was TERRIBLE. Hewitt is the best childbirth, Hopkins conducts his role in telecommunication (but Hewitt still casts his scenes together) and Alec is bored. Confirm me this: You should avoid this movie if it's like a pest. It seems that it will continue forever as it develops in the tired plot snail's pace. It is undoubtedly a matter of cinematography, and the direction is inevitable. Alec Baldwin should go to the film school in order to re-direct it. With regard to its behavior, its nature is totally impossible, which is why it is impossible to promote it. Dan Ackroyd is quite fun and the amazing appearance of the final jury of the film is very nice, but this movie is awesome.
