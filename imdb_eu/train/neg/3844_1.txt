First of all, I'd like to say to everyone who watched this movie, "The Transvestite" acted as one of my friends, whose name is Robert Dugdale, a brilliant actor, but he did not say. He has played in many plays and musicals on his filmography. Terrace B.C. he lives a year That's where I am, comes to our house almost on Saturday * laughter * It's good, now about the movie, I would not recommend it to anyone who has not seen it, since it's not a movie. It's been a bad movie, the main reason is never stopping, it continues to bounce over time, so it's a little hard to keep up with some points, and in the second it's really boring. The movie is just comparable.
