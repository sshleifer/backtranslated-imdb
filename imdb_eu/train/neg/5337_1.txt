There are negative reviews around "Stay away, Joe". Here I can not be silent, and let this injustice happen. You have not heard a party yet. <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley's films are my pleasure to be guilty for simple reasons: they are mere relaxations, I can not think of them when I see them. . This means that I do not worry because a complex plot is missing because it is not suitable for starting ground. I can simply take shoes, take beer, sit down, wash myself, and remember all the rock and roll that you like most in all of my enjoyable and enjoyable enjoyments. <br /> <br /> My book "Stay away, Joe" definitely falls into the category "so bad it is good". Now, if you appreciate the "trash value" like me, it is the last experience of the 1960's camp. It's so bad that you can almost see surrealists and just think it's not possible to be worse, surprisingly surprising you. In the end, you are amazed at all the new levels of stupidity that you do not shock or weep. In a nutshell: I love how funny so bad it was a generation that made so many films in time. I still give 10, though - after 100 knocked at the bottom, the instant movie becomes a bad classic.
