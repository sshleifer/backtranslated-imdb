Between 10th. <br /> <br /> This is not the type of movie you want to believe in 2 times as long as you've seen a few missed lifetime credits as a role. Honestly, I think I could make a better Vampire movie ... and I do not know anything. It does not suck it (it's harder than a vampire). Jason Scott Lee ... his character, at least, is a bit cool, has a bit of mystery and throws a small butt.
