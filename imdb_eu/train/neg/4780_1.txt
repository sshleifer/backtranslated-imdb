I think this drawing is one of the worst cartoon I have ever seen. I would recommend this drawing to under 5. When I was 4 and 5 I would like this show. I still did not see. Now I am 5 and I prefer to see homework. The cartoon was a bit fun, but they were not enough to make me laugh. Now, I am older, witty shows do not value us. I see Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I am interested in things related to Doctor Who, so I do not like 5-year-old cartoons. The cartoon did not last for only 6 seasons, but it was abandoned by small audiences, but some say that the writers had little idea but for most 8 shows.
