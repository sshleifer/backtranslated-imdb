I went into this movie as the next curators, but leave it feeling. The humor was weak and the characters were pretty flat. That was not a bad thing, it seemed to me that the idea of ​​a dating service in the grocery store was quite fruitful, but the director changed the focus to the "save the guy from the evil corporate mom-and-pop store". It seemed to me that it was stuck with the plot of service, the movie would come out with a much more memorable one. Now, I love the way the film's justice, I am from Rochester and portrayed Webster. Actually, the best homemade writers of Kevin Smith (writers) came up with their homeland. Webster, NY, what should be the verification of the Red Bank, NJ Secretary. The director made sense in Nick Tahou's newspaper. Confuse me, as regards Rochester's things, the garbage plate is at the top of the list. I could see this film in Little Rochester, everyone knew when the towns were created and when they appreciated.
