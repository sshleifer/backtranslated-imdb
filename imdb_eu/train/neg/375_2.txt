Two years ago, at the Berlin Film Festival, we watched the movie "Kolekzua" "Sue" in the Panorama program, featuring a wonderful Anna Thomson. It's a movie about loneliness and sex, and how it compensates for the other. In the same section of the Festival, we must now complain about the common antithesis Sue's "Extension of the domain of the lutte", which is the only problem that persists in trying to persuade loneliness and not having sex. But, unfortunately, we can not know our "heroine" (as it is called the story teller), because the company and its people are unlikely to be unnecessary and incomprehensible. Your own fault, sorry. I can not understand It is not enough that the author / director / actor accepts that it is not the consciousness of its destruction or the passivity of its personality, what it has meant so far, but the corrupt society and the image of its sexuality. Yes, there are more in-depth approaches to gender relations, but we will not continue until now ... And the point is that there is more than one sign of thought thinking that there is no sex. He still does not realize that the film is quite depressing ... <br /> <br /> At the beginning, it begins to draw a more detailed situation to draw the situation. He talks about buying a new "heroine" bed in the bed store. Perhaps climbing stairs is very wide. You have to be home for half a day ... it's a satire of a character, because it does not know how to take life and your heart, doing something ... the movie is not going to follow this path, but its characters manage without protection. Nobody believes that "our heroine" has been able to kill Tisserand. Very sad, too pleasing, passive (to mention the complex Tisserand, the inhibition, but it can not be a murderer, of course!). Finally: women and the world are not a device with a sexualized society. As you can, but do not follow the messages of this movie and "wisdom," which announces the call for failure of human relationships.
