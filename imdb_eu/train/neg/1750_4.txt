Priyadarshan's HERA PHERI was a humorous state. This film lacks a story, but it's very funny, but it's not slip. <br /> <br /> This is not an appropriate story, however, nevertheless it manages a nice flow <br /> <br /> In the first half Akshayk and John for Neha to have lunch and another in Paresh When entering, it has two fun scenes <br /> <br /> The first time it gets bored slowly but in the second half it's more fun, even though they do not script. <br /> <br /> Although jokes are fun, they wonder, no-one Have you ever heard the voices of every person? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> Akshay Kumar becomes his second skin, but this is it. She dazzles her film completely and everyone else <br /> <br /> John runs through and fails to make the comedy Paresh Rawal horny. Sometimes, aloud and incorrectly, Nargis, Daisy and Neetu (now only see Neetu) are good sections but often cries out. Manoj Joshi is well
