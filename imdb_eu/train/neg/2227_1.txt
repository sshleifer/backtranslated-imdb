Sometimes someone outside of the sky looks at me from one side to the other and "What is SNITCH'D?" I know there is a case of hidden right away + fear. You see, I was the director of the film's director. <br /> <br /> Let me clarify some "about this interesting life experience". <br /> <br /> Originally, SNITCH'D was called ONE HARD HIT. . In July of 1999 I met James Cahill, when I collected TRIANGLE SQUARE, after collecting an excellent 35 mm long feature film, the festival never separated as an individual feature of that era. Feature Experimental contract famous. But I'm digressing ... <br /> <br /> Although I was slamming, and James asked me to shoot at 16 mm in his gangster movie, if you did not want to break your rhythm with a $ 25,000 movie shoot budget. he took it After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI ... So I think my myth. <br /> <br /> Let's make it "for the escort of the film" for many who are involved, I also enter. SNITCH'D was shot in two weeks in August 1999, Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA. Cahill taught Drama in a secondary school, a Drama and English teacher ... consider film while watching it, or even in the title of apostrophe use), that's why locations and throwing. /> <br /> In his cast, they found out that Vera Jimenez had only one dramatic appearance of the LA Channel Channel Morning News, and was more impacted, as Eva Longoria, a newcomer to Hollywood. I'm hanging on to get a hanging movie. His professional dedication, focus and "let's do" attitude inspired me and was the front of the planned star. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D had poor optics, low light or electricity, and delivered multiple boom operators and offline corporations a day for doubling. This does not make any actual content that speaks of itself. <br /> <br /> However, since 2003, the movie was sold to distributors (a net loss, I understand), because Eva did not have any unexplainable photos. Kutxa (then a prestigious piece of work), but whoever got the clear clarity, is a true Latino gangster to give credibility to SNITCH'D. Because Cahill's passion is in the theater before the book, it seems that he thinks you can judge a book, because they have received so much DVD-based clothing. ----------------- One year later, Eve, now soap, and James I met a single short film that he shot a day a day, SPLIT SECOND. I have never thought of any theater festival. <br /> <br /> Six years later I was hired to shoot another movie called JUAREZ (Mexico). Although I worked on the process; My participation in the casting, the script and the control of the crew was constant, and as a result the movies seemed promising, what was ... cheap detective story about mass murdering girls in Juarez. Despite his claims here and abroad, the film never appeared in the festival or in the palace, although Cahille repeatedly claimed that it had been the distribution of the movie, and simultaneously with the DVD premiere of the two studio subjects, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and VIRGIN OF JUAREZ. TERRITORIAL VILLAGE.
