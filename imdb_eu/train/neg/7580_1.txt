The movie was horrible. Basically, Jane March was Korean-Korean American from North Korea who was sent by North Korean Kim Jong Il. It becomes an American maid's maid family, they all play Korean, although it seems more white (I think the actor is 1/4 or 1/8 in Southeast Asia, not all Korean) and the youngest. He hates his family and ends with him. The insanity of Korea and the United States of America is completely insane. Of course, the scriptwriter and director, of course, were white men who did not want to see real life in Korean or American life in the life of I or Americans. Fantasies full of Asian fantasy, the film is definitely as completely unbelievable. Everyone from Korea will know that the litter is empty. In the end, North Korean honhyol spy girl gets killed, obviously paying "her sins by paying" way. Very bad movie, with a television sensitivity.
