I took this Cuban film at an arthouse cinema club. Soon after he showed the cartoon Silly Symphony in 1935, where the Symphony Island merged with the Jazz Island. The Cuban banner that hangs Cuban bundles hanging over Cuban banners by Ruben Gonzalez, the scene of the wonderful film festival and the idiots of Helms-Burton. Then the movie started. And the film's peeling paint has gradually become a little bit more than becoming confused with the mess on the screen. <br /> <br /> Nada Mas is much in the story. Carla is a cover covered in a post office in Cuba. The only escape from a lightning-free existence is the writing and writing of letters, the grunts of the basic people that create in BrontÃ«an emotional silences. The plans of the Cuban photogallery are full of joy, pain, compassion, fear and the like. <br /> <br /> The problem is the simplicity of narration in film school, which are endless excursions in Latin cartoons. Marx brothers slapstick and even - especially slowing down an editing trick - the celluloid of the defect of a tear of a school on the face of a character. <br /> <br /> One-dimensional characters are abundant. Cunda, the main post office, is not a humorous domination-nosfer. An accomplice to the head, Concha, indicates toes, fingers and screams. Cesar, metalhead tricks and romantic interest, reveals hidden writing talent Carla Miami starts. The scene of Chase (a quick oh-so-hilarious progress) is a good measure. All of this would be fine in a comic book called Mortadello and Filemon, but in a black and white zero-FX movie, with high budgets. <br /> <br /> Nada Mas tries to stay somewhere. unknown hero-game-dreams and the topic of 'poetry-great-translator' by Il Postino. Like Amelie, her protagonist is a single-sex, eccentric female, who turns her magic into trying to bring strangers to life. Like Il Postino, the film does not include poetry's persistent recitations and the romantic postman of a bicycle. Unfortunately, Nada Mas does not capture the lenity and transcendence of each film. <br /> <br /> There are two things that there are two things that are worth watching in the madness of late-night television. The first one is the beginning of Carla's plan on a slab floor roof, which will cut the crosswords on it. The second, as an example for Nada Mas: Buena Vista Social Club's obsession with the artistic departure of Cuba, often blinks on the soundtrack to accept any litter that has a bundle. This movie can not be worth the world premiere - Films like Itxarote Zerrenda and Guantanamera cover a similar territory.
