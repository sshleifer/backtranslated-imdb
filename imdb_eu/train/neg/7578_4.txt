In the mid-1970s, the film "Superchick" (1973) is narrated in a 1970s movie, "Naked", a long-length feature of the movie, and it's somehow entertaining. And the main character here, Tara B. True, is really a superchick type Is it a hostess (not a winged helper) who has a beautiful airplane with his (!), and a hugy boyfriend in every port, that is, a "really" swinging "gal." "Laying out" with the superb surgeon germaphobe in New York, With gangster problems in Miami, and LA's star star rock star, Tara is sure to be busy. And if he does not escape his male energy, he learns the spectator, the Karate class, high mileage clubs, shines and ravage They would be taking part in the groovy pot. As I said, it's unhappy, and surely, when you're feeling dead, you're good at night and you're in front of the tube I want them. Joyce Jillson's future astrologer brings out the role of Tara's role, and the film is quite enjoyable. Unexpectedly, buxom '70s, Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (Candy Samples) are scorned here in very small roles. However, they do everything they do best. The image is never fun and does not have a lot of thought in its metaphorical head, but at the same time, it's fun and I think it's something. However, it is strange to pay attention to the double body of Jillson's final credits; I do not think I've ever seen that!
