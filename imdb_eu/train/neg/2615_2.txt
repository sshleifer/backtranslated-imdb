I do not know why, but because of some illness, I think that I'm facing the sequel to Disney, I decided to move on and I decided to 102 Dalmations. The first movie was the remake of Disney's cartoons, which seemed to be quite similar to Glenn Close Cruella De Vil, but it was just a bomb. The reasons why these films do not work 101 Dalmations, the original, a cartoon, has worked better and was more attractive for children and adults. This was not really fun, since people are trying to become true adults instead of being cartoons, they understand that they are a bit more attractive to kids, but seeing how they act is such a thrill. to film. 102 Dalmations's story is not really good. <br /> <br /> Cruella De Vil has been in jail for a while, but things are changing now that she loves animals and proves to be a good man. But his reputation is now damaged as a puppet maker, but he buys a man's dog refuge and suddenly everyone seems to have loved and changed. When absurd officers see Dalmatian, he crazy and places him and loses. He has returned to avenge the search for puppies and Dalmation coat is always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is an amazing actress, very popular, but Cruella De Vil, who is well-versed. But we have to admit it, this film turned into an unfortunate unfortunate misfortune. Likewise, they were just as nice as dogs, it works more for animation, they seem stupid, but it's not compelling, without cartoon or characters mixing. I would not really recommend 102 Dalmatian, it's okay, but if you only accept the first movie, it's the same. <br /> <br /> 2/10
