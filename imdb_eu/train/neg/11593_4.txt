This movie is the worst in the Nightmare series. It was very boring that I did not remember 20 minutes since the movie was finished, although it reminded me of writing a review. <br /> <br /> Well, # 4 was a joke and Freddy was a joker. He tried to translate # 5 attempts. Darker and atmospheric thing than Nightmare 4 was basically a good thing. They tried to shoot a horror movie instead of a comedy. Unfortunately, they forgot to add suspense and fear. Due to Nightmare 5: Dream Child is not fun is not scary. What we really get is a boring film by ordinary actors (perhaps except Lisa Wilcox). <br /> <br /> Plots (he killed Freddy's Lisa's friends using Lisa's baby's dreams). On the basis but not enough 90 minutes of the film. Sometimes the story is too confusing (maybe it's not) and you can not stop asking what the director wants. The script has to be more holes than Swiss Cheese, so the film was very cursory (I'm told that I like cheese, even though I'm Switzerland). Although the special effects were not as good as in section 4. <br /> <br /> Do not hesitate to rent or buy this film, it is very confusing. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (get dressed, # 6 is too confusing ...)
