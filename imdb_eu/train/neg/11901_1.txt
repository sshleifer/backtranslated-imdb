"Land of Plenty" is not a movie. Wim Wenders is a tomb manager of the German director. <br /> <br /> Many felt the "The Million Dollar Hotel", and now "Land of Plenty" is clear; Wenders has not only lost himself but has become a director, creating stories and scenes that are extremely vulnerable and superficial. <br /> <br /> "The time you missed" could be said to come from every director, but the Wenders case is extreme. As if he had completely forgotten about the cinema, everything started again so that the results were confusing. <br /> <br /> In some words, this film does not deserve your time.
