It has been said several times - at least for me - seeing a movie by Eric Rohmer is like watching dry paint; It seems that Monsieur Rohmer does not do that (he does not deny it, but then he can do it anyway, it just does) so much his last film, Inch Allah, is set back to the present. it's like watching the dust in time. The wonderful people that has given Cahiers du Cinema Nouvelle Vague have been named one of the best films of 2007, so we'll give you some ideas. The reality is not dependent on the Rohmer agenda, a 5th century France in the middle of a valley that is not in the Loire Loire Valley, because the other home we see is a dingy wooden cottage. The story comes from nymphs and sneakers, and Rohmer has played with strangers who have not had much to do with the fact that they are a general effect, especially because they captured an annual theater movie for special students. There is almost temptation to say "Go back to Godard, everything is forgiven", but this bad production can not even say these words.
