What can I say about cruel intentions 2? Well, I can honestly say, I'll see the movie again if I have a chair and my eyes open a clock-orange style. <br /> <br /> Movies 'stars' Robin Dunne (No, I never heard of it again), Ryan Phillipe's terrific impressions do not feel like it. In the event of heavy melting, Dunne (and fails) plays a beautiful and charming charismatic beauty. The actress is not beautiful, nor charismatic, because the character remains incredibly incredible. Amy Adams (who had been in a Buffy episode) tries to stop Sarah Michelle Gellar from leaving Katherine and bringing Katherine to abuse ... However, Adams is not a good actor and his performance It was flat. There was no real emotion, it seemed to him that the camera was reading reading cue cards away. However, two good actors were in the movie: Barry Flatman (Saw 2 and Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs. Kensington Austion Powers) fun and entertaining performances were Sebastian and Katherine parents, which is why I'm in Film 2, not in film 1 rated it <br /> <br /> The film is a bad version of the original, such as the copy of the original copy of the previous film and imitated scenes. <br /> <br /> I think it could work as a TV show, but if they could recover the people that could really work on the main pieces.
