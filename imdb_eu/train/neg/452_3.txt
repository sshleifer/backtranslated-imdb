I watched the movie for a love project. Please tell Nicolas Cage what he is about to be his character, then he says the lines. My life can not continue ... I accidentally cut my hand ... my brother was near. Of course, his fault. And since she was happy, she is a pretty guy who looks after a beautiful and unmistakable mom. It's not a shutdown, it's not a bad script and it does not have enough extension for small characters. Save yourself, if you do not make a good laugh. The clothes were done appropriately, and the extras worked well. I'm sure I'm going to make a fun movie, but with a more specific genre, I can not recommend those who know this movie, because there is no intellectual film. It's not a Chick Flick. It's not a strict romantic. And I can not show children for sex and questions to follow. In short, it's just not a good movie.
