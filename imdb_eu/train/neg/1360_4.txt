The summary of this film is a reasonable effort. A good six-year movie but no achievement. Maggie Smith gave him a decent performance, which was compelling, but he was not as good as he was, the other actors were horrible! Incredible portrait. He was not very funny and, therefore, he did not really get his genres, he was particularly funny and it was not dramatic. The only genre of good skill was love. The targets were not displayed and the movie was mixed with messages. A very basic plot and a very basic line were not thrown out or performed well, and people were confused about why the filmmaker was not good and targeted. Etc. Maggie was pretty good and the story was well-honed. <br /> <br /> 4.
