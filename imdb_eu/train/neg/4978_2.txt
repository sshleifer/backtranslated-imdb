This movie lost the Crossbow RPG. It was like someone cut and paste the Robocop scene. In Beowulf, I came to shout, "I like it!" <br /> <br /> I saw Chris Bruno as "The Dead Zone" that I like for television and he's part of it. He chose a curious accent, but remained at least consistent for the whole movie - just like any of his costars. From ancient English to modern English, they continued to slip all kinds of speech, sometimes in the same sentence. <br /> <br /> This movie is already about how the source material works. However, on his own, the plot of this movie is not good. It's boring, even if you do not apologize for small budgets. Having a low budget means at least a good story, dialogue and acting. These things do not cost much. Instead, they spent money on half-assed CGI and some decent outfits and sets. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch the movie.
