I rented this movie the dull version I saw later in 1959. It was not. For that reason, I was very drawn to the marginal representation, the poor character development and, above all, the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... it's just "part of the" Dog "movie of Flanders. Get the 1959 version!
