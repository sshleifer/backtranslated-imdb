The continuation of "Walking Tall" in 1973 follows the true drama surrounding Tennessee's Sheriff Buford Pusser, but plays like a crazy TV movie. Bo Svenson takes over the role of the CEO of Joe Don Baker, but it's a bit light for him; It's like a popular singer, instead of a bat. Contributors such as Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui do little. I gave him a single star of film on his good intentions, but the ordinary script is a transparent and lazy mass, and production is cheap. In 1977, he continued the "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" and a "A Real American Hero" television movie in 1978.
