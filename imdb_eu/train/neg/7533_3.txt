The film had a nice look. Maybe too much to my liking. The writer / director felt like he was trying to make sense of his inner confrontation with all his characters. Not once, many times ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> TV is work, not cinema. <br /> <br /> The train station's location was well-chosen and Sascha Horler enjoyed being a pregnant friend. <br /> <br /> I just felt the role of Justine Clarke. Reactions to things were felt forced by the director to listen to the voice of the film through the expressions of his protagonist. I can not believe a director has become a presence of Daniela Farinacci's incredulous disbelief. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the full sequence pop music. It is a lazy end, especially when pop music does not have a diagonal in the movie, and when it comes to the shameless lyrical song. <br /> <br /> That said, a movie that reminds the attitude of Australian warm and original origin is of good quality. It creates a hot and sunny atmosphere. Especially we use wonderful animated sequences, because the film does not give the whole challenge, passion and hand-made charm. <br /> <br /> I'm curious about why I feel like this interview. "Who knows if there is a god? To say what he has to do while sitting in the sky" or what was the line. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most annoying moments a friend came back from home, with a bouquet of flowers, saying "give up smoking" to the wife. <br /> <br /> Pre-commercial shopping? TAC advertisement with tasty animations? I had to leave the cinema in the 50-minute movie - it was too much.
