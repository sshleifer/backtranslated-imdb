Oh, if this rubbish was less than one star! It was a nice movie in two parts and that's it! One Worcry, Be Happy song was singing a line or two songs, and the other one fell from Roddy toilet bowl, and legs and legs were separated, when he landed everything else. he lowered his groin. That is, this was nothing more fun, at least not for me anyway! When Doctornappy2 is not correct, we can say that "Shrek" would be a fan of absolutely awesome fans, but fans of "Wallace & Gromit" will definitely be disgusting. "I love Shrek 1 2 and 3, and I also love Wallace and Gromit. You can see what is being read, if an animation goes well, it's worth it to see it definitely, but it could be a good thing to do, surely get it! There were some people in charge of this site saying that they were not others. I do not emphasize the other, but the following are more: when the young daughter leaves the movie at the beginning of the film, the cage will be taken to the door and the right hand side is on the right side, it clearly returns to the roundabout Behind him, Roddy will not be able to get out of it, but he does just that. At one point, the blonde falls to Roddy's back and Rita pushes the air straight into the air while the boat moves forward, the next scene is caught by Roddy. It seems that the only way to get out of the back of Ruby Roddy's shirt is how the ship goes forward. The only place that you could have was, there was no water in Roddy's hand. I wanted to emphasize a third, but for now I forgot. <br /> <br /> If we do not have any more words, some words "jokes" are repeated in one way or another, there was not. It was enough time to set any link with the character, the characters were empty, skinny and empty, and you wanted the whole movie ... about 85 minutes to watch! There are two great options to paint drying or herbs!
