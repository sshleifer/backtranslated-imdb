This movie has been a worse movie than I have ever seen in my life. I'm not joking. They did wrong and the actors could not play. It was my time and money to lose. My friends and I seemed to have the movie together. The case that came into the movie is a costume. There's nothing like the zombie on the front of the movie. It seems that a director or make-up artist called a black eye under someone's eyes. At the beginning of the film, credits take almost 20 minutes. Seeing credits was the best part of the movie. Honestly, the movie was horrible and I could not believe how it was put. The scenes jumped from one thing to another and sometimes it was like "what was going on". The audio was awesome and action plans played around a couple of teenagers to make an apparent battle scene around. <br /> <br /> If you want to buy or buy this movie, I'd recommend at least one trailer. because it shows that it's really awful. I'd like to see it before I rent it.
