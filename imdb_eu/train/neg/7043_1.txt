I was ready to laugh during this movie, like an experiment on the Mystery Science Theater, but it was boring. Apparently, the producers decided to make bikers and from there they decided to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It is often open. The footage of bikers on the dirt road, the same reproduced music. Sadly, Renee Harmon is almost in the movie. Harmon would surely have lived. Perhaps he had other commitments on the day of shooting. <br /> <br /> Of course, the bikers frighten a small town. Fights, murders, police coward, mechanical jewelry, etc. One of the bikes always wears a soccer helmet, another attempt against other bans is weak. <br /> <br /> The script does not offer anything. . A scene a biker attacks a woman and cries out on the woman's face "everyone is the same!" The scene will come again later and again says "You're all the same!". Could you not think the writer thinks something more creative? <br /> <br /> In the end, the bad boys have been killed. We have also suspended the marriage between middle-aged mechanic Joe and Susie. Susie goes to college, and a little bit, Joe's wedding is still there (but with other brides). End
