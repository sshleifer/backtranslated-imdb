Note to horror fans: it's terribly awkward when you realized that you were losing your life for 95 minutes in a lifetime, when it was insulting in a movie that was insulting. <br /> <br /> I saw this: <br /> <br /> The premise swore: it's not. Simply, it's just an excuse to use just the same lame films from some of the other slasher quotes. <br /> <br /> The promise of naked forest nymphs seemed very nice even if it was a great movie: it's not. It's not like that. Cinematography assures that "the fallen angels" are as sexy as a homeless person. and performing a low budget. Think, Savini should have a reason to see this movie. It's not a bad thing, but it's almost always bad films. His good work From Dawn came to Till Dawn, and has since been frightening him in horror conventions. <br /> <br /> But let's look at the positive: Forest of the Damned is not an excellent example. a movie <br /> <br /> Everything else is negative. Of course, the writer is an allergy of originality. The script is horrible. That's all that's been done after the first 10 minutes. But do not be relaxed; As the director thinks about "plot" and "characterization", he does not think of any kind of care; And driving, walking and sequencing of nature are terribly long and boring (they have undoubtedly been added to the right to distribute movies), they have fully demonstrated their capabilities and overall storytelling. <br /> <br /> This is another good example of whether or not a movie is going to be good: if it is written and directed by the same person, I hope it's garbage.
