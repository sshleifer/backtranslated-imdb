The timid moment in this movie is Brady Corbet's 'You have blossomed' about the latest film. I almost died. I still do not know why the scriptwriters were right in the line. Would you like to create love? It almost messed me up. <br /> <br /> The other scripts are hardly a favorite. <br /> <br /> I've never liked Thunderbirds, but Thunderbirds can do so much. This movie is not. Had it not been a great cartoon of the Thunderbirds brand, it would have taken it to the television directly or post-production packed. Maybe even before. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits are rounded up and Busteden is playing 'Thunderbirds are go'. I can not believe that I saw $ 7 lost in pay-per-view.
