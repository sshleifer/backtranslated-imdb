I am a Catholic, taught in monarchy by elementary schools, taught by Jesuit priests in high school and university. I'm still practicing Catholic, but it would not be considered "Catholic Church" because in the eyes of the church there is no belief in some or I do not tell me in certain ways the church tells me. <br /> <br /> So back to the movie ... it's bad, because two people have died because this woman thinks she's a satiation of the religious head. There is no comedy in that, and the satire is not well done by Diane Keaton. I have never seen the play, but if it were very different, it might be a good idea. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought the gun could be fake, and the first shot was shot down by the female lead. four former students as an attempt to prove their sister's emotional and intellectual claim to the faith of Mary. But the bullets are real and the story is tragedy ... the tragedy of life loss (two former students ... the life of aborted babies, the mother of the student's life) the dogmatic tragedy. The authority of the love of the people, the tragedy of the organized religion instead of the true faith of God. This is what happens with today's Islam, and yesterday Judaism and Christianity.
