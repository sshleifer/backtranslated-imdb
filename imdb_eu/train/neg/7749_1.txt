This movie should never be done. Misunderstood animations, misrepresentation and beyond. I'm not sure what the people behind that movie "Ok, look good! Let's do it!" I was scared that this movie was really horrible. At one point, it was a very difficult point. A saber-colored sound created by a computer drops from the roof by drooping the stupid founder of the mouth in the mouth ... ooookkkk. The movie's malady was paralyzed, his first appearance was killed in a minute. The other two people start to attack and die. Then there is a random number of victims waiting for the victims ... this one frightens me one reason. Will the second part be? God, for the sake of human beings, I do not expect. <br /> <br /> The movie was just junk. Finishing the end of slide shows from power ship owners.
