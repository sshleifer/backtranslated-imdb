This was my first and probably the latest Angelopoulos movie. When I got there, Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors, was a movie by Theo, which I've heard a lot. The opening was promising, a long shot on a jeep of soldiers across the border of Albania and Greece. ADOS! But that was all. There is nothing left. The movie had big holes and I do not know what to mention first. The main story of the story reveals the old woman to the journalist. on a long walk. It's like a monologue of 15 minutes, the action and the patience of the audience die, nothing happens during the 15 or 20 minutes of the screen, as well as this old woman who tells a story. Everything that is shown through the action, the old lady was only told a camera. Shortly afterwards, television equipment went to the bar. They rotated the corner and immediately the winter begins! Surely, shot in different days, there is a continuity. There was a lot of problems about the story, nonsense, and irrational, ever attached to a style, which asked the audience to never ask questions. He was given the task that was lacking the poor, integrity or charm of the Mastroianni. On the other hand, as many Greek or Albanian and Balkan people agree, they showed a lot of historical, ethnic or political wrong, in a new revision of a film about "humanity". Much more to say, but not waste time in a poor movie, it was not a movie, but the darkness of a person was impressed by the movie and paid for it with the state money.
