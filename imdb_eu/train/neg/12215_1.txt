What can I say was a robbery in my time to see this movie and I had a great experience. Fay Ann Lee is a horrible actress and does not believe in this film. Larryjoe76 is obviously a reviewer. The land is thinner, at least, the conversation in the canton is not fun. Watch this movie at your own risk. <br /> <br /> Shanghai Tang Tang Tang's film should be followed by little or no revenue generated by the film. The empty drawing tries to make another competition for pilgrims and goes hand in hand with the landscape. It was like watching dry paint. <br /> <br /> In short, this film lost time and space. I've watched better movies on YouTube.
