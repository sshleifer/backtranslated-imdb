I received this DVD from a friend to another (and probably still). The cover of the DVD is also cheap, as the whole movie. Shot and fist fights with delayed sound effects, some of the worst actors I've ever seen in my life, a very simple plot, laughed me ... until the stomach hurts! With little financial resources, I have to admit professionalism. Considered as a movie, he was one of eleven eleven books of the penniless gospel. So, if you're tired and want cheap lace, watch this movie. Alternatively, throw it out of the window.
