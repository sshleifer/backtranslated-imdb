Hollywood is a great example of literary fiction masterpiece and innocent punishment. <br /> <br /> In the case of "The Great Sky", the writers and company Dudley Nichols were proud of. A classic novel that pioneered the author of Pulitzer, Guthrie. In this way, the soul of the story has been removed and any impact that could be considered as a film adaptation. <br /> <br /> The epic character of Guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character, Boone Caudill, a boy-in-law boy in Kentucky, survived a trained and sick man who survived, with the intention of the author to replace it with a farce of a similar boat. In the movie version, except Boone's wonderful presence. <br /> <br /> Guthrie's impact and enthusiasm on some of the most interesting and shocking items on the plot have been deleted, for no reason whatsoever. Mostly understood by the character Zeb Calloway, the character of the book's little event, only occupying a few pages. On the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, Dick Summers, a pioneer veteran, is totally lacking !!! Hawks seems to have not been disappointed by the character of Zeb's film directed by Hunnicutt. So, Zeb / Hunnicutt was given a long time to make a short Hollywood version of screen writing, editing and direction. based books (it's an excellent example of "Ben-Hur" by William Wyl). But this is horrible and depressive, not only as a novel adaptation, but as a film itself. <br /> <br /> The story is dull and topical, and characters - at least not edited. Guthrie's only literary vision is the superficial shadows. Unfortunately, Kirk Douglas's star appeals, which can help raise the film, dismissed the role of listening to milk. <br /> <br /> If you want to believe, the movie version of Guthrie's Pulitzer Prize won. The battle, "The Way West," is even worse with Kirk. <br /> <br /> "My Big Sky" is the history of cinema that directs Howard's Hawks Hawk scene.
