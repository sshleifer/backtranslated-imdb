Positive comments on this film were encouraged to watch this movie. Bad mistake I've seen 950+ movies and this is really the worst thing - almost every way it's awful: editing, walking, story, 'acting', soundtrack (the only song in the movie - it's a town melody less than four times). The movie looks cheap and wicked and it's extreme boring. I was rarely happy to see the latest credits of a movie. <br /> <br /> Only one thing that prevents this score from being awarded is that of Harvey Keitel: this is far from its best performance, it seems to be at least an effort. Only for obsessive Keitel.
