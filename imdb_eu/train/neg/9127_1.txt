Ok, so here's the basics. In 1933, Peter Sellers, PhD. Fu Manchu, has been a Chinese man for 168 years who has lived for quite some time. The film is celebrated with its birthday, which drinks a special elixir (not even mentioned in the movie) extends a long life. This time, an assistant elixir (if you remember Kato Pink Panther) falls into a melancholic position and orders his servants to find six extra items to choose. When his hunters steal diamond museums and get into London, he creates hunting in hunters, Dr. Fu Yemisis, a retired Nayland Smith police officer from Scotland Yard, who works with Sellers. an adventure adventure that is horrible. <br /> <br /> This was the last, long-running, death, Sellers. The tragedy was horrible. Elegantly bought and the roles that have been "fun" in the Panther movies have been memorable and in "The Party", this movie is everything. This movie was totally tortured and I did not even finish it. USE IT, and I still see Sellers' performance. "What is there", a great deal of work a year ago, how can I say this, and how did it do that? A person mentioned earlier, 10.15 minutes earlier, is OK, but it's OK ... <br /> <br /> Avoid pestilence. <br /> <br /> Score out of 10.
