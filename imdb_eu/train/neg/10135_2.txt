I watched this movie in Starz. I improved them to spend some things; Acting, writing, directing, special effects, camera team, sound and lighting. Writers did not even know anyone who had nothing to do with that movie. It seems that in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, you could buy a giant stealth bomber, which could be totally invisible for $ 75 million. Nowadays, these things cost around $ 3 million and can not be invisible. It seems that you can take it from one hour to the south to the USA. There was a completely random lesbian scene, which did not matter to me, but it seemed bad to see more guys. It would randomly increase the cast with the camera and jump to the random scene. Yes, it's been planned since Steven Segal. In general, I'm located in a Snakes on Plane.
