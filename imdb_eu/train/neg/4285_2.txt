If you want to check a good movie on Jason Scott Lee, I recommend the following: <br /> <br /> Dragon: Bruce Lee story <br /> <br /> Rapa Nui <br /> <br /> "Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision "is a horrible movie. The enormous value of production. Immense impact Awesome script I would not recommend that anyone who thinks this movie seriously sees anybody who anticipates street entertainment or American Awesome American entertainment (this film does not). <br /> <br /> At least I would like it. Say that this movie is a good entertainment in a rainy day, if you find yourself hanging over the surfing. If you're curious about renting Netflix, but this movie is definitely not maintained. <br /> <br /> If you're one of the few people you saw in this American way of filmmaking. and he was disappointed and I recommend the following films for your personal conception. These are the films written, highly valued films, with a teammate with Asian American actors: <br /> <br /> Better Luck Tomorrow <br /> <br /> Mulan
