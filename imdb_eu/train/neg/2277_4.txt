'The Vampire Bat' is definitely interesting, being one of the first films of the 1930s at the beginning of the horror genre, but being isolated, everything is a bit daunting. <br /> <br /> The movie is nineteenth. In the 19th century it was established in a European village, where some killings attributed suspicious locals to vampirism. It is a similar feeling of James Whale's Frankenstein and, in addition to joining Lionel Atwill's Dr. Niemann, he has ideas for scientific advancement. <br /> <br /> The subject of the vampire is arbitrary and only Herman (Dwight Frye), the town of love in Hannah (Dwight Frye), suspected of being a fairy tale, used to make an excuse for a mafia lantern, as they needed. <br /> </ p> <p> This is one of the truncated trios that were performed by Leral Atwill and Fay Wray ('Doctor X' and 'The Wife Museum of the Mystery'); and other collaborations, a badly advised movie, a comic relief and a horror trend in the main thriller elements. In the context however, 'The Vampire Bat' is still weak and derivative. <br /> <br /> Everything we do about Frankenstein's bad imitation, vampire items, Dracula is a mere device that hoodwinks. For the title, the movie is afraid, and it should be noted that director Frank Strayer made a few years later with 'Blondie'.
