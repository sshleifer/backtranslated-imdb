When I heard that the duke of Hazzard renewed with current actors and with a good script, we seemed "well, I'll give them a chance, it's not better than the first, but we'll see what happens." Well, I saw what happened. I saw that there was a classic show of the late 70s, which was humiliated by Hollywood. It's so sad that Hollywood scriptwriters can not create something original. Apparently, they will have a great show that has a great audience and try the classic "REMAKE" show. Hollywood heads ... You are not busy !!!! However, more about the show. I think Sean William Scott (Stiffler American Pie) was the best actor. I am sure that John Schneider is the despair of the person who portrayed and took advantage of his character. Also, Get real for, as Johnny Knoxville, Luke Duke. What bass can you go? Actor theater for Luke's lover. This makes me sick. Also, I will give Jessica Simpson a beautiful woman, but her activity is horrible. Catherine Bach played the original Daisy, smart, sexy, strong, and was a good girl from the southern IL. The role model for each little girl grew up! (I became aware of Doll and Jeep - Thank you!) However, Jessica Simpson played a smart butt, 2-bit as Daisy Duke. Daisy was never a blonde. Why they should throw it away Jessica Alba Daisy would play an excellent Duke. He can speak with a strong Southern accent, and it is beautiful, and he would do a wonderful job. However, I would like to say that this movie is a tough thing. It seems I'm deducted from the $ 8.50 payment I'm going to get, and they will refund the money. If you do not see the movie if you like Hazzard Duke (original series). It will come out badly. CMT (country music television) Duke again plays at night later. So, set your TIVO's and go real stuff, not on the big screen Hollywood imitation.
