Wow, this movie was terribly bloody. However, I had a bad time to see it, although I still wanted to get the money back. <br /> <br /> The movie is not understandable. Science-fiction clicks better made filmmakers much better. The performances, especially the directors, were so much in love with Ed Wood as they were at the top. Speaking about Ed Wood, he would be proud of his character's conversation. There is only silence about irony or humor. In addition, it does not make sense, no plots, or missing. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are good, but they're not enough to go "oh wow, cool" and they just seem like it. Rather be drawn to "cool" rather than throwing it into a good line. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack did not set any mood. Once again, the director seems to have thrown his songs into the film, trying to make it "cool". <br /> <br /> What brings me to my last point. Perhaps if the director worries more about plot, storytelling and conversation rather than trying "fresh", he did not make a ditchy cliche of that short film. <br /> <br /> <br />
