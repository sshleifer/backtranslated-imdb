I bought this movie for 1 euro, I did not know what it was. I thought "hmmm, a boy called a movie should be very entertaining at least with gore." It was not fun either. It was disturbing. Very disturbing And I do not care to worry about what to swear, but this does not mean anything, the abuse of the child is not a good thing to do. hmmm ... The quality of the images was horrible. Performance ... there was no performance. Just mutilating some fcked-up fcker for over 90 minutes. This is probably the material for extraction of extreme penetrating gore. <br /> <br /> Do not ignore it. It's not your time to deserve it. It's wonderful. I never wanted to buy this one. <br /> <br /> They should cut the fonts that they did
