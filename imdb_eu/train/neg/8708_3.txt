Like all Carnosaur movies, this is a joke. They tell me how to move dinosaurs when my sister plays with her dolls, because they could not be more rigid or fake. <br /> <br /> The plot does not make any sense. I mean, first of all, they are on the bus, then in a warehouse they suddenly aboard. And to get overwhelmed, is it sensible that both dinosaurs can fit together in the vans or the boat? I thought the dinosaurs were the tallest animals, and now they come in a van that is moving. It seems even when you think that fool. <br /> <br /> The only reason I have given it 3 is still fun. I found it better than the first one (it has not yet seen the second one). Just do not rent. I saw it on TV and I did it because I did not want to rent money.
