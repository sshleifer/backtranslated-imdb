Some people think they've never seen the movie worse, and I understand where they came from, but I've seen it really worse. <br /> <br /> That said, the movies I remember. (that is to say, those that are not blocked) were less prone, because they were so bad, they felt the sense of physically seeing all the senses. War Games 2 are worse than those that you want to make your eyes look like or you want to break into sharp ears in your ears; you are beyond the horror of other parts of your soul. > <br /> War Games: Dead Code is not bad, but it's pretty close. Yes, I was an original, but I did not expect miracles. Let's see, initially, that the origin of a movie was not very good, especially for the 80s, there was just a love movie for young people, with a geek image <br /> <br /> I hope all of this, something bad, but that's it can it pull my geek chains. Was it too much to ask? Is not it possible to play better than original games, even if you have a video release directly? Well, he seemed to ask him too much. Keep it from this movie. At first it's just a bad thing, such as "Oh, this is a bad thing, but I enjoy it, maybe it's just as good as the original." And then it's worse, and at last, believe that you do not want to see this movie.
