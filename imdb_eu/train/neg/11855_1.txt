That is, at 2 in the afternoon, one of the films that appear in the cable, while eating the bored housewives. Operation is the second rate. Mathew Modine makes it difficult to see the whole movie. And God helped Gina Gershon. Its accent is on top. It's not really a real Englishman. It seems necessary and false, like acting. He should match the best one, a showgirl with-artist lesbian, who plays rock and roll, and has a drug problem. Other characters are not better. They are two-dimensional. empty, empty and stupid. How do we take care of these people? At one point, Christy Scott Cashman has been lost to Central Park. Really It's not so hard to navigate Central Park. Keep it on any road. I do not care about my characters, I do not hate it. The only reason I was with the railroad destruction of a movie was Fisher Stevens. Even though his excellent mood was not dying to save this fish. Each scene is a typical romantic comedy and nothing remains to surprise us. The script was awesome with the performance. If you catch this fish throw them away!
