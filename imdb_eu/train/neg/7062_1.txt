Ok, surely, the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This did not make any sense, there was no plot, characterization, no performance, anything. <br /> <br /> I thought I have here on the 28th of May 2003 when I saw it ** watch out, that is, it's a spoiler alert. I also complain that the movie is complaining about how bad it is: <br /> <br /> the wrong movie starts and the characters enter, but there is no character explanation. I knew how the main character was in this school, but apparently not. He also lived ... afterwards, that he was a boyfriend ... then his mother lived with a lively alcoholic. It seems that all the friends had no parents and they lived. <br /> <br /> Now we get to a main plot, this madness is disturbed and goes out. Now, our main character is the guy and he cares with the film carefully. I think the main item of the plot has been lost here, that there was no reason for the main character. Although there is no reason, why do they continue to be skeptics like 5 minutes earlier and what they want. <br /> <br /> The movie continues and gets it. okay They are destroying school, blah blah blah. But wait a minute ... Suddenly everyone knows that the main character is 'show' here. Wait a few seconds, would not the nonsense be the main character DO NOT do this? he had to be inonomous. <br /> <br /> ah another important plot has been skipped ... insane guy was not insane ... everyone said he was not insane. But as the story continues, it's ABOUT YOUR MENT. but I thought the news was not ... hm ... <br /> <br /> Now the movie is over. CLOSE UP WHAT IS THIS HELL? The ending was not the answer to any question about the main character, he was not asked about insanity. Are those people in the same situation? yes, then there are no basic stories that tend to do so. If not, then what do you mean "say in two weeks". <br /> <br /> * The end of the topic ... * <br /> <br /> Then I thought. Now I think quite now. It's 6 months down the line and if I get free, I would give it another chance, but I question it. I'm very sorry.
