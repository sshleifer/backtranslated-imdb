This movie has been a "Plan 9" competitor as a film ever made. Always worry is the same person: <br /> <br /> 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Author 5. Stuntman and 6. Editor. Sadly, Justin Kreinbrink has done 6 jobs! The IMDb shows that he and his father are the western 'stunt men'. Maybe it was a problem. <br /> <br /> The only example of the film: in the film, the sheriff must protect the witness from other countries. Of course, the bad ones are listening and waiting. But what's up Good boys are horseback riding and a shot pulls out and next to it a tree hits them. When the camera shows us bad guys, they're sitting in a record and chatting. What's wrong with this picture! <br /> <br /> I continued. Maybe this movie was understood as a comedy. If so, he did not do it right.
