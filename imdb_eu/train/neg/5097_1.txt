Unlike most other writers, I hate this very series. <br /> <br /> It is interesting, with mysterious foreigners and giant robots, and I have kept the latest experiences. In the end, I still do not understand what foreigners were in the attacks (maybe I lost something, who knows?), And I realized sitting through 26 episodes primarily through the characters themselves hatred, selfishness and self-compassion. It flattens the lines between alien characters and robots, and I hate "just one or more characters or more, crying out or shouting" in dark dark and shadowy characters and depressions. /> <br /> <br /> I can not see Shinji or Asuka (two of the main characters) showing growth or change (I can not see other characters or even grow). I wanted to call the first episodes to kick and get a bloody life and did not change the final feelings Shinji has a kind of anger that is really annoying, more annoying than people, than welfare, and Asukak is so much more believable as I want to break the television screen. Oh, and more than anyone else, they both hate everything and often say They have a veeeeeeeery. I read the series that the creator / writer wrote that he was suffering from depression, and I believe that he was watching me. Is that the purpose? Actually, I ask. Do you want to confuse and annoy the audience? And if it's suffering from depression, why not write about a book or biography, instead of mixing aliens and mice? This strange land of war, as I can say, goes completely wrong. <br /> <br /> In the end, I am really captivated as the people say that the plot of the deceased lives in love, I can not worry no matter how many they really find and how much they say.
