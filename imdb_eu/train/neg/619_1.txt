WOW is all about watching your reading or thinking about it. See me trust! <br /> <br /> The worst act ever performed in several episodes of this movie I laughed so much fun! I do not think they have passed the school signal! I had to play this scene repeatedly, to laugh more and more. If he does such a movie, it gives us hope to make our movies. the costume was also bad. My 7-year-old cousin seems to have a better job. Heck wrote the bet and could play it better. I know everything must be seen in the second part, if it were as bad as the first one. It's a wonderful idea about a killer murderer, but it can be a much better job. Luckily, another movie of the spectrum killer comes out, like this.
