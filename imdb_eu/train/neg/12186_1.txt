This version of the original movie in 1962, the book has some good pieces and we will present some of the great actors. However, Scorsese will change the final lines and the endless shame of Shakespeare for me. looking at my watch <br /> <br /> DeNiro is an excellent actress who wants to offer everything that he has to offer, despite the need to direct his talent, which he lacks in the last five minutes. to film <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck's camera is functional, but nothing more, Robert Michum is always fun to watch, with just a few lines like that. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolt performs better than Lorenzo's Oil, but it's not called "Weeds". Joe Don Baker has great lines, Juliette Lewis again proves that talent is skipping a generation. <br /> <br /> Good points? Initial credits (!), When Cody's back went into prison, on stage on Cody baseball bats, Sam Bowden has become terrified, Cody is quietly but disturbed. <br /> <br /> Worst? "The cleaning woman - BUT NO, really!" part At high speeds, the bottom of a car is hidden by hand. (If there are no bumps in the US?) "It's dead, but it's not really !!!" Parts and end of the aforementioned end. <br /> <br /> I can see the originals again, but I still have to be tempted to see it again for four years.
