Watching this movie is the only reason for a star or a producer with the actor Nichole Hiltz. The revenge is a show of that huge and moving story. Under the direction of Simon Gornick, the film is the protagonist of Joyce Hyser who decides to take his wife to his revenge. Oh, but not by ordinary. She talks about the entire Warlike War and chooses the bad girl Nichole Hiltz as her choice weapon. Nichole (like on Tuesday) wants to get close to his ex (beautiful and dull Stephan Jenkins, who should be bound to music) ashamed of him and losing his life. David DeLuise is good at his short moments, and former star of "Crime Story" Anthony Dennison is hardly ever given, but scowl. On the other hand, Hiltz is regularly sexy and playful, then evil and bad. He also manages the weak and "maybe a bit psychotic". Even though it is very hot (although it does not show a bit extravagant), you will be able to understand how it can reach the guessed guy. But the performance is wasted in this movie, which is not recommended, which is quite interesting or interesting.
