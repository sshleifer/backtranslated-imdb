I think that this movie is based on a real story ... It refers to young girls over 48 years of age, I do not know where fear strikes here ... There are some sequences in the "weird" and "surrealists", and play two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... yes). He hates the role of two psycho-men ... they do a pretty good job (although some of them go over). The movie is not good, and it's not horrible; it's really dated! I mean this dripping 70s thing. It's not really bad if you like this thing ... you know ...
