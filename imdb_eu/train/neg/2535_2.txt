As a recent event, WWE New Year Revolution headed a 2006 Elimination Chamber game. The difference between recent years and years was the value of entertainment. Actually, only three people lived with the WWE Championship of Pepsi Arena (WWE) in Albania (New York). These men were the current champion John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. There was no way Vinnie Mac would put it on the belt; Carlito or Chris Masters. And Kane? Kane was held in WWE in 1998 and was one night. It was clear that he would not be. The game of recent years was an exciting affair with six great models that the WWE offered. They were planned and disappointing in 2006, but the nightlife is still far away. <br /> <br /> The only night's surprise came after the main bell. Out Vince McMahon walked himself and asked to lift the chamber. Then it was announced that Edge was earning his money in the banking championship, there. After winning the Elimination Chamber without time of preparation, John Cena had no chance and the title fell one of WWE's most entertaining heels. It was the only entertaining action that happened throughout the night. <br /> <br /> The card, like last year, was very dire. Triple H and The Big Show performed stinging efforts. HHH won, but that was never a doubt? With payouts by Jerry Lawler and Viscera, they will never succeed, they really do. King Helms tightened (who wrote the books?) And Big Vis tasted the victory against Shelton Benjamin with his mother's help. <br /> <br /> WWE's women also had a busy night. Common Diva was absurd in the Bra and Panties Gauntlet match, Ashley won and the Women's Championship was also on the line. In a match, WrestleMania 22 Mickie James thought that Trish Stratus would question the good game. Trish won the competition, but it was obvious that he will continue in the near future. <br /> <br /> The opening night competition, soon will be the WWE Champion Edge, Ric Flair of the Intercontinental Championship. This could have been better, but he was retained after the dismissal of a Flair was frustrated and bloody. Edge fed some bigger fish, of course. <br /> <br /> So the New Year Revolution released a payment for the 2006 payment. Only one thing, knowing it is the only way for WWE. They do not get much worse than that.
