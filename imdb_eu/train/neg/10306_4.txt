After seeing the twelve sections, as I decided to refuse this investigation, I described it in a realistic way to mathematical modeling. In the episodes that Charlie would predict future behavior through mathematical models, I thought I was joking in my profession. I am not a mathematician, but a chemistry engineer, but I work hard with mathematical models. So I'm going to explain why I'm going to explain why they're close to "believing" fairy tales. <br /> <br /> First of all, choosing the right model to predict the proper situation is a daunting task. Charlie Eppes appears as a genius, but he too should spend a long time looking for a suitable model, to try to figure out exactly what someone else is doing or what is in the near future. Individuals are incorrect and random, there is no modeling. Isaac Asimov also wrote in the 1950s. Although there is a model for a specific type of person, it would be a probabilistic (stoicastic) one, because it has a good chance of making predictions. <br /> <br /> Secondly, one finds a situation that chooses someone or a suitable model, they need to know the model parameters. These parameters are constants of equations, such as gravity acceleration (9.8 m / s2), and often not easily determined. Once again, Charlie Eppes had to be terrified to know the correct parameters of the model he had to choose. By choosing the model and parameters, they should try. Curiously enough, they are not, and by miracle, they fit the predictable situation exactly. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always forgotten, not only by numbers, but by science. -f movies: computing effort needed to solve these models. Try to try Excel to solve a complex model with many equations and variables and work in Herculean. Although Charlie Eppes's software for fixing its models is correct, it's likely to be stuck with the hard-working hardware. With the right combination of software / hardware, the model solution may take a few days. Immediately fixed it! I can use his computer in my research, I would be very happy. <br /> <br /> As a drama, it is far from being the best show. The characters are incredibly stereotypical, but not as fun as the Big Bang Theory. Crimes are sad and Charlie Eppes fixes how sometimes FBI looks pretty wrong. <br /> <br /> For some laymen, the show can work. For others, managing things is difficult to swallow!
