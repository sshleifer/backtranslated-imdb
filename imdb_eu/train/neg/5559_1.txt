This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Was Avengers a bad honor? but no longer. The play "Jill the Ripper" is awesome and has only passed through the plot. This movie is as intellectually stimulating as Telletubbes. He does not know whether he wants an S & M movie or a bad thriller. Look for extreme poisoning or bedding and need leather distraction. This script should be reused in a pornographic format, it would not take much effort and it would be lower. A porn, even a bad porn, would not hurt Dolf Lundgren's career.
