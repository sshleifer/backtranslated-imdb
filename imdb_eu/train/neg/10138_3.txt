Over the years I have watched live video games Segal movies, each with the same amount of entertainment; unfortanetley, entertainment is low. Of course, action sequences were fun, but that was quite. Seagal was really like his first movie; Under Siege, Under Siege 2, and Executive Decision (at least in the action view), but in the last ten years, Segal's films have not covered the titles of these titles. <br /> <br /> On a more positive aspect, the film used time well, like some action sequences and the use of meaning. When it seemed that he had just dragged the movies, he took out the scene from the beautiful action scene. I honestly assure that Segal's films would get better if the film only admits fans. Supporting actors and actors is very important, and if their current films have been known as supporting actors and actresses, perhaps the movie will get more popular results.
