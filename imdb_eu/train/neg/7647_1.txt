Madison's bridge is a better version of this story. The end of this film was not sensibly handled, as in the original English film. This movie is very well-known, it's a very sensitive person who tears himself in a movie when you finally love this movie; on the other hand, if you're a life-fighter and crying, you might think. It's not like an ending. But, in general, quite good subject matter is directed towards Indian conditions. Tabu was a solidarity and mother. Everyone played well.
