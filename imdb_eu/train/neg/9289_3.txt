With Twitch talking about what happened to her in the original movie, you'll find your chance and then go back to the real world. <br /> <br /> The first movie that writes about yesterday in Twitch told Twitch, so he will be taken to another jail where the fighting champions are hanging. Twitch wants to stop jailing for a month, with the woman getting gold for life. <br /> <br /> Then something happens and someone fights and the movie becomes Die Hard in another prison. But the fighter's daughter catches everything, so she fixes with her and Twitch's wife. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the performance is under the same pair (it is very annoying). ) rap music and poorly published fight scenes. In a positive sense, this Hispanic block has everything that has ever been done in prison / action / thriller and has closed the door. <br /> <br /> It is not very fertile, but at least that's it. dangerous. <br /> <br /> If you had a fan of the original, it's so-ish. <br /> <br /> If not, you're warned.
