Although the production and direction of Jerry Jameson are accurate improvements, "Airport 77 is not much better than the" Airport 1975 ": a decent sense of commercial garbage (this time literally). Jack Lemmon is robbed of robbers of art and is a pilot of the plane that falls into the sea (all advertising has been said to be near the Bermuda Triangle, but there is no mention of that film). When rescue boats leave the aircraft, they will see all of their crane fall into the sea and it is difficult not to laugh (connecting the cranes to the plane, the passengers and the mixed script) NBC seemed like a "director's cut" air, at least one hour footage - Especially flashbacks, all of the details of a "Gilligan's Island" injected into the procedure, the most exciting thing is airliner crash, and players have a lot of fun: Lee Grant is drunk, Brenda Vaccaro, a senseless guest, old Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland They are flirting. However, personal identity conflicts and military details end up patiently. ** ****
