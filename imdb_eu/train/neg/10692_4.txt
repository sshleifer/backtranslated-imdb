When ingrid went to Italy, she suffered and suffered from glamorous Hollywood treatment. First, he was suffering from the turmoil of STROMBOLI volcanic islands, the fact that less defects would be the loss of a food route. And now, it is EUROPA 51, another boring exercise of sinister feeling. his young son. At least this one has better production values ​​and more coherent script than STROMBOLI. <br /> <br /> Bergman is still still attractive, but she is a woman of a richer society. He has never been able to face sudden loss of his son, despite the attempts of a pleasant friend. "Sometimes I think I'm leaving," she tells her husband. A great expression in a movie full of humor or grace, but gives us a sense of where the story is. <br /> <br /> Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in war in Rome. But being a social worker with poor children is not improving emotional health and, as a result, the plot is getting worse. <br /> <br /> The overall effect of the movie is not enough to access a project. An important star like Bergman. The film loses its rhythm in the middle of the story, as Bergman becomes more and more difficult, and the husband suspects that it is twice its time. The story goes down from where the street worker is nursing in his terminal illness. The last thread of the earthquake needs her husband to observe in a mental asylum. <br /> <br /> Ingrid suffers completely (compensates for losing his son), but it does not work. It's not one of his best films to say clearly. <br /> <br /> Curiosities would be noticed: if neo-realism prefers mental illness, it may have been approved by SNP PIT by the director of Anatole Litvak! EUROPE Over 51 should do more in their career. <br /> <br /> Summarizing: Rossellini and Bergman's other horrendous generosity.
