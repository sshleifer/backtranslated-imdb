Wow, Naked Brothers Band. What should I say? I can say that this show is a bad thing. Number 1: it has no talent, they can hardly play. Number 2: they said they were commercially famous, but no one heard them until they appeared on a crappy show. Look, I really do not hate badly, I would give it out of 10 in four ways, but what they feel bad mean they all know how talented they are, and Nat is very deep and he writes in-depth lyrics. Deep in my ass! He talks about hard fighters with inner feelings. wow, I have read what they say in the bathroom walls and it would be deeper than that. And they did not know from them, their parents were famous and they wanted to have their children too much, so they did a bad performance. I think it will soon be canceled.
