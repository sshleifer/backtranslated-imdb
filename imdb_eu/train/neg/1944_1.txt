I grew up in Scooby Doo throughout my life, my father grew up Scooby Doo. We have seen the first episode of Shaggy and Scooby. What planet Warner Bros is to fall into the air. Characters could be drawn to younger siblings. The story is one of the best twins of my three year olds (as well as Scooby Doo fans). They're just Scooby and Shaggy !!!!! Casey Kasem, but no one knows Shaggy's voice, it will not work like that! trust me <br /> <br /> This program was shy. Scooby Doo's news is much better. Why change the winning format? Bin throw this piece of rubbish and go back to the authentic Scooby
