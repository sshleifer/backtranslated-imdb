Ed Wood "9" malignant calendar space Space From Outer Space has an angry foreigner who calls human race "... stupid! Stupid, stupid stupid!" In that trial, I should say, surely, a rigid film science fictional science. <br /> <br /> The new movie that stars Jean Claude Van Damme returns to the original movie, Luke, a former universal soldier, who is nowadays a good universal soldier. While Van Damme was in the form of a big two sequel's role, Universal Soldier's fourth feature film had to do a lot more. So surely, breathing through the whole way, it throws and grunts and scowls ninety minutes through explosions and karate shots. You will find plenty of foreign violence, but I would recommend you to check your brain to see the door. Otherwise, you will forget about the place you left your last time. <br /> <br /> Luke is called against a universal soldier after a really bad computer called Seth (HAL looks like it). all other universal soldiers make the murderers evil and boring. Actually, these things are to be programmed, but in this case their creators are dying, not "the enemy", so it's a problem. <br /> <br /> I love the dumb logic of this movie. A supercomputer that will create a supercomputer that appears to be a shame that Michael Jai White will be in this movie. Seth, the creator, who is more frequent than the Old Faithful, means that he is a pale, sterile, stereotype, steam. One of the logic of the character against the character of the carat will appear three characters that break ten glasses after another, the time of the screen in three minutes. <br /> <br /> A character with a movie daughter, fighter Bill. Goldberg as a fighter wrestling as a Universal Soldier, and so enduringly romanticism, writers of the love affairs are really a good thing. And when this film ends, it ends. After a huge explosion of a giant style of a minute, the credits are running. It's not the epilogue, where they are now, without the last kiss, explosion, embrace. The creators want to get out as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Although not in Plan 9, in the United States: TR is a small action movie that will be fun in a fun-filled game. Van Damme's enthusiasts enjoy their new hero's depth. It is not seen in a serious stomach.
