With the seaside history of World War II, and like someone who is not proud of the history of the races of this country, I wanted to see this movie. What a disappointing piece of schlock. I walked about 3/4, but I had to turn it off in that subversive scene. The idea that a U-boat would turn a torpedo into a DDE, as if it were a hope of hitting it, then DDE is "absent" while it is absurd, it's absurd. It's just a little detail. The whole movie was badly written, misread and misinterpreted. I agree with others on this board that it could be a good movie. As the Second World War propaganda film, as they decided to do with white flaws, had to join the blacks. And they were just as bad as the old movies, which is really worse. And it's almost fake ads with Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. It has become very small roles. I believe that two good actors were ashamed to link this movie. I finished it. Much of life has given me too much life.
