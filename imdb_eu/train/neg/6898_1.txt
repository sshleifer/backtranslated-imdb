Avoid this shit at all costs. Bad script, bad management, performance, bad editing, bad sound and bad music. Got the idea? This movie wants to be a flavored western, it's not. It tries to become a hard core, it's not. It tries to introduce a new look to an old gender, no. The actors are trying, and my heart goes to them. However, working with this material is hard to make something shine. The first attempt for me is "all fireworks of a new outta movie". Freshmen filmmakers often bite more, or cheat on their quote. The best thing you can do is step by step, confirm that it is possible, and work on a limited budget next time.
