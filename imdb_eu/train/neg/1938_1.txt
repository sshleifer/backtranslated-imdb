Where do i start <br /> <br /> # 1 Amitabh's son, Akshaye Khanna, is 30 years old. <br /> <br /> <br /> Amitabh has been in prison for over 33 years <br /> <br /> A) Do you have to transmit the sperm house telepathically? <br /> <br /> B) Did you ask me to take care of a police policeman? <br /> D) Previously <br /> <br /> E) Producers had too much bargain <br /> <br /> when the script was approved? <br /> <br> # 2) Amrita Rao (Yummm!) Khanna wants - yum, yum, yummy ... and apparently wants her - who would not, right ?! ... But when he gets mad at his father, and then he's killed (I do not think this is a "spoiler" that we should not be blind and blind to avoid access to the film), it's quite moving to this catastrophe and the tip of his hat (metaphorically ). He leaves behind to save his father, he does not care about his loss, and says (the paraphrase) "If God wants to, we'll meet him again" ... Basically say "I'll get my dad" d Do my job, forgive your loss - CYA! Buh Bye! "Callus beyond the" Hollywood miniature standards "... <br /> <br /> # 3 There are several holes in this terrific loss of time, a movie called" Jeep ", a movie, camels, camels, and whatever else. Pass - time, really, totally and totally lost time - Oh, there is a great sequence of dances (yes, only - like the dance sequence - regardless of quality) belly dancing - but it is not worth it. > <br /> Let Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (Hrithik Roshan take on acting lessons) for the best Indo-Pak conflict ... Indeed, Veer-Zaara is quite good. 7.5 / 8 I would say!
