I keep that song on the head. It's not the biggest song, but they're 80's. This movie kills a "supposebly" singer while murdering him while singing his girlfriend's voice. Billy "Eye" (both right) died two years afterwards and his team returns to a concert, then the only copyist is a singer. Billy walks with her and eventually kills everyone and she has a terrible girl and she thinks she is surrounded by people who think that something is wrong and that things represent things. He finally decided to go to a cemetery and punch his grave to see where it is still. He sees dead, but still sees and hears his voice. At the end of the film, we find the reason for everything, Billy recounts John's brother (again) and John confesses that his father killed his brother Jeloskor and killed him all. When he blames his brother, he wears a girlfriend and frightens him, because he was crazy. The endless one is very gentle and the theater is very wood and wood. But ... I like it anyway. I can see it as a song. I wanted it.
