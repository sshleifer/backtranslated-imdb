Do not worry about money leaking. Do not enter the car and think that this movie does not seem to appeal to others. If you want to watch this movie on this weekend, go back to see Batman. <br /> <br /> Writing is awesome. Random randomized movie format. Given: a strange man who discovers all the traces of a place, a place of confined spaces, an unbelievable police officer, and an innocent and very curious, but beautiful and powerful woman. The audience would like to call the girlfriend. Mix it up, add a lot to run badly, and what the hell, let's put some freak in it for a bit "spin" on the plot. <br /> <br /> The play was awesome and the characters were unbelievable - Borat was more believable than this. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** and someone please tell me how a tomb of a jacket can shoot the bullet after shooting it to the person, even after shooting without shooting? ??? I'm in the army We need these kinds of things ourselves. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10 and I would be able to give the lowest score possible in the tenth tenth.
