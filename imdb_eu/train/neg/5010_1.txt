Do not waste your time or money for this. You can divert this thriller into half a decent boot, but do not think it's been 80 minutes since it's breaking records. <br /> <br /> It is not. <br /> <br /> It's not your fear, laugh, cry or challenge. Without a doubt, you'll be asked what the movie produced. Yes, it's really poor.
