My girlfriend, the one who has chosen to go to the blockbuster, has not heard anything. Actually, sometimes it has brought some fun discoveries. Often, it is said that the best is one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> He brought home the tips of a caterpillar. He was excited to say that the box was fun. Luckily, the propaganda in boxes is never a lie. <br /> <br /> This film was a patience exercise. It's one of those movies, if you have little or no people who love to watch movies that you like, you hate all the characters in the movie. Until the most beautiful character is set. The character will love the annoying character of the face and will play it in the real world as someone who drives away. Therefore, those who are emotionally sour, stuck and unruly are lovingly protected and find their success in their career. Then they meet a pleasant, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving character (almost a perfect man). At that time, we see the woman, the appearance of the evil artist (at the age of 30). She is in love. Therefore, he tries to escape from a fleeing intelligent man who is emotionally mature and has to be a married man with a great sex. The man is sour and is in his power to promote everything. In the real world, it was quite successful. I definitely wanted to run away and I was not in touch with him! <br /> <br /> Although the man had "fought" his love, I never wanted to. (She did not deserve my girlfriend too.) And, why do I ask him, did the director think he was "almost perfect guy" to be punished to gain a relationship with him? When the artist asked when the "perfect guy" came out, we started shouting. There is a problem that the hero of the movie is so annoying when you want to stop the child and the stupid one. <br /> <br /> In addition, Andy Dick laughed me several times. although his character was distressed. As for the other characters, they played very well, morally defeated and annoying characters. It's a comedy and I can say I've laughed at the movie several times. Unfortunately, there has not been much laughing about the last 10 minutes or so. When I was laughing, I prayed for a movie too long to finish. These vile people have gone out of my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the love that people hate to people who deserve it, then this is the movie for you.
