Honestly, I was disappointed with the "Expiration date". Great name and interesting premise, but I do not think I give it. What was it Is the desire to associate the roots of the main character with the self-centered? Or maybe he had to overcome the fear of death. But he was not set for someone who was afraid. It seems life would go well, but it's worrying that he's up until now. I did not buy In the meantime, it seems that they do not have characters of the film in line with the main story. The only thing they did was that they were parallel to the main character. Likewise, it was treated as "curse" more than coincidence. Who frightened the family? Why? When? Finally, why did not he want to stay in his apartment for a whole year? These are my critics, but I love the Seattle plans, it was a beautiful cinematography, when the performance was not very good.
