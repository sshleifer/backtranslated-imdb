There is not much such a genre, this street action street action is the only one I found when some friends made some beers. I'm pretty open and I'm a fan of Eamonn Walker. So I was prepared to enjoy myself. <br /> <br /> Blood and Bone is the story of Isiah Bone, a former street-maker. Fighters are unknown reasons as the film progresses. Bla bla blah <br /> <br /> What is boring film? I understand that movies like this do not trust in the plot, but do they have to make their stupid, predictable and stupid stories? It may not be important, but golly gum by me annoy me. It is better not plots and mere action than the apparent pessimism of a narration. With a totally simple and strange feeling, it is a thin turkey full of rotten Indian earrings. At this point, probably, the drawing of the movie I had to mention: the fight. Fights are themselves poor. Bone picks up the good fighters on the street in a single puncher (one or two big boards are trying to correct this non-contradictory filmmaker); It seems that fighting fighters, one-way attack, is a foolish courage. Although this is repetitive and stupid, the arms are broken and the faces shake and we see it again and again. <br /> <br /> A mill, worth the number of the movie. Directly to the DVD state, absolutely nothing and everything we have seen again and again. And not particularly well.
