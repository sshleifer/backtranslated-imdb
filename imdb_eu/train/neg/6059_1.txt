I had to say that he was a fan of the Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing, surely, his best films. <br /> <br /> Then you got this POS. I can not logically think that he has made the effort to cigarette smoking. At least, his son has made a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Looking at this, it does not seem like a movie. It seems that someone else looks at something. I do not think Carpenter made any effort. <br /> <br /> I just had to listen to the H2 / H3 / The Fog soundtrack in its old school and it was very wonderful, especially during those times. <Br /> <br /> Nobody was using a style and it worked so well for his film.
