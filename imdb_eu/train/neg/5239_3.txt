I saw this film based on other opinions I read. <br /> <br /> I did not see anything I saw forever, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> The movie starts at a good pace, and its first 15 or 20 minutes are interesting, and then it begins to emerge and it starts to avoid it, without mentioning the incredible. <br /> <br /> Finally you will find yourself saying: "What!", will he do that too? How far will it go with this? " <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> Argument begins with the character of Jeff Goldblume, John, in a delicatessen. to buy a wine bottle. There is a robbery and a new agent, Auggie Rose, robbery dies. <br /> <br /> John plays ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy. This looks a bit like it, but wait, there's more. <br /> <br /> John is completely obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that do not have any logical sense, John has a very good life, a beautiful and loving girlfriend, safe work, paid, home, nice car, outfits. - She says she wants to be a loser like Auggie Rose, and she lives in a life-long experience with a girlfriend dipper and the most dangerous people to experience connections. <br /> <br /> Why this darkness ... Roasted and half-baked movies I've never met with good reviews. Sure Goldblum does a good work of theater - it always does - and has improved with its appearance - but if you do not have a great suggestion with Jeff Goldblume and you need to watch all the movies, I would not recommend this turkey. About two hours of your life you will not return again ... and believe me - you do not appreciate anything at the end of these two hours, you're still not sure if you're watching this movie watching this movie! <br /> <br />
