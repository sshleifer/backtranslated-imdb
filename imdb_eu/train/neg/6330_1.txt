If you enjoy original SNL and shows, avoid this movie with all costs. This was my first time friends and we waited for more than an hour to go to the home of the sold out movie. In the middle of the film, the theater 3/4 was empty. We thought we should be better off. At the end of the movie, we were the only ones we left in the theater. The film lasted only one day in all theaters and then the sight disappeared. In conversations with "Mr. Mike" he denied comments about this movie. The film was a joke around the SNL film sections after closing the movie and closing it on a single day. We all tried to get in touch with "Mr. Mike" to make money with the phone and emails, but they were completely ignored.
