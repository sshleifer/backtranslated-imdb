After being banned by John Dillinger (Warren Oates), he is an Ebbo rapist, another thief in the 1930s, who is squeezed into a farmhouse and surrounded by the FBI. Under the second order, Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson) analyzes the situation, places a clear cigar in the mouth, and automatically receives .45 uploaded calamities, and enters the remote home. Bang, bang, bang. Purvis only appears from home, who kidnaps and wounds her. Shoot all for a long time. <br /> <br /> If you are fascinated with stories like Little Red Riding Hood, this should be a great appeals. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's very exciting it's mindless. Pretty Boy Floyd's disappearance is evident. Multiple citizen code violation. The shooter has Tommy pistols and guns. Blood completely <br /> <br /> As bad as history. Little do they remember Melvin Purvis as the FBI hero, to a certain extent, I think, for his name. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember that J. Edgar Hoover had drawn Melvin Purvis, although he was looking for a public enemy. <br /> <br /> Image was written and directed by John Milius. He is a guy who wrote in his contract, if he shot and killed animals in one of his productions, he should be the designated shooter. Milius is a gunsmith, a horrible gun, by Teddy Roosevelt Rough Riders in the American War of Henry V, who cried Henry V's quotation - "Saint Crispin's Day" and all that. <br /> <br /> Exciting, well, and complete garbage. "I know I will never be able to survive, and I did not even try hard". That is, kill all and let God ordain. <br /> <br /> You love it.
