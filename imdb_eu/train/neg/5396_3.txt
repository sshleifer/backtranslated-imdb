I have not read comments about the films that you can search for by Shakespeare's conversation. That is true, unfortunately, all the giant conversation, this wonderful theater has cut off and replaced the songs. I read this play, and I was just now lucky to watch it, I'm still one of my favorite Shakespeare comedies, but it seems that this film is all I like. Although the Princess definitely did what she wanted to do, she was not dressed in queen, and all the girls lost the wisdom of their characters, as well as the absurd cut-offs that did not touch the female characters. But the comments were out of context - listening to the princess a bit disturbing; "The girls are wise, therefore, the head of our lovers!", When it was not folly. The news of the film also stopped unexpectedly and removed many great scenes, because they displayed the following scene, and they were in modern form. In short, a great theater cut by unusual concepts and nonsense. Kenneth, what you usually love what you do. What did you think?
