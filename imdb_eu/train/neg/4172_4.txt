It's really not so terrific for a movie (especially for live TV distribution), it will be hard to stress a part of "Bloodsuckers", which is really original or refreshing. A vampire split in space is not a new formula and, in addition, in this specific setting, after so many movies on these monsters, it seems that nobody believes that horror is horrible, because it is impossible to pursue a horrible movie. "Bloodsuckers" goes a step further and imitates all the images of individual and intergalactic warfare. Drawings and characters directly steal John Carpenter's "Mars" and James Cameron's "Aliens", spotting futuristic vampire hunters in space and eliminating a mute named after iconic horror icons. , Like Voorhees and Leatherfaces. Good boys are pathetic stereotypes, they are constantly dealing with issues that are common and constantly dealt with. Damian's captain is different because he must prove his leadership now, after being responsible for the death of Captain Churchill (and much more lovingly). Other annoying characters create a typical cowboy style and a happy male pilot, a hard-fought female warrior with more men than any male man (Asian origin, "Latin-American girl") and most of the army. A Secret Weapon: A Blade Girl! Quintana is the most beautiful and deadly vampire he chose for human beings. When the clear years are gone, he can find his enemies and he can make sexy nasty things in someone's wet dream. In the end they all learn to work as a team when they are forced to face the last vampire-meanie: Michael Ironside (still another downward role). "Bloodsuckers" is a completely stupid movie, but it also has no-kill children, conversation children and OTT makeup. The frustrated warriors get the captain a fifth time and they are boring, they're boring. This movie is a non-slow series of topical creations and creative ideas, but at least it's a clock.
