Any movie that's just as hilarious as "Bagman" would automatically attract any attention to the lovers of any movie, but the plot is much more than expected after watching the DVD cover. Bagman is not a good movie. They have been filmed in a home camcorder (and probably have been). The play is horrible. Troll 2 has not heard and seen a wooden performance. There are plenty of scenes with nudity and sex, but they quickly jumped faster. The characters are morons and have been completely overlooked. When viewing the first scene, the unforeseen ending can be easily predicted. Due to the crunchy nature of the film, nothing frightening about the frightening productive value of the production (a realistic attempt at realistic gore, the clear station of the car, etc.). Recommended only for bad filmmakers.
