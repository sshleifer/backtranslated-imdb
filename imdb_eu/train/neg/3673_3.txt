William Hurt Diving Scientists ??? US agents research abroad? The sick man is hanging out and falls after falling 20 meters and he runs away and the Sniper is missing and he does not die (only injured), but the second "killing" shot is dead? Loss of time Comparison with other reviewers was ridiculous. Oh, and at the end of the movie, except for the "evil" to put gloves on, Hurt will decide to kill him by giving him "virus intervention." What BTW ... Did the IMDb require 10 lines of text? I'm inside. Is not it that the comments content has a number of lines x?
