The first movie is pretty good. This is very bad. <br /> <br /> Kriminally Insane collects a lot of footage (including initial credits and end title). The new footage footage is really well done. Although the scene is not light, sometimes the sound is almost impossible, although there is also a video error like a reminder of the image. <br /> <br /> Then repeat the second story. Ethel kills anyone who shares his life, because of the reasons why he or she wants to be fed. <br /> <br /> At least the first add-on DVD is just the first. He also enters the film's director, Satan's Black Wedding. The bad thing is not even Death movies into hell.
