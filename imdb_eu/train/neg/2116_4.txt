Poverty Row 1930s horror images and 40s break. God knows that I am not in the low-budget films, but those that were produced at that time have a rather uneasy look at them - and, in the end, they are not very good. "The Corpse Vanishes" is a smaller recipe as the "Invisible Ghost" and "The Ape Man" bottom, but it's not classical. Bela Lugosi, in his "Dracula", has long been a mad doctor; Elizabeth Russell is his wife unbearable. They sleep in coffins, as Lugosi describes as a fierce young reporter (Luana Walters), much more comfortable than a coffin bed. Ho hum Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal are also fans of fascinating films of the 30s and 40s.
