Herbie, a Volkswagen who thinks like a man, is back, now Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman who becomes a NASCAR champion. On his way, the only thing is that Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon) is the current champion, and that will stop him all. <br /> <br /> Original love was not so good. As a child, I do not like to remember much. I hoped for a march I mean it's a pretty good cast and the trailer seems like a fun movie. Unfortunately, Herbie is not better than before. The film is a weak challenge for people over 12 years of age. He will probably entertain children, but that's all. <br /> <br /> It's a children's movie and I think it's all more interesting. . She laughed at the end and began to get bored at the end. Most actors seemed dead too. Lindsay Lohan was as good as Maggie Peyton. He performs best performances regularly in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon was the best. He was a very bad man, although he did not do much work. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really there, and they do not do anything special. <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson directs and works well. He tries to maintain an interesting movie, but works with a weak screenwriter. Written by Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant, and would you be surprised to be in charge of Taxi and Pacifier? These two produce lightweight films, but they do not make the stories interesting or enjoyable. It's not entirely his fault, but fortunately they will try the next time. In the end, the Herbie family is a safe and predictable film that deserves to be a child. Others jump better. 4/10 rating
