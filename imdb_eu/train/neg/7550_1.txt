Ok, so I'm an original fan of Wicker Man and I do not like British film-makers from the Americas. So why did I put it so much as one of the worst movie experiments? I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage and maybe I had a moment of madness? The movie was awesome! Initially, the crash / fire was not important to the movie and the police came to know where he went, so that the two girls who visit the peninsula will not happen. The whole thing should be investigated. The history of the wicker man was not analyzed, and establishing in America was not really a pagan theme. This film was slow and had no twists or suspensions. The last time I had to say was the best, when Nicolas Cage makes it soaring! Now, in the mean time, I have to desperate to see the original again to see my soul disappointed. I really can not stress that this film is disappointed, please do not see it: <br /> <br /> A) Do not like the restructured B of British American films B) You are the original fan C) Hate Nicolas Cage
