A good copy is wasted at the same time as Melara and comedy are more astonishing than the comedy. Peter Ustinov tries hard to give something livelier here, but that's why he's missing out on all the good rhythms he's invisible. Although the comments that were mentioned here are great, this movie is awesome. Misguided Edit poorly. They acted badly. Bad writing You need to be seated in one hundred movies to find out what's wrong. <br /> <br /> Shameless and compassionate soil Ustinov enters American insurance companies to steal his computer and millions of kilos. . How does that go beyond lameness and credibility (his computer skills seem to read out loudspeakers on the daytime, and hoodwinks computer science Robert Morley went to South America and steals his personality). <br /> <br /> The secondary line, Ustinov highlights the lonely solitary Maggie Smith, whose secretary becomes casually, after obtaining an apartment in his building. She shares the scene with Bob Newhart's sexual details, she's no longer in it, Ustinov will gradually pull her money and tries to keep a step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. Then, Smith married and went to Brazil and has become the final end of almost all British comics (pedestrians, called Wanda?) <br /> <br /> The amazing surprise ending is far more brutal than before. Finally, I was thinking that it was really necessary for me to get my rocker out. Cesar Romero's camera did not help. One of the most popular and famous "comedies" I have never seen and, undoubtedly, the worst. Do not waste your time. If you love, you need to watch the best movies.
