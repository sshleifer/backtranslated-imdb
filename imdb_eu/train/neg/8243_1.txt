The summary words are shortened :) Five little girls are lost trying to get home. In it, when they stop at the store to get directions, they encounter a parked car, on which they make a rose. When entering into trouble, suddenly a light is seen behind (ooooh). <br /> <br /> Thereafter everything is terrifying when they try to escape from these people who have been crying and have lost violence. in the light of a light;), shouting and shouting is over the film (very annoying) of the movie, shooting a camera that looks "real" or "moving", is just embarrassing and useless. There is no better way to compare "Blair witch style". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , but a part of the painful reflection part.
