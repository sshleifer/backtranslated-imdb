This is almost like two films: literate and passionate, the other stupid and dangerous. It's hard now that all the problems are not written with writing, but as the majority of B movies have been written and produced quickly, this is not very common. It really is shame because it could be a very good movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, good. The film is an original and has codified World War II. That's pretty dazzling and I like the step-by-step lead man (Lee Bowman) as a master code. In fact, the first two-thirds of the film was very good. But in terms of evil, the movie has been too long and has lost about 50 minutes of steam. In addition, Jean Rogers should be the worst written role as a "kooky girlfriend" in film history. Because of the intelligent moves by Bowman, Rogers was approaching the stupid "comedy relief" as a mistake. If his role was intelligently written, the overall movie would be improved! Instead of watching it, it's really hard to see how we've won the Second World War !!
