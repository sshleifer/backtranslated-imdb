This is the video that does not mean that this film is wasting time and money. A version of "Heaven Can Wait" (at least worth watching) is a bad excuse for a romantic comedy. Another vehicle is Rocken giving a little bit of time in a short film, due to the weak comedy that does not play on the big screen. Above all, his jokes are generally from the body of an alleged human being, fat, rich and dead, but Rock itself. While black and white is insulting, chemistry is wrong. The movie is not funny, it's a poor performance. Rent "Heaven Can Wait" and live rock video and in front of the game.
