You have to be kidding !!!! Actor Parker Posey is not included in the actor's "mint club" play. Indeed, unless it's a satire in David Mamet's cheekshells, a fake and confusing interview alternating with a quick and monotonous gun machine (I think Ben Stein) is in a breeze or in a dry and dry comedy; To get the Rotten Tomato Prize for this film --- or even worse, it must be running. <br /> <br /> If Posey is not rigid and uncomfortable enough, we're harder and even more uncomfortable. Jeff Goldblum. In this movie there is more wood than a wood mill. <br /> <br /> There are many other roles in addition to the existing questionnaires, all those who have been forgotten by the actors, the American Model First Model, the look or sound of the bandits. A word like "Pardo" or "Beans", we're so pleased with Pardo's attention to what we like about that movie, we're looking at his accent if he's in Canada or not. !! I think I laughed in places where I was laughing, and I took seriously the episodes that were humorous. Although the music band can be a caricature of Alarik Jans's music for Mamet's "The House of Games" movie. If it is rumored, the movie is almost droll; If it were taken seriously, it's just a self-conscious one.
