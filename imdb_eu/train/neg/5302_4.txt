As a movie, Dewaana goes through ordinary clich√©s. Men and women fall in love and marry, their husband kills a family friend who wants a family income and marries another and a surprise surprise comes up again. The movie is Yash Chopra Chandni and many others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan give good performances. Amrish Puri crosses as a nasty move and is just the standard of Bollywood's criminals. Nadeem Shravan is a great music, all the songs were excellent. My favorite Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna motions are a regular movie.
