I was looking forward to the progress of this movie. In short, it is one of the oldest and most complex stories of humanity, and it was one of the first stories I read as a child (even before Tolkien). I must say that it was a big disadvantage. They crumpled on the crust and turned it into a long TV series. The items that were loyal to the plot were randomly thrown out, as audiences often laughed at the stupid script that fought a battalion battle. The complex nature of Achilles was a huge disappointment (almost a combination of Matrix's similar powers, strange combinations and a unique combination of original poem men) "puts Fabio on the beach" according to Pitt's source. It could become a more complex and original warrior ever produced in Hollywood with a good script and more effort. The actors were really decent, trying to make the most of a hilarious script. It was really a loss of talent (he stole Peter O'Toole's show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare with LOTR or Gladiator and do not even hold a candle. Many ladies are reluctant to hang on, but there is not enough battle scenes about a long battle and a siege. I would not recommend that you view this story as if it had been paid by someone with dirt (at least that part was right).
