The upper classes of SÃ£o Paulo, Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel have joined the university and on the eve of the inaugural class, they go to the feast and pharmacy. The next day, after classes, on the night before, Cristiano arrives to his house and three friends rape women. The girl dies, she is terrified and decides to eliminate her body, but her mother's mother has arrived, Gabriel is surprised and she rolls the stairs, breaking her neck. The trio decides to shoot and record corpses in the dump, but there are other tragedies throughout the night. <br /> <br /> The controversial and disgraceful "Cama de Gato" bed is overwhelmingly calcium-rich in alienation. and definitely the movie I have seen for many years is the worst in Brazil. The storyline of the cover, tragic and dark, really, a humorous black humor comedy. The script is not fun, stupid lines and conversations, and a boring, manipulative and stupid image, interviews with teenage morons at the beginning and end. The play is awful, apparently with a lot of improvisation, but it's not a talent, and I was disappointed in the trash in front of the hopeful Caio Blat. Camera, framing, cinematography and editing are low quality and amateur. The sound is horrible and it is often impossible to understand what the actors and actors are talking about (probably, it's an excessive advantage, this movie is very much like it). Gang bang is very realistic and is used to promote poor footage in the marketing of sexual exploitation. My vote (scary) is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cata de Gato" ("Cat's bed")
