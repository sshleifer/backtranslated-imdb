Wow, this was a very bad movie ... This movie, read in other comments, has no plot, has no development of characters, a script, but it is not difficult to make a real final result. <br /> </ p> <p> The editing of this movie does not really exist, it tends to move scene and scene, to help determine what's going on or what is happening to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Anything else is just a low-budget zombie movie, it's not considered, bad performance, bad conversation, everything. <br /> <br /> This is one of the only gore factors that store 1 or 2 on this movie. In my opinion, I think I should be in the place where they had to spend money trying to justify this. <br /> <br /> Find (and me like me) you can find all the zombies you have not found and seen, unless you miss them. in this.
