Anyone who does not know Sanfermin. Forrester's book should be interesting. It is colorful, it works well and shows a great adventure, but the original stories are awful for those who know it. I barely sat down. <br /> <br /> For some reason screen writers are forced to rewrite the stories they're working on. Of course, the spoken word is different and there are some episodes that are difficult to shoot. But why write writers instead of adapting the story to the screen? In this case, the writers themselves did it. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: There was no revelation about glory. The officers were taken to the ship when the insanity of the semi-insane captain was completely attacked, when he fell through a climbing-not for the reasons involved, but he never gave up. There was no martial in court. The queries were held in a fortunate atmosphere. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of Hornblower saga, nor Col. Ortega's wife too. Hornblower, too, never put on board or on the shore. Forrester's story is full of manipulation. <br /> <br /> In a purely technical setting, I think that the back-up of the device is repeatedly distorted by the continuity of the story. <br /> <br /> Why, why on screen should writers confuse a good story?
