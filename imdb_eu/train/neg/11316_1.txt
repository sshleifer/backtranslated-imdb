The knight was just the beginning of a series, the rider could say. On the plot (I really would not call it, there was no plot) it was logical and there were many flaws, such as [warning, plot summary]: <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, someone said there was only a couple of these cyborgs bad), but after the incident, he learned that he had left many more. And it was said that cyborgs were difficult to kill, but after one month the workout could kill only one blow. <br /> <br /> The film was just an oppression. I was not surprised to find out that the main star was a boxer of the shooter. <br /> <br /> There was a positive thing in the whole movie: it really laughed at him. and talk about it with my friends. I recommend looking inside.
