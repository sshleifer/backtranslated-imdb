I saw Dick Tracy and I thought it was horrible. The backdrop of the cities was terrific. Similarly, the character of the people seemed strange. Warren Beatty did not work like Trick Tracy, but it was definitely one of the best performances. Madonna is just about to sing. Glenne Headly did a good job on this movie. I gave this movie a 2/10 one for Al Pacino's amazing performance. He did not notice much in his career, but he still did a good job.
