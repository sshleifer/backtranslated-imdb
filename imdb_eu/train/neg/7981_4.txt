Rookie suffers so much. There are randomized musical films featured in the film, a long and long script and a slapstick grid that's enough to blush Jerry Lewis. Noonan and Leavitt do not know when to quit. It takes a long time before the story reaches the main plot and the characters are sinking. Then, Japanese sailors play their current caricature with a racist. It's a pity that the most fun part of the movie is played by Japanese stupid and stereotyped Noonan and Leavitt. But it becomes aggravated after changing between two character sets. Then he ends up violently. In a towel, Julie Newmar's bare can not be saved. <br /> <br /> There is very little charm in the film, which is more than half an hour long. The story looks for fun and failing situations. Paste with Martin and Lewis. At least Deano had a charm and Jerry had an animated face.
