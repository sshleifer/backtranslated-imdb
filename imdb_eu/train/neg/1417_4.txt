On vacation on the beach, Michael McGreevey and Billy Mumy (Arthur and Petey Loomis) find their seer's darkest. The boys beat the "Sammy" cream and spend the summer with the sandy sea lion. The time to go home, the boys begin to suffer from anxiety separation. Does young McGreevey decide he can not "take Sammy" to "Disneyland"? er, "Gatesville" - but nevertheless he packs young Mumy. At home, adults try to hide the "Out Way Out Seal" and, of course, ?? hijacks follow! <br /> <br /> **** Sammy - Waiting Seal, 1 pt.
