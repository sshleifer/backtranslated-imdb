Only hard-hitting Judy Garland. There are two really good two (2) numbers: it cleans a number with an older lady cleaning (you have seen the images and got a good number at the end). There are two scenes with fun lines. But, basically, the script is so bad and the movie is so dated that it is not very difficult to be afraid of being horrible. But it's worth 2.50 to rent the movie. Get ready!
