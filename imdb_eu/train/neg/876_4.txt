Until last 20 minutes, Jackie Chan's movie was the worst (that is, except I do not know the work I did not see in 1978). The last fight has changed all this sequence: it is long and good and good - indeed, one of the highlights of Chan's career. However, five-year-old children have to sit through many "comedians" fun (oh, look, someone drew a tomato on their boy's face) and an endless "football" scene. Duplication must be mentioned ("How do I deactivate the line that includes? It's not a tap"), see what is mentioned. "Dragon Lord," is worth the win only, but the rest of the film is only for Jackie collectors, and has only seen at least 15 films. (**)
