KAT O'NINE KAXAK (Il Gatto a Nove Code) <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 2.35: 1 (Cromoscope) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> < br /> (printouts of 35 mm and 70 mm) <br /> <br /> A regular blind journalist (Karl Malden) experts will hear an external link in a genetic research laboratory and later with a teammate ( James Franciscus) works with a teammate. The murder of the laboratory, based on a psychopathic murderer whose mind is murdered. <br /> <br /> Production came into the world with unexpected success after the unexpected success of the world THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (1969), Dario. Argento thought THE CAT O'NINE TAILS as a giant thriller, his first myth, together with the famous Hollywood actor Karl Malden, PATTON (1969) and his top star, Franciscus (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Unfortunately, the films obtained were nine times more susceptible to "birds" - they are depressing, straightforward and elegant photos, but they are also for the general consumer. <br /> <br /> Malden and Franciscus play a role very original, and the director of Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses a wide-ranging Cromoscope frame to transmit the world of Argento's dark heart to the world of technology. Francisca's romantic interest in Franciscus Spaak (LIBERTINA) is more than an unnecessary padding. The most striking thing should be a wonderful encounter with a fearless horror killer in a crowded train station (with Franco Fraticelli's cult war movie) and Malden and Franciscus's nightlife. The killer machine is strange. But despite the splendor's brilliance, the movies move from one scene to another, without being cooked slowly, since they never boil. It is not surprising that "Cat" emulated the success of the "Bird" emulation in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
