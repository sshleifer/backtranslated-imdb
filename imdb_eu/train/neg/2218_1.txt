I acknowledge that my review comes from the perspective of 2006, after 30 years of making this film, and at the time of conception, it was perhaps a great horror / thriller. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Michael commits himself to a head organization and fled 15 years later and returns to his village to kill him again. From now on, it is clear that the film will continue to have a very basic prediction. . The start of each scene is easily predicted while Michael, the murderer, is identical to the whole movie throughout the movie, which will tell the audience about the events to follow. <br /> Because of the horror / thriller's sake, there are no signs of blood / film in today's movies, although I am not currently the age and age. Find a medium that could be medium. <br /> <br /> The movie is half an hour until a scene is not unexpectedly. It's time to make a horror / thriller movie, so today's fan is missing. <br /> <br /> The positive film is a dark, dark-haired camera that is permanent and scary. atmosphere The second positive would be Michael's physician's character, a character that tells the story's probability. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that this star is in Jamie-Lee Curtis. The first phase of his early childhood of artistic career, thus, is not a central victim of a horrifying act. <br /> <br /> It is difficult for me to appreciate this film as it was in its era, but in fact it is a short film of horror / thriller in the 80s and, to a lesser extent, in the 90s. <br /> <br /> I recommend finding a classic of the 80s. Cheers!
