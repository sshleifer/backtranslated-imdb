Sorry, I will give you the plot line and the end of the holiday so I can avoid the fiasco. His father dies and his mother asks a letter to Santa's family to return Christmas ... and Santa does it. He is a pheasant, he was dead and happy that he was totally ignorant. Grandmother ends up losing his five-year-old best friend as a parent. Now, my son believes that everything he needs to do to bring back his friends is to ask Santa! Do not underestimate the will of a young heart. No conviction for any conviction that he was just a movie and his dog will NOT return to Christmas. He has broken his heart to find out that joy will need to face the loss of Christmas night again. <br /> <br /> He has loved you on behalf of all beloved believers recently. It is quite difficult to get lost for the child, but there are also wishes, we would not want to imagine.
