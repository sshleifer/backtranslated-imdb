I watched this movie at the AFI Dallas Festival. Most of the public, including my wife, enjoyed this dramatic comedy, but I did not. Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Art School Confidential). The director is Matt Bissonnette, married to Molly Park. All three actors work on this film for 3 people, two of them with marriage and the third infidelity. Everything is done at the lake and it looks wonderful. The film wants to be treated as a comedy for the first time and then a drama, and I thought it was necessary to do it the opposite.
