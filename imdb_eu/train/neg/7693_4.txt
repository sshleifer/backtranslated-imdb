Is not it something that's happening in this movie? I do not think so. It's basically a topical movie after the cliché, and it's really never a surprise. The movie is very predictable and, therefore, there is no movie tension. So thriller is not enough and unexpected, but also a drama. This is because the story of the movie is very difficult. I mean, this will never happen in real life, just like this happens. So the movie has a real suspense and credibility problem. <br /> <br /> But they are topicals that killed the movie. Sometimes the thing was stunned. Everything is so formulary in this film. The predator is portraying a fresh heart, it is almost a psychopath, like a sexually frustrated boy and a victim, a naïve young woman, which does not happen. Everything that happened in the film was so obvious and it seemed a bit of a reason. Such as the "predator" sequence of 'victims' repairing broken cars. It must be one of the oldest books in the book. After trying that point I learned how to try the movie. I tried to really grow up in the eyes of others as the teacher and student grew up around each other. So it was very obvious and cheap that I wanted to see almost the movie from that moment on. This movie is filled with some moments. <br /> <br /> The title suggests that the movie is cheap, but, in fact, it's sappy for the TV movie. This means that everything is happening slowly and the film goes through the development of character and unnecessary subplots to make the movie more dramatic. in this movie Sometimes, some clichés and events make it almost realistic. Hollywood's career is very encouraging after "Showgirls" appeared on Paul Verhoeven. Unfortunately, they will only appear in such movies and TV shows. He is losing his talent and he is surely worth it. All other characters fail. Corey Sevier is an "intangible" rich boy and the portrait of the main character is even worse. It looks like a sexually frustrated, real predator of the movie. In every sequence she tries to be sex with her wife. She wakes up, wants sex. Before he sleeps, he wants sex. He's got home, he wants sex. The thing can be realistic, but I do not know, it's not like that movie and a whole story. <br /> <br /> A movie full of clowns and I can not believe anyone can watch the movie for a reason. It is predictable and therefore there are no suspensions and credibility. It's not a horrible film and sometimes it's a clock, but the weak and topical elements of the movie are also far from being highly recommended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
