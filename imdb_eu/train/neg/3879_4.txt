Rebar is the first space mission in the world of Saturn, an astronaut, but, of course, the horror movie becomes ugly and returns to the land that survived. It slowly melts and loses itself, if it does not consume the usual human flesh, the only nurse in the hospital and the neighboring village escapes to prevent the victims. /> I liked the premise, and the monsters and rigid effects are really good, but the scene of the space is sewn together with NASA's foil and the hospital looks like a stroller like a stroller. Very poor writing, small character development, and plays that are generally poor, this is not a climb upstairs, slasher being a bit unhealthy, as well as the novelty of being a living candle, and has more or less its noisy effects. interest <br /> <br /> From 10 to 4, the happiest monster movie lovers strictly.
