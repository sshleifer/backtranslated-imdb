After watching this five minutes, I started to sign up for the IMDb, to warn everyone about this movie ... gender: afraid? Lightweight suspense and moments I thought that "something would happen soon" was not ... when the movie was over, I was ashamed of the writer / director I never had the greatest fancier. This kind of patrick guy does not know how to film and a horror movie after seeing the bad excuse, I have not been the greatest fan when I do not want to see another of his works .. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am not included in the summary of the soil make the same mistake <br /> <br /> This movie was given to 2 by the actors ... they were not bad and they did not blame for that. bad direction ...
