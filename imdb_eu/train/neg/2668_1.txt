Do not rent this movie. He has nothing to do with escaping from the queue of death, despite the title (English). I can not think of a good thing about the movie. Bad performance, bad editing, poor management ... the "plot", and the sound / music was so angry, it's amazing that this film did not come with a warning tag. The best possible way to enjoy yourself and enjoy yourself through this movie is the quality of your liking. They're no longer making bad movies.
