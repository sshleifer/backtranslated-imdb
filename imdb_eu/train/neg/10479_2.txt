This movie was very disappointed for my reasons. In the first half hour, it's really decent. Even if you would not find the performance in the rap video, its fun and the value of production does not look like a bad thing. In fact, I almost thought that it was just as good as Perico Ripiao (another recent Dominican movie) that I expected it was much better. The drawing of the film is not only a scam for her husband, but also for the women to see and treat the Dominican society in general, that is, the Dominican Republic is a good premise. Unfortunately, I do not think the makers of this film think they care about how a good movie is treated to your subject, and cut off the calf chops that they had before. The role of men and women in the film has been reversed for about 30 minutes as a result of the witchcraft that the main character may face due to fraudulent habits. This transition is not just a vanguard, space age, but the CGI effect can only be invented by the 70s, but the entire plot escapes. The rest of the movie is just a difficult situation, and one of the most intelligent. Finally, (Now, I have to warn SPOILER ALERT **), everything is a dream. Oh, who did not see that? Oh, I almost forgot the man of the ridiculous thing in the movie. Well, I'm starting to think about it for an hour later. "Hmmmm something just seems correct about the soundtrack but what could it be?" And then he hit me THE VIDEO OF PREVIOUSNESS FOR PRESENTING THE MUSIC FILM CITIZEN COMMITTEE. 95. <br /> <br /> We call a movie we have provided so far. art?!?! Perhaps with a French comedy called Amelie, or Thai Ong-Bak, Akira Japanese was a comedy, the Layer Cake was a thriller of England's crime thriller, or a trip to Waking Life's social journey. states <br /> <br /> I'd give it 1, but I've seen a lot worse off the DR, looking for Los Jodedores and I know what I'm doing.
