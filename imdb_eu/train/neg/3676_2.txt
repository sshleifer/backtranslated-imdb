Susan Swift is an attractive young lady, a flower born in the 1980s (like a young Susan Dey), but she does not have enough voices to find a sharp rumbling lead and joke; However, it is quite delicious and has bright eyes and pretty smiles. As it was called "The Coming" (as it was released in theaters), Swift Salem could be a reincarnation of a witch. The move is a small budget and I've borrowed it with other images that I have spent about 15 minutes. Starts up powerful and has an appealing camp. Obviously, there are serious films related to the Salem witch rehearsals, worth more than this; However, going to junk movies is not terrible. The locals in Boston have a detailed increase, and the help cast is hammy. * 1/2 ****
