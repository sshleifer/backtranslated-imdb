You have to offer Steven Seagal: regardless of its fault, it has a good taste for women. If you select a Seagal movie, surely there will be one or more beautiful women. And they usually do not work as an empty eye candy; They enter into action and fight, shoot guns, kill knives, etc. "Fury of Fury" offers a pair of Ciera Payton (a very sexy face, with lips that are superb with Angelina Jolie) and Katie Jones. Finds time in cats and a few lesbians! And it seems that I'm spending too much time talking about them, it's the rest of the movie, though it is appropriate, because it's very annoying, it's hard to talk a lot more. Ironically, the weakest part is probably that Seagal himself does not care that he looks like he tries to take care of it. In addition to being a military type activist, there is little fighting and does not include its role (a surfer pilot, "the best in the world," of course), which would almost appear.
