I'm kind of a sort of 2-time horror section when I'm selecting a movie, so I got it from five eyes, I was tired of this movie and I thought the story was not there and I did not like it. My skin has been creeping out that people like to watch movies that encourage violence, low budget and very rough! I think I could do it better. I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and the actress was banned from watching the trash and the camera was awful and the sound was not crashing. I think it was a little bit as small as projecting the project and it does not take a little bit of work.
