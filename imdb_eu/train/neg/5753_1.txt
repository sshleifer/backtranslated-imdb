... With regard to a movie that is trying to market it as a horror, there was a considerable lack of blood. <br /> <br /> There was also a lack of direction, play, editing and training. script writing. <br /> <br /> Jeremy London wrote one of the greatest shows I've ever seen: madness of "madness" of his madness was self-conscious and awkward. Oh, look at him! Oh, look at him, drink strong spirits! Check him lift his forehead, and bend his head at an angle jaunty! Check her hair dark and clean it! Oh, he heard his husky, crisp voice! Artist / writer / genius must be tortured! Oh well, the poet comes in shirt - Byron believes he is another boy. (Or Poe). Oh, for love ... someone handed it over to the "How to Act Good" handbook or a cardboard box, which sold a small plastic toy without interruption. bargain box cereal brand Okay, it was a stupid line - but only in London's performance, my brain closed a lot of hope. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is pretty, and she rose very pink, but she's still become a shoe player. This film - just like he delivered his lines - his work was very wood-like, he set his lines as sharp - who knows, maybe reacted, and attempting to neutralize Jeremy London's excessive mistakes, but if that happens, it takes too long. <br /> <br /> Arie Verveen Poe is noteworthy. While the role of his character is mixed, he bestows the performance of the piece. It just has a straightforward look, but it's more than that, it's a bit deeper, I think that all other characters live with two-dimensional quality. Yes, maybe I like Poe, and so I could guess while it was on my screen, and yet there was a lack of interest in it. <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are a blurring blur: they are all ordinary cartoons: a little shocking and blond; local police knocked out; a protective man, perhaps, with a paternal interest in our presence; ancient witchcraft scheme, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> As a «marked difference» of the blood of a horror movie, it is not one of the things we have mentioned (and mentions the fact that London is so rude) following Poe's writings. on the page. Another reviewer said that the potential was here: murder, incest, really amazing things, but they go away from the problems and cut off against violence (raising a lightweight rage that rises in the air - Black Cut! Right in fear of Noirish's horror, But it is expected, and when that happens, that's the case - it's a lovely convention, especially fake lightning and Siouxie eye makeup ... but it's just to find the 'Scribbling' wicked, or as the editor has been infected at the last minute and cut off It's like that.) That's it, a psychological thriller was very compact: palingenesis / delusion / madness, fearful or funny) slasher movie: either it wants to be either (something new and exciting!), but it does not work differently. The only horror element in the whole movie is epic. <br /> <br /> I think the editor (if there is one) drank that he should cut that thing - there are brave scenes; The scenes that appeared (however, it could be scripts). Also, I think the director and the CEO-Hitchcock or Browning were very rare and flat-frames for homage, but I had the final look (again, in black, but wanted to be something else). <br /> <br /> It may be a matter of great fun (as the previous reviewers mentioned - "How did this OMG come from!!") If I had littered myself, I unfortunately placed it on my couch so that I could lower myself down to the stupid one, This is a very poor movie, and I'm afraid I can not recommend it to people, or laugh. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste time or money for that - you'll find a horror thriller or a copy of the fantastic Poe stories. You'll be much happier and terrifying at night than to get that garbage.
