One can admire seeing it at night, it is a green dog in the world. A young couple are playing honeymoon, bats are attacked and their husband begins to attack several people in pajamas. And where are they exactly? They are in the desert, then they are skiing, then it seems they have mountains. The city is run by a serra, and this is a car dealer and his own personal sales team against the doctor. The ski hospital has a huge mustache and the wife is like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There is no dramatic tension, and the end will leave you angry. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston made this effect. I think you need to start somewhere.
