The role of the characters in the movie is a problem. Man to Man captures two pigments and shows a British anthropologist to Scotland, and then they are not animals or sub-human beings, but they are the same. The problem is that the role of pigments in the film is: the two animals hostage, treated as animals, and still remain within the film's stereotypical role ... The hero is to end the given baht (British anthropologist). because the film relates to pigments ... two kidnappers feel their opinion, how they feel their suffering ... it's not a skin film, with a racist view, on the one hand. ... never got the "whites" away from the perspective
