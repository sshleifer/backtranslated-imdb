Without being guilty of the actress (they all put on good performances), the story was not well executed. It starts with a big zombie movie: an old guy sends them to the car of a young aboriginal on the road. But then we need to minute minutes with the development of 40 minutes with new character groups ... and we do not know why it takes up to 40 minutes. They become acquainted with the body of the girl and it becomes the story from there. <br /> <br /> As long as the story is received, it does not go in any way. After 2 hours, I asked myself: is there any such point, or is it how to find the discovery of the characters to see the stupidity of the stupidity of racism? The story was finally happy and felt unfinished. Although it works well, there is not enough footage to help recommend the spine.
