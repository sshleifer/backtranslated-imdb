Undoubtedly, the movie I've ever seen is the worst and I have great (and good) movies to eat. It could not (just) manage teenage humor, if the exhibition ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW has been very entertaining. Other films, like outside space like PLAN NINE, have been fun (apparently) trying to be serious. As for the play, it seems that the brain's dead adolescents rounded off, and they were asked for full production. Compared to them, Tom Cruise is like Alec Guinness. There was a decent interpretation: the old ghost like the old motorcycle.
