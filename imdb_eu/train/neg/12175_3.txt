Why short films review "Trancers II?" <br /> <br /> <br /> When you can review the movie, the movie is soooo lame. I can draw drawings and teammates who work with the LA in collaboration, I'll give you extra shirts with a T-shirt in Tim Thomerson's poor and long suffering. The stars' families will come to play cameo, probably because Full Moon could not afford "real" accessories. Lame effects, lame sets, and script are so confusing, they would need eons to release all the knots, that is, the classic must be Trancers! <br /> <br /> And still ... and yet ... rules. Please note that this is the same as the "Trantsers IV". It's true, I'm saying it. Why can an old boy be plunged into a black tossed zombie and then bounce back: "Do not worry ladies, they're bio-degradable"? Well, many things can be better, but it's still a good thing. <br /> <br /> My most significant reservation is Megan Ward. Helen Hunt's hateful character. Eyes candy are both young, and it would be more effective if they contrasted a bit more. Well, you can not have everything. At least this fascinating plot of "long-lasting watches" has been re-established, and Hap Ashby is the least convincing in film history, with more than one of the minimum certification athletes. David Ogden's "Creator" brochures. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have not seen this lately, but it seems to me that Martine Beswick escapes twice in the last battle. Sadly bad continuity! One of the highlights of this wonderful movie.
