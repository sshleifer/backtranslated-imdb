The fact that someone has really offered money in the bad script, I'm beyond. It must be the worst film, apart from the "Haunted Highway" I have ever seen. Actors and a bad story. There is no normal reaction to the events of this film, and even Halloween, people would usually have more reactions when their father was killed, and people with cut ribbons are not able to breathe. (In a room that can add at least 50 people) and a person dressed as Satan's dead man out of the house, an 8-year-old boy would also see the difference between a doll and a person. In fact, nobody can be naive or mute in the belief of Satan's and the present day of Jesus, just like this child. When I was 8 years old, I was sure there were more brains than I was. <br /> <br /> But, really stupid, others seem to fall aside from Satan's silence, as well as not asking. The whole movie is the question, is it really Satan, or some crazy people die when people feel like they're away? Well, human hands, arms, build and whatever. That's why I think there will be a movie too, otherwise they did a bad job. Then, when he was human, he was able to kill an old lady, a man and his wife, 5 police (!) (All weapons and training) and others. ... and, of course, everyone was waiting there, or what? <br /> <br /> The whole story to tell and tell the story completely saw the worst thing, and I would never recommend it. Anyone losing a life should spend an hour and 30 minutes to see it rough.
