Black and white cinema. Good photography Credible characters Just awful. <br /> <br /> I lost another perfect night and another watching a movie called "worthwhile" and "very good". Here's a good thing to do and the plot's background is good (with that it should be done), but it grows and slows down very slowly. Sex is completely grounded without much love, with great nudity. It could be more with the main characters. If you do not want to see something with your family in a movie, otherwise you will have trouble. This movie is long in less than one inch depth!
