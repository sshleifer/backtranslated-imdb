Without a doubt, I can say that Going Overboard is the worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination to Schecky Moskowitz, a cute comedian who works in a cruise line. That's the plot. <br /> <br /> That's it! In the film, nothing makes any sense, it's like a breakfast of a damn place, and it is not naked and naked in his gun, but even more frustrated, throwing shoes in both. Noriega General also seems, because there is no reason to understand it (humor was no doubt). Add Miss Australia, with the worst Australian Accent I've ever heard, I have never heard of the worst film I've ever had, since it's not the basic definition of a movie to go onboard. I recommend that you watch this movie because it will raise the column of all the bad movies you ever watched. After seeing the bad movie, "at least I did not know how bad Goa was."
