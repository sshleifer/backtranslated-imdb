Let's go, the truth. The Knights of Christ, as called by Ordo Templi, or the Knights Templar, does not exist as XII. Until the beginning of the century. The story is so painless that it is pathetic. Dolph Lundgren seemed bored. Also, if you want to have a real temple, why not yet use the Christ the Knights in Portugal. At least history should be considered. The free quality that I found in this movie was that the artifacts were true for medieval or Gothic fortifications. The performance was a bad thing, a horrible story, horrible action and props.
