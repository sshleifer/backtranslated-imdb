It's the worst film of the year. The plot is ridiculous, the poorly developed characters, and the stupid premise. It all starts when Michael Keaton, unlike anything from Batman, loses his great author, Anna, to a car accident, which is why he drives one of these VW convertible defects, though he is rich. Mine, Batman moves to a new apartment and takes a hobby: nothing is recorded and then seen. He learned from his pathetically stupid little guy who killed three great fellows who lived on television on television. Soon, people start to see the dead, EVP or the Electronic Voice Phenomenon allows the deceased to send people their messages to the recorders, video cameras, cell phones ("Anna cell calls? But?" ... DEAD! ... be ghosts There is no explanation. I would be better to start that completely separate. ") Why they can not write a piece of paper or write something. It's never been time to tap into creating some pictograms. However, at the end, Batman sees in the future He decides to help that woman who does not know and does not leave her home at the end of the day, since high black boys go out and go ("D! Mn! Travels through life and electronics, but I am ... in time Can I? I am well? (they say the agreement is wrong). "This lady is taken to the store and finds herself in the first ten-minute character of the film (it will look hard or not). One killer, three dark devils at the same time. To get rid of the lost Ark style and look like cartoons. Some detectives save and save their lady. After passing Batman's funeral, he has decided to send a message out of the tomb asking his son to apologize for his son, it would be stupid that his son will feel the best way to protect EVP. The baby smiles. Nothing happens, even if his father, of course, starts talking to Batman TV. The biggest point in the movie was the calling of someone's phone and the guy cried out: "It's Anna!"
