More recently, I saw Guinea Devil's experiment as the first film in our genre, and we must admit that it is a disappointment. <br /> <br /> This movie is always included in any list of bad films, and maybe even more. hype. Actually, I do not value it. <br /> <br /> When I see that I am convinced that the text of the opening is true ("I found this tape"), I was perhaps completely worried, thinking it was real. Although I did not take advantage of the authentic knowledge, I thought that I would not pretend it. <br /> <br /> They are just what they need to be the reactions to the girlfriend during the film. She needed to scream like a banshe like mine. It means that it is not true. I would not want to see it as if it were true, but if it were more credible in acting, the movies would be more worrying. <br /> <br /> And then there are famous scenes: it's not for me any effect. hand until scalpel. Hot oil, my skin and my intuition did not worry. I'm not saying "I'm hard" I do not have the ability to interrupt my credibility, as a result of the girl's action. <br /> <br /> The ladder shook me a bit, but his hands gave him a rubber look. And the last scene of this eye was once again tiny, but nothing more. I did not want to look, and I did not feel nauseous. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's thirty-one years old, or maybe I'm empty. Actually, I did not find this film very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Playing a loop as a modern art facility is something that you would see as an exercise to move away. , story, etc. And leaving the torture, it works in some levels. The movie as a disturbing piece has not worked with me at least. <br /> <br /> I saw Guinea Pork with my wife, who is "just a movie" bending and what he was asking about was what it was all about. I discussed the reason why I watch film making and my reasons are many, but that a film has an impact. He said he did not think the movies could be so convincing and that led me to challenge. I played the Irreversible fire extinguisher scene and it was really confused. <br /> <br /> I am not sure I have one point, both of which overwhelmed us by a horror scene. so far as the genre's films make it difficult for different films to date.
