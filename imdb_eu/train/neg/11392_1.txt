Years of remembrance of the television guide "Trouble With Tracy" about this show. CFTO-TV Toronto Saturday morning at 6:00 AM! I did a two-hour drive north of Toronto and we could not get CFTO, but you know what it is, what we can not always want <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, I know what I want I saw what I wanted and what I saw was "Tracy With Trouble". Has a beautiful girl been the protagonist? Was there naked? Did you suspect? Was it a comedy? It would be fine to promote the show. I knew at least I was missing. But not! Mystery bonkers led me, CTV member CKCO was built again in the movie transmitter in Wiarton, Ontario and started broadcasting "Tracy" with CFTO broadcasting CFTO .... Saturday mornings at 6 o'clock! I got up on a Saturday morning and I watched TV 5:59 and finally I saw what was "The Tracy With Tracy." Yes, "Tracy With Trouble" was the content of Canada that was harmless at 6 am in spot blocked, so no one would have ever seen how horrible it was. <br /> <br /> Talented actress Canadian Steve Weston died a few years ago. Afterwards, but many argued that "appearing" was the first time in this show. When I saw that cold Saturday morning I first saw it, I was disappointed in my bed, a bit of it was killed.
