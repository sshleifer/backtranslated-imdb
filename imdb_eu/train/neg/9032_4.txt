I have never understood Garbo's appeal. He always finds himself in his films, not all that brilliant, and the annoying voice that could tear the tuba section. He was also a very limited actor, silent actor like Gloria Swanson. In his latest movie, his performance is very average, and even more likely. He tries hard, but everything writes nothing, because it is worse than his performance. <br /> <br /> The interim romcom would never be credible and never be achieved (even if Melvyn Douglask managed to enter into stage sculptures, the only thing that's really fun here). <br /> <br /> It was useful, but the scripts failed almost every department, where all the actors were wasting themselves. Douglas and Garbuy had enough chemicals, but this is not in Ninotchka, that is, I was very unnoticed.
