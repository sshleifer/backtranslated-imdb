This star-studded British / Spanish co-production is an excellent look, what you can see. I have three versions, two VHSs, a DVD, and all of them are cut off, so badly, buildings seem to be in mutual conversations. Few films work poorly as scanning, as Robert Parrish's director was so much in love with so much screen screen that he used at the same time on the screen, aside from the middle. Another user comments, initially, that we see all the inhabitants of a church massacre; I do not have copies. There are some cuts that cut some rifles, a Mexican officer fired, Shaw and Landau, and that's it. We never know why Shaw was the priest (really), we never know what happens to Carlos (Savalas), but I suspect that the name of the household was called Kojak, its departure seems arbitrary. And there's a strange sequence of flashbacks where Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) is dancing in a babe hat and dancing a bad suit, which is a great BATTLE OF NEW NEWLELEANS movie in the 1960s, which Johnny Horton does not sing, but never heard. I do not have lyrics. Also, the location is superb, the huge old fortress restored in Escher style stairs, the beautiful landscapes of Robert Shaw, and the good performances of Stevens, Landau, Lettieri and Telly Savalas with Telly Savalas. I have not liked the movie, but I have not seen it. I am looking for a panoramic photo version and then I will take the decision.
