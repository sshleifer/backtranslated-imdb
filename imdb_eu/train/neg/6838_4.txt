Publication Synopsis: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria Tunnel, along with his wife, killed his partners. His twin sons, Chad and Alex, are separated. Twenty-five years later, Chad, the Los Angeles karate instructor, and smuggler Alex, Hong Kong, strives to revenge the murder of their parents and directly claim the tunnel. <br /> <br /> This is the second time. Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sheldon Lettich have worked together for "Lionheart." Van Damme's dual role ("Maximum Risk" and "Replicant") is another of three films. The story of revenge on the ground is very simplistic, since the performance of Van Damme's film is just like two very different people. a cigar that is rich and rich and crapy. Van Damme does not work anymore in both roles, although Alex is playing quite funny. It is curious that the brothers mislead each other, dressed in clothes and have different hairstyles. Bolo Yeung is a terrible workforce.
