As Russian-Russian scientist says in two-thirds of the video, "I came to science". The reason I saw most of this is a lot more: in an impartial scientist worthy of any kind of empirical research involving half-man and a half-shark. Or, as is said in the way of life, my girlfriend's brother was far away and the rest is history. It would be a distraction in the field of special effects to say that special effects are bad. That is, in 2005, it's not difficult to shoot a car car scene without backing the screen bluescreen. Yes, this is a charming and state of the art when Hitchcock filmed "The Birds", but in 2005 he was a small budget. Rescue the inexpensive Sci-Fi essay and make me tempt to try the credibility of the service. <br /> <br /> However, after a serious defamation of the general concept of this movie, I will tell you. Once again, as sad as that, you probably deserve your time. If it's just, Sci-Fi is a tour of the wrong course, worthy of education for new filmmakers, and undoubtedly deserves a refresher course for those who watched some movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The plot lines are remotely likely. <br /> <br /> This film also meets my contentions for a long-term bad film - the bad guys always wear sunglasses. <br /> <br /> This was not the case in 2005, I would have this cold war because this movie was like a metaphor and a giant metaphor. I mean, well, maybe Khan will also be introducing Chekhov's ear to the bridge of a klingon of prey birds. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting lines of the movie is the chicken without the BRA without the appearance of Charlton Heston, trying to lift the helicopter "waiting for Tom". The thing is that Tom's sunglasses wasted his banana clip attached to his Kalashnikov or AK-47 in secular terms. <br /> <br /> As a mad scientist says. cinema "is my purpose to develop a human species," it is enough that this film only contributes to human destruction. When the frivolous reference freudian given by a crazy scientist was preparing a character bound by a shark shark, it is a simple reminder, in the bad science fiction, that we all find something we can laugh at.
