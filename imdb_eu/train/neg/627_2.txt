O my dear sir! This movie ... it was horrible. I'm very fond of horror movies. Most of the time, horror films say, others are bad, I like it. The actor who played Scarecrow was amazing, I'll say so. That land was horrible. He had no sense! She had too much in the way of having an inborn (unfailing) scene of sex. I think the director wanted to be 'shocking' or other things, but it was horrible. They called a land to add a few pounds of dogs, the actors (besides the txorimalo) were awesome, and so I did not care what soon I forgot who it was. Finally, this film has got me sick. If you do not see this movie, please do it.
