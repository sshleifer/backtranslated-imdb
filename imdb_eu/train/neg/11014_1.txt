This is the worst film ever I've ever seen. This is saying a bit, considering some of the options I have made in the rental of films. <br /> <br /> I got this in netflix, that someone who has gone to school does not have a topless one. . The Topless scene lasted for about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was very fun by pushing the sticks under my right foot, because Roseanne was forced to hear the Big Spender song. <br /> <br /> The skits are "stupid and they are the worst kind of bathroom mood and locker room, and Kentucky movie is as terrifying as The Fried Fried (and poor), Big Jim Slade asks for wall and keep us "Vince offer" for stupidity (this is). <br /> <br /> If you are not a cameraman, do not trash this garbage pile.
