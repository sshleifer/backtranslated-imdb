It's not clear to see this film (so I'm investigating people presenting visitors to their case), but this presentation about Islam's non-Muslims and non-Muslims is a lack of objectivity, as well. it completely fails in human conditions. One thing the Koran says is that he teaches a lot for Muslims to interact with Muslims, but every realist understands that they are not all human beings who feel like Islam. agree and fulfill all the principles of faith and system. There is a reason to ask much more about the presenters, such as viewers should see the skepticism as a whole; Do not swallow, hook, line and sink, not thinking of yourself. <br /> <br /> An individual, such as Walid Shoebat, is currently investigating; It is said to be an ancient Muslim who committed acts of terrorism in Belen. There are many scholars in the world who do not believe in any of these expressions. I am not a Muslim. I have never read the Koran. I am not a Christian, nor a faith. But I am an intelligent and intelligent man. While the movie is quite disturbing, while some Muslims explain how they see their duty in Islam; I remind you that Islam is more than the fundamental fundamentalist opinions. Their basic and Christian evangelists are, therefore, variations of the intensity of beliefs and duties between Jews and Muslims. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you need to have a cutter. hand. A grain is not enough, you will need more. Please use yourself and think about yourself, investigate what is presented, and evaluate the state of the world and how it is reflected in Islam, which is more than 98 minutes of video. Among those who put together this film is a common thread of the political party, indicating a specific bias. Have your brain
