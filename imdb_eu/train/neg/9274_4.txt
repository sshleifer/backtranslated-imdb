This sequel is a complete version of the first film. An untargeted movie. Basically, they took the sceanrio of the first film and renewed it in Omen IV, except this time with an anthristian woman. It also ends in the first way! Music is busy and interferes, because it's a much easier copy, it's very predictable. It's not a horrible movie, it's not a big deal, movies are much worse, that's just not enough. The Omen remake of 2006 is much worse, this is even more useless, so I have it. If someone directs a gun and needs to select this watch or reampeon 2006, I should choose this one.
