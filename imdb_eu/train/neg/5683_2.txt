From the beginning of the film I felt like a movie from Jason on Wednesday, 13. And it is ... The conflict that begins with an interesting movie. But time does not go unnoticed, it's just a senseless movie about a supernatural and silent killer. I mean, it goes under the guy, without any sound. After the execution failed, he thought he was supposed to be blind, but he often wanders and dies. I'm tired. It's the same for me. <br /> <br /> In other words: unreal. Too many bugs and misleading information. <br /> <br /> Well, the spectacular female scene with the tide, but it seemed the first time:} To do this and get interesting tickets with two stars.
