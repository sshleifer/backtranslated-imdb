First of all, I would like to say, only tired users commented on my eyes. SF is a comment that is a good comedy that has become good comedy is a comment. MST3000 lives outside of it. <br /> <br /> THE ANGRY RED PLANET says it's about a 10-year-old comedian reader in 1959. All the elements are: pseudoscience, occasionally logical, often hilarious baby. Adolescent attitude towards sex, with the captain "gigolo" (a good call for that, boys!) With eyes "soaring" in the eyes so red, it is not surprising to put fire on. A ridiculous idea about Martha, like a planet that is clear, however, a stranger has an eye-tailed monster with a mouse face and an eye that turns like a boy's toy. Comic relief, as if an astronaut (!) Had never finished Level 8 in Brooklyn, and has a psychotic ice cream on his track. And, of course, a pure act of being a strangely alien. If these people were to meet the US, they would have burned in two plain seconds! "OW" indeed! <br /> <br /> I'm not bad. I rated this movie low. However, it's never boring (unless you're trying to explain it to the scientist), and it's all that it's becoming more and more hilarious, and you must admit that you jump in your younger boy several times. <br /> <br /> Okay, do not accept it. I never thought you were.
