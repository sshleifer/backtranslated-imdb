God, I have never seen this great movie. Maybe it's not like 'The New Guy' or Freddie Prinze Jr movies. Yes, it's terribly terrifying. Mira Sorvino's wood and woodwork has inspired Freddie. The films were difficult to stage (like the theater, and the feeling of confinement does not work well). The actors did not know what they were doing, especially Sorvino. His accent was awful and there was no sexual appeal here; so it was painful to seduce other people, and they were "falling". And what happened in the ear of a live audience? Nonsense! I had to turn off the DVD player, I would bring myself to the headache.
