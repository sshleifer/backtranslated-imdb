I have had evidence of my suspicions. A series of children, from the 14th to the 22nd, will put the DVD of "Titanic" on a large screen mega screen entertainment. Only two of them were seen before. But they all saw that Kate, Leo and Celine Dion had watched the whole movie so many times. After a short period of time, they began to be agitated, others asked others: "Call us when the Iceberg appeared" more than an hour and a half before filming the movie, only two girls watched. They were there yet. They cried out: iceberg, iceberg. Later they saw the Titanic Titanium wreck. They sat openly, sending emissaries and remote exits. So, for the first time, I thought the movie came into the scene. What is this? It's about waiting for one or a half hours of bloody to go in but what happens with that. Dr Zivagho, for example, had a similar duration, but think about the amount of time it takes for that film in the same period of time. In "Titanic" Katek Katek teaches. Look, presumably, the creme de la creme's faces and hands in the first dining room in the boat. Check historical details, if you find them. The story is so thin that the gun and the shooter are entering a ship that is entering. The standard cinema is really sinking. All efforts are guarded by special effects and opening weekends. The film became the highest movie of all time, so what do I know?
