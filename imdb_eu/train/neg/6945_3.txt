Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) has been killed and his wife has attacked the home invasion. He wants to help Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) through a traumatic attempt. Then he finds himself facing a man Archer (Til Schweiger) and is gagged with a chair. He is a man who is killed and killed by his wife and can do everything he likes. And there are many tools to help there ... <br /> <br /> The film is interesting at the beginning (and it shows a real difference in terms of blood and gore), but it's a little less and very difficult. drawing and alternating. The end of a last tour, which was so old and stupid, I was surprised to think that anyone else would be more likely to use it. There are more talented actors like Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer beyond me. This makes three stars for play, but they make stupid plots and really disbelief.
