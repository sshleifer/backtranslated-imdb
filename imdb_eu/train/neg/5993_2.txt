I grew up (in 1965) and loved Thunderbirds. All my friends at the school saw it. We played "Thunderbirds" before school, lunch and school. We all wanted Virgil or Scott. Nobody wanted to be Alan. Counting down from 5 was art. My kids watched the movie I saw when I saw a baby I loved what I loved. What a fuss is It was the only edition of the theme of that era. No comparison with the Thunderbirds point of origin. Fortunately, on Saturday morning, television still plays Gerry Anderson and his wife's series. Jonatha Frakes should deliver a management chair. Loss of the movie. Trash. CGI remake can be acceptable but puppets Homo sapiens subsp. Sapiens was a great mistake in the trial.
