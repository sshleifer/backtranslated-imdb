There are three types of bad films: cheap, boring and pleasing. The really bad films are just boring and fun. <br /> <br /> They are just boring movies, well, boring - if you do not leave fast enough, you're sleeping. <br /> <br /> The likes of films are really defending; but, in fact, it is very helpful for people with disabilities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Capacity and resources available. <br /> <br /> Bo Derek is naturally a boring and tasty one; Fortunately, it spares fate and skills, it seems cheap. This movie is horny and it's likely that the latest fun and bad movie ever made. <br /> <br /> I saw in the first theater, maybe God could forgive; I was laughing inside, I was leaving from the seat and also with the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> Clearly, Derek and her husband-promoter thought this film, to some extent, a satire; unfortunately, the derek clearly did not have all the necessary resources; As a result, the "satirical" element looks like a gay impression of a young girl, who gorshin allegedly condemned herself as she tried to think about it, does not overcome us; human beings could be any. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are some serious suppository moments in this film - because we need to be a supposed movie, remember - it's surprisingly cheesy, does anyone admire that someone spots their eyes damaged. <br /> <br /> As far as malady tends to show off her breasts, I can not imagine erotic nakedness with the picture display, looking at these broad shoulders very strangely. Imagine what anyone has seen. <br /> <br /> Regarding the crust, such is the case - yes, it is not; Derek goes around Africa, and the god only knows why. She wants to play her father - a Harris-manier puppet show, and, of course, the ad is in Hunk'o'Tarzan, without being asked by the advertisement without changing the subject ... the script - nobody has a seemingly unimpeded camera, wrong editing - if there was no chip in 3 direction, the movie would be unbearable - <br /> <br /> such is a real hoot.
