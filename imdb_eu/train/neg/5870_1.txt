I did not like this movie! First of all, I do not know why, but here everyone says that Clémence Poésy's play is excellent, I think it's completely wrong! It's not like Natasha: another look, another character ... What's worse is a very inexperienced actor, and that's why he could not do that! He completely disfigured the hero! That was so much fun to watch her play! In my opinion, it would be much better to give this role to a Russian actor, which would be much easier to understand a Russian Russian soul. Unfortunately, Kutuzov was like a drunken man, who had not overcome his conflict for 2 weeks and lost an eye ... (Thank God, there are some actors in this movie. Alessio Boni was very impressed with his role, surprised I was! This book is a very important part of the play that is a person that reads a lot, as well as our Russian actress likes me, it was so wonderful to see them)) The only thing that I liked in this job was beautiful and beautiful dresses! My advice is to read the book and understand the true meaning, with Leo Tolstoy's masterpiece, and perhaps the whole idea of ​​the book ... 10 to 10
