Does America need the best man to win "in the game"? A gymnast directed by Kurt Thomas (Oh brother!), Ninjas, a crazies town and Richard Norton, tells Kurt Thomas "to keep hardware on keeping trousers". (His exact words) I missed the theaters and it was a good reason, because I often needed to run away I laughed at frequencies. The first thing that went through my mind was how these ninjas fell if a gymnast throws in his ass. Kurt Thomas is 5 feet 4 and hardly has any of the "Best Career" in Kurt Thomas's talented asset, if you do not say anything right ... We should ask ourselves seriously. how much cocaine was so stupid to give. The decision to be thrown out as a Tara Reid scientist is only slowness here. It's been 18 years since I've never seen the title of the movies. I did not want to say no, I would not have found it, I almost laughed at the death of almost my death. Twice a year. Only in the 80s can a bad idea, such as a movie. Although for the record, this hero is just like a hero, he can not even pull a sword to fall to the ground. The action ever performed is a commercial movie, and it's also horny. <br /> <br /> * 4th (bad)
