This movie was absolutely compelling! I can not understand how this film has come to production. There is nothing against the film, of course, the blame of the writer's band. You take the old, old land, that is to say, in this case, we will be poor and unnecessary. But this does not have any apparent plots - or at least one would like it. That is supposed to be an American environment with Canadian actors - this movie is very flat. In a positive note, the management was quite good and cinema was quite decent. The production quote was very generous. Only my one request will only leave the group write and look for a real screenwriter to help the movies come true. Net result - Swipe as it moves.
