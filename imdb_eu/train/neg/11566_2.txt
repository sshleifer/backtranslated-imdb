I might not find a DVD menu selection PLOT: ON OFF. Clearly, the default is OFF. When the last credits started, I could not believe it. As a beautiful, but beautiful character, I felt used, dirty, cheap ... <br /> <br /> The characters draw cartoons and the writer contests thatcheritus. "Roosevelt Democracy" I considered myself, but I would appreciate a little more nuance. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem can be with me. There seems to be many others that have found a meaning or message in this picture. Oh no, I do. <br /> <br /> This "1" thing prevented me from being the only thing that was a beautiful landscape, human beings and plants.
