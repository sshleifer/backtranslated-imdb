The old man is, "If I can not get my project subsidy, I will inject myself" monster movie. Here's nothing new. Jeff Goldblum is similar to "Fly". The man maintains something similar to the point of view, but eventually the consequences of his experiments fall. Playing is pretty bad. People work foolishly along the way, endangering their lives without risk. The guy is returning to the lab, access is prohibited. Next, there is a relationship with a young woman and her son. Certainly, it looks good, but it seems to have a lot of problems. The loss of time is quite high. The sticky Tyrannosaurus also seems to be in a Star Trek deal.
