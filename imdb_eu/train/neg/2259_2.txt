In my life, I can not pretend why they shot the "Jerry Springer Show". It's very compelling. In some ways, unfortunately, it is a pleasure to blame. We all recognize that we've seen at least one section. It's part of our culture. I recently saw it in the United States. It's very bad. I accept it. Jerry plays a great job on what he thinks. Or something like that. Jamie Pressley gives. He plays essentially himself. All he needed was Kid Rock lover. Then it would be perfect. So I'd recommend "Ringmaster." Check out the "Jerry Springer Show". It's more enjoyable than that. <br /> <br /> 2/10
