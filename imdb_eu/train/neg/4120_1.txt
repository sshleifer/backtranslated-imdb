Horrible movie Ameteurish and not funny. Mehmet Ali Erbil's character is very annoying. The publications of E.T and Star Wars are completely stupid. <br /> <br /> Yilmaz Goksal is the only one who thinks about that movie. He had to master his English and go to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find an actor with its features. Not only Goksal, but this film is a rubbish bin. <br /> <br /> The director is Gani Mujde, a comic book writer and the movie is the worst movie written for that date. <br /> <br /> Cem Karaca's music is another. losing money Sumer Tilmac also has the presence. The actors that play three children never have talent.
