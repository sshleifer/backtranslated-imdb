No, GWB, Decider / Strutter / Smirker administration, but small series "Monarch Cove". He had to realize his life completely because he was burning two episodes of the series in a dog, most of them at 21:00. Friday nights and Saturday mornings. Why did I see everything, I can not say before the sudden convulsions of the weekly masochism. <br /> <br /> The majority of the cast are unknown, but they are likely to remain unknown. Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward are the only two names: they only activate decent performances (Jones does not ride around the series - lucky women). Ward, by the way, is doing well after the days of "Thorn Birds". <br /> <br /> The main plot of the plot - He killed his father who had not convicted the murder of his father, but after six years he has been released in the slammer - he has stretched for so long and concludes that he has not been so fast that he does not care. There are plenty of "steamed" sex, many murders, and dreadful behaviors - it's hardly interesting or compelling. Most jets are not particularly attractive and talented. Writing and direction is the same as cast. <br /> <br /> If you come to an end, the mail card (very small) is a hoot. <br /> <br /> BEFORE EATING!
