Well, I've seen a lot of movies about witches and it's hidden, but this was pretty strange. This witch of Witches wandering Orson Wells begins to worship. Could someone not get someone Satan's appearance and performance, but he did not get into this movie. But, nevertheless, Coven takes on a new member and breaks a doll that resembles somebody and has a miscarrage. The lady and her husband, confused, will go to the place where Lillith goes to school, and they see anyone who calls the image of her sister or her sister with her lady, and that she'll be away and never use her powers to die. After settling in a strange town, the couple realizes that all the inhabitants are all witches and it turns the fear and fear of their neighbors and friends. Then things start to happen when the lady suddenly disappears as it begins to die, and if she looks at Orson Wells's playmate, she asks her to help her return. to live The woman tries to escape soon to the town, but she forgets only the inhabitants and their powers and warns the spirit. This movie is fine, it has suspense moments, but it could have been really much better than having Orson there.
