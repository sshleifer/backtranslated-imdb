Basically there is a family (the boy (Jake) thinks he's a zombie in his closet and his parents are fighting all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is slower than a TV series ... and suddenly Jake Rambo He decides to kill and kill zombies. <br /> <br /> Ok, first of all you decide to make a movie if you decide on a thriller or a drama! Drama looks like a movie. Parents are divorcing and arguing in real life. And then Jake completely destroyed our entire movie! I wanted to see a similar movie BOOGEYMAN, and instead I saw a drama with nonsense thriller spots. <br /> <br /> 10 to 3 for good parents and fall conversations. Jake- With regard to the plans: ignore it.
