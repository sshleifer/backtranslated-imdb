My friend and I rented the "Bad Movie Night" with high hopes, but The Brain was a letdown. Brain looks terribly, but mostly sits on his small platform. Who thought that Brain would only get three people out of 94 minutes? This movie starts with some things that stirred Estvez with a rebellious genius (we say that his mind is immensely poisoned in his elaborate pranks and in school stunts, that is, putting crazy glue on someone's chair.) In addition, it has excellent lines, almost unlike all of them, and, on the other hand, the pieces are naked. However, the director constantly needs education. In the last part, things begin to drag, at least 3 or 4 without sense, the boring access that makes up half a third of the plot. The scenes within the complex PRI are particularly bad. At least 15 minutes of this movie are being made up and down the same stairs. The script of that thing was half now, more cheese, more bees, more nudity, more brain action. If you want to make a horror movie bad, you'll give me at least a beautiful look, while the supermarket is off. Perhaps the director tried to direct his audience to his film. At the end of that partner, I started to feel like one of the neighbors.
