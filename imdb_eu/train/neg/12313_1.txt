This may or may not be the worst movie ever made by Steve Martin, but it's definitely his best. Of course, this dog made the pay check. Such a Dreck, definitely, does nothing to enhance his reputation as a fun man. They do not seem to know they are expected to be entertained when they go to watch a movie Steve Martin, who are not tired of tears. Sad to drag Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman with her. I do not know why it can not be considered with great talent that people do not see in bad films. If you would call the movie comedy, it should be fun. That was not it. It may be a shame to link the US military with this palloon. Full Metal Jacket was more lazy than the excuse of a "comedy service". Without a doubt, Phil Silvers is rotating in his grave.
