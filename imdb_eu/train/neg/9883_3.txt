Reasons to see the movie: <br /> <br /> 1) Bo Derek has been looking good for 16 years and occasionally becomes naked. He does a pretty good job that plays a 16-year-old immature and unstable beauty <br /> <br /> 2) a lot of beautiful Greek islands <br /> <br /> But: <br /> <br /> 1) Actor Peter Hooter makes Brutus Zeser the worst performer on March 15, March 15, when he played the "Roman Senate Proceedings". Every line shows a beautiful baritone. Lower volume whenever you speak. At any moment <br /> <br /> 2) Bo's fantasies are unhappy, especially according to current regulations. As a model for a two-round and fully dressed bath <br /> <br /> 3) Plots are less than the Bo's outfits.
