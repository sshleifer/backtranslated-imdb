The man expected a movie approximately. You would be in charge of watching at least $ 300,000,000 in the film at least. "Matrix Reloaded" proves that this assumption is wrong. <br /> <br /> <br /> Although the "Matrix" worked better with apparent holes about story logic. At least nobody could tell me why killing a bot (eg agent) in a simulation (with martix) could damage the computer program in any way ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Wachowski brothers did it completely. This "main agent" in "Matrix Reloaded" is a beat of o-rama. Combat scenes will take just 5 seconds (or even cool). trailer, but in a few minutes, seemingly fake, bad choreography and repeatedly boring is boring. Although you see spectacular spectacle shows, there is no low quality simple, bashing is just simple (for example, better). Van Damme 'movies'. The difference in post-production (etherything is 5 times faster, a lot of cameras go through and some scenes freeze, and this is repeated at least 5 minutes) does not help here, it's all about the same meaning. "martial arts". Beyond these "fights", all actors do not pay what they pay: act out. <br /> <br /> What happens between battle scenes? Except Hollywood's routine. The custom of the hippie group "Waterworld" was sucked into "Zion" as a citizen (on the ground in the last city) and they start dancing at Morpheus's order, because it's a good chance to show off. Almost tits and tits. The old customary tale of this little frog, who speaks of "Ne ne sais quoi," loses his fortune, is a daring of a "liason d'amour". After this (and unfortunately funny), the fight between neo and 'frog' is a fierce adventurer, since what's happening in Erroy Flynn, like int√©rians, is an ornate decoration for greetings. Neo puts it with hellish, just add two stairs and many statues (being destroyed, throwing more than evil and the like) and 5 other, meaningless, boring. this garbage <br /> <br /> What do you expect? Common merchandise hell. And whether or not "revolutions" happen without me.
