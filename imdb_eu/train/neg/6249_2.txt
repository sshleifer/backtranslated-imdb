(r # 97) <br /> <br /> There's a good thing about this poor Pokémon (do what you want): open topic. It should be the best music for the Japanese musician-oops-I-mean-the-young-fan music show. Unfortunately, after the opening, some shows were added. And they could not be more interesting than those who hear better than others' charts. Freud would have a field of play, unfortunately, I can not imagine why the children would have to sit down with the monkeys who could sit through a show with 98% of the duration of the interview in five minutes. <br /> <br /> "My devil, a fantastic Doomsday creature, will be a terrible strike for your Piramide Diamond Animal Misery! You can not see that you can not win this fight, fool! HAHAHAHHAHHAHA!" <br /> <br /> "Yes, yes? Look at this! I will use my Destruction Force Delta Times Pie Card to erase each of your Power Munches and create your latest Uber-Fantastical Doomsday creature that you will not see coming!" <br /> <br /> Really, they even talk about this show. While I saw myself in the bad show, ie, the Pokémon commercial phenomenon (every pet's mascot's mascot), at least monsters were paying tribute to "Yu-Gi-Oh". Just the words of Roger Ebert's A Clockwork Orange review, quietly, "plain talky and boring." Not to mention long-term (here I am hypocritical considering the phrase I just wrote here). <br /> <br /> This show continues forever. I do not know if there are any parcels and static monsters have no Pokémon character. Although kids can not compare my cartoons, this show is awesome. It's not necessarily fun, but it's not fun to watch. Bye bye, tight binds, dreamy dreams come true.
