The movie had a good concept, but the execution was not good. <br /> <br /> What is this concept? Well, the story, "Harry dirty", is known as "M". The child's killer starts to terrorize a city. The first discovery (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) have never been to the series with the murderer. The Mayor and Police Overpayers desperately hired the local mafia to speed up the thing that is hiding ... to end the mess as soon as possible to take things and police. . <br /> <br /> To make it really sound, this film really offers good things. <br /> <br /> Besides the concept, I liked the appearance of the killer's hiding place. Norman Bates has his own basement. This type has terrible scrubs. In some photographs, it is bounced off from clear water and reflects on the walls; often giving these scenes a terrific and dreamy quality. <br /> <br /> The effect was also good. Dennis Hopper is one of those actors that performs better with age. <br /> <br /> Once you can pass, it goes down more or less. <br /> <br /> The fastest pace of the movie. The actual investigation process of both groups is very sharp in the face of feeling intricate and fascinated. This can be set in two ways: make a bigger film or cut a few sub-shots. Each one would allow the crew to spend more time on the true mystery. <br /> <br /> For example, for example, it is one of the key roles that help only the suspect. this: in a moment of his life, the suspect went to the pet store ... It's right ... I'm very serious here. From point A (first surname) pointing point Z (suspicious) as they went, and "jump between" step by step. <br /> <br /> Then there are the characters. I really liked the only two pockets that covered the movie. Considering the small characters, I called him a bad sign. <br /> <br /> In the end, there is an angle of crowd. This is what I get the most from, which is why I coughed to buy the $ 3 DVD first. I mean, a hook! In the last 10-15 years it has been a massive series of killer films. It could help raise the angle of frequency above all others ... but not. <br /> <br /> Gangster's methods would be brutal, but also fun and exciting. ; carer or something else ... maybe they also cast shorts. In the end, we're talking about criminals. Instead, we provide some of the worst protagonists committed to celluloid. Detectives ask the witnesses. What does the mafia do? Ask and die. Nor is it that these witnesses are really bad. I truly found criminals who like less than the killer. <br /> <br /> The good points that have been mentioned are enough to get your interest, I would have missed it. Maybe one day they reuse the idea of ​​the same story and RIGHT. I hope. I hate to waste a good concept.
