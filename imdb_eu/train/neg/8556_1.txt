Okay, I like the idea of ​​this movie. I am a demographic age and I identify some stories. Although sometimes rigid and meaningless interviews seem semi-realistic, it would be a pity for another movie. <br /> <br /> I try hard to keep movies from being silly like others, but that's it. It's not so easy when filmmakers have not tried it. <br /> <br /> The editing of this movie is awesome! The worst edition I ever saw in a movie! If there are things you do not need to go to school, editing is not one of them, but it's a bad thing to do. <br /> <br /> Also, shot ... Oh my God, horrible! I can not access the details, but sometimes we started to see random things, and with editing, we will give you the most painful movie experience. <br /> <br /> 4 crews and crew with little budget and fewer crews are not just an excuse. I've watched shorts on YouTube with a whole lot more artistic! Joe, Greta, I do not know what you're thinking about, but this movie is just about to become your own. You should be ashamed! As a result, this movie is like a terrific amateur movie that has distributed a terrifying dialogue with 3 or 4 bad sex scenes, as well as a terrific and terrific scene of masturbation. If that's not you, avoid all this!
