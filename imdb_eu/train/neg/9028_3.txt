I saw the movie and I should say that there's so much in the premise and talent that this turkey is there! A friend gave me this movie and I was open in mind, especially thanks to the story. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie started with Kevin Costner as a pilot pilot to attack ... why? Why did a pilot fighter do it? He hired Anthony Quinn's character to supposedly be his newest driver ... well, we never have Costner bring his boarding gear to a movie! <br /> <br /> Costner sells a Texan (James Gammon) horse to sell a Mexican businessman and a large Costner tag. Without knowing what happened, Gammon's death is near and Costner leads the meeting with the Quinn team. But nothing happens ... nada, zilcho! Why were the nature of Gammon? Why were they selling horses for sale with Quinn if nothing were going to happen? <br /> <br /> After leaving Costner dead, Madeline Stowe becomes a whore and, afterwards, he has been attacking a man from Quinn ... he tosses him with his knife. and then moved to a convent! There is no explanation why it was moved, or when it was done! <br /> <br /> Lots of talent is wasted in poor writing and poor editing! I saw this because a friend knew it and I could see it ... In 2 days I will throw away my life when I was wasting it.
