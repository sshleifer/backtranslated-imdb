WOW! <br /> <br /> This film bought a friend of mine, bought by Walmart in 1.98 and felt that he had taken it! It's boring, most scenes are shot in front of a green screen, the play is a bit improvised, almost as if it were not written. Martians are CGI, like a beginner or a fan-produced movie. I can not stress that this DVD is really bad! <br /> <br /> For example: in a scene, the Martians torture a local captive. She is facing a green screen of a woman with a copy of her CGI. The change is absolutely outstanding and, when you die, you will see a computer image, like a game played in 1990! <br /> <br /> As soon as possible, avoid this plague! You can download two trailer sites and see what a great god!
