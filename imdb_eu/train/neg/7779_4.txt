A "real" story that appears when a American industrial plant begins to contaminate water. Funny, though it's not really good, monster movies get a lot of people getting monster and what's happening, as well as knowing everything. Give us some points because they give us a huge monster, because they have been built in some scenes, but they are taken away as a threat to some dogs. An entertaining exploration movie is unfortunately foolish in the mind's sphere. (My complaint is that the printout used in the version of Elvira is so bad that it seems like a well-copied tape that has been playing for over 20 years.)
