The Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /> <br /> Like the "Man from Planet X", fantasy and science fiction is still a strange science-fiction story of the time. Meaning, very special effects are very noisy and pseudo-science differs from science fiction. And so, Midnite Movies is another "classic" with a high quality broadcast with high quality transfer. <br /> <br /> So, the main reason to see this movie? Oh, definitely, our space team is at the time of Mars. (What did you think about the "Angry Red Planet" in Neptune?) Previously poorly spatial crew was immersed in a space ship, and they burned and drowned around the chauvinistic sex of "crazy women". team It would be the fault of current standards, but it's not so fun. But Mars is the real reason we are seeing. The film is generally white and black, but Mars, well, Mars is bloody red. It is filmed in the red-colored plasticine of the sun, which gives it a very interesting look against an angry red planet. It's really a pretty sight (according to the audience) witnesses. The best being "ratbatspidercrab". Do you think it's a joke? This is called a movie! It is a giant kimera (a small puppet) that combines the rats, bats, spiders and crabs. It is confined to all puppets and apprehens our "heroic crew". There are other aliens and foreigners who are not well-imagined, but that's what the cake is. In the end, after a serious experience of Mars, the sexist crew directs their "ship" and returns to any planet that came from there. That's not everyone. Science fiction filmmaker and curiosity, and some filmmakers. Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans will have the daytime show (if they have never achieved the show). 2/10 <br /> <br /> Modern score, 6/10 Nostalgia, 4/10 overall. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
