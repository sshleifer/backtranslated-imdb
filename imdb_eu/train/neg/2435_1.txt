I will tell you here: I believed that this conventional, sensible movie was not said to me by critics, but I would like to take advantage of this psychological drama rather than that. <br /> <p> I am here to say that they were wrong. Completely wrong. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not completely; It is very disappointing if you are looking for an action movie, they were right for that. But it is very easy to meet at other levels too. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer was not bad, I think it's worse than usual; But what did Billy Zane know to throw them away? Was the desire for death of producers? Are their films a way to make a flop guaranteed? In that case, he worked. <br /> <br /> If they want to be really successful, why not throw someone to play? Oh, and a scriptwriter can know how to write. Ah, well, and the director who directs you. <br /> <br /> I think I would never recover from someone who was seized by this mess. Mercy could be a good movie.
