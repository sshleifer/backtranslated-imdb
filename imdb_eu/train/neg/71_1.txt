This movie was so bad, I could hardly see it. Direction, editing, production and screenplay seem like it seems like secondary school students who do not know. There was no sense in the flow of narrative. The biggest ups and downs of emotional momentum (like the early morning Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and the relationship between characters (as we are very fond of at the beginning) are completely out of date and will not be as elegant as they were set. and make the film efficiently. The characters have unfortunately not been developed, and it is difficult to have a connection with them. Playing, surprisingly, is not quite bad, but frightful writing away from convincing actions. Films T.V. Western / epic is very bad and reduces the fascinating story that strives to play. I have read a lot of reviews that argue that this issue is important for Australian films. All of this is very well, but as Ned Kelly is an Australian icon, he has no video games. Nobody is saying that the theme is good, but the quality of the film itself. The American Pearl Harbor was about an important historical event, but this does not mean that they would defend the movie and say it was good, it was still bad. There's a pitfall around, though Heath and Orlando are beautiful.
