I accidentally wrote it as a text, I read it and maybe I would laugh. I do not want to, however, when I scatter the movie, the director wanted me to laugh. Although I'm still not sure about where they are. I do not like Woody Allen, this writer can not write a conversation, or at least he can not deliberately write the interview and draw plays to be able to draw even more stylish clowns. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrased) "I'm an art historian, I want to get a job in an artwork". <br /> <br /> Okay, therefore, he has stated the truth, but in truth, do you know what art historians would say? How would you respond? <br /> <br /> "Really? An art gallery? Who would think?" <br /> <br /> The whole scriptwriter would not expect the kind of intellectualist hope. Such a character from a respected writer. I accept that I do not know Allen's other works, and accordingly I do not want to learn to start. The characters are not without exception, the attempt to illustrate the human condition we are all suffering from? Or is it really a bad character writer? You are a judge
