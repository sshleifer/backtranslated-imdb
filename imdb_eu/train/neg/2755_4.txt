That is, the most beautiful line of clich√©s, in a straight line, I've seen a plot of land for a long time and a decent way of acting. Star Wars, Reign of Fire, Godzilla, the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter scenes, the war on the viewer's intelligence went completely. Was this movie good? There was no movie at all! <br /> <br /> Although it's not so bad to be really fun and to get the cult status of comedy, the film offers some laughter. Trick is putting the scenes copied in the original movie context. Gandalf can play a fun game, comparing a ridiculous monster snake with a kitten, and the bad guy Sauron and Jaja-bing or his name can make it commercially entertaining. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: any pleasure derived from this film is entirely dependent on the poisoning and the imagination of the audience, not by the director / writer. You shame, Shim!
