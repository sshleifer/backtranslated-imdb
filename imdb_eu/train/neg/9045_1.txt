This movie began with a plot similar to the endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with this story. It was impossible with this movie. This movie is very cynical, because it has a lot of animation skills, but it has a totally creative or unrivaled ability. An effort from an important study is a bad thing. It is clear that there are problems of morality and motivation with Disney, lack of supervision and uncontrolled quality. Thanks to this management, this movie allows you to see the light of day, about disability and despair. This movie is the "worst movie" of all my times.
