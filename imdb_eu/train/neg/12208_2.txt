As a veteran of the army, this film was very influential. In my opinion, it is the shame of those who fought for the Vietnam War. I knew that the real SF soldier was a mere soldier, it's worth noting. If the film was presented as a satire or a cartoon (it was), it could be better taken. But my people were taken seriously, especially abroad. It seems nonsensical, as I went to Europe at the end of the 80s, people generally played me through this movie and I am Americans in general. Unrealistic? Hmm, let's see. Monosyllabic muscular-bound cretin is released to release a jail job team to secret SE Asia to go to the US POW. He fights a 500-soldier enemy with a M-60 machine gun in a rage race and never escapes his ammo and never warms himself. And it never fails, running with an arm of a 32lb pistol. I could keep it, but I'm getting a headache. I gave this 2/10 a better performance than Rambo III.
