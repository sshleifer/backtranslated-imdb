Let me start by saying that I did not see the first great movie. The movie was recommended to me by a friend, and the cover "MTV" was stuck, so I did not expect much. I expected something that was a tear-whirlwind, very dramatic but at least effective. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me read the book that I never read. or even a new version of the film. <br /> <br /> The play was the main movie. God is AWFUL. The girl is pretty middle-aged, but she's Maryl Streep compared to the rest of the cast. The main "Heath" Hero is horrible. Sing songs of good songs, but about it. His activity broke the sad moments, because he was so bad at the points I laughed. Isabel was also very funny, and her brother was just four characters, who played emotions that could not be displayed by the actors. And when he tried, he failed. Neil Patrick Harris was a decent actor, although he played Edward, it was clear that the direction was bad, although I did not see it. Oh, and my father was not in my memory a bit wrong, but I remember the movie that I had little time to remember. <br /> <br /> The story was not very good. More than fractions you can think. A preview story (Lastly, until I understood little). Great characters that are not very well-liked ... Generally not interesting or compelling, anything we have not seen much better than ever, and nothing we can see here. <br /> <br /> It is supposed to end. having a tearjerker He did not do anything The end is not a complete one, it feels almost like a thought. In fact, my friends WHY WHO asked me what happened, and when he explained it, I had to wait "Wait, when did they say that? What?". It's never a good sign. I saw the edition, surely, it was the worst, even though fade-ins-fade-outs have already been made for television, but that's not an excuse. <br /> <br /> In total, the movie is just rubbish. I was a sensitive man and I called him in two episodes of Simpsons. I never get past my head, cry, or close. Actually, this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see another tearjerker.
