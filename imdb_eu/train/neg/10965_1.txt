I'm really watching this movie as I write this. . . The following comments "if it proves my lack of development as an artistic creator," then it will be. . . <br /> <br /> But. . . I thought this movie (as I still think). . . To light it up, very, very overrated. Again, very. <br /> <br /> It seems to be a real bad student of other resources that are very limited. . . and who did not pay much attention to detail. <br /> <br /> I do not want this movie to continue in different ways, but it does. . . well . . I just got it (I remember, I absolutely accept that ME is a fool, not a filmmaker) does not get that "imaginary genius". . . I rented the whim because they were very excellent reviews. . . <br /> <br /> Sheesh. . .
