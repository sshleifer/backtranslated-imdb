Even though this is not an "excellent movie", that's something compelling and memorable. Like other movie reviews, I saw this in childhood. In 1952, it's been twenty-eleven years ago, but I've never forgotten the story or its heavy hilarious title. See this option. You feel like a voyeur of a small town as you evolve over the decades. More than any other movie, this brings a human face to the twentieth. Early historical drama "Progress". For a young audience and a memorable enough for an older person. Also, it's easy to enjoy the characters and over time.
