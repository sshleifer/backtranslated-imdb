I had a lot of hope for this movie, and even more since the Yashraj Film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy has a call center and one day Pooja Singh has invited Lakhan Singh to teach English. . They decide to escape and fall in love, but Pooja says that he can not do it, as well as Bhaiyyaji, owed by Lakhan Singh. But they decide and steal money and then Jimmy is aware of Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh Don. In the meantime, Bhaiyyah has hired a man Bachchan Pandey to keep Jimmy and Pooja. <br /> <br /> Saipi Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar star, Viay's director will direct Viay for the first time. Created by Krishna Acharya and Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. "Tashan" has to be one of the worst films ever I've ever seen. Yes! The landscape is good and Kareena Kapoor (and his weight loss report) looks good. However, the plot story is very thin and sometimes there is no sense from one scene to another; so I initially said why I expected more about this film as a result of Yashraj's production. As for the songs, unfortunately, I am not the only song I remember. <br /> <br /> There are moments that can make you laugh, thanks to Akshaye Kumar, and Saif can definitely make Kareena better. Kapoor played well. But this can not be said of Anil Kapoor - he was not fit for criminals. In the end, it does not matter to Aditya Chopra, who has produced and directed good films in the past, "Mohabbatein," what did Yash Chopra do as a film trash? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A bad movie, you do not have to waste your time, which is my first and last impression.
