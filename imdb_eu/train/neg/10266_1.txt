View as of 07/07/2007 - 10 of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): The horror films that were in the 70's confirmed their encounters on Friday (1 version 1?). I can not think of here a lot of exceptions (can I think anything?) The story is based on a series of giants that listening to a radio show, allegedly like a homage to some children in the forest as a "tribute". However, one of the stupid people, it has a connection with the true event, because it is one of those who killed her sister (again, it is absurd that this would also be a part). Did not guess? The killer is back and we jumped from the beginning (so there is any mystery). Besides all this, where there are "police" and why does not someone call it. I can not believe this film was financed and made by someone. As you may think, now the Americans would have judged a bit more about at least their experience, but not this filmmaker.
