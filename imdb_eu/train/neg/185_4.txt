The five good western westerns made by Mann make Hollywood a unique set. Although John Ford has never done so much. There was a strange thing about them. Ford's My Darling Clementine is worth two and a half of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> Their true heroine is Mann and Stewart is Chase. Chase Red River is in charge of it. Chase wrote away the country, the river bend and probably others. But none of them is as finalized as my Darling Clementine, but they're just a few movies, western or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Each of Mann's five films has big voids, or six, let's see. Bend, far away, West, Fury, Winchester 73, and yes, six, Spur Nuda. Each one has a great scene after the great scene, it is quite evident. However, Red River is still the largest western one. So perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> But the remote country has huge and huge holes. He is Mawkish, and he is really alive only when Stewart and Mc Whole are blocking branches. The rest is fairly straightforward, with the exception of Mann's camera. Mann's film camera is a male course. It's a good eye for anyone who has succeeded in pursuing a moving band. It's hardly ever in the wrong place. <br /> <br /> The Remote Country has an amazing moment. And it's just like Stewart. Nobody in film history has ever received a physical punishment with the authority of that man. It's totally astonishing: look at Benden, Far, Winchester, and Laramie's man: he's beaten in Bend and hangs on it like someone who has moved from Dachau. It comes from violence, it's so compelling to you, and it's obvious that when you take it to Man's stove, it's obvious that you're looking for burnt brands. What is the actress When Winchester suddenly beaten him in the hotel room, as anyone did. <br /> <br /> But it was Mann's territory: look at Gary Cooper fighting Jack Lord in Western Man. At one time they recorded any fight as bad as the scene. Stewart does not persuade him, but, in some way, it's somehow the same when it's over when it's over. In conclusion, no one is one, but nobody has ever shown man in extremis and Mann. <br /> <br /> A wonderful and great director. <br /> <br /> View to the west of what you have ever seen. Their real monuments are, though they are all scetchy. But what? Shaking with good scenes is as good as anybody, including Ford. And there are six sets of plays made by anyone, the best of the time. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Anthony.
