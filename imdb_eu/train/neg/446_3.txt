This was disappointing. He started well, but as he moved forward and lost all the opportunities to climb, the flat fell. Maria Schrad's acting is horrible, she seems to never say what she's saying, or even says what she's saying. He did not show any real emotions, not the story of his beloved or his mother's story. Along with Lena, Lena's story only knew the academic interest. It seems that the real relationship between Lena and her mother did not exist, the mother seemed to be enjoying her wedding, which is not much. Hannah's "confuse" relationship between love and her mother's relationship was as topical as the topic, and yet they failed. The marriage was completely convincing and a mute was over. The supreme end of the protest was not inspiring, and Lena had the effect or negligence that had the result, at that time the feeling would have somehow complexity, an overwhelming appearance, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, the character of the movie is not in any depth or spark. It was very difficult to look after any of them, even if Ruth was little. Luis was a distraction. (Why did he undo it at the hotel at the hotel? There was no context or explanation for that.) Removing all references from him would not be noticeable. <br /> <br /> A simple story that was mixed with the character developed (who was the mother again?) were correct and corrected. It could almost be heard "flat in peace! ..." I began to think that it was worthy of 7, but as the film progressed, it fell quickly to 4, and then won 3 after the noisy scene of the wedding. I've seen a movie as cold and sterile as this. An awesome waste story.
