Paul Mercurio inadequate. After getting Scott Hastings a role, Strictly Ballroom, the best movie in history, made a lot of junk. The character of this movie is not very difficult, or even harder, but Mercurio is a person that wants to relinquish himself, he will be completely upset and ORIENTAL. This is a great mistake in costume design.
