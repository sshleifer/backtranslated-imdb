I did not expect a large part of this movie, a little fun and deviation. The story of Wuthering Heights can be converted into credible, pleasant and soothing, melodramatic and interesting. This movie decided to discard the talents of the people who participated in a version of the full version, which surprised Wuthering Heights. It must be taken into account that it is basically a story of people who are hardly familiar, most of them are not similar and often mutual cruel. Changes the nature of some characters. Isabelle, for example, in the novels, did not have a confusing bone in her body, removed the blind idealism and turned it into an schematic bitch. Heathcliff psychologically is a huge person that tortures most people on his way, but in this version, Catherine ends his daughter to take care of her. The conversation is sad and one thinks how to get the actors to make the right faces. Instead of deep or real emotions, we know that they mean something when they scream in someone's face. In the early 1990s, I read "Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights" and presented them by Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, making the gothic and obscure gothic tale a terrifying adventurer. A little bit of a comment, but the MTV version gives you a step closer, using the structure of the basic structure, to give the beach a bit of bad music.
