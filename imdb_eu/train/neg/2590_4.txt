American Pie has gone a long way. Initially, I think the actors do not think what they are doing, and instead it's just a restoration of a college party. Two students of the story have been enrolled (with the young stifler young) dying to go to university, local night parties, sex and of course. The plots are stupid and away from the original pastry. Actually, they do not submit an apple pie again. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I work in a video store and I can rent it for free. Remember, however, it's wasteful time if you enjoy sex movies without being naked and without drinking. I think I'm a teenager and I think Evan's All-Powerful would be a better option.
