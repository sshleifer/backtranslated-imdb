I do not know the positive comments about this film. It's cheap and bad at all levels and I can not understand how it was done. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < No one is a fictional character - except Sue's boyfriend in Asia, though he is now able to make domestic violence! Both people who are not as depressing as I do not know why Rita and / or Sue themselves were drawn like Bob by their heads, but when doing so, why did I expect them to take care of what's going on? So, there are several reviews that keep "realistic". True, it's a sad reflection on society, but there's no reason to go on film. <br /> <br /> I did not like the movie.
