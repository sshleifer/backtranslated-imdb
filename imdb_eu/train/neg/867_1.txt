I was really looking forward to this movie, although I did get a bad review on paper. I was very tolerant and I saw the whole movie. I was finally ill. <br /> <br /> Even though I was not a fan of cinema, I did not feel pretty, I enjoyed both Woody Allen's "Sex You Know You Ever Know About About ..." . 'and' Funny Games' by Michael Hanneke - I found that the director intended to drink the feminine milk by a ten-year-old boy. When the film ended with the "orgy" who likes her mother's milk and likes "the woman with the whole movie", I almost entirely cheered her with perversion and sentimental sentiment. da. <br /> <br /> Do not go wrong, I enjoy the majority of European cinema, as well as independent films; so I'd be very happy about this movie for me. Avoid this movie anytime, it will go down from the history analyzes as a lesson in the movies.
