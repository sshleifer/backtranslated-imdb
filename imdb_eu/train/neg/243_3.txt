He is the main character in this film for William Russ. He left his family again and began to pay debts. But she tries to get away from her family. That's when Peter Falk (Colombo) gets into playing different roles to convince him to return home. <br /> <br /> The story is average and it's really nice to get an old star (Peter Falk) and use it to be quite enjoyable. But William Russ was not really a star. However, acting seems to be okay. <br /> <br /> I was pleased to give you the story and I liked it all in the way it's predictable. In fact, in the last 20 minutes I had the word, before it happened. A good movie can not be that way. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was sub-par. In the letter grading system it would receive a "D".
