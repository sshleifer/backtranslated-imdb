I was very disappointed with this movie. I thought the film "Scary Movie" was not very good and fun. On the other hand, "Scary Movie 2" was boring, it's not fun, and sometimes stupid. <br /> <br /> Exorcist / Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great. <br /> <br /> Now, I accept that I am disadvantaged, because I saw some parodies that have not seen this parody for the first time, I have seen them basically. A bad comedy, however, is a bad comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie really ruined something that might have been a good joke. Scenes and jokes are dragged on long. <br /> <br /> Likewise jokes are the same again. For example, the bird that speaks. It's been a fun first and maybe a second time. But he continued to repeat the annoying point. The customs between the wheelchair in Hanson (Chris Elliott) was fun at the beginning but he continued to repeat and was stupid and even tasty. For example, I think that Cindy (Anna Faris) called "Scary Movie" was fun because Cindy had spent so much time giving her boyfriend a sex, because hell's blue balls were fun and creamed. But this time there was no place and it was not fun. <br /> <br /> Bath and sex humor was generally more fun and well organized for the first time. Scat humor was overwhelming and in the second film was a great explanation. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling was annoying and had no place in this film. <br /> <br /> But Shorty liked (Marlon) Wayans) was the funniest character in my first movie. With her, the scene and vegetable work was one of the favorites of the second films. <br /> <br /> I'm not bad, I love Wayans family and humor. That's why this movie is so deceptive. . . They have more comic abilities than endless jokes.
