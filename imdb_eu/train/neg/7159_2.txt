I have never found a movie like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre Return," but this movie will compete. <br /> <br /> I'm not a person who sleeps. I watched the movie, but it was 15 minutes since I started Trance. I woke up and started to see it again. Why did I deserve it? All the movies were tortured. I need to use the fastest progress to see if it is fulfilled. <br /> <br /> I can not explain why one of my favorite actors of my time (WALKEN Mr.) can do this. I have to think that he has favored the director, or when he really needs money, he is doing something wrong with the movie, and so fast ... <br /> <br /> What is the movie? It's not terrifying, stupid lelo, the characters are awesome (but I liked Jared Harris), the effects are very poor, lack of death and blood, and so on; In three words, everything has it. And I mean. It can not be highlighted by a director as he can make such a movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, when I was disappointed when I saw it on the cover, "Stephen King" presented me. believe that he can not present himself, right? (I rented in Argentina). I do not recommend a million years. <br /> <br /> I value this movie from 10th to 10th (as in the "Chainsaw Massacre Return in Texas", it will always be worse. movies, that's why it's not worth 1 to 10)
