I preferred to call Pier Paolo Pasolini or Pee-pee-pee (because of love for showing male sexual organs), maybe it's the most European Marxist director and the earth is thick. Who can see "art" a cheap sexual reflection, that is, than I do. Here some "stories" could be extracted from live soft porno movies, and I'm not so naked, but simplistic and insignificant stories, often insignificant. Those who enjoyed this curious enough but dumb thing should brush their teeth in the "Der Schulmaedchenreport" series of the 70s, but they look like "Decameron". <br /> <br /> In addition, the movie is almost crazy at all levels, from the beginning to the end: <br /> <br /> 1st Edition. An example: 1:15 a.m. minutes: in 45 seconds, the scene is quite clear in the wrong place. It was supposed to take a minute later, but I think that Pasolini should hire a "period of editor" with little time to make short films. The fans of Pee-pee-pee probably said that they were going to put an end to it, they deliberately put it, and I'm very sorry. Moreover, although this is true, it would be even worse, because this story does not do anything, because it does not continue to be harder. (This is not exactly one of the "Eraserhead" or different types of Tarantino films ...) <br /> <br /> Act 2. Vey sloppy Triple Pee fans (8 of them) express their pride as 3P-Ok uses "real people instead of actors". (Are not actors actors? They're not Martians? Yes, many actors have IQ sub-units, but that means we must treat them with disdain ...?) Other directors have used fans and got it (for example, Alan Parker or De) Niro), why are the fans of PPP so great in their films? The answer is again wonderful. Pasolini has sharpened everything, which is trying to get him out of polite dance as much as possible. The director is lazy, if you want an IMperfectionist. Contrary to Kubric, I suppose ... The main goal of Pee-Pee-Pee was to find the maximum possible amount of toothpaste (and young men like him) when he was cast. There is a simple formula in the Pasolinin world: lack of teeth + strange face = realism. It is very well and good to have teeth, but at least they can offer at least half-decent performances from those inexperienced neospecies; otherwise, you're an amateur, amateur director, in the case of Pasolini. 3P-0 is not about this matter or just does not matter, it does not change anything. (Who knows ... maybe he did not even know how to act?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3. Audio. Synchronization If 3P-0 has a horrible horror when the microphone is filmed, then at least post-production post-production should be done. so that the viewers would not have to see their mouths while moving their conversations while floating somewhere else. <br /> <br /> 4. Concept is missing. We have stories about dozens, implicitly linked. Some are anti-church (more about it later); Some people, however, are just sex-based, that's to say, to designate fantasy fantasies for cheap men (sometimes gay) and anything else. Stories and characters are not fun (in any way) in intelligent, but basic level. 10-year-old kids can laugh here ... And with that there is nothing wrong, but do not call them upright and intellectual. <br /> <br /> 5. In point 4, there is also a lack of logic in the order of stories. Without saying Pee-pee-pee ordered another way to order and had the same movie. This means that you can start feeling the middle and the beginning, etc. "Decameron" is like a spaghetti bowl: when you start eating, you can start any thread you like, it does. there is no difference. <br /> <br /> 6. No resolution of stories. Most stories end with a gag / cheap joke, that is, some rumors of innocent people from a comic porn movie, but some stories do not have an effect: they end only. Finite In most cases, stories are semi-anecdotes that are impressive, because they are reasonably deeper in there, such as if you do not find meaningful "porn" meanings. There is, of course, nothing to look for and find it "lacking". That's why even hardcore porn movies can be philosophically / continually being rethought. It's easy and fun. Try, 8 PPP fans! <br /> <br /> Concerning Church Treatment ... Some spectators excite Catholicism and aggression. Mostly, all this is fine and well - after all, I'm my atheist - but I do not know what the Pasolini is about to believe in Marxism, but it is essential. It's like a boat called black clay. Does a Marxist criticize the church for hypocrisy and stupidity? Where does the nerves come from? Besides, Pasolini was not an atheist; Therefore, its high and powerful attitude is not justified. In the end, Marxists are believers: it is only a fantasy of unwanted thought that was adopted only with the idea of ​​a Utopia that was only adopted by God. That's why I can not stand the anti-PPP anti-religion attitudes. <br /> <br /> Humpdorama, a sophomoric anthology, ends with a Pasolini, with dismay: "I'm asking ... why did you produce it when it was just dreaming of an artwork?" In fact, there was no mention of that bad movie about art. .. yours ...? If that were the case, I deceived the poor man, then I wonder why he just did not dream, and NOT do those bad films ... <br /> <br /> Can I read my modified subtitles from Bergman movies?
