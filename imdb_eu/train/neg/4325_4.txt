The second of the holiday section is easier, because Clark Griswold has won a trip to Europe for the whole family. <br /> <br /> The first time you've done your first education is full of humor. It's hardly here. The director of Hackerling is guilty, of course, that there is no inspirational script that is not so good as director Harold Ramis, and only scattered line-up lines. <br /> <br /> He can throw away; Chevy Chase is injecting a way of life in the process, but it's not enough, and Eric Idle is very amusingly wasting himself out of English as a very lucky role. Some ridiculous moments are not playing their full potential, and they make the audience worse, especially. European images are dimensionless and are almost universally not funny (as the English are SOOO nice). <br /> <br /> Apart from some scenes, it's not nearly a sight to laugh and it ends with a full slapstick. But if you are a fan of Chevy Chase (like myself), you can watch the movie, but not more than that.
