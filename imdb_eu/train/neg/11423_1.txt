What happened when this movie was made, it was finally a mess? A year later, "The Breakfast Club" was a great movie with the same actors as "St. Elmo's Fire" (by the way, they looked at the second level and the first plays were the first ones, but without being arrested for portraying their roles <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was directed or written. Kill "and two Batman films," Batman and Robin "and" Batman Forever ", good and bad director, something wrong with" StEF "was wrong, it does not have any genius, it does not cost anything for comedy, and it is far from really valid in life . <br /> <br /> For example: Wendy character (goodbye to a wealthy little girl) and aided by the unhappy ones of Mare Winningham) shows Billy (a rebellion that deceives his wife and his girlfriends). Rob Lowe has acted well in his sense of life that he is not yet a virgin. Billy really sees challenges and conquests possible but Wendy "is not ready." Wendy, in fact, is so unlikely to believe it is difficult to believe in incredible friends. Then the story, when Billy had taken his wife to his son and married another, draws some of his life chains somehow. Billy goes to New York, ignoring the responsibility of his father's daughter's parents, Wendy will convince himself that virginity is perfect for "gifts away". And Wendy, as a family worker who works as a social worker, seems to have never thrown out of this despot. Give me a break. The only thing that can be given is given to a loser who is leaving his family and friends? Schumacher draws this scene as a stunning and moving moment. <br /> <br /> There is a lot more examples that there is a complete disconnection between the real and the value that is being thrown aboard and acts like virtue. <br /> <br /> Some may say that it was "in the 80s," but I recall that "in the 80's, men were responsible for marrying or caring for children outside." /> <br /> I think this movie is very bad because it is synchronized with what is so valuable and correct. <br /> <br /> As regards the technique (not the story), it has been tremendous. It's current and 3-hour movie feels like an editing time of one hour and 40 minutes. Transitions and jumps over time simply do not make sense. Choose the editing room on the floor, put it back and the movie would go much better ... but it's still a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe Schumacher has become a better and better director since 1986 (he ought) or maybe he was over the head of writing the St Elmo Fire script, or maybe this group of actors took over and took his path. That's what really happened to me.
