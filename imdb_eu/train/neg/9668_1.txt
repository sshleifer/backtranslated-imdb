1940. - A visit to the Polish ghetto occupied by Polish Lodz nations, combined with the unbelievable Jewish community collaboration, archive footage, international news clip and portrayed cultural portraits. World Jews as enemies and parasites. This documentary interpretes Jewish life from the traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. Hate race, honest and cinematic expression. Personally, this movie seems incredibly terribly offensive to me. It can only be expected that photos like photos will never reach the screen anymore.
