I usually like to watch Burt Lancaster's movies, especially what you should do with a spectacular screen like Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, which was occasionally the greatest weakness, rarely, or never less than, never knew. And it's not so subtle that it's lacking with Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character is a kind of supervisor, but Katherine Hepburn could have fallen under his magic to be completely incomprehensible. Smart is supposed to happen, but it does not look like that Lancaster's lie is on the screen! In addition, it is one of the films that I have ever seen, and it is very evident that this is a theater-based movie. It seems they were shot in most scenes of sound, supposedly supposedly in the open West. <br /> <br /> Generally, a very overrated movie.
