This movie could give you a real score, it's likely to be in the numbers. If someone is to continue to make these horrible "horror" movies, seriously, people, buying a card for this film can spend a lot more money if you lose money. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If the rating was higher, it would probably take a longer film in the long run. <br /> <br /> He made anyone who made this "Prom Night" version. The actors probably did a decent job, if they were not scripts doubtful. It was a huge film footage of a trip. I would soon go back to see "One Missed Call", at least some of the plots.
