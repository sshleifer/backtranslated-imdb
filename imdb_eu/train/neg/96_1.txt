... Waiting, I can not! This movie is not for the typical snobber film, like your typical cinematic definitions, like "tracking edition" and "geographic match". I can not tell where I was in this movie. In the second moment, this time, the next minute in the 70's, they would ride a supposedly modern Amestoy and look like a 80s outfit. I think. I could not give myself enough attention for a long time, because the performance was horrible. I think that I only pay attention to what I do not see 3d. If you are a B-movie and I want to say B-movie to BAD, this movie is for you. It's a homemade movie and all the sensible styles will make you laugh when you're awake. If you like more Goddard and Antonioni, please skip it.
