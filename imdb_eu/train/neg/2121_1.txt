Actually, it seemed like boredom even for seven hours. What is that? What is Will Smith that has not survived? I think he plays seriously and he's very hell for an Oscar. As I understand the bias, but I do not suffer from any lessons in the new performance, I can never see it. He is a great name and, therefore, he is confused in general for his talent and multiple actors. It's just that. I make credit for trying so hard and being able to cry in a hat's tinge. That's it. <br /> <br /> Seven pounds for me was eyeroller, from the beginning. The 911 call for suicide did not make me intrigued. I did not know why I was aware of why he was calling for suicide. It was not surprising. The best thing I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had decent screen chemistry. Also, I do not know his name, but the Hispanic woman did an excellent job because she was afraid and won. Woody Harrelson had a very limited time on the screen, but I would say that he was stealing the show at each time. <br /> <br /> In the end, the ground line is just a very fast line. I could not ask myself all the way, why I took care of any of these people. Never felt the feeling for 'Tim / Ben'. He died with a medicine? Only one survivor of 8 people? Geewiz ... it was not seen coming ... <br /> <br /> <br /> 5/10 is quite generous.
