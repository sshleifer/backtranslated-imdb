I and my friends rented this movie for $ 2.50. And we agree with two things: <br /> <br /> THAT'S A GREAT ACCIDENT! <br /> <br /> Likewise, my and my friends number 475 faces. (Which consists of 95% of the film) <br /> <br /> So, in other words: KNOW YOU KNOW ABOUT you wasting money! And I do not! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
