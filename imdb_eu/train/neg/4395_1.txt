As a special holiday in December, like the original Frosty, quality music and story should be healthy, yet lighthearted to be a relaxed guy. They must touch the mystic magic of the holidays. Basically, they should look, sound and feel ... well, the "special" and decree holiday text should be decent and appropriate. <br /> <br /> So when I saw the frozen ice legend on TV, on the TV, I got lists, my children (6 and 8), told me the story of the original Frosty, and told them how much they liked in their childhood. My expectations for seeing my wife and children on the couch were high, but in 10 minutes my kids were rude and my wife and I looked "looking" at each other and turning their eyes. After 35 minutes, they asked my children to go to bed - they were bored with language sensitivity and disconnected segments. I really was ashamed of this movie (and my) despair. <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this legends of Frosty Snowman's story is like conflicting and bad step-by-step. Sponge Bob is a holiday movie than a classic. I'm not mistaken ... these shows are fine and I like to play with the next, but when I see Fairly Odd Parents or SpongeBob, I'm thinking of my small (semi-colored, colored, low-key) minds. Numerical sections are always happy. <br /> <br /> We received good books and the rest of the afternoon we continued reading together. A better option than the shameless legend of the snowy doll.
