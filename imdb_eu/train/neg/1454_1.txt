I recently saw the movie twice, and it seems that I do not know why authors have done this shit. I mean, however, that it gives an excellent impression on the Hitler environment and played in Austria in the late 1890s, it is the period between the First World War and War. I can not understand why it seemed to Hitler to figure 100% crazy, crazy, unreliable, and insanely stupid. In the end, he was a very intelligent, loving and intelligent man, of course, undoubtedly in the dark side. But why do they name it in the sky like this? All of its positive aspects have cut off the scene, but rather a very religious portrait of a man who has had the greatest impact on modern civilization. Yes, Germany destroyed the Second World War. Yes, it was racist, but at the end of the war it was mostly unstable. All true But again; why did the LIE hiss to the public? To notify? <br /> <br /> I do not think this movie was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and nations came to power in the most vulnerable worlds. This misery, in fact, that almost all almost alive Germans, such as the Austrians and many other people, do not refer to it as being so absurd as to modern civilization, NO, Hitler was "so strange". If the creators were to believe us, I would believe that the German peoples were postponed. A man like this movie would never get anything near the party leader - without mentioning ReichsKanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
