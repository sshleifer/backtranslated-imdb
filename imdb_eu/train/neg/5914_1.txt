This movie is really boring. They banned Chinese cinema and why I see it. Not because of the criticism of the communist community, but because the film has such a low quality. I would never pay the money to see this. I love movies by Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and I am disappointed in the bad movie taken from China. It seems that the public is ignored and the director seems to have shot himself. The shots of a person who does not do something for a minute are hilarious and there are many of them. Cinematography and video quality is very bad. I watched this movie online, and it seems like the likes of this movie. The only explanation of this is that if a movie fan can not be in English, it is automatically good. I can not see people as they like. It's not the art of celluloid waste. (They actually filmed it, but they did not film it).
