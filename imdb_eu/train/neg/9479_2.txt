This movie seemed to be better than being better. Cinematography is good, it seemed to be a good theater, no intense interview ... but about thirty minutes ago, there is a long scene with a doctor with a doctor, but an asylum that comes to the doctor. from south to south. <br /> <br /> On top of that, if the devil comes from Godzilla's appearance, the devil is the curse. The Logan race has masks that resemble teens that are older than the beginning. <br /> <br /> Finally, cinematography could not save this movie. Although theatrical performances are quite solid, the story has no place anywhere. I think that "Hellbored" would be a better title for that.
