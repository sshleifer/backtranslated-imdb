This misfortune was seen at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It's been very well shot at the start, but the last positive comment about the film is final. The play was horrible, I wonder if they were the real enthusiasm of the girls? However, it is likely that it was the most horny and, in fact, it was terrifying and boring, the only reason I gave it was 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** below. <br /> </ p> <p> I would like to mention the audience that I should laugh a lot about the scenes: wrong. Real eye open <br /> <br /> Entering the bus scene: the girl is in the bus. But, according to music, the world is ending. <br /> <br /> Rolling under the clothes line: Wow, this really shows the writer's skills on the plot. The room then sells raw meat and skills. Why not immediately do all three mistakes? At least that could be a smaller movie. <br /> <br /> Down the stairs of the center: see when a little girl falls down the stairs that eat meat, without waiting. * * He is just trying to break his nails. <br /> <br /> A race covered in blood: this is definitely my favorite scene and the ending of the movie. A half marathon in a red color, upstairs and a marathon that runs through the bridge, which only sends a plane with imagination. Not only that, but one of the most obsessed girls in the movie is suicide, now attached to your character. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is 16 years old. old and their friends. Unfortunately, after discovering the director of the host, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> But, if you are sarcastic, and you laugh a few friends ... think even more.
