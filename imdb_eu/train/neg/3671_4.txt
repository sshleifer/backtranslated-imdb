The story of a man contaminated by a chemical substance (Weller) is dull, predictable, and interesting, he goes across the country to find his ex-wife and children; Meanwhile, everyone who loses his hands will only kill him. In his dangerous track, he tries to stop the doctor (Hurt) and a young reporter (Natasha). The movie premise is not originally, but it can be much better. The end result is just a movie without suspense or difficult times. Even though the good cast has deteriorated. I give it 4 (four).
