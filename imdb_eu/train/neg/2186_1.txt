... but he asks you, first of all, if we have one! This movie is as bad as any of today's horror. A man raises his half-clothes and decides to give his girlfriend a new body. A scene involves a man who turns around three minutes throughout the whole set, covering what is needed by more than ten gallons. The film also tries to make the man who is doing his girlfriend is unwise and contrary to nature, but the film is so badly done and it is impossible for the viewer to eliminate the feeling of blow or attack. Unhappy and terribly malicious, the movie can not get its title straight; The initial credits are "The Brain That Would not Die", but the latest credits are called "The Head That Would't Die".
