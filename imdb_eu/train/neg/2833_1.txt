With a Bo Derek movie, the audience expects what it is. A thin paper thief and Mrs. Derek's little clothes. "Ghosts can not do it" is just that. The first fifteen minutes are the usual TV series, while Scott [Anthony Quinn] is alive. He is a very good actor and has a long experience in different roles, but it seems that a famous actor needs only money to work at times. Bo Derek is the opposite, always dressed in a beautiful outfit, without clothes or without. The movie is a waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence Arabia or La Strada. If you want to watch black women or play, rent any porn movie.
