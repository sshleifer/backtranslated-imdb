... This would be the worst movie I ever saw. Hmmm, maybe maybe tied to Boogeyman. Wonderful, really horrible <br /> <br /> I had low expectations and they did not meet them! Honestly, I can not think of a good thing. So here is the worst point ... <br /> <br /> 1. USE OF IMPACT 2 2. CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphs ... seriously) 4. TERRITORIAL 5. SOCIALITY AND, lastly, .... 6. LONG <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions, about 2:32 a month ago? Afterwards, they realized they did not get together in a Lex Luthor and Superman scenes, they forced him for a period of 3 minutes or nobody thought he would not notice. The main hero and criminals have less time on the screen than the son of Superman and the killer man? !! <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was half the commitment budget commitment? <br /> <br /> When Superman goes to the hospital, why doctors ask him "What do you want F *** to do? It's a horrible stranger! We do not know about his anatomy!" <br /> <br /> What happened to 5 years ago when Superman was away from technology for 28 years? <br /> <br /> People who wrote people who wrote good reviews? <br /> <br /> Finally, why? Just why? <br /> <br /> BTW, asking you how it will come to lift a whole continent of Krypyonite Superman, I think I figured it out ... <br /> <br /> ... the superman Kryptonite does not have any effect on the rocks until he sees something green, but all that is clear in himself. That's why the continent is getting rid of the fear of its bright green rock ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />]
