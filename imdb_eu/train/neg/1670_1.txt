The movie's premise is horrible: when a woman plays a bar, she is pregnant when pregnant. <br /> <br /> But when the movie starts, an awesome start-up scene indicates that the C type is CIS-Fi television. movie Star Trek is a great and X-file, but it's boring. <br /> <br /> When the movie begins, it's planned and common. Science Fi Fi was a bad TV show with 2 parter looks. There is no suspense or no excitement, but not trying. There are many conflicts planned between the main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
