When we went to see this bomb, we expected something great. It's mostly Broadway theater. Music is awesome No movie memorable. Is not it a success from that movie? Because you do not have it. Some music numbers go on for a long time, I went to the bathroom and I got pop corn and I still got back! Good songs were good - but they suck. The rhythm is a horrible and horrible nature. He sang the leader, but as he sang songs, it was almost impossible to stand up. This movie has not done any harm to Broadway's lover. This is definitely a movie that I have seen throughout my life. Time and money on the waist. There is nothing memorable about this movie, except Danny Glover, the screen was not enough and he did not develop enough characters. Rent video and I agree. This movie was a polished and expensive dog.
