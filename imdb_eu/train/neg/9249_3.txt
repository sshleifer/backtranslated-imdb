When you're watching the movie, I do not know what to take. For a reason that a writer does not direct his work or even act on it, you can not do it all. I felt the story really felt in this movie because the director was wearing so much hat. Mrs. McTeer is a movie. To add to his amazing talents, why I had the portrait of that woman with her. Here is a British actress who can do anything. In my opinion, the conflict is what makes drama and a wonderful story. I felt that this film did not work. All the characters easily had everything, there were no barriers to getting something they wanted. See film for the sweetness, but especially for the great performance of McTee's lady.
