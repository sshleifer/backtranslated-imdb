From the beginning scene, it will be very hard to try to imitate the very intelligent and powerful "Cruel Intentions" and how they got flat. Likewise, you'll see the tremendous opportunity made by Robin Dunne Valmont for Valencia. In this second scene, we meet Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers in Kathryn and her mother's movie. That is to say, if you could not beat the blonde in the first film of Kathryn ... Then you see the romantic story a thousand and a half times, and Sebastian has warned that Anette has already met her in the past, called Danielle here, and Cecile, named here Cherie ... How original is this for a prequel? Then a low-budget "Wild Things" type of film becomes oh-my "twists". As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. It's a bad act, it's good ... It's just a charisma by Ryan. Amy Adams, who seems to me to be one of the youngest talents of our time, once again. But with all the talents of the world, there is no way to save this litter. In general, this "movie" feels like "Beverly Hills, 90210". Scores have been stolen "Krudel hearing" and "Jawbreaker" ... Yes, JAWBREAKER's score was used ... Can not just leave at least? You want to overcome this. For more Christians, see Stephen Frears 'Dangerous Liaisonsons'.
