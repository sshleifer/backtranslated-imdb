Bill Maher Religulous is not an organized religion. It is an attack on Christianity and Islam. In addition to the hilarious bundles of Sabin Rabbit's guessing Sabbath rules, it really does not attack Judaism, and seems angry when a Rabbi challenges the State of Israel. If Bill Maher's logical consequence follows his hypothesis, he realizes that Israel's creation of Palestinian territories is based on holy books of organized religion. This is the lack of absolutely absurdity and objectivity of the creation of his film objectivity. <br /> <br /> It is really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even the most intelligent. Everyone can go to a religious person and laugh and make stupid calls for their belief, but what should they offer you in return? He does not really say why he thinks they are stupid. What does a "rational" person in the room do? It reflects in a way how it is not really and in the process remains as stupid as these people. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie / documentary about religious ills, like religion can harm human civilization, see Richard Dawkins 'Root of All Evil of'? He is a brilliant and well-documented documentary, who wants to get it and how to clearly reflect it. <br /> <br /> No matter how funny Bill Maher's Religulous does, he does not ask about any questions or debate. The condemnation and horror of an elderly man who is not ashamed of Catholic education seems. I almost feel sorry for him.
