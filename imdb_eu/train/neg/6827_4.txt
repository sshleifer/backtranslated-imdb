Dumb's mute black comedy is unexpectedly very interesting. Essentially, Chris Klein, who is trying to keep the low profile, will eventually become a version of "The Three Friends", without any laughter. To play black comedy, not all "Play Dead" must be wonderful. Black comedy to work, can not mean "Play Dead" horrible. "Play Dead" is really a town with jobs. Fred Dunst, however, makes a fairly accurate imitation of the character of "A Simple Plan" by Billy Bob Thornton, Jake Busey makes quite a good imitation of Jake Busey. - MERK
