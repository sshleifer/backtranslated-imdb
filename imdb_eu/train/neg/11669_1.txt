I think it's nice and fashionable to see wonderful things in such an empty movie. In addition to the excessive excesses of some Hollywood movies, we can relax and explode explosion, bad language and solo liners. Minimalism has its place and it can be very effective when it is used correctly. However, this film is not one of those cases. <br /> <br /> Take long scenes with no conversations and rough and deep landscapes. I am sure that they have a lot of meaning and ideas, because there is a message in the statement. The performance is inadequate ... the pedestrian and bland ... worst tears of history (at the end of the film, at the end of it). It's a strange landscape, and the long, hilarious sequence of girls in the playground is nice with a tooth. I would call this anti-climatic, but the movie does not build on any climate ... because it's not a "erotic" scene ... it would be a lie. I'm sure it was a script used in the recording, but with the number of conversations, I think maybe it was written under the cocktail. Basically, this film does not offer any interest or wonder ... a perfect story, fantastic views, no visual drama, no excitement. In addition to two or three fun moments, the movie is lost two hours. Tragic and boring cinema.
