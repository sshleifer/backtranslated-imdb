There are a few things wrong with this film - one of these characters in the Song Song. I do not believe that the actress is a bad girl. Actually no. I think it gives bad lines. She supposes that she must be "a rich and rich girl", and despite the funny television shows that she plays, she can not even get rid of dry here here. <br /> <br /> Either way, I'd really have to know what to expect when I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was not so horrible ... at the beginning. Wendy's Shen's reaction was totally natural. I would like to say, how would you feel if a man was a supporter of being a reincarnation, he would have to wear a medallion and wear a medallion necessary to face the "bad world". This has moved me to another point. I know that this movie is completely fiction, but it's still in Chinese culture. On the Wendy family line all "warriors" seem to be women. Correct when I'm wrong, but I doubt that monks will agree. Of course, they might somehow work, but they did not give an explanation. In this way, Hollywood and the efforts made by the mass media helped many. <br /> <br /> <br /> Never say anything, let's continue. <br /> <br /> <br /> Becomes a Wendy character. unbearable film unbearable. Yes, he's a teenager and he's coming home ... I mean, who wants to fight against evil at home? The problem is that when "evil" begins to appear, Wendy does not seem to be terrified. It is very irresponsible, even someone like her. He continues to be in charge of his training. I will use this interview as an example, Shen: "If you do not win this fight, it will take the evil one and everything will go well." Wendy: "Whoa, talk about pressure. Well ... let's talk about something else." Yes, leave Wendy. Let's also go to dance properly with training. Of course, Shen allows him, but his character is an excuse. It is better for him to cooperate with him than he did, and he did not train and both would die. <br /> <br /> Oh, talk about it. Shen also told Wendy that his destiny was to kill him in battle, like his grandmother (I suppose that part). That's the undeniable Wendy's actions. <br /> <br /> Like Writer's writers, Wendy's house and "big fight" are in the exact date. Do you know what Wendy does? Need more guess? Yes, he finally goes to the battle, because trying to return home, the monks report that Shen was trapped in the body of his coaches and trainers because he "feels an old man". Shen only fights, so he saves. <br /> <br /> In the beginning we see a semi-decent fight, which is really fun. In the end, great wickedness comes from the body of the Wendy family, and creates a real reflection of these pieces of the ancient body of his warriors. <br /> <br /> Do not ask. <br /> <br /> However, Wendy is "overwhelmed". Then, Shen defends this guy, he forgot to forget his long Chinese name and kill him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < air. <br /> <br /> The title of that article cries out. <br /> <br /> Now ... Wendy was bad enough to be too powerful too far, too far. No, I will not allow forgiveness because he is "his destiny" and "within the power". <br /> <br /> Then he learned to heal? No, the worst ... would the people revive from time to time? So Shen is lifted up among the dead. Then, Wendy and the guy fighting him. <br /> <br /> It is easily lost. The worst part is jumped together and they are thrown at the same time and can be dragged forever. After that, the monks worshiped at the sacrifice of Wendy. <br /> <br /> Two things, # 1: is not it the writer and the director needs a "little more" fight? # 2: What a sacrifice? Was not it true for the return home? The girl did not break her sweat, or even less peeled. I mean, go now, this movie was TV PG, I wanted someone to hurt. <br /> <br /> Moving ah-ha ... Maybe I would give a play, based on my comments. A piece of criticism, you need to know, however, to break something. You do not necessarily try to look bad, but, if it's the case, pay attention. This movie is bad, but it's something fun that something you've never expected is really great. <br /> <br /> So I suppose it's OK. I would not say no good to see anyone.
