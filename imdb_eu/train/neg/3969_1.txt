I'm writing this because I thought I thought I'd think it was a good movie. Although I did not see the worst thing, it's not okay. <br /> <br /> Poor writing, acting and weak leadership. Although they can not afford to do great work, would it be much more to appeal to the actor more? It was painful to see the plain actor watching his movie with his comfortable work. The story was a clich√© and there was no script. Special effects were minimal. Here you can swallow the "trick" tricks that are repeated here. <br /> <br /> To be traced, Dark Remains is not like episodes of such masterpieces. But it is not yet matched with quality movies. It is only recommended for fans of horror lovers who do not want to miss any movie in this genre. Only Dark Remains. In the case of others, a much more valuable time should be spent - it should be very easy.
