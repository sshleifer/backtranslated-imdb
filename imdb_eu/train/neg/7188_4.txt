When I saw the title, I thought I'd get another to get another hip-slasher hard to get, but I actually found that "7eventy 5ive" is adequate enough to move to the 80s almost a bit after a heavy section. half the last minute to push the main impulse and endless police officers. There will not be a reward for its originality, as it can be systematically achieved, to steal and steal its thundercloud through emotions (usual cheap jump), location (solitary farm) and motivation in other films. Shiny management is done through the book, and considering that the material is quite riotous, it is made up of improper red corpusions, a plain and invaluable plot. Sometimes I'm horny, but, above all, I was entertained, especially because the violent attacks were fierce and horrible actions and some annoying universities by a psychotic killer with a sharp ax. The performances were not bad as a young spunky young man, but the characters that portrayed were not particularly attractive. Rutger Hauer, who is always present, is revealed as a gripping detective. A sharp base, but the rest of the surface is unforgettable.
