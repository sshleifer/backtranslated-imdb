I rented this film about 4-5 years ago and I was immediately disappointed. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see a B-movie slasher movie, but I ended up with a stuffy stuff for my eyes. The operation was to see the dry grass. I've seen a better performance in a softcore movie ... <br /> <br /> It crashed me into the idea of ​​leaving a crazy murderer out of nowhere. How was this a horror movie? <br /> <br /> The value of the production of this film was unmitigated. He was not afraid. A high school student earned a new Christmas camera. The earth had a whole place, if any. If you are bored with the horror movie you want to rent, jump out. B-movies are much better.
