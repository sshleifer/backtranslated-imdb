After leaving the popular television show "The Andy Griffith Show", Don Knotts tried to make a horrible movie star with comedic, but enjoyable vehicles. Unfortunately, "The Reluctant Astronaut", cheap ((most of them as Knotts' movies) is much worse than others. Don says a small town is admitted to the Schnook astronaut training camp ... but it is not a space travel candidate. They want their new conservative! Some people may say that the weak Satire Americans accuse fever after the culinary technology, but the film is just a shameless excuse to keep children unstoppable. Starts well, well-organized and with nostalgic locations, but increasingly silence and It's stupid. ****
