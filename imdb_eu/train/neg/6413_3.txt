My friends and I went into this movie to know what they expected us, but we were expecting the best. When we went out, the plot of the movie really made us more informed. Although I've never seen the movie I've ever seen, I definitely do not spend money on theaters. Maybe you can rent a friend (it's not worth the rent too) if you really want to see it. <br /> <br /> When a movie is so confusing you do not know what's wrong. In the last five minutes, there is no real defense. The play was honest, but it was a good idea to get out of this movie, and some shots were good, but the slogan and the slogan did not bother. really so bad, as soon as I came out, I went and bought the ticket to see a good movie to clear myself. I recommend that you jump to all of the first step, instead of seeing a good movie.
