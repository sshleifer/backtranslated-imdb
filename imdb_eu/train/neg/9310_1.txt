OK - This movie ADORE ... I credit this movie - only - that horror fanatic made me so hard. I could not see this movie anymore. I have heard a lot about the impact of theater on the original version, about the audience. Incredible masterpiece ... The horrible and psychological thing frightens my pants. Oh, kindly bless him, who made this wonderful movie. I love. I thought the whole film was decent and interesting. This movie is terrifying - it's a strange movie I've ever seen in my life! It's not what happens in the movie and the idea of ​​the movie is not terribly frightening, but it's always got me - Brendan's wonderful performance. The best horror movie EVER. Nothing ever was scary. Halloween is the most evil one.
