Like 'First Blood', it tries to make a point about the treatment of Viet Nam veterans, but there is no time to go for a lot of monotonous shooting, sunburning, structures, torture and explosions, just like Rambo is not half-hearted. Asian soldiers, tons of Vietnamese soldiers, most of the Russian army, to point to various vehicles and any other explosives. Only one female midfielder is bounced back, it allows testosterone to reach dangerous levels and scripts become a succession. Jerry Goldsmith, giving support, giving some music signals, controls all ordinary issues in a Russian rat, only from China's Ching-Chang-Chong to Cheng-Cheng-Chong, we do not understand who we were looking for. Stallon has a brain in his head; This pure nonsense is beneath him.
