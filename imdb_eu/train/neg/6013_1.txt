To date, I have read all the books left on the left, and the film does not do any justice. Of course, I saw worse films, but they were very disappointing. This movie would be a good part of MST3K. It was a great adaptation of the script book, and the actors read their lines, instead of saying it. The characters were hard and hard. The effects were cursed and they looked awful. The end was horrible. First, he did not even go to the first book. Second, it does not make sense. If you have not read the book, you do not know what you are doing. I was the favorite movie of a movie that I ever saw. I'm wrong to say that they paid the money for this movie. As a result of a miracle, if it gets a lot of liberation, it must be completely renewed and Hollywood should be taken. Two filmmakers and directors will be able to make movies for professionals.
