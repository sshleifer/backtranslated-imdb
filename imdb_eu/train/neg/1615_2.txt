Old-fashioned old Che Well, he ignored the interesting facts of Che's true nature. Sodeberg has the same boring narrative of Che's. The fascinate story of an Argentinian boy, who was so impressed by poverty, turned upside-down on the poor Robin Hood, who eventually killed the CIA. Yes, yes, what has been heard before, BORING AND UNTRUE! The reality of Che Guevara is very different and far more explosive! The events show that with a line of Messiah it was totally totalitarian, that the tyranny of Maoism would impose on the world. So, at the best time of the Cold War, the Soviet Union was a fanatic, I would ask the Soviet Union to be in New York, Washington or Los Angeles, and bring the end of the world. CHe asked Khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against US cities. Throughout his life he indicated that he was in the button on his finger, which he would push. Khrushchev retreated and literally rescued the world, and Angry Che was "angry". If Che's recommendations are continued, you should not read this review anymore. The homicidal maniac movie that became a pop icon became much more interesting. An incredible filmmaker has not dared Che to show off real-life aspects of Che's and after his media transformation. FILM YOU WOULD BE WON! I thought I'd make independent films REAL RISKS and GROUNDBRAKING! "Anti-cultural issues," "Che cool," "Wall Street bad," "Republican = Nazi", "Bush ex-Hitler" are only stuck, "NRA is worse than the KGB", Christians are fanatical and stupid. "etc. Nauseum ... Oooh, how daring, how to make headlines: Three anti-mainstream and edgy, I would like to have some true cojones and I want to face the Independent Cinema Oligarch! It would be really daring!
