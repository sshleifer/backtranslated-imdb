I do not know if Carpenter wants to ask questions about abortion, and his wife is really rich and obvious that he should have abortion if he has Satan, but he is dragged. Ron Perlman is wild. The baby looks very stupid, especially when the crab is mounted on the baby's head. You can see pretty material on Satan's clothes. What's wrong This episode has five minutes of stories and 55 minutes of tedium. Very, very bad. And the end is ridiculous. After learning to kill the baby, the devil destroys the abortion clinic and kills everyone, bloody, bloody, shameless? NO! He puts his head down and leaves the room. Amazing.
