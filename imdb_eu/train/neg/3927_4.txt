A horror story of a luxurious Brooklyn building that hides hell doors. It is reminded of what is called "Tenant" by Polansk ("Sentinel"), but it is far from the film of Polish filmmaker. "The tenant" was so disturbing that the "Sentinel" was not at all. <br /> <br /> This cast is more striking about this movie: with the great names of American cinema (Burguess, Gardner). , Wallach), veteran actors for food (I think). <br /> <br /> Judgment: it's not fun. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
