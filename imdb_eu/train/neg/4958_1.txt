The characters were completely erroneous, not only by stealing their voices, but also by writers, they should be taken seriously, but the drawings are not only raw, but it seems mostly created in 1-6 years. The only episode I've ever seen in this show was "A wonderful family", I liked Robin. And sometimes I think it's a general copy of Batman The Animated Series. For example: in BTAS, Bruce is a friend of Harvey Dent? It becomes more than two story episodes, two fashionable, TwoFace. Bruce is a friend of "Show" on "Ethan Guy," and in more than two story episodes, ClayFace is unlikely to meet. It was a small example (maybe it's not true), but ultimately Batman is one of the biggest attempts at a series. And that says something.
