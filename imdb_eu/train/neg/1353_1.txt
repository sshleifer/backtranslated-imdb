What is that? It is a mish-mash of strange repetition motifs (Snails, Shirley Temple, Swastika, and others, which have a racist music), immersed in any narrative or plot or character development. The whole thing called myself consciously called "a terrific show", and I do not mean that only the unusual decisions of the questionnaire. Acid fever is a bad journey, which can be overcome by any drug level, with Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie that Eraserhead (the second less-liked movie) can compare, was much more depressing, but I still found what it is? full waste of time One thing is to see the inner workings of someone else, even though the consciousness of a chemically modified one of another, but also that it tells me that it's just something curious.
