If you have watched other such films, it might be better. Omega man finds himself out. Due to the credit of the studio, the great technological budgets that the film's films have avoided are unnecessary. In addition, training and premise were excellent: we avoid four people who are almost irrelevant to the past and try to avoid getting rid of serious infectious disease infections. It's a bad thing, otherwise! I'm tired of a stupid, careless, bad, efficient and proud person in a movie. At this time, all the films are described. I rented it and they cried out on television repeatedly, "No, do not do it!", "Why you're so stupid," "Look!", Etc. The true lack of personality is evident in the middle. A movie will give you at least a strong personal connection with some characters to take care of what's going on. This is not. It should also fill more movies and more.
