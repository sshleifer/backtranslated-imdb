This film began with a brilliant start. It was really potential to turn into a sad and romantic love film with "Harlan" and the love between Tobe with long, poetic and idyllic scenes. It really was not to be more than this, and for a moment I was excited for someone to end up making a beautiful movie, a classic of his time, perhaps a modern myth. Why, why then mix in the middle, the main character (Norton) doing another psychological psycho? I may not miss out on this, but do we really need another movie about psychosis? Or is this need in Hollywood to illustrate the human nature's illness as a misunderstanding of the film industry? For a moment I informed him of the name of the director; now I feel indifferent. In the defense of the film, at least one added that the actors were invested in their roles. Similarly, Evan Rachel Wood looks very beautiful and has a great potential with a good actor.
