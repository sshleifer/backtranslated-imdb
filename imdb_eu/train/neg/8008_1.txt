Daniel Auteuil, "Margot queen" was much better. For Nastassja Kinskir, 'Paris, Texas' was much better. Chris Menges ("CrissCross" and "A World Apart" can not compare), and Goran Bregovic's use of a "version of the same theme" by "Margot Queen" ("Attention to"). end of the film). Had it been an American pop movie, I would not feel sorry; But for a European film for an independent actor and a European director, a common overview of the abuse of children is very original and very unpleasant. There are bad people kidnapping and selling minority children. People who sell people hate each other and are waiting for someone to save themselves. And lastly, this great hero, who is bad bad, to kill all the boys, and these poor children save bad men. Each character is shown in simple black and white words: good and evil. Also, from the outset, I understood how to end the story. Is the story of sexual abuse against childhood terminated? I think the problem of childhood and the difficult problems of pedophilia are much more complex in how this is a very unusual movie. I think this movie is not disturbing, but very disappointing.
