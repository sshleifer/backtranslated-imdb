Maybe it's dubbing, or maybe weeping, the cries or the folks who follow it are endless, but I believe Europe is one of the most (and therefore annoying) films I have ever seen in Europe. The film begins with great promise at the beginning, because Ingrid Bergman's mother is busy with her son (Sandro Franchinaia) with the time of spoiled girls. Mum and dad (Alexander Knox Gentle), despite the fact that guests are entertained in a diner, tries to kill themselves, moving Bergman to a pile of poverty and pity for the poor. Thanks to the publisher of the newspaper Communist Andrea (Ettore Giannini), she soon extends the abuse of men with her husband. Bergman plays the role of saints, repeating Joan Arko's 1948 functions, and Rossellini is making a great job and shooting with the best picture. Unfortunately, the script strikes the point of shaking his point at home, as Andrea and Mother alternate Marxist and Christian prayers. In the last scene of soaked tears, I had more than my confusing nature. The real step towards Rossellinora moved away from Neorrealism and the Flowers of St. Francis in 1950 He took mythical and mystical themes called Francis.
