The first movie is not a comedy; If you really do not force yourself, you are almost lazy. Second, the movie is slow and boring. Playing is not bad, but not unique. Lucky Luke is a comic book about two families (a big nose and a big ears) fighting each other in a small town ... you will laugh a lot if you read this, if you waste this time. Religions and dogmas are not the best source for a good comedy and this film only confirms this rule. There is a similar theme comedy entitled '' Home teachers ''; This moment was good. It's my final comment: do not waste your time and money to see this film inspired and boring.
