<br /> <br /> This film surpasses what the 6-star average has achieved for me. The script is so strange and, in truth, an insult to all its life. Cinematography comes directly from the world of advertising world, and talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed. However, Demi Moore is not surprised to take part in this film if he looks at his track list. In short, Don Simpson is also a "great concept" that would be shameful.
