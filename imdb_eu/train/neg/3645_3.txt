A young man gets his hair on a bad day, he gets out on a hill and can not run away. Then, Mr. ATLAS, a 2000-year-old "mythological friend" like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Herculean force helps the boy to compromise and adapts to modern life later. So what's great? This is the most sincere idea for the "family" departure! In any case, this should not be tried at all, really! Perhaps the fictitious nature of the force is nothing more than a typical stranger who appears in the ordinary universe of the universe. Adding evil does not add anything or something unattractive and tries to recognize violence as "family" without knowing it before. Even though Atlas is a gaggling scene that fights his fired man. Spend a pleasant and pleasant afternoon for the park to change.
