It started with an interesting premise. I always like the Civil War and ancient social secrets. The longer the movies progressed, the more I realized that B was a movie. In the latter half, he quickly became a C movie, then D, then F, then "This is not a rental I want to be put in the microwave!" I can not say that acting in all cases is horrible, most of them. Writing, however ... I have never read the book. Maybe the book is well-written. The script is 10 years old. It was nonsensical, a rough and interesting conversation, as interesting as a 5-kilate fertilizer bag. I really hate this movie, with my wife too. I am a Christian and I have no problem with films that promote or support Christianity. This film caused great wickedness. Fantastic, horrible, useless. If you like, I recommend Superman 4.
