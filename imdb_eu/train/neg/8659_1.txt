I can never understand some things. Like this movie. What would happen to Mayon Dino and crocodile polygons make a really cheap and inexpensive model and then cramp and paste them into the same amateur video clip that people scream and eat? How can you think that a totally false CGI dinocroc is completely out of context, how could the events of this film be affected? I know that B-grade, low budget and producers, but producers, could not see it better than doing a piece of chips that they have not seen or seated. It does not make sense. Are people really so stupid to sit through it? It seems so. Laughter No, that is not a matter of laughter.
