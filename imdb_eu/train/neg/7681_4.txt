Sean, I know you are the main actor in the world, but I can not recommend it. Comedy is just your powerful suit. <br /> <br /> However, it is not your fault. It has been hard to understand a few things. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you should ask where the lines came from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Once again, Sean ... Sorry.
