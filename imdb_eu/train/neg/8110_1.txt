Phillip Kaufman wrote the cliff notes after reading Kunder's novel and then completing this movie. Okay, of course, it will not be the original hole. Kundar's novels are the concept of narrative, because of the ability to detach from the stories he builds. This movie has not tried! Tereza's dream sequence, the atmosphere of the book is very important, rebuilds and makes no sense. Similarly, and this, perhaps, is a smaller point, Daniel Day-Lewis Ben looks much like this (I know it's not a really valid complaint, but well). An excellent example of Hollywood's other fine arts literature.
