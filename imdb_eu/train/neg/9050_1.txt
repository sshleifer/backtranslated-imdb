I watched this movie as a whole in the 1960s and 70s. Yes, it's horrible, and it could be the father of the "series of the 80's and 90's deaths". In these days, considering the status of "driver education", this should be seen for anyone who is willing to drive. When you see violent death with fear and fear, you will definitely get a better perspective on the necessary responsibilities to safely drive (without any sensitivity). Bell Telephone worked in the 70s and 80s and was assigned to make a security class at one point. I found this movie at the company's library, I showed it in the session, people had to be physically ill and they had to leave the room! Mostly, most of them said later: "I never had a car accident so huge!" This movie, and another "RED ASPHALT", is a reality in its graphic form. I will never forget, I have found a copy only when my children "learned the driver" when they were studying at high school!
