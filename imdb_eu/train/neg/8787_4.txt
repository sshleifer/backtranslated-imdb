When I saw the TV ad I heard about Noise White. Until then I did not know it existed. I saw the online trailer and decided to see and go. Now, being a fan of movies like Sixth Sense, I thought that I would give everything I wanted. Michael Keaton holds up and rocks. Unfortunately, the movie has not given. Sixth Sense or Echo Move to be another and failed miserably. The start is hopeful, but in the middle it is repeating itself and the monkey completes a complete twist. Unfortunately, as in most of the "Scary" movies, today's noises and rumors are based on the audience to jump. This movie could be a lot more. Pity is a good idea.
