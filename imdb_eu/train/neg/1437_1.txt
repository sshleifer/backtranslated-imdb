I missed the first 10 minutes of the movie, but I do not think it would be different from the beginning. The movie seemed very boring to me and I was disappointed with the actor. I remember Patrick Swayze and other actors (such as Roy Marsden) in prominent roles, but everyone is disappointed with this very weak script here. "Kind Solomon's Mines" ... The short part of the "mines" film was exciting to see paint dry paint, and I doubt that a pre-school child would be spell-free. "warriors". The movie was reminded of the American TV series cheaply produced. Get Indiana Jones Every Day!
