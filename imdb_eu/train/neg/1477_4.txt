I have watched Dolemita and also (Avenging) Disco Padrinoa, other great works by Blaxploitation of his friend Rudy Ray Moore. This film, The Human Tornado (Dolemite 2), will always have a special place in my heart. Goofiness, lack of skill in film production and absolute excitement (True a little too much), The Human Tornado can not be led. <br /> <br /> Sets the scene to the opening scene. Our old friend Dolemite is confronted with a white woman, some local police raiders are attacking the house for no reason, and you should not know! In bed, Dole's wife is just the wife of the serfia. When he saw his cry: "Make me!" Dolmen's cry: "Are you & $ * @ $ authentic?" Subtlety was never his strength. <br /> <br /> Highlights? A cameo with a very young Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters fame), constant flaws (the characters are looking for one direction, and the next one is shooting Dolemites suit in every nightclub) and Queen Bee in demonic. his first scene eyes. <br /> <br /> But the real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore. Did he really think that he looks like this wonderful movie? Certainly, I do not know why, but you have to admire the excitement that has been. If you're going to leap out of the abyss completely, or if you're bothered with your notebook, for example: Quickly! In my cave, my mother wants $ @ @ (% and I'm leaving her grave), it's definitely going by boat, kung fu At any time, it shoots at high speed at high speed, but in the afternoon it slows Rudy to let his teeth stop, such as the fact that it was stretched as a movie effect or as it seemed to be fast, however, it's not "Matrix." > <br /> The Human Tornado, like the original Dolemita, is an incompetent film with a huge proportion, but at least it's fun and it's definitely the effort you have to make the effort to the people, do not get that much. Enjoy my good recommendations.
