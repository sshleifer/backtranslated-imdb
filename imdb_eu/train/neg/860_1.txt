He comes across Kubrick King. I remembered it in the spring of 1980, I remember. Then the movie came out and Kubrick cultists have been king since King Cultists. <br /> <br /> King Cultists say Stanley Kubrick took a great horror story and ruined it. Kubrick's writers do not curse the story of King. They talk about Steadicams, tracking shots, camera angles. This is a movie, they emphasize: it must be considered on its own. As it happens, they are two straight camp. Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> If we only see King's adaptation of the novel, "The Shining" failure, a useless choice, is a series of false narratives. <br /> <br /> I'm guilty of the Kubricken scriptwriter. The writer Diane Johnson (Le Marriage, L'Affaire, Le Divorce, etc.) is a novice socialist. Perhaps he was chosen for the understanding of his or her husband's family or family dynamics. But the blue collar Sidewinder (Colorado) does not exist in a map of the Franklin universe. <br /> <br /> Probably Kubrick Anglophile found it pleasing. He, of course, is a real author. And considering his merits, the script of "The Shining", with abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernatural, and impregnated reincarnation, simply does not deal with logical analysis. <br /> <br /> I want to consider Kubric's "Shining" in its conditions. Although I want to take something different than the usual horror movie genre. Yes, however, he does not get isolation, alienation and insanity as a naturalistic study. In the same way, movies are pretty far away. <br /> <br /> Are the horrors of the Overlook Hotel? Or do they only exist in the head - first as a promising nightmare by small Danny Torrance, as the hallucinations of his father? One realizes Jack Torrance is looking for a mirror every time he speaks "ghostly." The labyrinth of the hotel's topiary cover is known to be symbolized by the harsh and shiny Jack's psyche. Very deep things. <br /> <br /> But Overlooked "ghosts" are mere statements of growth of Jack Torrance's madness, which leaves the person who captured the Jack hotel out of the kitchen cabinet closet. Can he carry on his permanent rampage that exploits his ax? <br /> <br /> And someone can explain, with a straight face, Nicholson's "1921" black and white label as the party -The most coming out of the left field and reaching the hotel room wall in the closing seconds of the movie? Did we conclude that Jack Torrance Bad Craziness had a certain experience of "past life"? (And if you think that people recovered are thinking of having their own physical replicas in the past?) Maybe Kubrick did not care about his story. Maybe he wanted to remember a horror mood. In any case, the film wants to cover its narrative bets - it has two ways, rational and supernatural. As a result, the story is wrong. This movie has not improved with age, and it certainly does not improve through magazines. <br /> <br /> I do not deny fear, claustrophobia and scattered moments of a horrible general. feature film But those bloody elevators who have been watching over and over again, in Danny's little conjectures, are absurd and ridiculous. Jack Torrance's bad lines label ("Wendy, I'm home!" And "Heeeeeere's JOHNNY!") The movie puts a dramatic tension on its narrative energy. (I know: I sat in the theater and the audience laughed at comic reliefs: "Whew! We're glad we did not take this thing seriously!") Finally, Kubrick is totally seedy or completely cynical. Wendy in scenes surrounding empty hotel while trying to get his husband to purple his son. A foyer full of mummy guests at Atondo, all seated on the dead? Yikes, now I'm scared. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < to want. The screening of Shelley Duvall, as a female version of Don Knotts's "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken", is the best silent. <br /> <br /> This film is not successful, not as an adaptation, not on its own. It is probably worth 10 out of 10, but I give it 1 because it has been very enjoyable in this forum.
