This show is dull, sloping, and essentially removes several things to make it "original". First: animation is so ugly ... Johnny Terrible ... and all of us are annoying. Both twins are like Dexters, "Dexter's Lab," and Johnny is almost like Dee Dee, more intelligent than "Dexter's Lab." Gagak is crisp and I'm not forced to laugh at anything ... especially when it comes to fun. I only saw two sections, but I only activated them. <br /> <br /> Thirds: The whole song of the song begins to extract "American Idiot" in the Green Day. And I do not have much to do with that team, they are going to take the same initial melody and then subtly change them to be their own. <br /> <br /> At the point ... it can be boring. 1/10
