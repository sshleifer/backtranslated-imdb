I have had two reasons to watch Swashbuckler yesterday on Danish television. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I was not disappointed. She looked pretty. Secondly, as a result of the film, I appeared to be absurd humor that could be found in the films of Philippe de Broca. That's why I was unfortunately disappointed. I found the jokes to be predictable (not only were there any wrong notes about the war issue) and the characters were completely unimportant. Also, the action scene was surprisingly mechanical and inspirational, without dramas. I finished watching until the end, but I got bored very quickly and sat down, watching Lollobrigida's scenes.
