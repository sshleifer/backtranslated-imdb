If it was not the worst film to get out of Britain in the 80s. <br /> <br /> A story about a middle school teacher who seduces two teenage babies and their nonsense nonsense. There's no need to get rid of it. <br /> <br /> At the same time free, puerile, uncouth and unrealistic, this film plumbs deeply fails miserably for its fun, provocative, intellectual and controversial attempts. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie is the way in which strict writers George Costigan, Michelle Holmes, and Siobhan Finneran have written hard work. It's not surprising that Andrea Dbar's latest work was the only way to access the screen. Burning and burning at all levels.
