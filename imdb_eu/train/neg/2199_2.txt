I shot "Sorrows Lost" at the New York Film and Video Festival, and I think I had a lot of hope in this movie. Unfortunately, it's just a Visual FX card. The story is pretty lame. Bad lighting and camera work, editing and doing less than beautiful music seems to be of low quality. <br /> <br /> It's really overwhelming that FX shorts have better stories and have the rest. The technical production will be equivalent to FX! You can not escape FX with short films, for more than 5 years there have been a great joke. At least short, fresh and a bit fun! That does not mean "Sorrows Lost".
