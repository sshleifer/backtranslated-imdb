The film starts with a voice to tell the audience about who they are and what their characters are. And that's when I started to like the movie. With all the endless possibilities that the filmmaker can access, it seems really easy and cheaper to express this situation with the voice. I truly believe that voices are betrayal of the concept of the film. <br /> <br /> I will be glad to hear where we are, the date we are saying, and especially what people feel and think about. I think a manager must find a way of seeing feelings and personal thoughts to the audience. <br /> <br /> But after a bad start, a very big movie begins and continues for a long time. The bourgeois family and all the members of the individual are realistically represented. The director thinks I have talent to get real life situations. For example, the father who needs to make his private calls from the bathroom seems to be awesome at first, but life itself brings us some habits, but it is normal. I think the director is a good observer of true life. <br /> <br /> But that's it. Shortly afterwards, the film begins to sacrifice real-life story telling. I really felt a huge headache due to the characters that are not speaking. The actors and the actress were able to improvisate and improvised them. They are really realistic, but the characters are "really, it's the case", always asking me together, or if the characters say "no" or "you're listening", it's only enough to say ten times that I have a headache. <br /> <br /> I also think that I have more scenes to play plays and books. I understand that the movie theater and the book are related to the plot, but I think the director has lost the point he needs to stop the exhibition of these scenes.
