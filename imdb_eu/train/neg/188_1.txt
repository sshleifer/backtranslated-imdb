This movie has beautiful landscapes. Unfortunately, there's no plot. There must be a conflict in a plot. This movie was not there. He spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to put into action anymore. It is an artistic image but the basics of telling stories do not pay attention to them. <br /> <br /> If you love Montana landscape and fly fishing, this movie is not worth a story. There is not one.
