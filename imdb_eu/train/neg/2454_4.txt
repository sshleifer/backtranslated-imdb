I have not seen the movie for a while, so I have not thought about being a very accurate one ... It has got some interesting points. Ralph Bakshi J.R.R The essay of an animated adaptation of the Tolkien's masterpiece was a very ambitious project, so ambitious, that it failed at a moment of production. So in the middle of the second trilogy book (it's never a sort of suggestion of a sequence) it stops violently somewhere, it seems less than the movie's ending. It seems that some of the characters were animated and others were shot, but it can be said intentionally or not. The whole thing is strictly done and dissolved, especially Orcs and Nazgul. Another problem, of course, is the large gaps in the plot. Bakshi ran to finish this movie, and in a way, he waited for a book and half later in two hours (Peter Jackson's new trilogy takes place during this time). Outside (and I'm not only referring to Tom Bombard, it seemed to me pretty in that book but it seemed stinking in a movie). And, of course, the end, the sudden and the place. I am not sure that Bakshi was originally planning to finish the movie or, even though, what would end up being an idea? <br /> <br /> <br /> Characters ... well, most were good. . The hobbies do not look so bad (except Sam Gaya. Did you know that the new trilogy producers originally wanted to be a Sam a pretty woman.) like me), watch this movie (although I'm not sure if I can buy it for sale. What special features does DVD versions have?) But before you know that you will not see a real 'Lord of the Rings. The movie, but it's not much more than historical curiosity, seems to be much better than in the 60's version, the Beatles would continue (I think it would be quite cool psychedelic LOTR, George's idea was thrown out. Gandalf, Paul Like Frodo, like Ringo Sam and John Gollum.) If you do not read the book or I do not like it much or you do not like animation movies or if you do not want to see a semi-finished movie ... stay away.
