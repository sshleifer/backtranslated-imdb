Sorry, this movie is just a cheap TV production. I saw a lot of promotional materials and I watched professional films like "Stormriders". A little budget movie was presented as "XENA" or "Hercules" on TV. It's not a very boring atmosphere, the battle scenes are worse. Some good ideas - no more. I hope this will be a chance to make a movie like this and I can show you the next movie. <br /> <br /> My ASIA tips: "MUSA - GUERRERA", "ACTORS", "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry my bad English!
