People who are watching this movie is already worried about the head. This movie does not have to be related to Jack The Ripper (as you thought) with his other B, an electronic assembly. Sometimes sexual scenes in some sex scenes, before splatting on a nearby tree. It's not terrifying, funny or funny. If you feel like no plot of land, see Cabin Fever, at least the director does not sleep asleep while he runs this crap. Look at this if you do anything completely of life, and the only thing on television with Oprah Winfrey crying on television.
