Congratulations, when I first appeared for myself, I had the time to check the timer. I was very surprised. Animation and horror films have a common base: the attention of the selected audience must be correct for 90 minutes. Nothing more, and you will lose a bigger audience. <br /> <br /> In its first minute or 20 minutes this has been a serious problem for me. I would say that half of this movie can change, but I would be generous to say that. Go ahead and see and tell me how many scenes can be edited, even if it's not the main movie. <br /> <br /> Despite being a debated visit, the movie was smaller. All this time, this great mystery called "elite 10" continues, which kills other friends. In most cases, they not only surpass, but they increase their face and they say "that guy! No! This is Gal!" The more time you spend the camera will deceive you than to really enjoy the movie. And do not bring me up. <br /> <br /> Okay, that's it. I had to laugh at first, Melissa Sue Anderson, trying to remember the mysterious blind man of the Little House on the Prairie (which later proved to be my direct suspicions), seemed completely blind to this movie. Strange, as an established actress, had to be the best of the band, but it was the worst. The rest of the staff, apart from Ann (Bregman), was very bad, but he took the cake. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a group of ten people, and it will die immediately. off Almost no one thinks of "friendliness" by the two friends, and they continue happily. Gradually, faster, there are some revelations from Virgini (Anderson), the main character, the past and his psychologist, who are a bit more personal (AND ON CALL 24/7, apparently) than most of them. In the meantime, more and more deaths occur. <br /> <br /> What is fun, like the first "disappearance", "the best children" disappear, and the rest is less and more careful. Without a doubt, they give a few seconds of air. "Wow, (that person) would not run", but then they will return to their sexual ways. And, according to that, it's probably a terrifying screenplay, and maybe I was losing interest in 30 minutes, but it was really hard for me to have sex with the likes of our teammates. Next, or another, the other, MAX would freaked the next scene. SEE: I had a mouse / mouse in the pocket that had a terrible guy? literally ?? and it was the clearest suspect. I give too much credit to the film (and time), but I never knew how to become "elite 10". <br /> <br /> But, digressing, it's a mystery here. Why are children's goals? Why does somebody think that Virgini's death has never been proved when she has never seen (until "the end") that one of them has died? And why would the trailers and posters be released "six of the greatest murders ever seen?" Hell, even in 1981, most of them showed the 13th of the first Friday on Friday? Coincidentally, on Friday, in the second half, they gave me 2 years, together with the birthday of Congratulations. Maybe they talked about it a month ago, but they came late, well, the party. <br /> <br /> When "Secrets" are revealed, trust me, you will have to postpone 3 -4x reasons to get some pretty and inconsistent reasons, and then put subtitles for all the mockery of the victim / killer. The first time you get it, it's a wonderful and hilarious end. It's worth it to see the whole movie again, but as a drinking game. <br /> <br /> This birthday encounter needs to be avoided. Is the first sketch script horrible and non-logical? Please be aware that before the camera role plays a great deal of rewriting, acting in different ways or more than acting and 100% realist reacts to how people react in great situations. <br /> <br /> Side note: When I was a child or 10-11 years old, I love horror movies. (Still oddly. Accurate guilty practices, but increasingly difficult to see during years of passing). We got our first video player, and I recorded a lot of horror movies on the network (or EDITION VERSIONS) from the TV. I remember Happy Birthday to Me all the last 10 minutes getting it on the tape, which frightens me death? and, of course, the great mystery of the murderer. Although I've seen other clips of this movie, I think I've had this first long time. Fortunately, this horrible movie did not hurt me as a child. I'm older now and I can take this litter. But never. Again. <br /> <br /> Second Note 2: As mentioned above, the final credits (and as many scores) this "Happy Birthday Mass" still makes me awful. I think this movie (or a few minutes later) has had a great impact on my childhood. Pena, Melissa Sue Anderson!
