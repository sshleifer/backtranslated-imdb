John Candy. Should we tell more? This is the main reason to watch this movie. Most people do not realize how much they offer as an actor. Bad review is changing. We only have a simple and subtle change of face. There are a lot of curious pieces in this movie and they are very curious. The best moments for me are KUNG FU U scenes, as well as the great moment that John goes up to the stage and how much he loves talking about, that is, how many genitals he loves his girlfriend. I'm sure reading this sequence seems to be very raw. It is but very funny, especially, John Candy is doing this bit. In general, the story is quite lame, and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (two former students of Candy SCTV) are not enough in the film. Levy has her moments, especially at the end of the wedding filming (think Rod Serling) and the excellent scene with her mother talking on the phone. In general, if you have had a good movie today and you have to put the brain stupid. I gave it from 10th of these.
