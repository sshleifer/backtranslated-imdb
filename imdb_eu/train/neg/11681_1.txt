The trailers were better than movies. What talents and money loss? I'd wait for this movie on the DVD for at least $ 9. The movie block completely fails. It could be a GREAT movie for all actors, at best it was a B movie. The film moved very slow and I thought I would go somewhere, it almost did, but then it was not. In today's age, it is impossible to see plots and closures in the apparent film, and this film does not offer them. It's very good to know how suspicious everyone is, but it's not sure how it was directed, lighting, delivering lines, typing or whatever, but there was nothing. There is no profit. I was very disappointed in this movie, and I did not say anything. The entire saxophone music worsened in the film. And the end was not related to the rest of the film. What a despair
