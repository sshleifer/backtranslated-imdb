The standard procedure for today's Swedish films seems to be credible in the window and the process to follow from that path. RÃ¥narna is a great example of a sensible movie. <br /> <br /> Stockholm Bank steals the robbery by an effective "military style" group. The police began to investigate the case that makes the police more difficult than before. <br /> <br /> Like the usual Swedish movie, the same person once again and again has been thrown out. Mikael Persbrandt must be in every Swedish filmmaker in recent years! However, I think that Persbrandt is a little solid here (as usual). The problems of this film are based primarily on the story. Theft is first, especially if it feels like a background. This is a movie about a young policeman struggling to prove themselves in the male world (so it has not been done a thousand times before Helena instead of acting actors). At the same time, the endless atmosphere that seems to be as credible as the landing of Aliens is incredible. But, however, I thought it was very nice considering I had slept there. He stung a bit of things (and he actually saved his rating for another step). <br /> <br /> Eventually, the main problem occurs with other Swedish films. Action and suspense does not depend on the rules we use in other types of movies (most of Hollywood). Comparing it it feels cheap and pretty weak. In my opinion, Swedish filmmakers should try to focus on plot and acting and now they are trying to do some work like "Hollywood-action light". Because the Swedish film industry becomes an unforgettable effort. I value 3/10.
