Well, I can say about that movie, it's very good to see Asian faces. I did not like it about the movie, the breed characters achieved their stereotypes in their role. An Asian girlfriend of confidence needs to play another person, she decides to leave behind the white woman who was strictly in love with the Asian culture and left the white world on the yellow line and the "real keep" in a black taxi driver. Additionally, all cokas, shanghai tang and dunk donuts have been very prominent in the product locations. The plot of the story was fun, but I thought it was a lot more story. Once again, when you're not expecting much more than just watching romantic comics, I could be surprised at least once again. Parents are the best part of the movie.
