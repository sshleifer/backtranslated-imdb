I live a black man black. That said, I have important doubts about Tyler Perry's work. I know people feel that they need to praise there, because they are black and I try to figure out a positive image about culture. But honestly, I think that Perry White's film was NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson during their ass. <br /> <br /> I was shocked by this movie. Many recently and repeatedly repeated inspections boil my blood. The characters are badly written and dramatized. The jokes are so bad, I really need to say something fun. I will break this great Sh-t battery. <br /> <br /> Madea = suck. The character may have appeal, but it does not exist anymore. It seems that the only thing that ever does threatens children and adults with violence, which is useless. It is not necessary. <br /> <br /> His wife's wife, fiancé, won. If a woman's fear of her husband is so frightened, why would she escape when she sleeps in bed. Was there any sense of quitting when he was in work? In any case, the characters in this arch were so annoying and energetic that I did not expect to be thrown out of the balcony and never again. <br /> <br /> <br /> Then there are two lovers of the moon. A bus driver asks the woman while they are making the rounds. I could not believe it. I really could not believe it when he agreed to tell him more. But a mega bitch was dragged down by an adult man throwing unusual stones in a window and sending notes like ten years ago. I do not use this term clearly, but the woman has only two ways. Excellent victims and psycho mother. However, what he showed both of these faces, however, was a constant. The bus driver was not reached. His wife did not even get married - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then there's a family reunion scene. Here we have implicit taboos of the implicit charge of mom, grind grinding, shirt, muscular, b-ball, and taste of Maya Angelou. When these children dragged their campaigns and called the meeting, I was mistaken to ask the oldest of them to give up. Crafty makes everything happening in that meeting, easy and easy to distinguish the team, and then they call a bell. When they do that, everyone drops what they are doing and heads out when they talk with the stern, like Pavlov's dogs - WTF !! <br /> <br /> Then you have the last five minutes of the movie. We have seen that there is an abusive fiancé visible around her victims and unlucky actors. An improvised wedding is dressed as an angel in black and hanging on the ceiling - WTF !!! The only reason you can see it until now, in addition to your threshold to test your pain, the second evil part of this story will also be delivered to your ass. Guess what, it does not happen. Instead, Perry is challengingly challenging and surely plays down the tone of forgiveness of the movie - WTF! <br /> <br /> I'm sure if I give it for a day, it would probably have to write a doctoral thesis to peel the movie. Do not start with Tyler Perry's other films. I will say this. In my opinion, as a black man, D.W. Griffith's legacy lives. Irony is done through a black man who does it, by doing the birth of a birth, who sells us down the river. I'd like to get Perry's movie just like dudes. Thanks, dude !!
