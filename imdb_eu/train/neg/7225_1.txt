I sat down by this movie and I have to say that they have only managed to keep my attention. The movie would be more convenient if you do not have to see a horrible CGI, if you want to use CGI for reference in industry, let's see what you need to avoid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems. This supposes a graphic novel on the screen, but I saw that it was a bad movie that did not seem to have any graphic novel. <br /> <br /> In the end, the story was not as bad as CGI. I was very impressed with the play, and I thought it was a good question, and that I had little character information I would be pleasant to be something confusing for me sometime, but it's not surprising, as I said, that I kept paying attention, but I would like to lose it.
