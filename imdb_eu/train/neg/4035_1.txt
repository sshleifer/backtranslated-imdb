In the parade (even a small one like this) I would like to rain, but the first scene was said to be the beginning of the movie that was completely shameless. It's really a shame, I like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I noticed that they were mixing together with the cinema, but for me, I do not even have a scene together! I think they need to repeat it - The two main actors (adjoining advertisements and DVD azaleas) did not have a single scene together! They did not talk together and never appeared on the screen at the same time. It summarizes roughly a bad excuse for a movie. False advertisement. <br /> <br /> The conversation was painful; Every character in the film is not realistic, and not as a human being. The scenes were very scarce, the plot was rough, the jokes were thin, Freeman was trying harder to be fun (and Tim was home-run at the office), no one was pleasant, and the worst were some characters. he was almost annoyed that he was almost annoyed, because I can not see it or I can not hear them. <br /> <br /> This little stinker budget was an empty epic. Although Danny Dyer could not inject any kind of humor and charm, he blessed it. Waste time <br /> <br /> In any case this movie is a way of evaluating 'ten stars'. Ten star Really Let's go ... I have not given up ten of the greatest stars, because ten stars mean it's a great movie. This movie was not very perfect, almost the opposite, that is, it was almost totally horrible. <br /> <br /> If you want to look, but if you've watched a lot of movies and you've seen a lot of great movies, it's probably similar to my review. <br /> <br /> 1/10
