This was awarded to all fans of "winning all" winners of the "two companies" (World Wrestling Federation and "Alliance"): the WCW first and the ECW supermarket. It's the last game because it's the top company. It was a team of tag team that fought the fighters ringed on either side of the ring; Each fighter concludes that to weaken his opponents and to increase the match, interference is necessary. punch, run a special move, and a partner's labels. The previous line was that Vince's underlayer watched a member of Allance be passionate about entering the WWF. Overall: the story is very innovative but bad execution, that is, the shortage of fighters because the format of the game is a tag team. The other games are bored: <br /> <br /> Edge versus T est: "big boot" powerful Test, but this does not show both real stars talent stars <br /> <br /> Al Snow Versus Christian: good matches but audiovisuals <br /> Taji and William Regal: the worst nightmare <br /> <br /> Immunity Battle Royal: seeing it was very fun, but the main characters of both companies take part in the main event They had only a fighter that appears on "Heat", and surely the WCW is a negligible lightweight (eg hurricane hired as a cheerleader) <br /> <br /> Hardy Boyz against Dudley Boyz: the best game of the night: Jeff Hardy made a "Swanton Bomb" on a top of a cage and a wooden table. and Matt entered the cage, because he thought it was very painful. Stone Cold was a WWF champion, Rob Van Dam was the Hardcore champion, and German Kurt Angle was part of the alliance. All the key stars of the main event of the "Alliance" party achieved the result of the match, except Booker T., who was attacked by a "Raw" fighter and would not work. Shane McMahon will somehow return to television, and everyone wants the "Alliance" drop and disappear without Stone Cold. WWF has done much better. It would be a better match for an all-out team, and what happened to Casket and Iron Man games?
