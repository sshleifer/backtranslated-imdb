I have to say that I like the horror films I have never seen ... However, this is my pathetic nature. I usually have a gut wrenching type ... but it was lame in this particular movie. The play was awesome (still red lines (no match) was wonderful). And the trick, Txorimalo Slayer, is even worse! Yes, probably, when he first came out, there was a great crowd around him and people liked it. But when The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose get out, similar movies are similar to Scarecrow movies. If you want the movie you want to spend, select this! Special effects are bright icing. I had seen a low-budget movie, but I can see how it's coming. This will remind you of the movie "Baby boy". Independent films rock ... most time. So, if you want to see the birdwalkers die or watch it in the sequel, 2 puppets go, then these movies would be for you.
