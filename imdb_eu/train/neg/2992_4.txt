Next to slasher movies of the 1970s and '80s, the second half-horror sub-genre was probably a bit closer to the dead. While the Slasher films had 'Black Christmas' and' Halloween 'movies to complete all the zombies' films by George Romero's' Dead'. And it is not surprising that soon after the first two successes in the series, other directors wanted to get involved. Many Italian executives were interested, such as Lucio Fulci gave Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" a year. "Zombi" is known in Italy and other countries, and Fulci was known as "Zombi 2". He has no relation to pedestrian, Romero's film, but his own film. He has had a great success in Europe and a sequel was born 9 years later. <br /> <br /> Pros: a lot of beautiful landscapes. Awesome score The play is not quite good, but the cast is in the game and it seems to enjoy the experience. After a slow start, the pace moves as an action. A lot of cheese and unwanted darkness for lovers of honest cinema. Good work on makeup. A lot of dirty and dirty blood. <br /> <br /> Controls: they almost draw. Nothing you've seen Hidden things breaks the first pair of 'Dead of Living Dead' for the first time. Cardboard characters. Due to the bad rock music of the 1980s, he has not lived very well (I do not say that all rock music is bad at that time), clothing and the feeling of the movie. <br /> <br /> Last thoughts: First of all, it is not the beginning of the classic worship of Fulci. In fact, I do not know how to bring that movie anywhere. For those who do not know, Fulci was ill in production, and eventually he left and replaced Bruno Mattei. Matte's films are quite crazy, but it's a lot like this movie. And this is something really funny about this movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (Score is so bad) 2/5 (Serious scores)
