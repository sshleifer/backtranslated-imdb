A laugh-inducing snaff tells the story of a detective who is investigating Inside Man (Denzel Washington), in cases of money laxity. After robbing a bank, the hostages are against a mastermind robber (Clive Owen) and his team against his will and will ask the detective to leave the robber? He proves innocent and deserving his attitude. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) using secrets and feeds, you have the three-way dilemma sent to recover the owner of a bank owner's bank security item. Unfortunately, everything you set up in the movie and, in the end, it's nothing. Denzel Washington will not give any interest in an effective and an egocentric role. The only savings in the film are the stars of Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, much better than the movies themselves. In fact, Jodie Foster provides stunning high-quality performance and good quality, which plays the worst and most disgusting of different types. Clive Owen is not much to do and plan, but he gains the depth of his presence and his active ability over his underdeveloped development capability. It's strange that this tale is wasting so much in this movie that has little impact or interest. You have to ask what director Spike Lee was thinking about while this movie was emerging. The most surprising aspect of Inside Man, however, has received many unanswered judgments. As regards a movie that seemed to be a form of a summer mum, this is terribly flat.
