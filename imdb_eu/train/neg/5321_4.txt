It is a special musical comic, which artificially tries to marry the explosion of rock-n 'roll victory with the class-sensitive subgroups of a cutting-edge sitcom. The result mish-mash is jarringly dated, filling in with no audiences going to music, but at least keeping parents. <br /> <br /> A quick look at the promotion The back of the video version should be given some ideas of content. Tom Ewell is a drunken agent, who almost exaggerated comic abilities, "hi honey, home even!" The ad is "It's so funny" in "The 7 Year Itch." It's like an excuse. What other movie would you skip an important player was in something else? "She reads so funny 'The 7 Year Itch', but junk this is ". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mansfield, a beautiful girl with a 50-inch rookie, unfortunately is a basement vault. The ability of a haddock to detect Monroe Active and comic-time, combined with its double-sided delivery with Ewell's OTT, turns Hell's comedy into a partnership, and the sale shows: "[Jayne Mansfield], whose talent is clearly creating the laughter of the greatest talents!" As you can see The film that sells the lead with a big breasted lead is not the most sophisticated thing. Most of the "humor" is that men are falling, glasses are cracked in Mansfield, etc. The Freudian nightmare of a milk bottle is only certified "U" throws it on. <br /> <br /> Musically, the player's adenity is chosen. You're really going to see Eddie Fontaine's offer: "I love your eyes, I love your lips better than potato chips" "Cool It, Baby"? Only the MOR is violent with a faint little Richard, but in the fourth minute he tries to sing some pretty little father. And how do all the events happen without a single microphone? Industry attempts are trying to expand and understand their concept. <br /> <br /> Technically, the image was quite advanced, with special effects (including a ghost, including Julie London) and a luxurious color (which now looks flat and looks like). Artificial, in fact, looks like a red color with red fleshy and false fake shades. Direction, however, is not outstanding, and the sound quality is quite bad. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's getting old. While men were still burning on the screen, adults warned by humorous actors, and the waiters got black and danced only. (All this happens here). Some Like It Hot, African Queen, Ben Hur and many are much more like today's movie movies, so the argument "good time" does not really stand out. In her heart, the Girl Can not Support Kinetic and protective and does not take a close inspection. 4/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
