There are no comments in this review. Nothing goes wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, nothing; Most clips should at least try to tighten clips on the plot line, with a rough stretch, but that is not the same. Clips, carry an endless sequence about three sad line clips ... OK, so maybe they were short of the production season, but it would be better to completely eliminate this passage. Waste time <br /> <br /> I do not know how this is achieved. The shells are much better when crossing the troops, but somehow ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They gladly returned to heaven in the next episode.
