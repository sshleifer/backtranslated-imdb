The tendency to repeat itself, Wenders has been disappointed, because it has been very successful with "Paris Texas". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Freedom territory' is no exception. Undoubtedly, especially when I first introduced the movie, I think that the intentions of Wenders are always improving. Now, his generous and motivated films have been based. <br /> <br /> I was not sure of the comedy music that made a mid-American or thriller. The result of the Diehlen nature is highly predictable. Wender is also very annoying to have plenty of scenes with rock songs. The scenes that covered her script and the direction were jumping. <br /> <br /> Surely many people will find an important and highly renowned film, but this honestly speaking, this didactic and false effort only speaks. bad directions <br /> <br /> It is interesting that Wenders admitted that it was 'Paris Texas', which Sam Sheppard had helped him with the script. Yes, Wenders was the best and should understand that now he needs a good screenwriter. Films in the last 15 years were a total mix.
