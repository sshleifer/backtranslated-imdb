The first part, in Cuba, is about the part of his life. He has too many incessant conflicts and Che manages many injuries without pain (remember that Che was a doctor). Castro wins the revolution; Che will never reach Havana. The second part, Bolivian Che, guesses it. He has too many unequivocal battles and administers numerous injuries to Che. <br /> <br /> When I thought that "epic" (I never knew * anything but the title before). Naturally I thought the greatest epic of all of them, David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia. More of them later. <br /> <br /> You do not want to be racist, but besides what I already mentioned, there are too many characters, which are inseparable. The same, especially the "Che" beard, and all the Che outfits. This is to allow the viewer to identify with other people, Benicio del Toro (although Fidel has a small role). While Del Toro is horrible, think of "Lawrence" as unique character with Peter O'Toole: Alec Guinness, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, etc. You get an idea. <br /> <br /> Because other characters are removable, this causes a loss of reference. When the main Checo helpers die, you do not know who they feel. Even when you die (I do not think it's a spoiler), there's no empathy for the public, it's just death. <br /> <br /> It's a very social dimension. For being revolutionary and not only in the moral justice of Jesus but also for being the second, the only thing we learn from Che is married to five children (he tells a person who is close to the end). What was his motivation? Full enigma <br /> <br /> Maybe, Soderbergh is lean-fit. Like Soderbergh's Che, Lean never leaves Lawrence, the mysterious Arabian, to know anything about. But at least a friend of Lawrence (Sharif) and associates (Guinness, Quinn). He was very brave because he was not sure, that is, he had human characteristics. Che is like a machine, as warm as Terminator. <br /> <br /> This first year, another epic war was Mongol. Chek Mongolia looks great.
