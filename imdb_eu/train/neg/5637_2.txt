I understand that it is a desirable and different movie. I understand that the previous reviewer is a movie that he thinks no comment. As soon as I finished my movie, my first comment was: "This is what happens when a wealthy princess wants to be a movie star and does not have any talent" ... she uses her father's money to make the movie she wrote, and pay ... obviously, to realize that there was no development of the character in the movie, and from the beginning, in the middle and the end there was no direction ... the voyeur part was good and edgy, but what was the point? I saw a woman go home, find some pictures, a concierge screw, get out of the cold at night (it's not incredible) to see the noise and overcome the lover of her concierge ... finishing the movies ... how do my unconscious educate me? I really want to know what the director's vision was ... why was not the development of the dead lover? Why do not you have a background background? What is the night vision? What is the lipstick on the car? Why is the dead goalkeeper? Why has he told us about a mentally ill / nonsense who fled? What is it with the urn? Oh, and this lamp supposes what his house is? Territory? Why? Why would the goalkeeper feel like his house? this party was never run ... as far as William Defoe ... I rented this movie because it was there and what was known for the celebrities ... write and say what I need to learn ... I am a mother in Central America, movies I love ... Chris ....
