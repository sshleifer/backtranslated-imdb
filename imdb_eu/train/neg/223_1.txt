It's not a movie but a film for a movie. One of the worst movies ever made by a female director male. Andy McKay's director only knows the woman. Bad taste, American Pie humor, raw story, nonsense story, infected characters. Unbelievable fantasies appeared on the screen. The insult and definitely not funny. I wonder how to participate in how to accept three good actors.
