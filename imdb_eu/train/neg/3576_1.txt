Even when I watched a teen's movie, I asked what was ironic about Pia Zadora, a star in a movie about an artist who came to the forefront. As beautiful as Mrs. Zadora, she did not even have any movie without movie excuses. Also, for his Penthouse photo table, which was promoted "The Lonely Lady", he could keep the movie. Only the one who could save this movie? Script completely different. Give this a miss.
