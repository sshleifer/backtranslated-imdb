"Victory of love" does not defeat anything. 4 hours of torture is heavy. Actually, it is less than 2 hours. I try to think about the beautiful performances of beautiful actors like Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The assistant players are not horrible. Perhaps, they were trying to get up, to be clownish, but if so, I did not see that. Mira Sorvino does not make any impression on either side. There it is. I think Marivaux has been much better than the theater of about 270 years ago. It can not be worse. Clare Peploe, the writer and director of this movie, was inspired by the last session of a new play. I do not know what he thought about when he created this bomb. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the translation has been lost.
