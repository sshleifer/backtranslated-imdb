It was not possible to publish her cast with Madeleine Carroll. That said, I must add that the British film is approaching. The story takes place in the "SS Atlantic" ship and is based on a trip to the "Titanic". The word "Impossible" is heard, the bag plays an intense ice and the sky choir says "My God the Shallest". Convicted trips eventually take on the hymn in a clever sound. The year of the film version (1929), however, has to admit modern audiences with primitive sounds and silent films and theater conventions. These are not problems. The main mistake of the movie is to pause, and the steps have been very silent. However, if the conversation started at real speed, it would cut the half-time of the movie. The effect of the end was drama (and clarity in a new medium), but the result is unfortunate now. The film structure is not innocuous and innocent. Paradoxically, I have found some modern editing techniques in the modern technique: on the other side of the ship, violent and sharp cuts, sometimes even in sound effects. Although the first film was included in the "Atlantic" ship, we were in the movie for more than 4 minutes, when I met. The boat dance orchestra has long music passages. (Sound entertaining and easy. Personal stories are presented in a very invading and convincing way. Do not think about the show too. Berg is a small thing and the small external damage that the ship's crust makes. However, the scenes that pass through the sketches of travelers - clearly visible on a real liner, when they are tied to the dock - create a great deal of excitement. Apart from the glorious Miss Carroll, these sequences are the only points of excellence in the movie. While the movie and the ship are close to the end, the screen goes black over several times when the generators fail. The last permanent shutdown ends with the movie, the evil symbolic effect that sunsets the sun / sunshine. 'Atl√°ntico' is a cinema curiosity. Mostly. <br /> <br />
