Where do i start How do you describe the best movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> Let's get started with campy hick humor. It's not very funny. Add actors-like musicians - Meat Loaf is horrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Merry Art Carney, who should know better than this movie. <br /> <br /> And then it's on the plot. The life of Alice Cooper is a road of life. She meets a girl who wants to be a part of Alice Cooper's life. They get at least what they want ... <br /> <br /> And then, when the movie is over, they can not make the last scene more believable - yes, I will not spoil if you want to watch the movie for you. <br /> <br /> There are some actors that are "B" movie or maybe worse. Gailard Sartain is for me and has a more important role. Surely the movie is not very good. If only, the movie will come to low expectations - it goes far beyond the poor. <br /> <br /> Please say this. This is the movie that compares all the wrong movies. And they are not worse than Roadie.
