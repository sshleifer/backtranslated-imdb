<br /> <br /> I am a fan of horror / science fiction for a long time, regardless of the budget, but after watching many nightly horror movies that night, cable and video should be the worst of all the movies. It has bloody special effects (those that seemed to be covered with false blood or fake ketchup were repeatedly revealed) and people were shouting at the left, then shouting right, back again. It should stop at the starter's shop scene and stay in it for 15 minutes. Instead, it drags a lot. Budget is very low x5. There were many scenes, too long. The narrator was very brighter, as a brave little person spoke. This is, in my opinion, Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji and Godzilla vs. The only movie to be rated less than megalon, even though there are big budgets. 10 snoozes, try to sleep during a whole movie or better yet, avoid the brain of the dead as a food mafia. Why did this Zombie-Dung-Blues part? The occurrence of filmed wrongs ... infinite. -infinity / 10
