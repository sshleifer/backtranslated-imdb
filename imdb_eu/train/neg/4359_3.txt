Wow, after Timo Roses's "Rout City" trashing after about 15 minutes of the record (South Park is more than curse nonsense ... I think some people just did not get it) I was interested in this movie. I have read positive things and the movie looks far away from the trash that I expected after "Rout city". <br /> <br /> Surprise: the movie is not a trash, but the problem seems to be this way. Timo Rose tries to step-by-step with German Horror / Splatter Cinema with Olaf Ittenbach and the like. This means that the pieces of "Barrikada" are very gory and accurate. Gore FX is not really incredible, but well, acting is fine, but in some cases it's just. The round opening of the opening sequel is ridiculous and does not improve until it shoots. <br /> <br /> So what is the problem ... the movie is horrible, the German underground atmosphere has a typical (classic including) booby shots blood blood), OK FX and it feels like it is already ordered as the ships? <br /> <br /> 1. The total script is BS. In a typical hillbilly / forest you'll get lost story with some guys + crowded out of camping and a degenerated hillbilly family. It's all about going to the scene of torture / mutilation and it seems random and unbelievable. This turns the barricade into half. <br /> <br /> 2. It is a great opportunity to describe a lot of random camera work (I liked the tortuous bubble scene, which was repetitive ... it did not materialize or the editor worked in the store). Even worse is the edition ... surely, much better and much better than other genres of his genre, but his RANDOM. The excessive use of this typical expression effect is everywhere and without any sense ... there is ... all the time. After that, the film's appearance is spiny and noisy and it's just as well that it's thrown away, I do not have any meaning. <br /> <br /> 3. As with the aforementioned effects, there are many repetitive things here. For example, most murders make knives and punching. He's okay once but here he's annoying and false, especially at the end. The annoying "music" is also used in the background without any change. It will not last for a long time until it hardly lasts. <br /> <br /> 4. From all this, the biggest problem in this movie (and many others in my opinion). If you make a splatter film bin, you feel pretty stupid with a special FX and new school editing. They also seem serious. It's not fun because the decent gore is wasted in this context. And gore FX classics are well on the computer, similar to scenes like FX in the mouth or the end guns look pretty bad (and 3D Splatter is more like a budget and 3D movie with good artists). /> <br /> I often asked to finish a serious splatter film over time and if "Barricade" is another example, you should put it in the grave. It's not funny, it does not have any characters and it looks very trashy. The script "Wrong Turn" and "TCM" essay is inexpensive nowhere. You can take that literally ... there's just one end and a lot more randomly here ("I love you" in the splatter ... come on!). "Barrikada" tries to strive hard and fails ... you can surely make progress through this movie through the decompression, melting the acid face, spicy skin and on the Friday classic 13th style, fingering on a tent. boobies hooray!). But it's really hard to get that. You will notice that overall failure, especially, could be something.
