I loved the apprentice for the first two seasons. <br /> <br /> Now, in season 5? (or 6?) things are getting pretty laborious. <br /> <br /> I liked the show, but Donald Trumps became his own ego. He is giving you his company, but come! Some things say that it is "insisting that it is still" insulting. <br /> <br /> After seeing the show, I would not want to work with her. It's not an arrogant, pompous or so. Simply, the show is realistic and makes me handle things badly. Good entertainment YES, but when the back is wrinkled, it's hard. It's not a team job, it's not personal, its business. watch your back hook
