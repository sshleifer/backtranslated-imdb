This movie makes several mistakes. Some American actors in Spain and Castilian actors in English. 'Spaniards' is English well, but the way it plays is very annoying. the entire dialog is very weak; It may be a Spanish script, but it is incorrectly translated, who knows and who cares. I can not suppose that the English actors are obliged by the English language, they can be good, but not in this flop. You will figure out the first 5-minute movie, which is pathetic. then the rest is bad. If you lose a lot of time, the United Nations has a lot of necessary land. Oh, I mentioned one of these socks.
