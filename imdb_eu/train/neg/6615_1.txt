Once in the Indian cinema room, it comes with a movie like Sholay, which changes the way the viewer perceives a good movie. Every now and then (fortunately) we have a RGV ki Aag that breaks all the standards and creates it on its own. The standard so low can never be broken. Ram Gopal Varma takes a talented fusion and creates a dish that reminds us from scratch. It's impossible to kill and kill a classic like Sholay and I can not believe that RGV was almost called Sholay. Although Sholay had a lot of folklore elements, he simply defined the character of the film that he built on his plot. What characterizes Aag brings these characters and mix them so badly if you need a contest to choose the worst. The realism element is completely missing and the ending of the movie ends with a series of "actors" in events that are not seemingly unrelated to a plot of land. One of the stars in this movie is like voting. RGV will be able to wake up with the reality of its failure and create different "plots" that can be classified under cinema.
