I am generally disappointed with the network movies. The flixes that appeal to the great actors also destroy the television community. However, this is the worst. The script is weak and the play, especially Tracey Pollan, is abominable. I have seen the treatment of my children's school plays and improve the performance. Pollan speaks as if reading the script. When trying to express fear, anger or pain, it is very unclear. Due to the overall quality of production, it is very difficult to take it seriously. If you decide to dodge this, prepare for great despair. Scary things do not frighten you, sad things will not make you sad, love will not feel hot and blurry, and you will surely worsen to see the end come. He says a lot about "The First Kill".
