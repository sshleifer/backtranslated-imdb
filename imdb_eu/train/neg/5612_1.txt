Spiritualist and not as a Christian. I really thought about my faith, but what I was responsible for. I thought the movies would be good arguments, but only got the views of the gates and the Jews? And who is the people in the street who are interviewing, I do not know the back of his arm. Where are the theologians and the priests? Writing books and finishing their studies were not in 1970. Personally, this DVD was a waste of time and I was not told if the events were true or wrong, or that I thought it was an anti-Christ. Please, God finds out that he has not come to an end to his own selves and the devil to make him better. I do not say that the movie was horrible to help readers read. But if you really want to think if you want to show the poor souls that believe in Jesus to the world, we play with your utility and not the drum.
