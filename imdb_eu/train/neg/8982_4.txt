My nose bends a little bit as I write it. I have sent a comment about this movie that has not appeared in the past for some weeks, so I suppose this is supposed to be rejected, although all the usual instructions are met. <br /> <br /> I found this film a very interesting thirty minutes, especially Jordi Moll√†, a veteran actress who appeared in the "Blow" and "The Alamo" productions. Leonor Watling is also pretty good. Unfortunately, everything goes under the weight of a melodramatic script that is well-written. There is also a lot of free donation of narration that contains nothing to narrative or even beautifully shot art with imprintsic art. <br /> <br /> The authentic day of the beach in Valencia. These fictional characters are much harder to find anywhere else anytime.
