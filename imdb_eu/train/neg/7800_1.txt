In addition to cheap dirt, this video-shot video of ineptitude was difficult. It's a typical gore you'd expect from a zombie movie, but the atmosphere it deserves is not essential. <br /> <br /> What's strange, that is, amateur video is German and I version. has been dubbed in English! It seems Americans are fans (Germans' balances?) Who can not decide to play directly or want to become a comedian. A character (German white, of course), a black man doubles with apparently ebonics! 'Kno wahm sayin', Comrad?
