A ridiculous horror movie about a wealthy man, John Carradine, leaves all his four children and distributes his servants in the same way. One condition: they must spend a week to get their money. And if any of them dies, others get more. Next to guess what happened ... <br /> <br /> I saw a new copy of this film in the cable. The colors were bright and lively and the house is beautiful. That's all about things that can be said about it. <br /> <br /> We have listed some of the problems with this film: the murderer is a clear cry; The officials are called Igor and Elga - go; Some of the sound recordings were so bad, I could not publish the interview (I'm sure I do not have a big loss); He was deeply gore and very bad; Other murders were boring, stupid or impossible, and this movie has some really awesome performances; so badly, you just look at the screen in the belief. Jeff Morrow was also horrible! Faith Domergue (better than this one) and John Carradine (who seem to be old and weak) has been a pretty good performer of the Faith Domergue team. Although I have to admit - the end of this movie is a treasure! <br /> <br /> Why did you name "Legacy of Blood" for me, this is another horror film of 1978! <br /> Whatever your name is, it's a bad movie. All expenses to avoid.
