I was always curious about this movie, so difficult to find, when I stumbled on Ebay, I sold more than $ 10 and I bought them, now I understand why it's so strange! This movie is very bad, so incredibly written and a small budget, the final credits, which show all the scenes that have been cut off by their lines, make the movie stand out. It's about a psychic movie (Pettyjohn, for one obvious reason, his topless scene), with an experimental machine that uses his powers to bring objects from one dimension to this reality. When he brings out something like a thousand boxes, he tosses the military with a soldier in the back of a truck, and what do you know? SURPRISE! A mumble foam mum will appear in a suit, he immediately kills a soldier who crosses his face and then escapes into a nearby city. But to protect those responsible and responsible for showing the armed forces in the region, let Pettyjohn and Ray's owner find themselves alone, but it does not matter, this movie extends its full credibility. That's just about to run away for me. I only voted for unwanted laughter. Someone needs a producer to "Mystery Science Theater 3000", if they do not already know it! 2 10, really, really bad!
