Good night, Mr. Tom begins in a very magnificent town in the south of England, the sun always seems glowing. We announced the idea of ​​the time in the radio announcement of the Second World War statement. Soon, a train steals children in refugees in London, and when the old Tom's shy, reluctant and tough Tomorrow William (he only knows that he has a golden heart) begins, our story begins. <br /> <br /> And what a sensitive feeling is the charge. Actually, it's just a strange old-fashioned couple. Is not it writing to write new stories? <br /> <br /> As I suggest, it's hardly ever felt in the town, not much in London, about the strange old ambulance. And definitely, the horror of Blitz's hint is not as lucky as Londoners are at the airport shelters. When the local teacher's husband admits that he is dead, he later revives. <br /> <br /> I found the topic "Goodnight, Tom Mr", and I discovered John Thaw's accent, a picture of Ronnie Barker. Two Ronnies straw in the mouth with their 'country bumpkin' accent. <br /> <br /> My wife enjoys this movie for all the reasons that I did not like and seems to be looking at reviewers who seem to me. in a minority. <br /> <br />
