Why watch it There is only one reason, that is, the greatness of John Saxon. I love her performance. My favorite appearances are Nightmare On Elm Street, 1.3, and 7 as Nancy's police dad, as a Black Christmas policeman, and From Dusk Till Dawn as a cop again. When I went through the video output at my local center, I encountered the movie Zombie Death House, and quickly dumped it, but before continuing, John Saxon's movie was not the only actor but I realized it was the first time I ever had it. I heard a director's announcement. This fascinated me somewhat (also $ 9.00 cheap) and I and I had to be. When I returned home, I noticed that this movie was not directed to Saxon's other work, even though the managerial pressure added was infected. But they were not absorbed by other actors as well. Apparently, it seemed like they had been ripped off by a recent shoot, and now you have to tell them the boys really needed to play. The movie also looks like the 80s. I can not recommend this film in good faith, but if you are an obsessed fan of the 80s, it was the culture of that time who was a fan of late or born fans. . Even if you do it with Saxon John.
