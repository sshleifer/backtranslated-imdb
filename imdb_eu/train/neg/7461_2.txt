*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** From its initial credits, this wonderful movie is recorded straight: it's an instant classic. It's not a long time to realize that this movie is more than "Kindergarten Cop" or "Police Academy 7". I left the hangman of that time when I got out of the movie theater and returned to my ticket for a dozen tickets to buy myself. <br /> <br /> This is just a movie that requires a lot of conception. The first observation will surely leave you `Huh? Feel, but do not be embarrassed - it's best for us. The story is so diabolically fast, what to ask about the mortality of its authors. It seems that FBI is a simple story of an infiltrating fool. It is an allegorical story that works on different levels, as well as some really important things in life. The complexity of the plot structure will prevent your first inspection, but do not give up! Until the sixth or seventh conception, there were some hidden mysteries of Corky Romano. And end the unexpected turn, or the FBI agent, FBI agent, the biggest FBI prosecutor of the FBI, Peter Romano, the worst offense against FBI's Brick Davis FBI. She admits that she is illiterate and Paulie Romano comes out as a homosexual closet. I'm laughing away, I can say a lot. <br /> <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan's comedy talent does not match, because Corky Romano directs his character through an unforeseen maze. John Reynolds recalls the interpretation of "Manos, the Fate of Hands", "Kattan takes on a number of characters, and combines scenes with the right timing, but the comedy is not Kattan. She also plays drama because she controls the audience's feelings , with the smallest movements of the face, whose facial expression reflects the same life in some way, for example, seeing the scene that goes into the faces of his brothers, the expression of social injustice and alienation clearly reflects his serious face, at which time it is difficult to find a dry eye at home . <br /> <br /> David Garret and Jason Ward are the real heroes of `Corky Romano ', the story of one of these proportions being easy to understand why these two experienced writers were required to complete this ambitious project: their unusual storytelling and structuring "Pulp Fiction" looks like Saturday Night Live skit looks like Garret and Warden It is so compelling and attractive to wear in your hair, it totally devours you and shakes you around. After finishing the experience of world-renowned 'Corky Romano', you will find another world all over the world with different ideas and ideas, and with one single question in your head: <br /> <br /> Why, God? Why?!?
