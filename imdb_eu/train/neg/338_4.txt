Undoubtedly, this nonsense about a mystical child, three hundred-year-old Dragons, kidnapped one of the funniest movies of Eddie Murphy, is nonsense about a "Selected". <br /> <br /> Murphy is "choosing" and suggests the beginning songs, "the best man in the world". Missing and missing children lost, a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) approached "The Chosen One" and tries to find and save her "Golden Child". If the child died, he would die with compassion as a carrier of mercy. <br /> <br /> If the trash bin does not spoil it right now, it will probably start the movie once. We can say that the plot is abominable and destroys the entire movie. Murphy's humorous comedy (a comedy is not so intelligent), the film fails at many levels. Charles Dantza, too, can not do evil Sardo Numspa in the proceedings. Very stupid and depressing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
