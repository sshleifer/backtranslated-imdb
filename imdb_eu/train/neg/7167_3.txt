For this, I saw another video clip, and I decided to get it out. Boy, I was disappointed! The story is very boring, the performance (not only Christopher Walken) is bad, and I do not care less about the characters, really trying to frustrate Nora's husband. Christopher Walken's role, such as throwing himself off, is hard!
