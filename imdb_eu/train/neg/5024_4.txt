There's not much to say about that. Gammera is a type of turtle breathing. It is thrown by a nuclear explosion. He runs the land and starts building buildings and tanks and other garbage (oh, electric lines, I almost forgot). At one time, at the beginning of the film, he is a friend of the little boy, and he simply tosses it away or breaks it down on the floor. Safe Since then, we have seen and face this small little face, to appear and escape, show and escape. For some reason, Gammera can hear about 20,000 children. Or, well, the plot is about to reach a Gammera space and try to shoot the rocket and penetrate it. As usual, the monster is not coordinated (a man with a Gammera suit). The Japanese army (with the help of Americans) uses enough ammunition and fire to solve national debt and, of course, it does not work well. However, they should know. We have found a lot of Tokyo monster. Because they do not sew because it can be fun, but it's not very good.
