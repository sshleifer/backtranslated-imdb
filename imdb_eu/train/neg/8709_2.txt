Arg. We are back in the midst of the dinosaurs, in another third movie to get another snack. On this occasion, European terrorists (I would say Irish) allowed an uranium conveying army coop. They enter a shipyard, they open the truck and know our old friends. Pandemonium comes when wheel dinosaurs visit terrorists, police and some sailors. It seems that the whole movie was inspired largely by Alien (again Carnosaur 2) (gunsmanship pathetic ships in "claustrophobic shipyards"), this third movie probably is the fastest film in this film, just like a whirlwind, because a rubbery dragon violates the sea's head They are rigid, as they usually tend to be stirring and the sounds of a terrified T-Rex shake (it does not look like it). One of the toughest scenes in the movie comes to the police station: they enter the building that holds the kidnapping truck and other trucks They hear a strange noise, a surprise! Rubber Reptile Gang left and left, why did they block the dinosaurs from escaping from the second truck, how could they stop blocking the truck door from outside? What has been shooting this scene ???? Oh bother, who cares? Two-fingered down rubber bandage size.
