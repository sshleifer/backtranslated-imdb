Before I start, I love Eddie Izzard. I think it's one of today's most fun stand-up. Perhaps, therefore, I hope they are hopeful, but I do not find eddies fun at this exit. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Eddie is very hard to try Eddie to be. Everyone knows an absolutely irrelevant comic, and we all love it for that. But in Circle, it seems to go much further than irrelevant, and has completely lost me in places. It covers a lot of covered topics before - I think I've got some recycled jokes. <br /> <br /> If you buy a DVD you will find a look behind Eddie's career. (places of interest, but not very funny), and one of its shows in French. Die-hards Eddie can enjoy watching in another language, but subtitled comedy is not very funny. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Eddie, you can either go or buy whatever I buy. If you're passing, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill - you're not disappointed. With Circle, probably.
