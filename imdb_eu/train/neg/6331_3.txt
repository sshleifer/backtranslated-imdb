Mr. Mike was probably a misanthropic comedian of all time, so I was interested in what he was going to do to see all the creative control of a movie I was interested in. Unfortunately, it's impossible, but it's not fun at joking. Some of them (I'm not the ones that most know it) are, in fact, Mr. Mike did a good job in returning his unbalanced mental imbalances. The problem is that technical quality (set, lighting, sound, editing, naming) is so scary that the movie is unbearable. An outfit called "PKO Productions" earns a credit, but does not seem to produce it; Mike looks more like stealing a camera from SNL camera and made the whole thing one afternoon. I know Mike's goal was to make torture for the audience, but they also deserve some basic rules, such as ability to see, hear or understand everything that is moving. However, the DVD is not a total waste: it is a tribute to Bill Murray O'Donoghue and three writers of "Mr. Mike's Least Loved Bedtime Stories" by SNL. Also, the movie is a great scene that catches the "cat swimming" section, if you want to look at someone's mind. 3/10
