... from this awesome movie! There are so many things wrong with this movie, in the theater, writing, directing, editing, etc. It is amazing that something rises to the top and proves to be the absolute highest. Music! I had a movie with two composers. That's why each frame has to have music, the worst absolute style of the movie "D". They never heard the word "less". It was so painful to hear, when the sound was not in conversation, I made a mute sound, not a good conversation. You have to thank Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I am sure they did not see the role of the sun on the route. See at your own risk.
