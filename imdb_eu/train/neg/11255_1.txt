In a word, this movie was boring. Life and spark were lacking. A big problem is brought to you two. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow did not have chemicals. It was boring and annoying. <br /> <br /> Images were of interest, but they did not improve the scenes. In any case, it was a tendency to visually view the viewer on the screen. One of the sequences of action was not real, so the movie failed to create a real drama or dangers. <br /> <br /> He had a potential movie, but he needed a better script, a better performance and a better director. I continued to think about the movie, you know, this movie could work on the Harrison Ford Sky Captain, Karen Allen Polly and Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> Do not overlook the main criticism of this movie. I think critics are raising their films, because they want to, and even if they want to succeed, even if it fails at different levels.
