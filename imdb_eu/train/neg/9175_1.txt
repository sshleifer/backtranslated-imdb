This is the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie coincides with the quality of these films, such as "THEY" and "Cabin Fever", but also shortened the names of the actors. In this movie, "eye candy" was 50 women to raise the face. (it's just an example of quality). I would rate this movie crying. Women should say that men are not looking bad, but not much. If you want to see this movie, I would recommend saving money.
