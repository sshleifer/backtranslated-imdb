I found that I was very trapped in this movie, at least in the beginning, and any credit that I give to this movie is Lacey Chabert, it was wonderful !! But it ends there. It seems that who knows who is the murderer is very good, and I like the movie when it is totally wrong for me, but I felt it and I felt it, it will take you all the time in a single direction and then suddenly go to the end completely in the opposite direction He decided that they did not get any success, it is not very bad to write and plan mischief, someone does not believe in any way! <br /> <br /> I felt the movie would be much better to take it on the plot, it seems they did not answer anything, why it burned the teacher's house Jane (Maria). <br /> <br /> It is a great mercy. I thought that the movie was pretty good.
