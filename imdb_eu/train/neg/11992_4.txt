I never read the novel Gary Paulsen's Hatchet, "A Cry in the Wild" adaptations, so I can not compare them to the book. However, I will say that, as an original film, no adaptation or adaptation, it was an underdeveloped adventure with few characters. <br /> <br /> Think of it 'weeping wildly. "A smashing teen mountaineer (Quincy, California, was the only place where he was shot?)" Cast Away "version. Brian Roebson, 13, is Jared Rushton, a small plane heads out to visit his father, and craftsmen broke through some desert areas. > <br /> Basically, there are three parts to the movie. The obvious characters are fifteen minutes, that is, Brian and his mother. <br /> <br /> The next third of the film (actually consumes everything in the whole movie) is Brian "roughing it". These scenes have no amazing action, nothing spectacular than a beautiful film of a beautiful landscape of Yukon. It does not want to put anything, it's not a real encounter (except for a cube), and there are not great dilemmas to start enjoying or linking to the character on the screen. You would be getting bored a little bit of time, by means of time, when we are dealing with the former before addressing Brian and then improving it (using tools, etc.) to survive. It's similar to ordinary time that was stuck in that situation, and that's pretty much that. In other words, Paulsen's words do not eat when they return to any media. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the third part of the movie is his salvation. <br /> <br /> There is an intrigue that constantly strives to know during that time. Some conflicts between Brian and his parents created a strange and wrong relationship between them. However, in most cases, only a brief, short, minimal flashback of a short story that resembles a story in the back of a music video. In just a few minutes, the singer Jefferson Starship began singing "Sara". In addition to what the spectator needs to draw from the implications or the need to fill the narrative gaps, we also get a backward story developed, it was probably necessary to enjoy a part of this film and create a link. The character, in the third part of the film, had nothing to do with Brian's survival adventure. These are the narrative errors to find out what they are doing on the screen, and for me, they say something to scream almost on the TV and say something. Tell me more! <br /> <br /> For me, definitely, it was not a good adventure story. But one of the latest films by Jared Rushton. So, see only nostalgia, if only.
