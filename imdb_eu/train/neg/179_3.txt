Back to Cabin by the Lake ... It was missing. The budget must be very low, because the amount of light in the movie must be shot with a conventional video camera. So, in the same scene, you will have some flat screen quality movies and simple video camera shots. It blends very curiously! I think they should find the way to "home videos" type effect! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth it to see, if you've seen the original CBTL, you can compare and see the differences. But if you have not seen the original CBTL ... you will never see it if you see it first! It probably looks very bad, and you will also take care of the original.
