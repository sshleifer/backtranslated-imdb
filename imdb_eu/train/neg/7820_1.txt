or is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, look ... it's a disaster! or: It is not necessary to look in the sky. <br /> <br /> or: (... OK, that's enough). If the singer wants to make a romantic titan movie to fall into the movie, he has failed. . The SR structure can not do this, I called a dark and limited color scheme ("wishi-washi"), a boring traditional conversation, clowns with advanced alien technology, fun magic, and so on. totally disappointing <br /> <br /> Simply it does not work. <br /> <br /> Superman is one of the main characters that is a superhero. That is crucial, most important. <br /> <br /> Love problems and a sad high depression Supersoftie can be up to 2:40 Superman's facade, not all the time. <br /> </ br> It is not a supermarket or a superhero movie. It is like social research (and, in this case, very bad and boring), every 30 minutes a person flies. <br /> <br /> That's a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. Holy Skywalker, this is Superman, so give us Supervillains, Superaction and most importantly, Superfun. <br /> <br /> We want to do entertainment! Singer, 2:40 long soul if you make love affairs dead and missed drama about people? Then take the ordinary human characters and make a renewed version. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman returns. And then there is a high-end door. <br /> <br /> Maybe the singer has tried to kill the legend without cryptonite, but a bad movie can not do that. Do not give up, they organize a sequel ... <br /> <br /> Next, the singer (and Warner Brothers) performs a superhero movie, not a depression surplus or a soap. A superhero's movie means colorful fantasy and magic. <br /> <br /> This movie is a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover. Yes, there are a lot of technical types, there are many small talks, jokes, scenes of action, etc. But all the wrong pieces can be the only one that is bad quality. <br /> It's not a very boring patchwork and one of my worst direct movies. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous cast strategy (Take it out to the young as much as possible, so we can take part in the next 25 years). Kate Bosworth plays a 22-year-old star reporter. For over 19 years, Superman has been in full swing for five years, so he's been 6 years old and was 16 years old (13) and a daily reporter on the planet, "Wroting" spent the night with the superman. "Warner Brothers, too. <br /> <br /> Routh is not so bad, he's playing a bit of wood, but the movie is wood, so ...?! Temporary good ones were marching and sometimes posey. The rest, forgotten. Even spatial, this is not his land. > <br /> <br /> <br /> Reeve / Hackman / Kidder was so simple, funny, what's the difference. <br /> <br /> Finally, Jesus raises the ridiculous thing. What the hell should be? The problem is Are they serious, not a joke. Will Spiderman or Batman or Ironman descend and raise angels or angels like Jesus or speak directly to God? Why not? They are superheroes, to save human lives every day, so you should at least have a lecture with the god all week ... Oh my god <br /> <br /> Maybe it was not a real predicted movie, but since it was a sad parallel universe. <br /> <br /> As for the war brothers, this super flick depression will be the biggest disaster in history. Not only for money. <br /> <br /> I understand how difficult it is (maybe) creating and transporting messages or feelings, but people who are unlucky, missed and unfortunately are not new, and thousands of movies or TV shows made it better in old and old people like Magnolia. And the wings of the wings were more exciting than the supermarket, sorry, of course, superman. <br /> <br /> Singer and WB, nothing more. It is more than anything, it's like a black hole (comic / superhero) that destroys cinema passion and stole three hours of our lives. <br /> <br /> Andrea Smilla's younger brother. (Very angry and green like the hulk).
