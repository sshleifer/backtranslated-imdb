Of course, she has some talents, Maria Bello is always great. but it's just a dull waste of time, all of the characters hating and exploiting the character to be exploited, so someone can create an interesting movie. Well, I hope they have come out of their system. unfortunately, for the audience, there is no idea, no sensitivity, no context and no humanity. All this would be fine, humor, fearless, except context, and nothing about the story that is trying to tell the story is a builder. Bad things happen, you sit down and watch, you do not mind, and what? 99% of all the time, a word based on a real story is an unwanted warning to the audience. The director and screenwriter are lazy and they feel fascinated by something they've heard somewhere, so they think they're on the screen and the 'truth' of the story seems to feel like the viewer does not do something. wool I hope this movie has been a good time. it makes ice
