HeidiJean really watched the movie? Great Christmas Movie It's not close Teddy, soft and completely lacking in imagination and in the heart. When I saw this movie, I asked him to ask Carly Pope to be the star of this movie. Women have no personality and they are totally lacking. Baransky was just as good as usual, and the only thing that was very interesting. Probably, from the outset, this project was a clear sign of its involvement. I may be waiting for excessive life in 15 days of Christmas cinema, but I sat down with another director and a JJ reconfirmation, with at least one actor with sympathy, which could be pretty nice. .
