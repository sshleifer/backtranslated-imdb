Creature Unknown is a good word for this movie. Or maybe it's called the Unknown Movie. This movie is part of the gap from the beginning. Really stupid "plot", really "active" is pathetic and "so special effects." <br /> <br /> Thirty-something "post-teenage" are trapped in the woods for a few years, with a crunchy mother, a can and a rubbery creature. The one you get with this movie has a lot of talk and little action. You talk about the girl walking through the woods, and then you talk about trees with heavy masks. The whole thing is so boring! <br /> <br /> This creature is rarely seen in most films. As it is shown, it distorts the image to hide a man with a rubber band, and the movement indicates that it is a suit, which is why the fuzzy image and the reason for the distortion. <br /> <br /> It's NOT a good movie, and those who praised this were probably the "amazing" movie they got. Skip this sure!
