I prefer Robin Williams in more important roles (for example, Will Will Hunting, Fisher King, The World According to Garp). These are my favorite Robin Williams movies. However, Love the Day, even if it's a good thing to do, is the worst movie I've ever seen and, definitely, Robin Williams's worst film (Death to Smoochy, Club Paradise and Alladin on Ice). <br /> </ p> <p> The good story will have its ups and downs. This movie is a giant. I do not need to have a good Hollywood cheese party, but I have to have full despair in over 90 minutes. This film reminds me of "Love Liza" (really worse), the only point in the film seems to see where it can fall. Answer? Who is charged
