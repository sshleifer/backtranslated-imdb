I love Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> I enjoy 99% of all the films I watch. <br /> <br /> And I went out. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit, perhaps, that it was related to two white middle-aged women in the back of the theater ("Oh no, Jamie has hit the door! HEE HEE HEE!") But ... This was just so annoying It could not be a permanent shot of the camera, and there was no camera shot from a normal angle ... everything was in your face, loud and annoying. <br /> <br /> He was trying to get a bad guy to be gentle and Malkovich-like, but this time he's just old and tired. He did not bring anything new or interesting. From all the characters, before you've seen too many lines, before you've heard too much, and "tough guy" lines too ... and I do not mind things like that, really, as long as there is something original about it. In fact, he has gotten a lot of support for his favorite. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx and I think it's so funny, and I thought it was a fun movie ... but it's not quite fun. I had to endure everything else. <br /> <br /> This movie has required less shooting, fewer annoying camera shots, more emotions, more feelings and more Jamie Foxx. I gave him 2
