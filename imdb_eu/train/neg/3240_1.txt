This is the first Japanese guinea pig, that is, I think the most sick. A boy tortures a boy for a few days until he is killed. And at this time I will say that these films are NOT REAL! They are fake horror films that are trying to be realistic. <br /> <br /> The scenes are unmistakable but they are often not realistic. For example, when the little girl is trampled on the floor, we can clearly see how they step on and bury the girl next to the floor! And how stupid this looks! Sound effects are not realistic and do not make sense. Other scenes, such as the animal's throats were thrown out in the little girl, and for a long time the girl was silent, her nails cut off, the worms put her in the body of the girl's womb, crossed her eyes and mutilated such horrific details. A very ill and bad film that is horrible and without any value or cinematic significance. This first entry is the best and most beloved Swine Pork, although it is not so bloody in the next part, flowers and flowers as possible to be as shocking as possible. <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: Devil's Experiment is perhaps the worst thing I've seen and the closest thing to tobacco. This is (of course) the official false (n / a) official, that the "real movie" is not the only one killed or real in this movie. I can not recommend this to anyone, that is, it's so bad and insolent. Those who think it's a great horror film do not understand anything about cinema and its true meaning. I saw this as a curiosity (like other parts of the series) and now I know how insignificant waste is. They only work for the shock level, which is not a valuable film achievement. Devil's Experiment is perhaps the most weird movie I've ever seen and is in Mermaid in the Manhole (Guinea Pig 4), maybe I've seen a disgusting movie. So my book is very extreme, but that's all.
