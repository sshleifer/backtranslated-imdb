I liked the first movie. Comedy was a little enjoyable in some moments. Albert Wolsky's costume designer did his best !!! Robert R. Benton is as equal as wonderful decorators. This man had a good taste !!! Scriptwriters were very disappointed. In the end, the stairs would be a scene, but instead the father and daughter decided to be together. I do not like the end. His father turns his daughter's boyfriend and his ex-wife knows and is well. Well, as the scriptwriter would say, now there is another soul in the body, but they will not only be taken away from memory. The actors were good, they were very entertaining. Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr. was a very entertaining dance scene :))) But sometimes it's a good performance. For example, Corinne Jeffries, Cybill Shepherd, has been waiting for her 23 years after her husband's death (it is a long time!), He was true to him, loved no one, and when he met and just had to love him, Philip Train Ryan O'Neal), after a scene with his friend, he was very easily betrayed by the man he had wanted for so many years! It would be a good movie, if not the end and the human lost psychology.
