This movie is pretty bad. But it's not so bad that he suggests. The production values ​​are not very bad and the scene is effective. It has a 80s slab, it's always fun. Be careful with the look of Jimmy's Nails too. The accent with America is incredibly wonderful. In addition to fantasy, there are also breasts in Sybil Danning. They make a short appearance in a short film but in the final credits the scene is repeated over and over again in Sybil Danning's boob 12 "mix. He bought a new one and the two main characters that needed the money for the deposit: man and woman - were so absurd that I almost forgot about them and I saw this movie earlier tonight. The wolves are considerably less spectacular than in the original film, , sometimes monkeys are burning. East European environment is very good and the music from the bands band Babel is quite awesome, at least it adds up to the movie. <br /> <br /> Generally laughable, you will be sly Is it expected? And at least you've always had Sybil's knockers.
