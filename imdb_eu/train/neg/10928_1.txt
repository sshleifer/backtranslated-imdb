You only have to watch this movie and what time it is to lose it. The film was predictable and slow. Basically, Mormon has been selling bad news for basketball at church. I'd have to have a root channel just to watch this movie. Kameo performances were promoted through sponsorship / financing. This movie was a potential for demanding behavior by Mormon who played as a church-sanctioned basketball, but it's called PG because the true nature of the show can not be transferred to the film. The performance is horrible except Clint Howard and Fred Willard. Thurl Bailey's look was completely useless.
