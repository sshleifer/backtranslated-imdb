I felt the way I saw this movie, I found it in a vault and I bought it for myself, but I often shut it off and I often paid it for writing. If you're a fan of Gore and sadism, this movie is fine. Those responsible for this film know a thing, the fake blood and the creative use of parts of the body is a confusing effect. If you do not have this emotion, follow it. <br /> <br /> This movie is filmed in a home video camera with a huge school of props and actresses. It's dubbed from Germany, but it allows it, the sound is awesome. The movie is a quote that gets a quote, except for the aforementioned special effects. If they had spent a bit of money on the actors and the blood and guts were not a real screenplay, the movie could be quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> A neighbor is about three men living in an island. an army of sadistic stained-glasses. They catch up and the rest of the films try to escape. This story, because it's quiet, is called a story, because some scenes of torture and fighting are darkened by conversations that are darkened together. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to get rid of about this movie, unless you're a strange gore. Let us be warned.
