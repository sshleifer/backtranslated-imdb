I discussed whether I had to dial the unnecessary box. The 99% of this show is probably seen by any followers of Scrubs, it is not included in a spoiler category. <br /> <br /> Klip shows. Grrr. We all knew that Friends were going down the channels when the clip shows started ... and they went down with Scrubs for five and a half years and fell in that hole. <br /> <br /> I must ask The writers could not write a week and say "show them another funny". It does not work. <br /> <br /> When it comes to getting started, people are not fun when it comes to not showing up at all times when people fall. It's not fun to see Todd hanging his banana hammock on, why he did not hang banana banana-moms. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it was supposed to be a collection of JD fantasies, that it was a dream of Turk. Another one was not his fantasy, though I forget it. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. This episode can be overlooked. We've seen all these things before. And the collection of clues that people dance? Why? That's not fun. <br /> <br /> In the end, I must admit that they will be shown for the last time in the collection of my favorite Scrubs ... Dr. Cox realized that Ben was dead ... and told him how proud he was. <br /> <br /> But save the episode that did not see them again. It says all the abstracts. <br /> <br /> The last worst. Bill Lawrence, please do not let your show be like your friends, save it, save it fun ... or go back.
