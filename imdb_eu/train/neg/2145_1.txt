I have a question for those who thought about this idea. Why? This made them think of a second movie. If the memory is worth, Cinderella did not finish "All those who were lucky"? I am pretty confident or implicit. Wait a minute, if they had luckily lived, how could a horseman be? If they do not try to get bored with the story of history, it can not be a sequel. Certainly Cinderella can sing for nonsense for two hours, but why? There can not be a sequel to the movie "happily ever ends"; If they do, they will never live happily. Something must go wrong, which creates the first end problems! Why? That is not correct, it's evil. That's my last word.
