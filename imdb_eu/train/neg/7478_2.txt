When I saw the preview of this movie I thought it was dumb, but it would be fun at least. I was wrong. Producers came up with profoundly interesting messages that only parents left and re-evaluated their lives, but this was a great way to deliver this message. The first fifty times it happened to the couple was quite fun. But in the end, I can hardly imagine what the accident will happen next. <br /> <br /> I like five lines of interview in the entire movie, and everything else was half-full, which is still more than I say.
