First of all, this is not as bad as another garbage produced by Sci-Fi Channel. This does not mean that Grendel is a good movie, which is a very bad thing, but definitely the potential has been much better. The film's mistakes come from character design, character, absurd purchasing of the story, visual effects, music, and most often: the actor. <br /> <br /> In the design of characters, I, of course, show how our heroes and criminals see it. Beowulf and the rest of the Danes seem to be ridiculous for Vikings, but rather the brutal warriors, the helmet of our main hero is stupid. Grendel looks like Hulk, but he has an elbow with strange attachments. <br /> <br /> Characters are very limited. Beowulf is the same from beginning to end, however, Finn - the useless owner - has achieved a two-dimensional section, thanks to his romantic enthusiasm. /> Like Finn, this story contains over-the-counter add-ons while maintaining the material source. The beats with Beowulf are so ridiculous, but I'm surprised I'm not leaving the group out. Apart from additives, there are errors, such as Christianity and paganism, as well as false lies. <br /> <br /> The special effects are awful. Grendel and his mother Hag are misguided, so the portrait on the screen is less than incredible. <br /> <br /> Music is keen, especially when a character dies. <br /> <br /> After all, this is not the worst film on Sci-Fi. No. The truth is that it is one of the best films, although it is still trash, it is a good trash and, therefore, it is a guilty pleasure. Everything in the work is a wooden conversation. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you jump on this movie and you will see that Robert Zemeckis will take the old story Beowulf, this movie (Grendel) is just half the story, and not everything, this movie gets a three-star review who has.
