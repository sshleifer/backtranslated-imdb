I remember when I first loved this show when I was a child. I thought the helicopter was the most beautiful thing I've seen. It was a top-class technology. The enemy was able to repel fire, he could make all types of acrobatics in the air, and he would do almost anything in that way. Now, I go back and look at it today and I'm surprised how this show really is. The members of the Karkas are not very credible, there are many moments of course, and the fight scenes are very fake. And almost everywhere he has the crap fight with the helicopter, reusing the footage of low quality jewelry. Vietnam's footage appears a lot. <br /> <br /> Airwolf with Knight Rider basically has the same theme, except for the election of a vehicle instead of a car instead of a helicopter. After seeing some episodes, I was bored. But I like the music theme.
