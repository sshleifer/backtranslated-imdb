In the old submarine mode, I was the worst movie underwater ever seen. First and foremost, the revelation of the United States ship embarkation, especially the unthinkable undisturbed Trident nuclear submarine. These men are the best and best they are dedicated to their mission. The responsibility taken is enormous and the members of the crew consider the captain to be very important. I never saw a group of a boat between the Captain and the Executive Director. An official of the Executive Character of Denzel Washington would remove his duties and the Martialed Court, then join the Navy. It is not surprising that the Navy refused to send a technical adviser to this film. In the end, if a member of the underwater crew has made a noise in the boat, they would be seriously recovered. Submarines learn early career to avoid possible detection as long as possible. They open the doors and talk quietly and the shoes are wearing soft shoes. I was surprised to see how he was drawn to people who were angry. Loud music would never tolerate. I know the underwater life reality should not sell tickets, but this is a boom to be ridiculous. I would not recommend the movie to anyone.
