Ouch! This was a bit painful. It has a nice and fun premise, but that's where it comes from. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying and does not disappoint him. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville decided to watch the show surprisingly. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly played for the first time. I know how many parts have been written, and it is difficult for the acters to blame when they do such as the script and the director. If you have terrible characters, it's okay, but you have to have good material to operate. It's not here He fled if he could scream from this movie.
