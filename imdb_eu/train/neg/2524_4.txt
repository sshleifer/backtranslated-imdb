Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stuart Gordon <br /> <br /> Cast: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo <br /> <br /> Review: Stuart Gordon We usually meet with horror movies such as Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak, a short film, and we took a small detour and made a small sci-fi movie. I emphasize the word "Little", because it looks like a small budget, and it is the main weakness. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the future. Superpowers (according to this film, as the United States and Russia claim) differentiate their world all over the world, forming a war that is left all over the world ... but Gladiator-style fights are struggling with giant robots. Our hero Achilles must go against the evil Robot robot robots Alexander. Stop motion animation is created. <br /> <br /> Well, I think it's a great idea. Large Nations to establish territorial conflicts with giant robots? An interesting premise and a properly managed budget that is handy. Unfortunately, it might have been a fun movie, otherwise it's a shame for a great director. <br /> <br /> I love a child who loves this movie and I think that if you want to enjoy this movie, I'll be back to being a little child to have fun. I showed this movie to some of my friends and the movie as my friends progressed, "what the hell is this frank dog?" And one of my favorite plays is a science fiction with Stuart Gordon. "But when the movie came into that country, I was stopped by pressure and I did not go through torture. I loved this movie, and I still have a little nostalgia for watching. But others did not get it. <br /> <br /> And I also realized that the movie was not ... This is really. First of all, the movie is about giant robots that come out from each other, and in a credible way, you should use some special effects to operate, with costly effects but, unfortunately, on a scale On a small-scale small company (Impossible for Empire after this movie failed!), we can only help the giggle and laughter when it comes to some sets and cabinets that are finished or half assed. <br /> <br /> OK, when it's done, animation and When you are viewing a mix of miniature stops, you agree that you can play the movie and even the great robots that go out with each other. They are cool ool while they're fighting, and go "why I liked swearing the movie!" But all we know is going to take you to this little protection that you are trying to hide innocent effects. And boom, the right to realize this movie is no longer until its premise. <br /> <br /> And there was something else that worried me about the movie too. This movie is basically a children's movie. Do you know how to make giant robots? Stop motion animation? Hello But this film conversation has many sexual promotions and a little bloody violence. So I ask myself whether I have a children's movie or not? After a while, I concluded, basically, that is, when it was a child with adult sensitivity, it really is not a good mix. <br /> <br /> So, for no one was naive to me, naive. If you do not have the nostalgic connection with the baby and this movie, if you do not want to see the two fighting robots that are fighting for each other, as I do, I would like to make you think you want to peel. Gordons is a brilliant director, but this film was just not for me. Well, at least I did not get an adult that I'm an adult. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 out of 5
