I have to admit that this "imagination" of the original 1968 film was a great despair. Especially considering Tim Burton as a movie. It's one of the most original Hollywood-produced directors, maybe the original and, I can say. Apes I really liked the original movie. When it first came out, people in the 70s expected a science fiction movie, but it was very surprising that this theory was misunderstood. The message was clear. A clear anti-war post. The fear of the cold war, the fear of using the world and fearing the use of nuclear weapons in the minds of the filmmakers. Thanks to these reasons, the film passed over all expectations and became an instant classic. Although the new film, "reconstruction" or whatever, does not allow us. There are no messages, ideals behind. It's just another summer culinary passion. <br /> <br /> Visible by Tim Burton will not leave. Dark and terrible settings were very good and, of course, make-up was wonderful. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not enough to prevent people from accessing the movie. It must be an exciting land or story. In this movie, the plot is very interesting and very badly conceived. The script is very lame and has gaps. It seems that this movie has been rushfully written. Why the explanation of the monkeys happened, and why he ruled the planet was very stupid and the writer's script proved ignorant. br /> <br /> For example; Why do monkeys speak English? Why were there other monkeys in the world than butterflies on the planet (for there were only spacecraft that left the ships on the planet). How did they make chimpanzees a huge number of thousands of monkeys growing at all. (I mean, we needed a million years to change the monkey from the man!) <br /> <br /> And finally, the mumble plane ended with a bad surprise. It is possible that the original film was thrown when it was so finished, but the audience expected it to end. In the end, many questions are raised, that is, YOU WANT, they do not have smart outfits. Did Theid say that he worked on a spacecraft, that is to say, without power, and he learned to go back in time and take his land alone, and what did he do to grow up with all women? And let's say that this would happen. Certainly, I would continue to be the same in history, as it would be like today's Washington! (Did not I mean not a large banana instead of the memorial?) <br /> <br /> Well, just to say something about the movie. Some great scooters. Helen Bonham Carter's character was very interesting and well-interpreted, just like Tim Roth's Theid. It was very good, it was sold out at certain points in the movie. Michael Clark Duncan was fine too. I was not happy with Marc Whalberg. Not much actor, and here is the character that is not massive in color. Very easy and not the original compared to Heston's character. And the main character does not have reason or place in the film. She was thrown into her eyes. There is hardly a word in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I think that when you think about future planet monkeys you will think about the original. It is finally forgotten.
