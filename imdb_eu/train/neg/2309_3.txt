I am very strange in the face of tolerance, but, in any case, some films are extravagant, they go beyond jewelry. Until now, you're giving up your mind. This is a movie. Understanding or explaining is impossible to try and believe that the movie is well received for drugs - this is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a very cute animation with a Japanese cat. However, things that are out of blue are twisted and occasionally disturbing occur, if you ask, if you lose something, in translation. However, however, why we should treat magical magic, defection, puking, fire ignition, switched on, switched on, switched on, etc. With pictures to be painted. All this seemed random and pretty. Curiously enough, and I do not know why, some see this as a genius. I do not get that.
