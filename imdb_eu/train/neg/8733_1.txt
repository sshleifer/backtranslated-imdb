*** Spoils with possible soil *** <br /> <br /> I like Dennis Hopper. I wonder why the police detective role 2000 approved The Spreading Ground. This movie sucks and why I tell you. <br /> <br /> It's about a small town that gets a contract for the sports field. A tournament: the killer is loose and bad for the business. The mayor makes an Irish Mobrekin deal to find the murderer and never make sure that he is in court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He also wants to catch this guy, but he's level and believes the system. The system wants to see work done. <br /> <br /> That could be pretty good. It could be exciting. It was horrible. First of all, this guy is named "Serial Killer". Err no. There are specific criteria and it is not one of them. On the first day, 5 children died bad, and I think 2 the second day. The whole movie is as long as the 48-hour period ... Serial Killer little action. I do not mind the reasons that end up giving them, which Serial Killers do for a long time. Suddenly, 7 children die in two days. That's Spree. <br /> <br /> Wrongly angry, it was theater. Hopper was the only name, and it was the only one that was close to breaking its part. Unfortunately, it somehow threw me down, and I think that it makes a lot more psyche parts, much better. That was just a good Hopper vehicle. He did not allow him to do good, but to do everything he could do. It's not a bad thing, I've seen so much better done. <br /> <br /> <br /> Irish boys, Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - Long Day's Journey Into Night), who is in charge. Their research is only a whirlwind edge. Contradiction? It's not really. He tries to play a wonderful and tough guy, which makes him a character in a wooden way. Maximum boring He did not scare He did not stir any excitement, except for boredom. I can not say how many times I have seen how long it was for the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> Another thing to say is that it was the feeling of a television movie. . You know what I mean. Poor production cost, low budget, re-use the scene to save costs. Only Yanno? But I like to compare them with these to insult them. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint was the director and director of this project. He broke more than a bunch of chefs. I can not sense that Hopper took the role as a friend to a friend. That's what I'm nonsense. Vanlint's first work was a director, as a filmmaker. Fortunately, it has been an educational experience for him. <br /> <br /> I do not end the end if you decide to torture yourself, but I want to get it all. ... Hopper. Being emotionally detected in a scene of a detective, just ... yes ... it was blah. I did not see any incident with any change in the total change. Very depressing <br /> <br /> Lasting 100 minutes and Rakodunak R and violence and language. Children under the age of 13 will not see any interest, so there is no concern. Not suitable for everyone. heh <br /> <br /> Skip to this. Then you will thank me.
