This movie has big stars, but an adult movie would not be interesting. You can not take your shot scene anywhere in between. The movie is filmed in a dream, that is, younger and shameless. The performance is worse than Keanu Reeves; The sex scene is exciting as it's as exciting as talking about a neighbor's college boy, and the conversation is worse as I've seen in a movie. The land was even worse ten times. I would follow the amateur career. Audio commentary was no good, but a cover film, but it was also a bad thing. If it's not a fan of Jenna James, here's not a few. 4/10
