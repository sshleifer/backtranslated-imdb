If you like the first two films, I would like to say no. This is actually a straightforward and unnecessary video directly, probably a TV show. Still Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is a silly but pretty scientist with his family yet and Szalinski Inc. She has her own company with her brother. Afterwards he also reduced his wife and his brotherhood. Now adults need to find a way to make home-grown children more meaningful. The other, for example, the repetition of two other things, just one or two things. a roller coaster for a toy car, swimming bathtub, and so on. Very poor!
