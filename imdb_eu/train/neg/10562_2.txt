With a low budget comic caper this movie has a low budget. Stupid conversations are completely stupid; Evening scenes are getting bored evenly, and most of the screen money saved a bunch of crashes and explosions in a car park in the last five-minute movie (a briefly brief threshold has been seen). At the beginning, this scene is the source of ruin and ruin for the main criminals of the movie - it's not the purpose of this film.) The entire film is reminiscent of Rodger Corman's studio, when he first gave the director money and a camera, but would impose Corman without discipline.
