save your money and see something else. This movie is empty. I did not want to go, but I needed it, so I thought I would laugh at least once, NOPE. It's not a single laughter, it was horrible! Chris Kattan does not play a good part of the comedy and will be "one night roxbury". This movie is completely clear, it does not have humor, and it is repeated repeatedly. Listen to me, and you can probably do away with these movies!
