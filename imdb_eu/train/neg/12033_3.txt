A movie about a small town with the same amount of Mormon and Baptist. The new family moves, overwhelm the conversation, act on the greats, the green salad jelly crushed carrots, and all others known as the 'Mormon joke'. Everyone outside Mormon culture will be hard pressed to tighten this movie. Anyone from Mormon culture will laugh a bit at the leg and there. Other Hessen films (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.) You will be better off looking at it than sitting by. The performance is mediocre. Jared Hess has had a lot more quality films like "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite". I'd recommend the two movies about this groaner.
