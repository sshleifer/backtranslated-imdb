Very bad. Why anyone who thinks this movie is good and even less fun is the real mystery. I like comedy as much as the next men and I loved "A Christmas story". Being the same director and based on the same author's memoir, I was surprised by the fact that this film is in every level quite impassable. Charles Grodin is great for dad for beginners. At other times, it seems that it does not have the same space, but it does not flow well. Everything was tired and forced. The joy of life that goes through the first film is totally lacking here: you just want to finish the movie. I would not recommend this movie for those who liked the "Christmas Story". It's bad 1/10.
