Do you like beautiful girls? Me too What is bad about beautiful girls? Nothing, then, why would I give the movie only 5 stars, 5 as Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto's "talents"? <br /> <br /> If you want to see beautiful people, I saw MTV or that. The movie is, however, a movie called action. So, by definition, a plot is not needed at all? I do not agree 100%, but let's say yes. So what does it need? 20 minute footage of 1 minute (maybe a bit too much, but it's been more than 20 minutes ...)? It would not be. But again, if you never knew, those who saw a part might not know what they eat for breakfast this morning, so let's just remind them ... maybe twice remind them of it? Surely they will not forget ... until at least one credit is cleared, of course! <br /> <br /> So, forget about the story, the development of the characters, the real emotions, the "performance" (and I do not think that walking and / or struggling women are responsible for playing women!) ... what does it leave? Both action scenes. The scenes of the actions are not bad and that's why I gave the movie 1 star than 2! I gave this movie a chance, but it was a waste of time ... Do you see or see better things, believe me ...
