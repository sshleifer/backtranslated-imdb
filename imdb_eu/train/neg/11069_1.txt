I've been cheated after seeing this picture. I felt like watching this movie 101 minutes like nothing. I do not understand what they were doing. It's hardly ever entered into the killing of Jeffrey Dahmer and does not end there. That film was left open as it almost felt safe. Soprano was like watching TV shows. It ends suddenly and will be another episode next week. Also, I saw part 1 as a part of what I saw in both films. Here are a lot of bad opportunities; They were lazy, they had run out of money, they did not know the story, they wanted to make Dahmer 2. After watching this movie they are very accurate. Jeffrey Dahmer walked through the woods. Suddenly I'm listening to this music, it will appear on the writing screen and says how Dahmer served for 2 years of sentence and killed a prisoner at the age of 34. to kill forests in jail How was the way it arrived? What would happen to the Dahmer trial? What is more detail? I can not explain what happened during this movie during the jump. In my opinion I said disbelief, "Is that the end?" I want to finish the review, I'm saying that Dahmer is still a good movie to do. I'd like to say to filmmakers, if you want to do this, do it right.
