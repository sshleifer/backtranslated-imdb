Without a doubt, they should call this movie called The Map, the biggest part of the total movie is coming up on a map of cemeteries. There's no need to mention the same boring planes on the map. The only thing that shows the same map is the grain of sweat that is constantly being constructed in front of our main character. This, of course, was a way of showing filmmakers to show what is incredibly hilarious months in the Immortal Hills Cemetery. Come on, did they show us a scene of death? All those on the map are listening to how the fly goes down, but we do not see anything. I have given a generous rating to some of how Bury Living I've been mantained to keep my attention, but I do not recommend this film to anyone. If you do not seduce maps or sweat, I recommend renting a better movie, such as I Spit On Your Grave or Drinking Your Blood.
