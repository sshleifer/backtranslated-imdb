I want to first point out that I am a Christian (and working in the film and television industry), so I understand what film makers want to work on. I am all positive and surprising messages if they are trustworthy with the nature of life (this is a fallen world and things do not always work ... even for Christ followers). I'm glad that others have positive reactions to the Christian message; The execution of me fell on the face of the movie. A movie raises his story and survives and here are stereotyped dimensions, explanations and changes in nature that are spontaneous, at least, incomprehensible. I think a movie does not have to put it on the club to get its message. I'm sure Kendrick Bros. It will improve over time and their storytelling methods too. Maybe someone's script can direct the next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports movies are not my first love, but the good ones (Hoosiers, Dreams Fields, etc.) inspire many different forms. If you are interested in a PG movie experimentation, take a look at Steven Soderbergh's "King of the Hill" look. All truth is God's truth ...
