This movie was intended to be a great movie and it really is. Popcorn is a kind of movie to eat and glittering graphics. Considering that, the film looks like it's not even the brightest Iron Man, but enough. Regardless of the action of Krispet and the special effects, the movie drops faster than Wile E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But this only makes poor film adaptation, not a poor movie. This movie is not satisfying for other reasons. The makers did not feel like they were more attractive to the eye. Long-awaited and promoted characters have been reduced to four cameo scenes. Wolverine, Victor Creed (never in the film Sabertooth) and Colonel Stryker are well-developed. I was surprised by the performance of Liev Schriber. The rest of the characters carry them on the path to boost the most important candy in the eye. Wolverine's character is fully developed after 30 minutes, like Sabertooth, although Victor is shooting a surprise later. <br /> <br /> It's a bad and bad adaptation of the "last boss" of the movie. The original character and it's hardly ever to develop, why show it. The filmmakers, of course, felt that everything they really had to do was to create a bad ass, they could do everything they wanted, and they stepped on the name of the famous character. <br /> <br /> Very depressing ...
