Silly, often ridiculous landing on a romp space ship causing disaster Tim (Jeff Daniels) and his orbit people. <br /> <br /> I've always been shocked by Daniels. He promised a number of promises and revealed in 1983 the "Congratulations" as trumpet of Shirley MacLaine's children. Over the years, Daniels was not able to get a good and proud hand. Instead, "Dumb and Dumber." Such comedy is alive. <br /> <br /> In this picture, the subject fails. It has at least led to some television situations. In the film, we constantly have slapstick and people are becoming monster by the government as a result of the capture of Martin Martin martyrs. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Brown is an excellent example of the unsuccessful part. film On television, an individual who was trapped in a story by Pamela Britton went to bed, when she was confused. In the movie version, Brown's red bomb, it makes romantic entries. <br /> <br /> Ray Walston's television star has a small role as a government agent, or is it that? <br /> <br /> Very disappointing to those who have enjoyed the television show.
