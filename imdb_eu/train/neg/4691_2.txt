The movie really blows literally. This British film is boring. <br /> <br /> What an exciting plot! A terrorist puts bombs on a train. How can the producers and producers of this writer turn into an empty story? Of course, Anne Vernon's wife will be left as Anne Vernon. No wonder Miss Vernon ever heard. After that, it was enough to finish his career. <br /> <br /> This elderly man, who loved trains and interferences, is a version of senile dementia of 1954. I thought I was very insulted to show this man, even at last.
