I need to add, if anyone really reads and still has not got any points. These other reviewers are not joking around, this is really the worst color ever you'll ever see. When the movie started, I could not believe something similar to see the world. <br /> <br /> They are not saying that they are like a home movie. It really does. As the "Director", he took on the family's hi8 camera (DV cameras and non-linear editing of computers), other equipment (lights, sound tools, etc.) were not captured by captive students, and filmed a movie. There is no script as it progresses. <br /> <br /> When I saw my TV was on the mono, so I have only one audio channel (left on the right speaker). At first I thought it was wrong. The movie was silent until someone spoke in a few minutes. I got up and changed to the other channel and suddenly I heard music and sound effects, but I could not hear the conversation. The sound was recorded in different blood channels! I mean, watch movies that can be fun, so good and good. I'm not sure of one of them. I mean, I admit being a young filmmaker. And you just want to watch bad movies, and you know if you want to prove it better. But it made me feel like I saw it. <br /> <br /> They were just as bad as their actors, the only thing that's good about it. I thought the little pin was hot and the scene of its bath was disappointed. His T and A would be a bit unimportant for a score of 3 or 4. But oh, no. If you want to make a movie, but it is failing, throw a free throw. He worked with Roger Corman.
