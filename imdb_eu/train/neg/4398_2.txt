Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors that I have considered throughout the whole two, and this was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie. Well, I can all say that I totally regretted that! Both of these great actors completely slip themselves, inevitably, because of their innocuousness and their own kitchens, which are ridiculous, but they do not do it. I can think of the only reason why the director decided to support his film as a friend, I can not think of anything more because this movie is very cheap! Luckily, Tim Robbins and John Cusack did not despair. I would recommend you avoid this movie, if you do not want your opinion on two broken actors.
