Ok ... I see a lot of bad movies. I'm proud about that. Sometimes there are some gems in B classified bombs. But I saw this movie is the worst. I like a good horror movie ... but with drawing and movement. The initial scenes looked pretty good. Music and images. From here, the hill descends. One of the main characters is a disability (calls to "Aids"). This, at the same time, threatens to reveal his secret. The film's focus was too much. So he calls his ears and suddenly stops his ear in where he should not be. It is not necessary to continue. So this guy has a great relationship with that girl and falls in a muffler and knocks his head at the end of the table. So instead of knowing his affair, he decides to eliminate the body. Now she is trying to find out where her sister is and where she is. Well, seeing her sister repeatedly (like zombies like the ghost) and directing the body's position, she finally finds it. Now, the body regains itself and killed the only suspect and confronted. The bad thing is that the plan did not have much. He only guessed his being a twin and found out the guy who poured his body. He did not even think he was dead. So everything is revealed and even though it's a gun ... he asserts in some way that he satisfies himself. So, the last scenes of the movies are twins who have left their "spirits" and waters. So you mean that this movie has to win victory. And two innocent people but two die. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie: images <br /> <br /> Bad things about the movie: music effects, long sound, and low-level directing. singing from all actors
