At least I say that the movie is sensible, but it's bad. Acting in the majority is not good (I think Sky only appeared to you) and you feel like you are. All the scenes to be meaningful are very profound, such as when Ng gets his parents. There are many details, such as the Sky-shoulder kanji tattoo, the girls in the refrigerator magnets and costumes, awesome decorations ... and music ... and clothes ... and everything. Actual life has never been like this movie. The boy said: "I am gay, not crisp." And not aware The comments are awful too, and I turned it off when he told Ng that he was playing like a lesbian.
