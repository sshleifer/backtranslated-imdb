The main problem with "power" is that there are too many characters in the film and subplatins that add no value to the movie. It's been getting bored for a little while, sitting around the seats to find something that makes the movie. It is possible that all the characters develop, but all the scenes in front of the movie are recycled, or they are only flat and interesting. Lumet never has enough time to get any support. He had to cut out some characters (hackman, wife) and more hardcore (Billings). It could have been a tough political thriller, instead of a bad mess and a bad performance on a sea. Because he shocked me. The performance of Gene Hackman did not equal. This note is here by Denzel Washington. Gere and others have done it much better elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet returns to the tough man he made in the 70's (that is, Serpico) and does not recover his success with "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe". Sidney has not worked yet, and it will probably never be. leave the drama of the group Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
