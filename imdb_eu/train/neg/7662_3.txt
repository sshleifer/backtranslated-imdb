This should be my type of movie. To be stumbled, it should be on my alley; hell, I like "Kongo" and "Allan Quatermaine" movies. In my hearts I have a smooth place for strange aliens / demon / adventure films. Let's get ahead, why did I see it first and foremost? <br /> <br /> 1. Terror / Science fiction almost always disturbs me 2. I am an archeologist, and this film brings a strange treasure. 3. Supernatural enemies with high quality FX. 4. I enjoy Christian Slater and Dorf in general. 5. Tara Reid is hot. <br /> <br /> So this film had a potential at least in the video store cheese and horror section, but it sucked the boys. Slater and Dorf are both traders and not as enterprising as I find them all ... Let's say, admit, both melodramatic. But today, about a lot of defects. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid. Although the movie is generally worse, Reiden's interpretation is horrible. We're not talking bad, I'm referring to Tara Reid's nomination for the worst year of performance. I do not know whether to be able to do it, but to go to the museum curator is just outside her league ... totally. Trying to take the roller of a researcher educator was not much different than what was being watched by poor pornography. I mean, that's not bad, it's laughably bad. Oh, and you're curious, it's not naked, a foolish and unnecessary scene of love, it's just a bra. But he is the owner of the plot and he has written a plot of land for 10 years. I did not realize the adaptation of video games after watching the DVD (otherwise, in real life, I'd be stupid enough). <br /> <br /> The tale goes to the story of Slater's childhood orphanage, something that has happened is a great deal of delays and amnesia, of course. In his adult life, Slater contracted a number of 713 units, a paranoid military force that apparently was evil or something that hunted. Because I think it was rebellious because Slater had to leave, I do not know, except in one of those voiced voices. The movie begins with Slater hunting objects, after completing his last piece after "selling Chilean mercenaries specializing in the sale of old-fashioned". It may be a bad budget, but you'll get the idea. <br /> <br /> There are some bad guys who want to create infertility in the bad medicine (no reason), children's experiments, the best demons or foreign human hybrids, "photons" bullets (demons can not sunlight) and , of course, Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone. <br /> <br /> Jesus, I can not cross the topical elements. The script had to work poorly, to limit the focus and give it some depth. I mean why is this evil nasty scientist? Now, mankind is condemned and is trying to save man. I think it's infected? How did that happen? Oh, he has one of the evil demons in the cage and he shoots out the blood to shoot himself. How did that happen? Why and where did he get super slugs (well, old science fiction stands use foreign parasites / demons to "spin their host") Of course, Slater is, like Blade, driven by super-slug, But his slug "was not totally fusible due to an electric shock" thank God. Oh, and people who are "confusing" in this corner do not know because they're a semi-alien / devil, and they're good community members when they give you some secret signals for killer zombies. Yes, we get zombies. <br /> <br /> So, many dogs could be entertaining, but no one is. <br /> <br /> Also, the end is completely stupid because it is not everything. First of all, a great deal ... a small dynamite can not manage anything. At least you do not see things, but really bad movie.
