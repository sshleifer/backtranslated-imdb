Kurt Russell (Steven Post) is working on the UBC series (United Broadcasting Corporation). He's not going to go anywhere, just as ridiculous projects like "Abraham Lincoln's dog," for studio directors - Lincoln, doctors and dogs are very popular. Joe Flynn's programming director (Francis X. Wilbanks) rejects Russell's proposals, but he does not know how successful a TV show has been. His secretary, Heather North (Jennifer Scott), who plays double duty as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee at a chimpanzee that Russell has to watch on television. It turns out that the monkey will see all the popular shows and will easily find hits. Russell chimps talent and discovers his career. Of course, things HAIRY gets Russell and Cast! <br /> <br /> Butterflies (handled by Frank Lamping) play well; While raffles get bored and / or pay attention to some scenes, chimpanzees seem to be of interest; they can be redirected or edited. There's a satirial light, think about television shows! ETA is a monkey who gets a flute (drinking in a Disney movie)! An eye-catching actress tries to make fun of television entertainers. In honor of Raffles's beer-guzzling, you can make a drinking game when you've guessed it and have seen it before. Here it starts - Hey, is not it "Dr. Bellows" from "I Dream of Jeannie"? Right down! <br /> <br /> **** Barefoot Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn and John Ritter
