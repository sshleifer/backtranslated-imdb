This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I got up and I had to leave Tape 4, but I stopped. I think I'm Masochist! Afghanistan? Come guys! Who is hiding from writers hiding from the idiom? I thought the main actor (George Calil) was particularly inept. In addition to the bad plays and the shaking of the camera, I thought the reason for using the 9/11 events was "Larson the Lunatic Implodes, near your screen" shameful and shameless in the case of 9/11 victims. Using a telephone call from his wife, Larson, one of the terrorist aircraft that made airplanes on that day was terribly sorry. The shake of the camera did not feel sick to me, thanks to that cold joy.
