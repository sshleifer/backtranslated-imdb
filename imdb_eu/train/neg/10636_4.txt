I really expected this show because of the quality of the actors and the Scott brothers. Sadly, my expectations fell! Once again, we believe that the KGB does not have what it is that it is a group of morions that do not have any idea. One moment, there is a quiet scene where 4 KGB agents could not handle a CIA agent. The cold war that occurred to me in front of these portraits of the spying game, I was totally misguided and totally miserable. It's amazing that the US does not involve WW2 and beyond to make objective films about them. U-571 is like a pathetic one, as we thought the United States got the Enigma machine, it is completely false. <br /> <br /> His company "Company" is shot and directed very well. Local locals are exceptionally successful. Alfred Molina makes a great performance with Keaton (the conflict between them very well). I really liked this show and I definitely see other 2 episodes, but I really want to try US portraying their Spy, soldiers, etc .. planet He gets it fast and removes credibility from 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
