Heavy-handed moralism. Writers use word as their character. Predictably, the plot points (say five times faster). A child's imitation of Britney Spears. This film has the main characteristics of Life that has denied life. <br /> <br /> Actually, I think that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo create a thoughtful, emotional movie about a hard topic, seeing things. They are not always black and white, being a crime with a definition does not necessarily mean a bad man, and there may be sharp situations, especially when the well-being of the child is placed. However, they are crushed in the preaching of their seriousness and the situations raised to move on plots. An interesting use of the cost-effective production and documentary style of the camera is not enough to fulfill its goal when performing the script and the performance. <br /> <br /> Logic tension often comes in danger: Soid first will try to help escape his participation in the documentary, then, in the same breath, he does not believe in him to help him out of altruism. Well, duh And for the man running, Paul is incredibly repulsed. Cristina's welfare is so important for her to escape from capture and jail or to escape her deportation, but if she does not want to go to Mexico, she is at risk of losing everything. Right. Talk about over-authorization. Thirdly, he uses the handset of phone company, Charlie, to Detective Bright, but he is not very professional at all, especially since he was old ... did he think he was convincing? Oh well, I would go in. CCH Pounder's Wims detective could clear the floor. <br /> <br /> I'd like to list things I'd like to be fair to. Um, I liked it. And I liked it at the seminar named Sexy. Dress the cross, always plus; Cross-dressing for youth, no less! Harry infinitely is as beautiful as Cristina. But it must be the favorite moment for the movie when it releases a detective by Cristina Not-So-Bright. Also, I find it very interesting in a small personality (I am much appreciated), that the black character is racist. It's a bad thing to throw away and do nothing more. <br /> <br /> The score is unusual and distinctive, but in general there is no context in context, any scene that increases mood or tension, except for a pathetic and severe ax. Every single person who feels that his plays does not seem to show enough: "If you're not sure, you're upset and have music to be proved" <br /> <br /> Due to intense dialogues and discourse, a depressing lack of text underscores da; everything must be written in the conversation, even if the body language is up. For example, all the fervent speech that Paul makes, and Mrs. Knight will strive to make sure that her child does not browse in bed in the morning. <br /> <br /> 'Papi, tell me Mama again' - what a shame, a great exposition, a generic dead wife! (She's always a widow, she's the most beautiful woman, what she's ever known. Why can not we see a woman like Shakespeare, weeping, fat, ugly, shameful, but deep-oceaned love? Now I have a story that would move me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Without it, it's not as fast as lightning, and then I do not feel the spelling.) A guy who drags a small child over the bicycle police, choosing a fight with a biker macho, but then cut off by a child? To mention Margaret Cho, so sad Is it we would see this in the "Cops"? <br /> <br /> <br /> Deus ex machina champion and the supreme: as an employer, I would refrain from verifying the green card. Is the hope of inspiration from a poster behind the azule? <br /> <br /> Plus some scenes, including the predecessor, threaten pornographic threats: 'Well, I'll do this for you, while doing something ... I can almost hear bowm-chicka-bowm-bowm. <br /> <br /> When parents see the remorse of Pablo's remorse, the mourning of his mother is terrified to feel like a movie. Unfortunately, this weakens his emotional words to be completely immersed, until he is doing it ballistically. The look would be more ambivalent here convincing. <br /> <br /> I keep continuing with the stupidity of the main character, visiting a mask without saving the comfort shop. dead tomb And why does not the mother consider her face to be considered before? "You know a lot ..." <br /> <br /> What is Soid and an artificially enhanced bartender with this totally useless and so-purpose scene? Character development? Tch. Little, too late <br /> <br /> In Detective Lightning, detective Bright says it's skeptical, Scorpio has to show how he knows how to hide it. And I do not think that fate is quite acceptable because it is a Voodoo Mumbo jumbo. <br /> <br /> Eventually, when Bright dies while holding Paul - wait, why take care now? His character is as much as Soid's. What, he must shoot, because he said: "Will I stop or shoot?" (He was in charge of his entirety until now). He was armed There was no deadly force. What's wrong with him to catch him to immobilize his leg? <br /> <br /> In the end, the son of admission to the death of her mother, Dr. Knight, gave peace to her daughter's death. And her child, Cristina's family, became the family's new ... I am angry that it's "a substitute for her girlfriend." Likewise, it is not realistic that a white couple would take the daughter of a man who had killed his daughter. I do not mean that people who are loving and loving. I can only say that the characters here are never developing so they can do so. <br /> <br /> It seems offensive that another IMDb reviewer has said that, of course, the woman had moved. sappy scenes I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for some momentous emotions. Nebot writer, co-director, co-director said that he himself had too much clothing. This production. Chefs can spoil too many broths, but a chef only finishes a special after school. <br /> <br /> In the end, the title of the film does not have anything to do with the story and more. Regard, with disgrace and loss of recollection, you will never see your money again.
