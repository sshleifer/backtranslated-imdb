... I have read about this movie well on the Internet somewhere, and many were criticized for the bad and bad movie. And I could not agree more about it. Then, when I saw this movie on the DVD, I thought about it twice and then I commercialized this movie on TV. Fortunately, I saved my money for those pieces of shit. I swore the movie because they slept me and soon appeared to me that the movie could not be satisfied. So I can not decide how to make the movie, but anyway ... it's horrible. Regarding all those who liked this movie, I would like to apologize for the fact that this film was flamboyant and how this movie came to mind. I do not know what you think of that movie?
