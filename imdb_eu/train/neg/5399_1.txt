SPOILERS Often Hollywood Shakespeare adaptations are a fun piece of cinema. Beautifully shot, well-interpreted and loyal texts. Branagh's "Henry V" and 1993's "Much Ado About Nothing" feature films. Therefore, when they see "Love's Labor's Lost", they are so desperate as desperate waste. Unfortunately "Love's Labor's Lost" is horrible! The king of Navarra (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends have been drinking and women have abandoned their studies for three years. However, the Enigmatic Princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) and her ensign will arrive. Soon love is in the air and in the mind of the prince of philosophy. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, you realize that this movie is not quite Shakespeare. In Ken Branagh, when he was taken to music in the 1930s, he is still on the plot and the script continues, but now he has opted for a serious musical taste. Classics, "The Way You Look Tonight", "Let's Face Music and Dance", "I'm in Heaven", breaks down weak songs and strong feelings that all do not fit here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> </ p> </ p> <p> Ken Branagh and friends can enjoy this movie, but they bring together abdominal roles. <br /> <br /> Eight main actors (four men and four women) are completely wrong and the only ones are positive. On his behalf, Timothy Spall is a really big improvement. <br /> <br /> Indeed, only one individual deserves the film to be praised, and this is the recognition of Nathan Lane. Lane proved that she was a genre of comedy over the years, and adds humor to Costard's humor again. <br /> <br /> It does not really mean. "Lost in Love's Labor" is worth a long laudation about an old story by Branagh. Unfortunately, that's where the positive ends. Pleasure, play, sing and build "Love's Labor's Lost" is the weakest adaptation of Shakespeare over the last forty years. It must be avoided as a plague and never be done. Branagh's awful and desperate choice, and here's his next best effort.
