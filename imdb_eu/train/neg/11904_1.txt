The end of violence and, undoubtedly, the Million Dollar hotel has forgotten the idea that Wenders has lost his opinion, by telling a compelling story through a mobile image map. There, she saddles the Land of Plenty's coffin, afraid of her, an incredibly imaginative, sentimental and topical movie. The characters are completely flat and stereotypical, writing, plots and direction are the best, at best. For the first time, I was impatient for the end of the movie, so I could move forward with my life. Uncle, a renowned warlike accessory, looking at what patriotic patriotism from heaven looks like ... it seems to me that it's so easy and pathetic, the work of a filmmaker who almost never made a solid screen on the screen. What happened I am afraid of days of experimentation, sensitive writing and interesting shooting options. We look forward to his inspiration ... at the Toronto Film Festival, when I saw the movie, it was presented by Wenders. Without modesty, he offered: "I hope ... no, wait ... I know that you will enjoy it in the next two hours." I'm afraid I will not go wrong anymore ...
