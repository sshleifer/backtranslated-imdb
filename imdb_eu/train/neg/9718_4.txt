A innocent man (Steve Guttenberg) has a single night stand with his boss's wife (Isabelle Huppert). She finds a woman from afar (Elizabeth McGovern), but she can not call the police, because they could spurn Gutenberg's boss (Paul Shenar). Guttenberg, therefore, is a honest citizen, when he finds out that another woman is attacked and attacked by an hour later, she presents her first attack and only sends information provided by Huppert. Well, never give false witness against your neighbor, as they say. <br /> <br /> An easy attempt to help police a murderer crush. When McGovern is close to the victim, he picked up the horns of what happened immediately, but agrees he's silent for now. But then he finds himself in court in Guttenberg, identifies heavy (Greenquist) and finds out by discovery NEAR-SIGHTED and can not identify objects remotely, and even less, faces. (It is not important, after all, to never see any snipe). The plot has almost labyrinth. Guttenberg squeezes the main suspect when Huppert dies too. <br /> <br /> Now he is arrested and escaped with McGovern now with sympathy. Guttenberg and McGovern create a plan to capture the murderer. It will be well. A mysterious bum will continue in a haunt, and McGovern will play like a doxy that catches the murderer to try to kill him. But everything will be fine, see, because Guttenberg will not only look at it, and not only warns the police after a few minutes he will enter the police, but a stick will be available. case <br /> <br /> Do I ask the spectator's alert, in the planned mode? Elizabeth McGovern has an interesting bone structure. Sometimes it seems like all barizpila and little mouths, but it's alive. Steve Guttenberg has her hair on her neck and that's all. Otherwise, he will be as defenseless as the character he plays. If Isabelle Huppert works, it's not clear in this movie. The murderer is so full and therefore looks like Twilight Zone shows a deformation mask on fatal heirs. <br /> <br /> Was not the director, Curtis Hanson, doing? "LA Confidencial"? That was a good job. Here, everything looks rough and resembling little pieces. Before the inevitable violent violence, a uniformed police officer has been forced to postpone McGovern's rescue, and the scene is awful. Dick Olsen has just become a consumer as a consumer. He is smart and always trustworthy. Paul Shenar, as a grocery store, has a striking face on stage and also works well. <br/> <br /> <br /> McGovern is the link that catches the attention of the killer, where he is playing in the pool. A couple of hairy apes in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, were shot in a far-away bar where I was. How to determine the interior is clear that this is a dangerous and dirty thinking. Actually, it looks more elegant than on the screen. <br /> <br /> In general, this is Hitchcock's territory and the eye brings tears to what he would imagine what he would do with that story.
