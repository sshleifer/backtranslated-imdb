This 'movie' must be the highest number of steamed C * ^ p. I have seen what I can say more than BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD. There's nothing to save this "movie" and I'm not asking you to talk about making a movie. If you are thinking of seeing this, you should know that the story is that two garbage men drag to save earth. Films like Men in Black have been split up and together they have come back to make this "comedy", but they have completely failed. Please try this movie (save yourself).
