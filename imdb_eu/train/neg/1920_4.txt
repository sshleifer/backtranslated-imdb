I did not say that Twister's night was awful, but it was not too great. The best half end. It seems that when a type of film is released, one second must be at the same time. (Think of Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's peak) Twisters tonight is only worse than Twister and with special daily effects. <br /> <br /> I did not play anything against actors, even though they were not excellent, the film itself, directorate, special effects, was a strange interpretation of the whole story. Tornados hit a town and, basically, the film is about families and friends who try to deal with damage. <br /> <br /> I really do not know why the catastrophic movies look like duplicates. It has been released with one another, but that would be better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
