Many of the 3 losers who try to capture the spirit of universality during the summer breaks by universities are not able to become stupid. The problem is that when these losers try to spend more than fifteen years of college, they are assigned to be the senate of the next vice president to look after a woman's daughter. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the daughter is not known, but of course everything goes away. The girls make dreadful appearances, exotic dancing and other nonsense. <br /> <br /> It's really impossible to get this movie a bit worse.
