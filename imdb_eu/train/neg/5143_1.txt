99.99% of those who watched this movie is Brazil, because I am still in English because it is the language of this website. <br /> <br /> This movie is a part of Cr * p. . I watched loooong for a little while. Children are awful. Especially the boy. For the first time I saw someone with less face than Arnold Schwarzenegger, and read a single-tone tone, which was before a class of a 5-year-old boy. How can someone so badly be the main actor of a movie? On the cover of the story is so easy that my daughter (3 years old). It's easy to write in a napkin and say it in 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> Someone can only enjoy three films: 1) You are young; 2) Depending on the stupidity of Globo, you think everyone with Globo seal is awful; 3) You have serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs!
