This is the worst entry into the IMDb. All former reviewers play in the theater. This is not a movie. On the other hand, the DVD on "The One" is just an extraordinary premiere. There is also 90 minutes to be listed here. Actually, Jet Li is only 13 minutes worth of martial arts. and his thoughts. So this entry for the IMDb is a bit like that. Do not listen because all the other reviews are incorrect. You can trust me, dear reader, BS. Never feed me. <br /> <br /> And that's true. I think this is the "One" Reviewer I am.
