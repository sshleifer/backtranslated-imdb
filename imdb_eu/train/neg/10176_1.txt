GENERAL LIGA: RETURN UP THE MINORITIES (1998) ½ * <br /> <br /> Protagonists: Written and directed by Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, John Warren and 100 minutes. Some languages ​​and violence) Blake French: <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, John Warren's new comedy is "LEAGUE MAJOR: BACK TO MINORS TO". scene It consists in a sequence, a strong coach throws a baseball behind the wall to knock cement and go back and fall on the face. It's not a lot, but except for a few liners, this movie has to be offered ... it's enough. <br /> <br /> This movie is not just structural problems, especially undeveloped, predictable and written, but at the same time very bad. The viewers have no critics hate this film as well. It's so popular it's not fun. <br /> <br /> How often do the same film about sports? In recent years, we saw the same material as the "Air Bud: Golden Receiver" and it was as bad as this movie, it is even worse. "Air Bud" was at least one family. "The main anti-league minors" is very common for free families, to see each other on Sunday afternoon. Children for adults. So who is this movie? Teenager? Older people People who are so entertaining would rent something like that? <br /> <br /> This film, like many others like that, has the basic point: they conquer all teamwork. Yes, as well as the great moral that he wants to prove. We have been bad for those who have already seen and saved so many times and so much talent and intelligence as their cheerleaders are dancers men. Somewhere, foolish advertisers make up their "routine comic roommate," as a suit they make themselves boys as "suck", "a fast ball for children with an hour glass" - "that guy has fallen a bit to find something lost, maybe he was in his head "Someone needs a nap" and "see a sunny sunset ever". The characters have so much meaning from each other and we have never been known by name. And right there, the only scene of a talk show about group work is so popular that it's almost fun. <br /> <br /> "The Great League of minors is so bad, it loses everything that ends in the middle of the good closing sequence, the good team of Baseball has come back, they will win, and power comes out." I thought for a minute He concluded that the bins were in the process, but actually his false last scene only exists for a few minutes to launch, a movie that is basically unrelated to the movie. It's not fun to throw so much joke into it. There's another fun conversation coaches and players in a position that no longer wants to speak together for a long time, the coach replied: "You are old enough, slow and too fat." The reaction of the players will die, but this scene definitely does not match your time. This movie, and definitely, is not the percentage of your money. <br /> <br /> So, here is another introduction to this genre of film The frightening one, that is, another who has his own script, who has failed before seeing it, and another so popular is more than once. <br /> <br />
