I am absolutely surprised to see why this film is about why, even less, it is considered by most critics. <br /> <br /> There is a keyword that describes this. The film has its own personality - rhythmic. <br /> <br /> The simplest explanation of this is the use of the director or the abuse of music. In the first half, the reggae melody is very dull three times (often too often). In the second part, The Mommas And The Papas "California Dreamin" is played at least seven times, usually at the highest level. Godsakes, whether you liked it or not in advance, would be completely wrong. Think of it, some have seen this movie four or five times. This means that they've heard it with Kalifornian Dreamin in 28 or 35 times ... <br /> <br /> All unexpected hyper-repetitions (nothing in the story) would surely remain, the rest of it had a merit-ful merit , or if the story were in any way. <br /> <br /> But it's not. <br /> <br /> I was glad to find Bridgette Lin's only charge. and still Asia The Invincible plays the cover and the sun. Although that was pretty quickly dressed. <br /> <br /> I am sure that this film is going to invite some very bad cartoons to come to the forefront of fame. <br /> <br /> I've just been warned ... if there's never before seen a HK movie, do not start with this. <br /> <br /> If you feel compelled to watch, avoid watching it in the cinema. Fast progress and silence are the essential tools to survive here. <br /> <br /> You have been warned!
