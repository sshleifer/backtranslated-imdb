For the first time see 2/2002 2/2 - 10 of 4 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery ?? / Thriller, too hilarious to play ridiculous. Although this is a very talented one, this movie is a great preview and the budget is not among the audience. The public at the Festival is not a fool, and I hope they do not end up permanently filling in with some pile of stars, even if they are involved with them. We think that this movie will be something that will be at the beginning of the anti-penalty against the Connery chapter, but it's just a standard created for the audience, so it's a running of the mill. . We change the character badly, because we make a portrait of the story we need, and before that time we need to be prepared. Yes, there are some good actions, especially in Blair Underwood, Fishburne and Ed Harris in psychoprophyla, but the story does not work until almost the end of the long-awaited event.
