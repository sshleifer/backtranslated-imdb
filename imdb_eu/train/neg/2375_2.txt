Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth part of Elm Street Nightmare and again a bad sequel. I think this is linked to the latest Dream Child's latest show. I was fortunate enough to get a birthday DVD on the Nightmare Elm Street series, so I saw all the conclusions. I can say I'm increasingly disappointed, even with these follow-ups, at least two at the end, Freddy has lost his edge. Nearly writers are trying to make Freddy want to offer his soul and are instead destroying the story. He did not need a sequel to Robert Englund, which is under Freddy Krueger's statement. <br /> <br /> Freddy is back, but we do not know anything, daughter. Maggie, she does not know she is her father, but soon finds what her dark secret is and wants her help. He has to make every effort to face his powers, but it is tough for a loving father with a good memory. Irrational, right? But Freddy does not give up in his own way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Freddy's Dead: The latest nightmare is also presented with 3-Dan, radicals, right? Take note of sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequel, linked to the fifth sequel of Elm Street's Nightmare, I'd rather see Elm Street's second honest Nightmare. This had a bad performance, stupid editing, and a bad idea for almost a story. I did not like his concept and Freddy Krueger really damaged the whole idea, the master of nightmare death, or Father Knows Best. <br /> <br /> 2/10
