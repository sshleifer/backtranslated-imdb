OK ... this movie could be very good! All generations came up with Thunderbirds and loved it and had some features that wanted to find this movie on a Thunderbirds movie. The craft itself and Tracey Island really took it to the big screen, and still supported the designs that were still in love. Sophia Miles, it was just wonderful, as Lady P and Bill Paxton did not exactly anticipate with Jeff Tracey, it was strong enough ... but then the kids take the equation for 8-year-old children they were asked to believe. It could fly a 200-ton machine. <br /> <br /> There's not much movie about Jonathan Frakes threatening me with a damp fish and centered around laughing at how hard my money earned me. In the film, Alan Tracey felt so badly felt that the machine could fly, at least 19/20. Actually, these are simple machines that can be used in these cases. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film would not be serious or inadequate. He tried to sermon the homage and fell into his face in general. 3/10 (2 for machines, 1 Lady P)
