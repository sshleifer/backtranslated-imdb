I did not get behind the left with the theology of the series, but nevertheless I have searched the books and I read 8 of them. Good writing and interesting story. However, I did not have much hope for the movie. A Hollywood-based series and a legendary movie that had been produced had no tradition in Hollywood. So it was done independently ... and I feel like I'm seeing a long TV program. It was not like a movie; There was no movie about this "experience", someone knows what I'm talking about. So, as a result, he underwent a movie, and low-budget special effects were bad for me. <br /> <br /> In addition, I think that Gordon Currie was as rugged as Nicolie Carpathia. Reading the book, NC was my impression that it was a fascinating, fascinable, surprisingly beautiful guy who speaks English with almost an accent with a stunning accent. So I imagined someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, Clay Aiken's pencil has been found, it seems to be a Best Buy monthly employee, and he gave it a bad false accent. So I lost a few stars there. The movie is not convincing when it does not look at the suppository way of the wicked master. <br /> <br /> The play was fine, but nothing at home. Some scenes - like a conversion scene (you can not remember which) - they were real seats for me. And some or all of the Christian musicians, there was no seating, just like Kirk Cameron in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was not a bad film, but it's not for me. Please note that the book, people, is much better.
