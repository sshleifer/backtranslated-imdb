I am a fan of Ram Gopal Varma, but I could not believe that he made this movie. I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag does not approach Sholay real. It does not leave a permanent impression on the viewer. Ram Gopal Varma does not create chemistry among the characters. There is no partner between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant Raj). There are not more than two scenes in the painting together. Amitabh Bachchan's and Mohanlal's front court is a remarkable outward sequence. Amitabh Bachchan should not make the movie. Ajay and Sushmita tried their best but did not use it anymore. Rajpal Yadaven's voice modulation - is not effective and quite absurd. Mohanlal has made full justice and has once again proved that he plays face to face expression and body language. The rest of the cast was below the expectation. This comic situation adapted to the original musician Sholay was blurred in the film. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma could work on the script, but it was only caused by controversial anti-movies, and was just as favorable. He made this Aag. No fire
