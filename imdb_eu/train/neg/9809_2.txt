Some ask why there was not Mrs. Murphy films follow. This movie will be completely silent. Disney was not an appropriate studio for this movie. MAYBE Touchstone (well, it's owned by Disney, but it would be older). The movie is too big, because the books are not. Casting is wrong in the characters. The characters do not make any book making. And why did a Tucker change? The girl is in rough books! To get this film to the boys? Sheesh And where was Pewter, gray cat? One of the funniest characters in the book is missing. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but Disney's job was wrong. An animated feature film, perhaps on the cover of Don Bluthen's work, Ms. Murphy would be a better film. In general, I give it 2, because Disney has made at least a series of books that have earnestly rated the series. But I would like to do it better. In any case, I still have books to entertain.
