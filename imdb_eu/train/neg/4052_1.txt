I've seen "if?" Since 1968, I've been looking at movie ads, so I wanted to see it at last. Britain's public school could be an overview of an American who has never traveled, and has lost some social references, but I thought the movie was horrible. Others, as others have pointed out, almost take up the whole film for the great upsurge in the way it was slowly. On the other hand, what happens if the final scene is real or imagined is not a rebellion, but a shooting rampage. There is a big difference. <br /> <br /> I know it's been wrong to judge the movie in the next movies, but it can not be avoided here. A person wrote on the message board when we did not want to compare the movie with Columbine High School and Virginia Tech events. Even though Klebold, Harris and Cho are on the one hand and Travis (Malcom McDowell) has a shining difference, I can not see it. These four deceived the cleansing of the world that would create no responsibility for rockets. <br /> <br /> What brings me: why do Travis and her mother work? In a scorned school? They are grown or near. They are not yet in a military prison, like the detained "The Hill", a much better British film of that time. Nobody wants to go to university and take pace with attacks, except for parents who need parents to have their children's character. I had the opportunity to join the maid with the University, but I could not make sense and cruel commands that my future "brothers" gave me. I have taken the consequences of not being "non-existent" with the establishment offered by Frats, and I can not say I regretted it. <br /> <br /> Travis Lenin has a second impression (hangs his credible picture). It is obviously in his room and in the next elections he will be free to work with the installer's union or Michael Foot. If you want to be Jack Kerouac, then take the road and start writing. What benefit can the world give to a motorcycle to cheat and to ditch in its room? <br /> <br /> Sometimes Brando Mopes has to be like a person who has responded to the scene of "The Last Tango in Paris". I had to go to a date with the beef-maker in shoes. In the real person, said the person, a listener would say: "Why would not you be frustrated? Should the shoes change?" - Do not let the fictional characters compete with self-compassion because they do not dare to explain an alternative non-signaling action. So here it is.
