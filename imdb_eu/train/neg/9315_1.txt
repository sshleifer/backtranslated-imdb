This movie was very bad! It was wonderful! It was wonderful! I can not stress. The performance, direction, story, characters and everything about it was bad! So crispy and topical. Do not touch the lid or label "Texas" massacre "does not laugh." You're kidding! It was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The first 2 minutes of the film are good for Brendan until he reaches the main character, turn off. From what I got from the movie, a bunch of ugly, annoying and immature people go to a hut in the middle of the woods, and kills the clowns of children's rhymes in orderly and original ways. <br /> <br /> This movie was a waste of my time and money, and it would also be your loss of money and time! Most of the films I made progressed, because I was so horrible, I wanted to see how bad an actor died and STILL did not deserve it! You only have time to look at the cover. This is seriously the worst film EVER! Rating: it's not worth it.
