Totally unforgettable Especially due to weak influence. It's the first movie that I've seen with Dax Shepard. To my surprise, it has lived in the late 90s. I thought it was new, because its performance was so soft. Also, I can say about Liv Tyler. Although I've seen a lot of good reviews on other films, Clare Cooper gave her a unique personality. Liv is not the character, a passionate and emotional nature like Diane Keaton, but it was quite rare to see her lines as whispering. There seems to be no way that there was a good chemistry among actors, and I think that Diane Keaton felt this too. It's a great actress, but this movie seemed a little bit higher. He felt that he wanted to get that movie as soon as possible. I did not blame him.
