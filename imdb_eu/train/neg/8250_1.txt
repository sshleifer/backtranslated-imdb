I ordered the Korean movie to be an extra and I was interested in how it happened. <br /> <br /> When I see it, I can say that I am ashamed to have a part of it. I feel very embarrassed for the British people who made this British "comedy" very much. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, the film is predictable, boring, dull, monotonous and unhappy, from a distance that I looked away from a different belief on the screen. When you're really watching the movie, it's hard to understand how romantic and romantic comedy can be. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad story, but a bad movie. In a single scene, you can see a runner or assistant director when it shows the description of S.A. I will post details about 'Goofs'. <br /> <br /> On top of me, emotions filled me (disappointment, rage, embarrassment?)
