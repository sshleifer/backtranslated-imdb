The worst movie I've not seen, but it's definitely not very good. I am a paintball player, it is a great change to the airborne and to go from the forest to the airfield. The film represents similar qualities. First, the movie begins with a group that is trying to shoot "this type of" Phantom. For professional teams, sweaters and magicians are shown. The guy is a bush sport. It's not much mistaken in the movie, but what he perceives most was very cursed. They are a wooden player who does not have bundles of good guys and who dream of "getting better guns". Another team chooses and constantly insulates them in the woods and they play blah blah blah. Phantom helps wildlife children and prepares them and all this boat. <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with the movies? Well the quote is a giant thing, the paintball movie would not be bad, but the quote is pretty low and it's made by an amateur movie. There is no big name in this movie and the theater is very much like it. Paintball's perception is also bad. It seems that everyone wants to say they're fast and sharp. In my opinion, it was a bad movie, and it does not give a real perception of what paintball is. It's honest that real paintball is not a friend, it's not "respect" and playing with rules. Do not watch this movie and then you expect "4 da 1 !!" to scream.
