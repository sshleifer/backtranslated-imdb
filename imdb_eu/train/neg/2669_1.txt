I rarely change a comment about a few movies. But I can not understand how this has been done. Who made it? How did they think they were able to do a feature film? Did they have a weekend course at the film school, they had a great deal of proof of their dad and they had kidnapped David Badiel's family before they were there? Or was it, in any case, a family / distant relationship of long-term friendship through a mere and wrong friendship? I do not care, I do not want to know. Although she was very embarrassed, marking her, she smudged its lines and hid her face from the camera. Meanwhile, the DOP must have the ability of the neighbors, there was no sound design, all screenplay, direction and editing were abysmal, and, in fact, the apathy that is bad at the time means that they do not know how to bother. Spend some more films of my life.
