Actually, Al Gore (and his supporters), something that does not go down directly with the theory of "consensus". <br /> <br /> If there is a consensus, why is it "believers"? It feels generally global warming to avoid anyone being questioned. <br /> <br /> Why is there anyone who does not line up global warming? Fulfilling the accusations of being stupid, or in the name of oil companies (apparently, a professional global warming researcher is not in any position you are marching in this wonderful person of this world ...) Why is this need to know how to determine the whole, when the nature of science is challengingly challenged? Put some ideas on questions answered, read by Michael Crichton's crude oil predators ... Waiting for it, it's rich and not a payroll for oil companies. It took a great risk for the race because the greens and the other worshipers of Kyoto did not do the truth and investigated the truth he said. By the way, did you know that keeping the Kyoto protocol is going to be a bit of a temperature, its sponsor by according to? Al Gore made some questions in the environmental room, he could not escape from a penny again, if he decided to run again. <br /> <br /> So who is the bargain ...?
