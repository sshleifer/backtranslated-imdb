Gee, what a gap was! I do not know what people find so scary that "The Grudge" finds what they find. The director plays a trick (I should be very good, very stylish) and then repeat it throughout the movie over and over again. As a result, I was surprised at the first quarter of the film, but once I discovered the drilling I almost slept when Grudge was more and more predictable. Finally, I can say that at the beginning there are movies that are much better in the genre, because the pre-recorded "The Ring" was so dirty that the money is to buy "The Grudge" tickets.
