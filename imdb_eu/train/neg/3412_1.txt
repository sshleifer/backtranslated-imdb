First, IFC drives the country and the country, and now this. The difference between the Stinker and the Pink Panther difference was the Town and Country clock. This is not. <br /> <br /> I can only believe that this cast was signed in order to return to Europe with someone else. Belushi is hard. His scene with Candy (Dom DeLuise Z-grade) was torture. Talking about torture, a tale of five-year-old Shepherd, and I bet that the detainee of Gitmo would crack it like nuts! <br /> <br /> The real "Crime" (with clear green) Shepherd's character: sour. The wife put Monte-Carlo casino half a million dollars! If you buy it, Arizona has some seaside property here that interests you!
