Fluff a little and pointless (bloody fluff, but fluff). Poor written, dialogue wood and wood. You do not mind that the characters (even the actors themselves) live or die. Little grace or charm, little action, the whole thing little point. Perhaps the set and setting will be interesting - the gaps between the boards of all buildings may be true in life. The encounter is not needed and attended, and the character Hoppalong Cassidy is boring and inept.
