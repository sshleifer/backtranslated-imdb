I'm sure that operations were the favorite in the Dames newspapers. You just have a plot of land, maybe you're worried otherwise. And if you have some moody activities in other activities, you have some curly curves on the screen so you can fill in the mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, there is not everything Operazio Dames has. It has been set in the Korean War, where it is accompanied by a GIS platoon, who has to go too far into the United States with a British tommy. Suffice it to be bad, but these boys also use USO girls and their choreographers in their native country. <br /> <br /> You know what the film is sad about when the female generation finally accepted. In army and battle situations. These USO bimbos are set for female liberation over the years. Actually, the professional sergeant in charge of these men also can not keep him in play. <br /> <br /> But it was probably better to remember what the units came from. da. This name is no better if I do not accept anyone's efforts. <br /> <br /> Operations are Dames's flop team.
