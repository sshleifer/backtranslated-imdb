Faces are cut, throats cut out, blood jokes, and finally three main characters are both depressed and dying. They hit the dog Kevin Costner with a shotgun. Why would you like to see such a movie? Good violence when you kill bad guys when it's valid, not vice versa. For example, the Evolution of World Investment and Eradication, where you can enjoy justice when you kill demons. In this movie, the good are cut. See the difference? Why would anyone want the movie that releases the audience? In such a beautiful photo, the beautiful picture and the skill of editing is the loss of talent. Put this into a superb body category.
