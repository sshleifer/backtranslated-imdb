Okay, if you're looking for other Bastketball Diaries, this is a completely wrong movie. <br /> <br /> I'm about two brothers. Max, younger, cocaine is highly dependent. Adam, the oldest, is a doctor. This movie shows the extreme drop in the number of medications that actually reduce reality. However, it is not. Cocaine can be fun, regardless of the situation. Most of the movie focus is based on Max and its partials. In the end, Adam can not even get rid of work stress (perscription drug). <br /> <br /> This movie is almost unchanged. Cocaine really does not go down on what you really like, it has a boring budget and low-budget scenes, and the older brother's influence, Adam, is horrible. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to manage the movie to receive and receive prizes, it's not a heart-bang. If you want a clear and real story about the extreme world of Drugs, if it's not buying The Basketball Diaries. And you will notice the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this movie, but if you think you want to enjoy it. Try and watch ...
