I had to compare two versions of Hamlet to the Shakespeare class and unfortunately I received this version. Everything plays (actors cast a direct camera on most of their lines) to the camera's shots (all medium shots or near ones ... scenery shots and small shots of small shots) were absolutely awesome. I saw it during the spring break and it was very safe to feel that I had come out of my 114-minute vacation. Any imagery is recommended.
