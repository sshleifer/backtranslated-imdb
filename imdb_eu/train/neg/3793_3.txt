Puppets have always been problematic. And it has not been seen with the original story of Hoffman. <br /> <br /> In the ballet, the story is almost in the second half when the story is when Clara (or Marie) travels in this version. See a series of dancing of sweets character. <br /> <br /> There is an infinite number of times in the story that reinterpret the story in multiple ways (not always successfully) to compensate for the weak ballet books. > <br /> Balanchine's version does not make any sense of play or story (because there is a lot of drama and mystery in the wonderful action of Tchaikovsky's first feature). The result is an unforgettable Christmas holiday, almost nothing happens and where dance (the less-known) is not particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> The performance of more than one pantomime, especially Drosselmeier, may be suitable on stage, looks like a stupid flicker on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, things are not much better in reaching the sweets kingdom (Act II on the stage). version). Although there are some outstanding choreographies, most of the choreography is boring. This, definitely, is not Balanchine. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is considered as a master of abstract dance, but I always felt that if there were less success as a creator of narratives. Seeing the cinematographic version of The Nutcracker's scenic production, this only confirms this approach.
