The plot is about the death of small children. Hopper is the one who needs to investigate the murder. The film seems to have a daughter with problems. In the end, the serial killer has been captured. That's it. But before getting to know you, you have to see the great vision of all the actors. It's unbelievable how bad the actors are, such as Hopper. That way I could continue, but that's one with my loss of time. Do not watch the movie. It has warned me
