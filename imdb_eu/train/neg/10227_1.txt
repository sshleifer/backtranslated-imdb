It's a wonderful story about a man married to the man hiding himself and then "hiding" his "unknown" wife. At the same time, he is sexist and racist. We never know, for example, why a woman wining a respect for a Indian warrior can not cope completely with her husband. Or why his teammates are so eager to watch over looking for "real man". This was sensible in Hollywood fifties. <br /> <br /> The scene is stupid because he is riding himself and he really catches the second penalty - and then he takes off his horse. It does not matter for the first time that he would probably lose his eye, which would be quite difficult for him to take it! Later, he prevails in the fight against the Indian bodyguard, where he becomes the first two-thirds to make matters worse. It's the second wind. Later, he negotiates successfully because he denies that some Indians with wild (because they are all) are his "cap". He does not mind that he is not a diplomat and is negotiating with them for many years. And he continues to discourage him from fascinating him, keeping him in mind and not keeping him back. Just like women did the way down the road. <br /> <br /> In the end, no one roots believe in his roles. Madison is a jerk, realistically lucky. Fleming wears her hair and it hurts a lot, but it's totally convincing as the hearth is. The only reason for her is that Madison wants to bind her with the fugitive knight and want to drag on a ravine before the end of the movie. Madison Fleming's way is so predictable and it's so much an obstacle to seeing if your sweat is irritating to women that hit the dolls. Even if you see them as dolls, you will be completely bored by the lack of suspicion. <br /> <br /> The loss of time. The landscape is also sad. Give this a great miss.
