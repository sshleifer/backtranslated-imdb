Hoax is complete ... <br /> <br /> The film has been shot in the Indian state of northeastern Rajasthan. Look at the scene of harassment - the vehicles are in India; Writing everything is Hindi - the language of India is used. The route leads to typical Jaipur streets. Also, the palace is in Ameren - Jaipur, 10 kilometers from Rajasthan. The filmmakers on the DVD Bonus (film) seem to have risked their lives in Kabul and around. Almost all of his action scenes are filmed in India. A scene that looks like a group of songs around the fire is so fake that they have not thought of changing Afghan folk songs. Rajasthanik has just recorded a folk song. How can I find out that I've traveled a lot? They're only a bandgap to increase this topic. I want to deny the filmmakers.
