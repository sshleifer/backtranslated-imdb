This movie still makes a bone that thinks I think. This movie was not only bad in a small budget, poorly played, and so on, all these things were definitely. The problem of that movie seemed to make the spectator disappoint, and with great success. What do I want to know, is it a horror movie? I mean, it's terribly terrifying, but it's not like horror films. I saw that the first segment was trying to dread and fail, but what the hell is the second segment? It's annoying. In the third segment, the student is just as fascinating as watching an art movie. This movie is not less than 100 at the bottom, so get your votes (1/10) people! I know many people have given good reviews, but they are lying sadly in a sadistic attempts. Believe it, it's impossible to like this movie. The only benefit of this movie is the amazing effect of amazing life: it seems like you're watching this movie just the first half of the year.
