This movie is an excellent example to destroy large resources in a movie. You have the SNL and SCTV boxes of the future, such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty, who are basically at least 70 minutes of inspiration. The concept of a future network of the future society could lead to really interesting extreme aspects, but the door goes straight to the whistle and jokes of young proctology and it is a very humorous way. Groove Tube is much more subversive and silent or later, the horny Kentucky Fried Movie. This movie is only for those who want to see a badminton movie cartoon in the 70s.
