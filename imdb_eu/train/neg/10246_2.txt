At the end of the world it is a bloody film, that is, about the destruction of the earth. The main character is a sort of scientist, I'm not sure what it is. There are two jobs in government (?) In a four-man safety-related installation. His first job is to take care of the space through it (although it is like a hobby that works when not working in number 2). Lan # 2 needs to wear a protective suit and get into a dark room ... at least that's what I think. Apparently, "plant" is not exactly a high secret, as the scientist brings his wife. It hangs (they are arriving at a dinner) while it finds a message from a space: the Great Human Earth, which is repeated repeatedly. It is something that says it's the first message of space that has been detached; The wife herself tells her to have a late dinner party. So leave and go to the party (!?!). A few moments later, China is aware of a large earthquake. From there the movie ... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is there, but it does not really help. In addition, Lee has little performance in the field of appearing in Howling II. This movie is boring, but it's just enough for you to have the items of stupidity, if you like Christopher Lee or Z-grade science fiction. Moreover, the land is destroying many footage.
