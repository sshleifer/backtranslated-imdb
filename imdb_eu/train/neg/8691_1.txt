If there is a zero rating, I would give this film. Today I saw it a second time and I still could not get it to the end from the beginning. I can not believe the supposition of the many stars and actors provided by others, or a disguised publicist! The play is very slow around, the script is blah, while Nichole's child is threatened by youngsters, it also shows zero emotions. The "southern" accent of Amber's mother is strange: I am from Georgia and I have friends from Texas. I think no one is such a lecture! None of his emotions did not have any scene of imagery. The matter is very serious and it deserves a better treatment.
