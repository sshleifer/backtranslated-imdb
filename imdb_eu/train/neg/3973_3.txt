The rhythm was weak, but in the horror movie, I can live if it's a good story. It was not. The initial event was an erroneous and misguided effort to exploit crowd worship. Okay They will soon retrieve emotionally the "place in the country". I like the revelation of ghosts. Okay, nice - this will be a horroring supernatural story, because they are rotten parts in our world ... never. Then the action starts like three head dogs as a dog and a poor bird - Is there such an evil force trying to attack them directly? Is there a bad force trying to attack directly: does the people want to make things really unbelievable? Oh, wait, do not you, maybe EVERYTHING is a kind of chamber of psychic echo, where ambient disagreements could start to kill you? Okay, hold on - is it just a little boy with "Delbert" who is blameless with his mind, what is missing his mother, and K-Tel Norman Bates has a similar kind of qualities? Oh, well ... more points are turned off: it seems that the only black character is the grandson of our "Gang" pullman. The actor plays it straight in the way of a crisp conversation, but the truth is that its purpose is: "I've made you Boss!" They wrote about intelligent GTF at least. She was silent and broke off with her little girl, no doubt, like in a shower. These were just two of those that were very wonderful in this movie. The problem is that they are combined in a disarmonic way, like beef, chocolate bite and the bite of a Gummi bear. Both are excellent, but are they mixed up? Bleah! This potential. Wasted
