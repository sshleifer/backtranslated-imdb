Well, if it were not Ethel Waters and the 7-year-old Sammy Davis, Jr. (here billed without Jr), if it were not, Rufus Jones would be the president's worst representation of African American stereotypes. Since the beginning of the debate, it would not have been worth it. Mrs. Waters is brilliant here, "Am I Blue?" and "Under our Harlem Moon" shows us how the experience of Mr. Davis came to us as he prepared for superstar status. It's so good to dance. I thought the experience was a bit like a decade in the people. So, if you are willing to abandon the negative connotations we know here, President Rufus Jones should be happy. PD I now see for the fourth time and I've heard the song, "I will be delighted in the Dead You Rascal You," Davis this time. The song of that era must be well known.
