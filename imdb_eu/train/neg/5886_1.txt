I would like to leave the movie halfway down with the people I love. It is based on real-world events, but that's why it's not completely felt. I have a psychological situation, I get out with a lot of psychotherapists and I know people seriously, so it's not like that people did not think it. But the films were the only human beings that appeared to be Augusten's father (Alec Baldwin) and Augusten's youth (Jack Kaedin). (Even though Evan Rachel Wood was an interesting divert, it was very funny, the bad sense very sexy). There were some funny moments, but the tone of the movie was grim, curious and abstruse. Which is an excellent cast! While I was passing through the turns, I felt I was watching a theater class. They brought home those credits, when a couple of people appeared to him when he was sitting down, not acting or talking. These few moments were more entertaining than the previous 2 hours.
