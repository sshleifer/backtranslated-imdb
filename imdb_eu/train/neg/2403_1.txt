Whack !!! I got this film because Elizabeth Hartman was there. I was disappointed to know that at the end there were two short scenes. On the other hand, I pressed forward all the time. A teenager travels to Romania with his father and a wolf feeds a bunch of people and a man becomes a dog if the moon is full. He kills his father and his friends. He has been working for 30 years and has not been doing a great deal of age and has been enrolled in high school classes. There he finds a shy teacher and he snorts, and then with his children. This movie is sucked and I do not recommend anyone. Read War and Peace instead. Mrs. Hartman did a great job. Check out Bob Saget very young!
