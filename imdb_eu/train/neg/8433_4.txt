Pere is an idiot, but he knows that and acts as a result. Life is completely boring and does not know how to change. When Nicco's last friend is dying. She is totally empty and has decided to get drunk. When he's back home, he's stuck with a girl who puts ads. Although he leaves his side, he begins to fall in love and begins to be obsessively. Well, the start of the movie is slow and most people can be boring. However, as the action begins, it's a bit better (not much, perhaps, the best part of the 5-minute sex you can see in the middle of the movie (almost 30 on that scene), it's not good for eroticism, but for a fun and unexpected scene. It's best: actors and good managers are not, and the result is a fun movie that can be fun for some people.) All the film is based on absurd situations (idiot, as the movie says), I have something interesting. I like Ventura Pons, but I admit that this is not one of his best films (maybe the worst!). ), he knows that he is doing better.
