This film reminded me of "A History of Violence" because it wanted to be a close study of violence and violence, but eventually it is a kind of action movie that looks like a film about violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride go to a small English town and find endless harassment against some local drunkards. Do not these men work? However, Dustin can take everything and at the end of the film he will receive his house and anyone who strives to fight such a terrible way as a whiskey boils. head seized in claws. It's fun to have someone in a small British town need big traps like that, maybe a man would put him on his head. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah made "Wild Bunch". because he was leaving blood out of violence. But it was made with style, and you think. Straw Dogs is not incredible. First, the location is wrong and it does not work. Why put it in England? I think of a city in the mid-1930s or a small town in South America. Secondly, in my opinion, I have never been able to explain why these men quickly accelerate, maybe drink, and maybe even if they did not have to kill Hoffman and wife. this
