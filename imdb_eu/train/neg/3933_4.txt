The success of Austrian audiences is amazing today as it may be fun nowadays, but its top political mistake and humor, humor and sense. It's too long; Content <br /> <br /> Some could be saved for this sequel, Barry McKenzie Holds Own (owner), who are desperately needed new things. He gives his ocker a fun attitude to Aussie, but it is also a nuisance to shoot the movie. Some say that Crock's songs are the tallest, and it's the original, but "hilarious"? Barry McKenzie's adventures fall into the Australian cinema scene, but foreign audiences do not see Barry McKenzies (or Mick Dundees!). Most foreigners do not have to do everything we can. . Rating: 5/10
