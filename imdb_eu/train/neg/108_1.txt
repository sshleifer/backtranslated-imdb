Instructions: Nothing. <br /> <br /> Cons: all <br /> <br /> Publication summary: A storyteller tells stories about people killed by a zombie. > <br /> Review: Never in my life did I find a short film about Zombie Zombie Chronicles. Shot in a budget of around $ 20, a TZC horror movie is absolutely awesome, because we are looking for the most vain and unforgettable players to save their lives and make them more fearful. How do you get this movie like this? Simply avoid TZC like a sexually transmitted illness. <br /> <br /> My last 2 cents: Fortunately, the movie was made by a company called Brain Damage Films. This brain really needs to be damaged to create such a movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10 out of 10 (I think the movie would get a badge)
