What is it, when someone who plays lyrical in their own mind, portraying the emotional scene between two people? If Flipper puts the wicked wife in the room, the singing song with lyrical song is loud as conversation, so it can not be heard, diluting the emotional impact of the scene. The scene of Annabella, her father's fist, a lamp and a belt, considered such cartoons to be nonsense. The whole movie is a cartoon, the rampant prejudices against whites are literally astonishing. After being warned by black women after the wife of Flipper, she has been fooled by white, and as discussed by a group that is discussing Oxford, the debate is ridiculous. It can withstand deep racism, but the soundtrack and "sound" of this movie are too much. It was a technically wrong movie. There is no basic work in the film's basic pieces of work, soundtracks, editing, and great actresses. I really felt with Anthony Quinn, asking, asking why he got paper - his look is painful. This director has watched the first movie and it will be my last.
