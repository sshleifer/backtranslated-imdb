I thought this movie was an excellent idea, that was not given. Apparently, they found a way to build a suspense, but they were unable to organize their profits very well. In one case, the police are in clocks to find the secretion of the kidnappers. They walk sharply to match the dentist's dentist to go to the dentist. At the same time, the abducted man (Mason) escapes from the lifts axle. After all the construction, the police arrive at the same time, that is, the very opposite climate, at least. There is also a narrative scene that embodies the thought of the "husband and wife" thought, which does not add to the suspicion. We know their tension, and the voices are insulted and steals the chances of personal experience of fear of the audience, as Hitchcock has proved repeatedly, it is much more effective. The biggest disappointment is to sit across the movie, and to finish it faster, but rather soft. I mean ... it's just "ending".
