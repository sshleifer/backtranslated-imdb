Awesome story (Amis's worst), nonsense and self-conscious 'decline', obvious tactical excitement and flawed performance (but rather "Rancid Aluminum") is in error with the British British film resemblance. Such humorous, sharp, and full pretentousness of configuration ("terrorist internet group" - some sort of ooh, including how contemporary) actually starts grinding. <br /> <br /> The final summary - a half-baked attempt does not make any favors. However, it's always nice to watch Katy Carmichael on the screen ... <br /> <br /> <br />
