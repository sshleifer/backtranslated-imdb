The story about ten minutes passed in more than two hours. I did not leave any importance, I had to leave at half point. But hopefully, I stopped. Due to the vain feeling of being in vain. The play was fine, but the story is very transparent and weak. The script is kind of lame, but once again, stretching the ten-minute line does not leave room for good conversation.
