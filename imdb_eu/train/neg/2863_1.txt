I was glad that I watched this film working in the hotel industry, and lately this movie has been in our library. There is nothing short of budget films, but this movie has a great performance. How can this movie be? The director must be blacklisted, and because of the poor actress, he probably will not leap into a career. Please be assured that you have not seen the movie, it's a lama, camera and awesome director in the theater. There are some films worth more than "LOW 10". Another example would be "Dracula 3000". People who earn money with this movie must give their charity, so it's at least good for a good reason. <br /> <br /> In this case, I would see another 10 (or at least one other).
