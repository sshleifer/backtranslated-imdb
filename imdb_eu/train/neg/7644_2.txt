It's been a long time since I saw the bad movie. Real time is the play, the story is boring and I do not know what happened. It was totally strange. Oh, this is a comedy from Clint Eastwood's pregnant Schwarzenegger! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenarios (people with a television show) was correct: 80% of the shares were awarded - forgotten actors. If I intend to start a career, I think it might not happen with the CV! The script had a potential, but not 80% of the actors or directors (as an actress and actress need). Fred Durst was the only one that seemed better than the rest. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if you ever think about seeing it, I recommend that you not only do something traumatic. the complete loss of time, but also a weak example that looks like bad cinema.
