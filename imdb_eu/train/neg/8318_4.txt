I have seen fantastical stories, but its needs are so incredible, what happens next to being ridiculous. A rich marriage and a young person makes a heart transplant day by day, and, so to speak, his surgery and his surgeon plots witness him to kill him. Although there is a medical explanation about this medical event, I'm going to have an interview that follows ... say ... what do you say ...? ... maybe and a true life where a dedicated mother will do everything to save her son's life. There is no suspicion or emotion shadow, but a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that are not going to happen in life. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film is not entirely lacking. - Actually, the director, Joby Harold, really works for Anakin Skywalker wearing a good group directed by Hayden Christensen group, after removing the wonderful Jessica Alba and the supermarket Lena Olin. Everyone deserved a better story.
