For a lot of embarrassment, this part of the rumor could allow a beautiful actor like Joseph Fiennes. The movie was not only bad, but enormous and without quality. On the plot (was there any one?) There was not somewhere. The Russians plundered the stupidity of the games, and the rest of the casts had to be left untimely due to their cunning performances. I left the path around 3/4 and turned it off. "1" is horrible, nothing less. Do not miss this time, you have not lost anything.
