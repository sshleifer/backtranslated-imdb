Pediatric, a long manufacture that tries to chronicle the birth of a federal research center. It starts with a promising probe, especially in the future. However, the melody is in line with James Stewart and his wife Vera Miles (Miles had a wife's habit of getting hot under pressure and her broken nerve is included here.) The famous director Mervyn LeRoy directed this adaptation of Don Whitehead's book, but despite the involvement of the talent, the image is not a great deal of impression. Best performance, Murray Hamilton is activated as a Stewart partner. However, most conversations are wonderful and group stimulation seems like a movie twice. * 1/2 ****
