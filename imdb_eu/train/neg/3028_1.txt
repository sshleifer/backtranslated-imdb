My flatmate rented this movie another night, so we saw each other together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is really positive, because the whole movie is shot in a colorful, grainy, post-MTV. Fast sequences, fresh angles, camera movements. For now you feel like "Snatch" is visible to one another ... for a moment. Feel like an excess dose. things just make sense now. I'd like to have fun watching watching some scenes, but once again, the movie is so bad that it's not really what you see better. <br /> <br /> First, you think it's a crime in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. Wrong This interview does not offer consistent narrative. On the other hand, in the second part of the character of Lucy Liu, Domino's lesbian, she began to throw away more confusion. <br /> <br /> Then I thought maybe it's a movie about a wealthy girl. But the non-functional background became a harsh reward hunter. In any case, it is a message sent by the opening-scene. Afterwards, Domino's criminal nature was lost completely. So, in the end, this is not a movie about Domino's character. <br /> <br /> Then I thought, probably, that it is a story of a robbery. Theft is quite bloody. 10 million people disappeared, the Bounty Hunters hunters were supposedly robbing themselves, the mafia children were running, their hands were removed, and this time Domino tries to find out why they have not obtained award certificates, and so on. plot <br /> <br /> This time we're faced with a sad story of an African-American obese, who falsifies local driver MBA licenses and is at the age of 28 with the youngest grandmother. Lateesha is a show by Jerry Springer, who tries to publish a new theoretic race, and at the same time fights for his young grandson. <br /> <br /> What do you need to link to the main plot? Yes, yes, nobody knows. The director had to explain: where the hunters of the collection would make a fee of 300,000 euros for their collectors. <br /> <br /> Then you begin to think for a moment: "Oh, our society and the media are in a distortion way things." There are real-world television crews driving with Bounty Hunters and makes the footage violent. Bounty Hunters are also stuck with a series of Hollywood actors. They get darkened by their broken noses and the excessive scene of crime all the time. But no, this is not a movie about the media, which appears on multiple occasions in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are many other sub-plots: Afghanistan Freedom, Dominoes love story and Chocco, Mescaline episode, FBI surveillance operation ... <br /> <br /> All things mentioned 2-hour movie can they meet? You judge yourself, but my conclusion is clear: it's a real blend!
