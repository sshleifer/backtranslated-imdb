Being a fan of Elvis, I can not understand how this project can be done. It's far from Elvis related movies of all time, quite unfunny, stupid and immature of King. Come, the tomb of Elvis in a public park? A mention about Suspicious Minds in 1958 ... and these are just two examples. Some people try to do the best, Mike Starr is fun (especially as an imitator), Tom Hanks's stroke is a surprise, but Elvis plays the guy. Generally, the movie is not fun. minute If you'd like to see ultra-cheap movie related to Elvis, but very funny but very funny, I'd recommend "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of a mess.
