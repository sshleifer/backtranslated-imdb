How did you get the great script to attract this cast? It's ridiculous, predictable, and incredibly disconcerting, well directed and correct, but the material is so bad. These years I've seen one of the most thriller of all time. Stunningly bad, not a fun way. Avoid at all costs, even if you're a fan of someone of the cast.
