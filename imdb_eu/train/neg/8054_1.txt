Dear, what a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Production was so cheap and rough ... Remember "Filmed on" Nature, where the lightning hits the tree (leaving huge stems) Roy Hobbs. Does it match? Well, the producers of this film used the same scene as a branch of a tree in the pre-arranged scene. <br /> <br /> I wonder whether I paid for the Natural Footage, or did anyone who could not see the movie they expected? <br /> <br /> Then they were finally trying to get away on the truck. Such an excessive operation in the cabin. <br /> <br /> A real bad movie, a bad movie.
