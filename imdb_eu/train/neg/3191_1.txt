There are wonderful movies and movies that are so scary that have long been forgotten. Likewise, violence and bad things (you do not know what you like, what I mean) adds to the mix. What is bad film with bad results? Why, "Last Justice", of course! <br /> <br /> Remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of this film, and Joel and Bots riffed in "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Now, for the time being, taking Mike Joel's Love Satellite (but with his boots), this trio had to make the second movie of Joe Don Baker's "Final Justice" MST3K. Obviously, I wanted to see the things that I have mentioned so much for television, but I still want to see that section (and "Mitchell"), what is Joe Don "hating"? Why, Mystery Science Theater 3000! <br /> <br /> P.S. If you have nearby connections, check out the trash tape! LOL happened to another user!
