I've seen it long, and I have to say: the movie is horrible. I see happy movies for fun. Scarecreow is not fun. Scarecrow is stupid. You have a horrible monster of horrible misfortune that enjoys a great spectacle, because the victim dies (this is worse than the one included in this sentence). He has a happy story that uses his mind to kill him. "Anyone chooses me for me. I like one of the boys I like, the only girl who thinks I'm not a Trailer-trash, I want to kill everyone. Wah." I agree. But the premise of this movie alone is enough to put it on the bottom of the wonderful movie list. <br /> <br /> As I have just said, the mother of the child is endless, she finds herself with her mother and says she is leaving her boyfriend, the boyfriend, the girl refuses to insist, that she is not her house will be left. The boyfriend walks back in the cornfield. The baby dies at a child, mother is terrified, it's like a boyfriend "OMG! I did not want to!" He then told her that the mother did not say anything to the police. Kid was killed under a scarecrow. So, like any dying under a scarecrow, he has returned with a scarecrow. His victims "do not want to get rid of that before ..." (Official Txorimalo's tag) <br /> <br /> The worst thing to do was filming a giant 8-day movie. That's it, 8 days. I would give him this movie 2, even if he had one or two wealth. (They are spoilers, so I did not harm you, if you really want to see that rubbish). The bad asset, the special effects, the horrible script and the bad camera. but I do not simply respect this level effortlessly. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good as I do. If you'd like to see an example of how to make a movie or watch bad movies, as I do, watch this at your own risk. Others need to be safe away from this movie.
