... but Christmas Carol must be the worst adaptation of all times. And that makes some, what Lifetime efforts like. I'm not wrong to write - I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. I like it in other roles (look like Sipsey Tomatoes, for example). But the script gives only the chance to chew the landscape. And he chewed all the excitement that Tiny Tim attaches to a Christmas goose. <br /> <br /> Give me classics at any time: Alastair Sim, 1951. The exception might be the Scrooged, they're just the rest of the others. Great efforts to understand the past, present or future Christmas spirit.
