Vipul Shah's past work was really awesome. 'Waqt - The race against time' and 'Namaste London' was a very entertaining and interesting experience. 'Singh Is Kinng' was fun, which he produced. The latest output as a filmmaker Dreams creates the weakest quality of his career. <br /> <br /> 'London Dreams has a rugged story, which is a success in hating friendship. Okay, it's a potential, but after seeing 'London Dreams', do you ask what happens to you? This movie may end up lately. Vipul Shah writes director Vipul Shah. <br /> <br /> The first time is boring, the second hour is better; But again the top points are awesome. How can someone who can decide to destroy someone? I do not have. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and apologize to his diaper, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he came to India, instead of salmon or tinnitus, Salman welcomed him and said he was the cause of the whole fiasco. Was Vipul Shah's intention to show the character of God of Salman? Yes, you completely failed. The only question I asked Vipul Shah is: would you welcome a person who has destroyed you with a wonderful reception? Write down what you feel, do not fool us to the people, we're senseless to understand it or not. <br /> <br /> This is music, but Shankar-Eshaan-Loy's great music. The only song is not in your mind. <br /> <br /> Salman is superb. He carries the film on the shoulder and really works well in emotional scenes. But once again, his character appears as God, which, in the end, is like a delay. Ajay is also good, but Salman has completely darkened. Asin is losing out and what is the great talent in this film by Om Puri? Rannvijay ice cream, though Aditya Roy Kapoor emphasized. Brinda Parekh is well vamp. <br /> <br /> In general, this dream remains a dream!
