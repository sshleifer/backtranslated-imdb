I love Alec Guinness. And that goes a long way after this film. Actually, it's not wrong. It seems to be ignored, that he is very fond of himself, but nothing is invested. It is evident that a girl with a girl with her, even if she is a young French woman inexperienced. Sir Alec would not have chosen himself when he was young, and of course he was not happy. <br /> <br /> Interesting character "Suzanne"'s brother is terrifying. French "Donald" wants to be Heathcliffe and I have waited a lot for the mystery of her mystery. What hidden dark darkness behind that forehead? He fell in love with his father? Why did Suzanne shake her hair, when the parts of this turkey decided to bring her different? Or perhaps he had enough of his evil performance. <br /> <br /> Movies Guinness and "older women" would be charming, remembering and watching with Paris. That would be a great story! After the destruction of World War II, two beautiful experiences in a beautiful city live. Why was not someone come here? I recommend that I read Alec Guinness "The Card" ("Card").
