I will summarize this short. The adaptation of this wonderful King book is a joke and nothing more. Of course, there are many fans of Kubrick and Nickolson in this site and, as a result, this film finds it mysteriously. Top-250-n. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As a screwdriver, Jack Nicholson is Shelley Duvall. A story that is unrelated to the book, Jack and Wendy Torrance's non-consistent character. They're jokes. <br /> <br /> For anyone who does not read this book, and who wants to understand the characters of this story: paste the TV series ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Oh, and people who say they have the right to destroy Kubrick's right to the story of King ... does not need to retain good writers as "masters" "closed eyes".
