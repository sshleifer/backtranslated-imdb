It is about the codes against World War II, that is, the stolen "stolen", etc. "The play" is about what I expected from the list of MGM "B" actors. <br /> <br /> A great deal. Jean Rogers, a great job Dale Arden made the film that he played in the first serials of the flash Gordon series. Its character is very annoying. She absolutely never let her overacting. We believe that when World War II is the Top Secret code facility, it does not even leave the selected office and have no official function. From this point of view, I feel I have never seen the movie. Mrs. Rogers has always changed the perception. Talentwise, it's lightweight. <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman is his usual car, it's just right. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
