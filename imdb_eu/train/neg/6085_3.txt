In this guided tour in Paranoia, heroes of our reporter fight against the authorities, double colleagues, the undeniable debunker of the UFO and the silent and demanding aliens. (Although remotely able to consider objects and zapping, three of them need to operate a control panel about two dozen buttons.) The script is from event to event cloning, leaving puzzlers. Why did the foreigners blind themselves to the dog? Why do they talk about the soldiers when they make a landing area with radiation? And what space boys are worthy of their moon cheese instead of ugly abduction photographers instead of their model? Ask to know the minds! Writing and director Mario Gariazzo apparently researched his theme with a feature of UFO's theme with the feature film Sunn Classics. (The closure screen crash is based on real events ... "9 is like the plan"). Some may feel burned at the end of the day, but still have conspiracy brakes.
