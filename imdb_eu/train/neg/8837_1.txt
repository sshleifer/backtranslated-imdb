This movie is horrible. I really expected him because I thought it was great lantern. <br /> <br /> The following review may have spoilers * <br /> <br /> ***** <br />. <br /> First of all, good things: it looks great, some of the shows are fine. Bad things are all about that. <br /> <br /> This story, surely known as you know, is located around some fishing blocks and they know a body, with a tour that they find on Friday, but they continue fishing and eventually denounce Sunday when they return. on mobile (on mobile phone). However, the movie is time (the boy takes time) to get to the central event. <br /> <br /> In a series of characters (about a dozen), it does not seem to like another (that is, I suppose, consistent, because all are not difficult. I failed to explain how the characters are linked, and I was not frustrated until the end of the film until the family tree is built up quite a bit. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine a movie that reminds us that it is a failure in the structure of the story, since the life of the character seems as bad as the fishing trip. Anybody dying of the head. <br /> <br /> There are common foolish logics. The killer spills the body of the lake, then climbs to the mountains on the river. Fishermen go on Sunday mornings, but for some reason they get home by night at Home Byrne After his wife is going to bed, then the next day, the police go by the door to take him to the station. I do not listen on the phone? Down the station, the media know the whole story, go Not less than reported within 24 hours? <br /> <br /> The story is totally lacking, it is probably the debate that the blocks have found after the body. This is a mystery: everyone asks "how can you do that?" and the viewers are doing the same question. (What is the topic to be done with the body? The scene of "Deliverance" is the key. I know what I would do in his situation. Someone must go to the car, move to the cellphone, call the police, wait and move to the location, others waiting for camps and fish. zaintzen du? <br /> <br /> Hori guztia faltsua dela dirudi. Egia esan, neska beltzak zirela eta, arrantzaleen ekintza arrazista gisa hartutako tokiko aborigenek - "ez litzateke neska zuri bat balitz ere egin". <br /> <br /> Neska hil dezakeenari buruzko zalantza bitxi bat dago (uste dut gaia aipatzen da behin ere), eta ez dago misteriorik, ikusleak hiltzailea irekitzen den eszena ikusten baitu. /> <br /> Beraz eserita nago, aldi berean, aspertzen eta nahastuta, It's a turn, not a plot, but a matter of course. It suddenly becomes the dignity of native aborigines when you end up with some inconsistent things about black-and-white reconciliation. <br /> <br /> This "australian" movie According to The Age.
