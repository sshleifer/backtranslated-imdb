This 1977 worship film features two giant lesbians (Sandra Locke and Colleen Camp) in the home of George Homec (Seymour Cassel), who seem to find a place where they can not find a home. These two, however, considering other plans, when George's wife is away from the city, begin taking control of the residence, wearing George, destroying the running of the bulls in an afternoon. A bizarre and disturbing movie, but they only get the reward they end up when the movies are over. Most people will not like it directly or they will catch up to 30 minutes in this wonderful movie. In any case, some believe a classic worship. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
