The story goes like this: later Netflix sent me my DVD and I went to an analog room where I called "Blockbuster Video". Really bad, 150 copies of the film have Lame to see your pleasure, but I have never wanted to see one of them. So, I saw BTK Killer on the shelf, all in his lonely head. I like watching movies by serious killers. I never understand it as a part of humanity; so I want to see such things. In any case I put this DVD and, suddenly, from the second place, it sucks. Here I am my and we like it, "what's this sort of thing?" Impactless camera operation, great performance. She asks you the first scene that kills a woman, but would have given her a rest, but then a rat will lower her throat. I really ask the director to have that misfortune. There's no decent about this "movie." Everything you need to say to the director, "are you a freaky tripod?" Each shot was very unstable. Music was horrible. As one day they decided to make the movie. Probably Walmart people gathered to exhibit them and act. Very common If you do such a movie, there is no direction for your hobby - you should not do what you should do - it would not make it to DVD vendors for filmmakers like me. You should be better off for a party for your friends and foreclosing things ... Then you will be taken to your BTK KIller movie and once said, "Do you want to see the happy movie I have ever done?"
