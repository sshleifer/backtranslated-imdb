I do not know what this Margaret Atwood thought was to have the same name for his book. I've always been a great hobby for The Robber Bride and I was very excited to learn to play a movie. I know the translation of the book movies is not perfect, but the movie was ever worse. Women's names are correct and the background story is correct, but it's about it. I think I'm trying to get through this movie during my time. It was really a small series to tell the story he wrote. -Louise Parker. I only want to be a better script for work, because it does not have anything to do with the book.
