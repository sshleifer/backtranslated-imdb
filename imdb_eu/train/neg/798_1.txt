Okay, it's a good movie, but I'm going to get the idea of ​​a computer virus because it's just a fairy tale that has become an organic virus. This kind of type is like a computer virus virus. First of all, the code chains and the 1 and 0 of the chains are added to the computer virus. Organic virus is much more complex, although it is a bit smaller. Although one of the simplest forms of the universe, organic viruses enter cells into the RNA and then change your RNA code. Tell me how a monitor might process something like that? Maybe radiation affects the users causing cornea viruses in these viruses? I could see that, but, of course, the writer did not think it.
