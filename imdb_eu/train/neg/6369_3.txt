I rented it for the sole reason that it was the Fangoria magazine article. The article seemed interesting to me. Well, it's not. This was a very boring, amateurishly written and directed film. All the actors in this movie are incredible, except Faye Dunaway, who always sees joy. But it was too much time for Gina Phillips and their huge cliffs to meet the gorges and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has a strong Argentinean accent that only understands what he says. He is also Nicholas Pauls, who plays Gina Phillips's ultimate love interest. Bottom line: the movie is not terrifying. It's just a good scene and it's only five or ten minutes from the movie. I'd give it a star, but I like Faye Dunaway so much. But that was not so great.
