I went to the prevention of this film and I was surprised. It was a combination of all horror / thriller themes, pedophiles, Satan worship, secret police, issues, religion ... it was a lot to comment on many things ... and it was wrong. The playwright was quite a washing machine; The baby and Jesus were well, but apart from them ... In any case. I admire the effort of trying to show Christians differently (even if they failed), yet the Gospel's presentation mode was for sale and Yiddish. But again, maybe he should have been talking about the child ... no. Actually, I decided it was a bad thing. music ... oh my son ... horrible ... too dramatic. Okay I felt the poor people who premiered this movie; The bad student seemed like a project. Now I'm going to talk about this and say the last line, go see if you want to lose this movie for fifty minutes of your life. there you are.
