This movie is a portrait of Spaghetti Teenage Benjamin, who has to visit a boarding school for Mathematical brands. He did not make the best experiences of life and he got serious self-esteem problems. After a strenuous start to his new school, he starts making friends, loves a girl, and does some things that she eats with young Americans. <br /> <br /> Next to comedies, the movie is a very serious way. With Benjamin and the focus of his problems. <br /> <br /> If you do not already like the scheme of this story, save your time and see something else. If you do, consider the following: 1) Benjamin is completely losing. It does what it does, it does not go wrong and it is self-paced all the time. In my opinion, it was not a "charming loser" that you could feel and laugh at that kind of sympathy. Instead, he and his behavior really annoyed me and I did not see myself so far behind my teenagers. <br /> <br /> 2) The film tries to be almost realistic and seems like a story. Only characters are experimented (except Janosch). Yes, I know that this film is based on a self-produced biography written by a 17-year-old boy - but if I experience experiences with German and German youth, I do not believe it. 3/3 <br /> <br /> 3) Sexual milk verification is a key issue for a film about this topic. But I doubt whether teens are "characterized in the cookie", where everybody has to lie in a sperm with a massive sperm for the woods and losers after eating sperm bones. Although it was a fun way to mix me up, it's not fun or stressed by the serious attempts of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4) The betrayal of the true Benjamin family and his father's wife is a sub-plot. I do not know why it is and where to put it. He got bored. <br /> <br /> Well, I personally hate this essay for Benjamin's character, a message, a concept, a scheme that, in any way, does not intend to be dramatic and serious. However, I can imagine that some people are sensitive and shocking. If you liked the "other sister" you might like to like it too. I hated both. <br /> <br /> 17-year-old boys do not write an autobiography, and it seems they are not the best idea to get a movie. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10
