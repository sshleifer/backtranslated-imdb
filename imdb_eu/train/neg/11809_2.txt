I bought this movie at the Rogers Video Store bunker for $ 2. I enjoy a good B movie and it seemed to me from time to time. <br /> <br /> The movie "1970's" is a pretty gesture, which is why it's very bold. Unfortunately, the story is difficult to follow and there is not much going on in the movie. In fact, I turned it off after seeing 45 minutes and it seemed as slow as it seemed to me a whole week later. <br /> <br /> The movie is in a good place, but wait and wait and wait ... for them. <br /> <br /> If you enter B movies, this may be a must-have for you, it's a slow movie and you can not warn much. It really happens, and I did not mention much of the story ... <br /> <br /> <br />
