My God I bought this movie ... and ... I saw ... the whole thing .... . Okay, it'll be fine ... I'll be in a month or two. Some time soon I hope to get rid of flash backs. I'd have something to eat after the movie, but it seems that I dare to try every time I try food. Bad Yes bad Very bad. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. Wait, it does not seem to be a good way to bring the message. Hmm ... There is not a horrible word ... it's not too scary to describe ... Hmm was terribly frustrated / staged / shot / directed / written. Now I do not know what to do but throw it. I might not burn it, I would not want to end up at the bottom of an architectural hole a thousand years ago. The worst movie in that era was "happy"
