Oh dear, this movie was bad for several reasons. I expected to see a very low score for this film and I was amazing all the scores. Sorry, but if they value so much, it's a joke! After passing a short film and a black and white gimmick, when it was a pretty idea, the movie was only running for 66 minutes. At the beginning the credit sequence of the customers was very angry! Trucks suffer from a flat van and change the wheel, wow, it was necessary in the story! How did Campbelli slow down the boys? Apparently, they did not care about continuing her ... the sigh ... I'm glad. I'm very happy, that is, with a special edition of Evil Dead!
