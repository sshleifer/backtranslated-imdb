It's not surprising that the historian Ian Kershaw, the author of an innovative biography that transforms Hitler's innovation into a scientific adviser for this TV movie, thus separated. The film is historically wrong. The mistakes immediately begin when Hitler's father dies at Alois's house, but he died in a pub. In the film, Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich in 1914, but in 1913 he moved to Munich. I could continuously continue. Hitler's childhood and youth are too short, and it is therefore difficult for people who are historically misunderstood to understand the nature of this neurotic method. The important people of the early period of the party, like Dietrich Eckart, such as Hitler's father, or Alfred Rosenberg's "philosopher", are absolutely missing. Ernst Hanfstaenglen's characterization is a problem. In the film, he describes himself as a noble character depicting Hitler almost despising himself. The script obviously surpassed Hanfstaengl's brilliance in his biography in the vision he gave after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl was anti-Semitic and crazy about his "Fuehrer". But the biggest problem in the film is the portrait of Hitler himself. It is constantly unfriendly as someone's characteristics, not charisma nor charm and constantly commends us all around. After watching the movie, we wonder if a follower could ever like it so much. Since we are told, what is an evil criminals of Hitler, of course, is that the scriptwriter's temptation to portray Hitler is totally disgusting and charismatic. But the facts, in private, may be very enjoyable and fun. His friends did not follow him, because he constantly cried, but they liked this strange man. Beyond those historical faults, the movie is well made, actors are first class, location plans and production design provide a compelling impression of that time.
