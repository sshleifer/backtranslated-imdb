The Golden Age of cartoons in Disney died at the end of the 90s. This show of Quack Pack would not even have DuckTales spin playing because the show had nothing to do with DuckTales. About Huey, Dewey and Louie, they talk about Uncle Donald's problems and their hip-hop language, they are dressed as DuckTales. I prefer little DuckTales adventurers. There are humans in Duckburg and the ducks are the only animals that live in Duckburg. There is no reference to Scrooge McDucken. Stories are repetitive, the plot is boring, but the animation is good. If you want a lot of slapstick moods, I recommend you. If you want a better Disney show clock "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
