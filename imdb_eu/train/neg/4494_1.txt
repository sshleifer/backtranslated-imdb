*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continue ... <br /> <br /> <br /> From now on the whole movie collapses. We will find the first rogue program, we will get ghosts, vampires and man-made wolves and the like. We get an understated accent that speaks of endless garbage, two "ghosts" that are not really intended and never have a series of characters and secrets. Someone told me they were vampires (directly from Blade 2), but I did not notice them so undefined. <br /> <br /> Funny accent with a ridiculous name Oracle has the same problem as Oracle. much longer and far worse. He has a simple point about cause and effect, he does it, and then he does it until he's done it until he's become naughty and stupid. The last line of walking before Storm "do you know what a pig is like ..." It's like a line of X-Men, a vague evil. Chocolate cake is lazy and pathetic, and Monica Bellucci's wife has just done something that we expect at the moment. <br /> <br /> Then, another kung fu fight !!! Why? Neo, presumably, is One. Can do anything It has the latest powers and what it uses. Kung bloody er all the time. And while 1000 bullets are still able to stop, it still cuts a sword and still grabs 5 maids (vampires). I wanted to think throws thoughts. I wanted to see something people wanted to do something that was the poorest and most crazy person. I got forward like 'wow' without it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Own car chase. That was not a bad thing. Well ... no, it's not. It was not what we needed to happen. All the cool movies in this scene are on the trailer. Everyone So, of course, Wow comes out from us, all we've got is a good follow-up sequence, guess what, kung fu fight !!! Okay, it's not Neo, but we could think about Matrix's reality about his closest friends. He taught them at least something. It is not difficult. <br /> <br /> "Hey, Morfeo, do not worry about what happens to the matrix. It's not real. Whenever nothing is true, you can not really harm anything." <br /> <br /> You are here. Simple <br /> <br /> Well, therefore, harassment is not bad. It's never boring and it does not look like 16 minutes. So it's so rich. And yet, it's worse. <br /> <br /> The ultimate key to the movie is probably the worst imagination. They have all three plans that include three crews. Only then is Morpheus a long, highly preaching monologue. To make it worse, they never clearly define a plan that requires 3 teams. You know well, but you do not know who's doing what, when and when a crew goes down you do not care, and you do not know what will happen. <br /> <br /> I will shorten it again, so Trinity can access Matrix for the end. That is the only reason that happens. This question is posed: why should they originally send 6 people? Trinity will come in five minutes! <br /> <br /> The trips in the middle of the Neo Matrix (in other words) handles mismanagement. Ooohhh !!! 100 agent Smith finds another! Woooooo !!! This had to take a lot of thought. Now they are only in a corridor, the battle is not scalable, and for a moment it's over. Man, what a great end! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Then the architect !!! Add together and duplicate, the architect is very horrible. In his opinion, the only reasonable potential is the Cliffhanging climate. <br /> <br /> And then it knocks it! <br /> <br /> Look at Neo options. Choose a gate and all humanity will die (except 27!). Choose another and kill all humanity !!! Choosing is something that strives to explore this film, it's not really his hero. Save if you have humanity opportunities, and if Missus dies or Save Missus and kill humanity, there is inner pain and tension. Additionally, when Trinity is midway through the fall, a third one is more likely to be a real cliffhanger potential. But no. He does not save anyone or save Missus. <br /> <br /> Now, the worst thing about the original Matrix died after Neo died. When the year went out, all of us were so angry that Jar Jar was not stupid, the Matrix's end looked at Steven Hawking. "Oracle told me I'd fall in love with One Love and I love you". Come on! How can the whole world be enormous in the whole world? <br /> <br /> So what's the battle of Wachowski? Well, they improve their original appearance. How Well, again, they do the same thing (just by changing the characters), I think it would be much worse if I continued to write down my fa and r keys before writing it worse. <br /> <br /> And cliffhanger is not really a cliffhanger. It's a reminder <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is bad. I really did not want to be bad, but that's right. In poorly so many ways. And to make things worse, this is not a movie with enough budget. It's not a short film. It's not a movie to run. It's not a big hit on the movie. This is exactly what Wachowski wants Wachowski to do with Warner's fortune. And that's so scary. At least Rancid Aluminum can say that it did not have time and money. <br /> <br /> Matrix Reloaded. The worst movie ever? Maybe it's not quite. The most depressing and humble movie ever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Certainly. <br /> <br /> <br />
