It seems why this picture has been made why: this plot is quite incredible, if not ridiculous, a character (a lonely and younger, pretty lonely policeman, quite fascinated) quite predictable, an end that is completely incomprehensible and impossible (maybe some views but this should be the masochistic desire; It's a good idea to read, understand, and play bad. The basic idea was that French filmmakers could prove that Americans are capable of making "Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs", so it's a total failure. It was a great success although it is a kind of state that worships France's first series killer movie) and is considered a good product for export. Strange.
