The bad operation is horrible, there is no light, no light story, and at least a bright and slow motion picture is required: it's all that Adrenaline movie does not have. <br /> <br /> Georgina Verbaan (and so is the Dutch girl who has not participated in English classes (a freya girl named Freya, who is "looking for emotion"). We basically make dangerous stunts, break things up and embarrass people. And not Jackass in a fun way, then he is in Dracko (Rivas), he directs the series a little bit, but with other unlawful activities on the side, Freya's father (Lockyer), which challenges the role, and eventually Jason (Fyall debut) We got Freya's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> One day, Freya disappears and everyone is involved, but the audience really does not care. Cast is nice or compelling, and the story makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Why has it been done? 2/10.
