I found this on the shelves while I was in the house and I was bored. How can they give 10 people? It's not just what I think is a good repayment film, because it does not work on that level. Poor plot, bad conversation, great performance; There's nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent, but she has not done anything, and Bridget Fonda and, above all, Johnathon Schaech are terrifying. Drawing progression (in particular, Byron and Ashley) makes no sense. Writers seem to want to make their land in a certain way, however, without spotting the required bit. It's only an hour and a half, but 90 minutes of your life will never return.
