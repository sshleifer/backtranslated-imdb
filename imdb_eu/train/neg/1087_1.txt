This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. While good actors appear, the movie does not meet expectations. The most dramatic feature of this film is music, which summarizes quite a film: it compensates for a bad and confusing story by paying off good actors, loud and dramatic music. It does not change the truth, seeing it is a very boring movie. Fully get 1 score.
