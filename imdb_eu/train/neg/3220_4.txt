I completely hate the movie after finishing the end after investing an hour. and that's it with this movie. I was interested in his actors and Malamud wrote his own fountain story. I do not read the story, but I can not imagine it ends like this film ends. Fortunately, I did not pay any money to see or rent because of my library. Ohhhh, this splendid play (especially the wife was so perfect). But as a thousand Jews as Jews? !!!! now it was fun. I did not investigate his role, but the director acted like he lost his marbles or killed the video 3/4 times. Before that point, a story and characters were being developed, some plots were clear and it did not waste much time. But if it had not been for the last 1/2 hours, I have not been the worst and most deserving I have never seen, I do not know what it is. I only hate, so, when faith is destroyed; It feels like a violent act.
