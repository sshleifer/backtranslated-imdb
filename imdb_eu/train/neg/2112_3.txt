Dr. Bela Lugosi is a doctor who plans to continue his young and beautiful wife. To this end, the marriage marries drugstores in their weddings, so they can rob their bodies for the dead. I do not know what he does with his body. I do not remember what I explained. I know that it comes out of something and injects it to the woman. (I think it's a fast fluid, the liquid spinal tumor was all the crazy drooping in the 40s.) You guess the rest here. <br /> <br /> There's a couple (well, really a couple more, but I've written two problems with these movies: it's a sail, it's working just enough in its own way (BTW, just the rest of the cast It's abysmal.) But to avoid hiding in the back of the headset or hiding in the female reporter's room, it's nothing wrong, so why should he beat up and / or kill any actress? To look like a wicked man? Well, he does not do the kidnapping of his wife someone should not have to look any further wrong. <br /> <br /> My second problem is the girl's medication idea. Wives why? A woman under the age of 20 should not do it? Watching them with these suggestions for the victims, I was reminded Remember, I'm still a foolish Fisherman I know of Last Summer. In each case, it seems that it's a simpler way to reach your goal than the circumstances outside your control mode and much more than the use of strangers. (BTW, the title for this movie is The Casual Marriage Marriage. I think that part of the "brides" need is explained.)
