The protocol is not supposed to be a movie. The passion for saving all this is with the accompanying actors Goldie Hawn. The story is based on a famous server cocktail, which unreservedly saves the life of a Arab dignity. The story goes halfway and Goldie's charm is not saved. Goldie Hawn is not a fan if you're not going to watch this movie any way.
