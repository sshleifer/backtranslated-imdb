This film was not exactly what I expected. <br /> <br /> If this film is called something else, no one would have warned the difference between them. <br /> <br /> It's very strange, I do not see any point. Prequels and seizures say they do not make sense, but they do not coincide. Maybe I'm naive but 1 vol. 1 and 2 vol. 2 would not be matched. <br /> <br /> Karlito was the first and the original prisoner and he dies and is not put in jail. <br /> <br /> The drawing is okay, but some actors and story and movie would be renamed and would be a good movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> If someone has an opinion about this message, please.
