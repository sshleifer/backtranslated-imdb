Love Crimes's non-illegitimate gray area is about 10% of the movie; Another 90% is bad. Sean Young's job as a lawyer in the district is, of course, to say. With its soft suits and hairdressing, Young makes a decent job to persuade audiences about their hateful men. Why would he ask his only friend as a prostitute to arrest the police trying to get them? This hatred is the only reason why he is looking for a perverted photographer who works with his wife's emotional thrill and the role of this wonderful movie. Seeing young people in front of the cold, it creates little interest from the forehead of the stool, but next to the lake it spills the lake from the lake. In addition to seeing his complaints about his malignancy and sexual frustration, Love Crimes deserves wages, but he goes down there. Although Patrick Bergin is keen to bring him to justice, his police capability completely escapes his tired passion. Patrick Bergin works well enough as a social whirlwind; If he has worked with Sleeping with the Enemy, he probably works that way. But I can not ask you if the young energy is significantly shaky if the film is shattered by its sliminess. I think that does and the result is a "thriller", very bad and still full of comedic emotions.
