I'm saying one thing about this movie: there's no clue. You can not get bored watching this. The problem is that TOO is intense. There is too much action and it needs lulls! That's the risk of modern action movies. You want interesting but not too much. This is an excessive way. <br /> <br /> Even if the asset is good, Gary Busey and Roy Scheider have a couple of "names". However, it has the feeling of "B". The best part of this is Dialidi's interview: the only "A" in this movie "B". <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is Rambo's mindset, but it has some scenes. Especially, the scene with landslides was very innovative. That was memorable. The other scene did not go long enough to become the goalkeeper.
