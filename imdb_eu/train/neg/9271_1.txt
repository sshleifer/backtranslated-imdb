Here is a small minority who is watching this movie SERIO. I know people's personal opinion is the last day, but in more than a couple of brain cells, anyone can assure that all of them is rubbish. They're so bad they do not belong to this franchise. I can not only assume that they are friends with someone in the movie and they are trying to give way to their career. In all poor people, do not let people know otherwise. Revenue from incoming readout is weak, even scripts. The attempts to conceal the lack of originality when using a girl (WOW!) They do not stop the filmmakers from missing the idea, and, unfortunately, there is no fear. There is no exception quality. The magazine pair has given me this brand to finance myself the money it gives me. They needed more effort to make the movie than they really did. Shame
