Are there any fictional non-fiction films that can ever be said? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After arriving at the terrible director of "Dead of the Dead", Uwe Boll has dropped his eye less talented for video game adaptation. Do not these guys? For anyone who can not understand, here are the block capitals for you: NOT VOICE GAMES! Acting here is at least a sub-standard. The set design and the special effects are poor. Unlike videogame games, although its most terrible moment, the movie is not a no-brainer atmosphere, no danger or threat. Rhythms and graphics are mixed together, and the printout of the script will be used as a toilet paper. He is the General Director. Uwe Boll uses the camera using the brush and skill of a monkey. Some zombies, rumors and frying pan are stolen in a moment, they enter an amazing moment at strange moments that are uneasy and bored at all times. Why did he first leave this guy to be one of the most modern movie theaters in the first period of a movie. Avoid at all costs.
