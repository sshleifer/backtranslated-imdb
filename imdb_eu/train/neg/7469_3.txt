The screenplay of this TV series is so bad, although A. Hopkins had to act like a drama-student at some point in bringing the life of the character of the dead script. I do not know whether it was the purpose of the director, but Hopkins Ciano did not disappoint, because he lacked fear and self-esteem. Ciano really was that real, but then why did he make a movie? Mussolini was a little convincing, and a long way down the road was in front of the truth. Edda Mussolini was absolutely ridiculous (not for Sarandon, but for disability), while the family drama was supposed to be the main character. See if you enjoy Venezuelan telenobia.
