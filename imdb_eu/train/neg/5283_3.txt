I expected that the first screening of this film was given to me on Christmas DVD. After saving my special slit last night, I sat down with my daughter (at the age of 17 and with the Student Student Student), of course with a chocolate savings. We love Jane Austin. <br /> <br /> When we only had the first two minutes, we knew we were sinking. The camera's photo and heavy angles, cinematography, directing and the lack of wooden shows we have already left with pleasure and sadness. They saw us in the break. <br /> <br /> Anne, interpreted by Sally Hawkins, stared at the extravagant and unobtrusive object of the camera directly on some cameras, breaking the fierce and passionate fantasy of our time. Directly I'm just about to be "I'll find you". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I hope they will pay for it, however, because it was almost drowned for a moment, because the lighthouse was fired as it was anticipated, because it was emptied by him and his actor. They were almost thrown into the sea. Health and Safety would be a daily area! Rupert left the poor sea water to give his line. Most likely, there was not enough money left in the kitty to shoot again in that scene. Anyone with any sense would not try the first day of that day. <br /> <br /> Not only Mr. Penry-Jones, but also incredible performance by Alice Krige, Lady Russell, but he quickly balances his efforts. According to Anthony Head's non-commercial portrait of Sir Walter Elliott's annoying. Waiting for a long film, the captain Wentworth appeared to avoid the stunning Annei gracefully. for the majority of the movie. He developed a memory obstacle, which forgot the same reason for being. Instead, Anne ran, a hyper ventilation, the good captain who sent her to the column, while in the meantime almost all of her bath was called in for nearly three or four minutes. even without a sweat. <br /> <br /> Anne's charm was not on the screen. Actually, when we were wondering if Anne Wentworth had never seen Charismatic Captain, and why did not anyone know, anyone, Walter said, just close Sir Walter. <br /> <br /> He painted a crucial kiss, usually our favorite girl. As they went closer, Anne opened her mouth and closed it, giving her a look on the screen, because she had a cheek at the end of her lips. Eww! <br /> <br /> Last night, it was most enjoyable how bad the movie was exchanging hours between chocolates and mom and daughter. <br /> <br /> What's wrong? spoil wonderful and fascinating stories, shot in some of the best England landscapes. <br /> <br /> Sorry Jane.
