Gone With the Wind was a gay party that could be given an epic length, but the empty chain of episodes was very happy, and nothing happened. The characters are universal and they do not develop stories (there's really no story) to look for and kiss each other. It's hardly a matter of aesthetic conversation that an aesthetic proposal has been completely wasted in a film, but it does not make any effort to see the psychology of the characters with dignity and give real resonance. He also hopes to have a "art" movie, offering unbelievable snobber cinematography. But, nevertheless, if someone identifies with a heavy idea, it's okay.
