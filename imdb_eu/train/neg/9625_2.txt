This film does not offer any image in the premise or execution, but this is only seen after the so-called "comedy without an energy". This story covers the risk analyst risk management manager Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller). This finds his new wife, Lisa, (Debra Messing), after having spent a single day with an underwater teacher (Hank Azaria). When he returned home, he went to one of his best siblings, Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and went to Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston), who had been with her for a few years before going to school. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Polly forgets and is sloppy and Carefree lives as the person of Reuben, but they begin to update and Reuben starts changing people with new things, sauce starts to dance. eating foods. One day, Lisa returns and wants to get married to Reuben, but she does not want to, but Polly does not believe in marriage because she does not believe it. <br /> <br /> This second film directed by John Hamburg, in general, wrote two inadequate "Zoolander" and "Meet the Parents" two bad guys, but these two films are classics like the old rumor. It's very easy to say something is not funny, but I think this is why knowing this is a bit easier. This movie is completely and completely predictable from the beginning to the end, as each scene looks at the ridiculous script. Hamburg also writes a script that seems to have been written for trying something different and sometimes it seems that trying to create "something around Mary" energy itself, but the incident seems to be very forced. Did you really think of that blindfold? If you do it, it's easy! In some films, emotional lectures that would be incomprehensible to all characters, because they intend to understand everything, but they all get obvious. Stiller works a lot, but maybe he has to work less and wait for better screenplay because this movie is not comedic or amusing.
