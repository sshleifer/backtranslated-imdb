The viewer who reacted to this new "adaptation" of Shirley Jackson's book, which was pushed forward by the 1963 movie of 1963 (true), is based on: those who suspect books or original films will not be so much thought ... and never Those who have not suffered, and the current Hollywood "special effects" trend are great Hollywood fans as being the "first and last word". good "is a movie, we will love to go. <br /> <br /> I did not like things about this adaptation: <br /> <br /> 1. It's NOT a real adaptation of the book. I've read the articles I've never seen before He did not cover other aspects. And this seemed to him unreasonable, the film is not literally covering a book, except the length of STANDARD! (And even then) But there were no videos on the movie that never mentioned or explained. they brought me a way to kill a black man in the original version of THE SHINING. I do not like it. What the film's press release should say ... "The basic idea of ​​Shirley Jackson's book is very basic, the name of the house and the name of the protagonist not all) we kept. We decided to write our story, and what the hell, THE CHANGELING and THE SHINING and GHOST we first saw and we decided to throw them a bit. "<br /> <br /> 2. All the guests who had lost sight of the appearance of a paraphologist apparently lost sight of the fact that they had brushes with the paranormal in the past to" look like a bad boy "to study the house, but not the" doctor " When he was studying "his insomnia" (he really invited them there to scare him to death and then see how their fear was reacted ... like in the lab, who said he was never part of an experiment ... nice guy), who was not the doctor of the same name, in any case, it was as different as the original professional's professional day to day. <br /> <br /> 3. The expression used to promote both movies directly "some houses are badly born", this house was not born badly, but it was bad there For what happened ... and this time, Nel will clarify. mystery (CHANGING). I am sure that the only problem was that so-called mysteries was so strange that most of the audience we are still mysteries ... but then there was no mystery (first of all, not in the book) the mystery. the house was bad LIVE. The first "victim" has died before it's ever seen. <br /> <br /> 4. The manner in which Luke's character was portrayed was quite ridiculous. It was an unexpectedly playboy, someday inherited the house (and it was a real skeptic of "history") ... and it was an unhealthy wine that could not sleep. He remembered insomnia and was a compulsive liar. <br /> <br /> 5. Nik ere haserretu egin zitzaidan filma ia jatorrizko esamoldeen hitza birsortzeko saiakera izugarrizko saltoa zela eta (neskaren Nel ahizparen familiak eta Dudley andrearen irekitze txiki batekin ...) pentsatzen saiatu nintzen pentsatzeko. other than the other films than HAUNTING. He could not remember what he wanted to do. <br /> <br /> <br /> 6. I lost Nel's narration throughout the movie. The original was like a gothic novel, the story was explained by the first person, through the eyes of Nele, and we always thought their thoughts. This new version completely lost its touch. They also wanted to make Nel with more heroines. Jatorrizko Nel ez zen pertsona txarra, baina pertsona mingotsa zen (bestela 11 urte zituela bere emazteari eta bere ahizpa lotsagabe bati uko egin ondoren, gezurra izan zitekeen), eta nahigabetu egin zen. .. This was almost too true to be true. That was never more apparent than the writer's views over the writer's movie. <br /> <br /> 7. The history of the house has changed and it is excessive occupation. There was no Abigail Crain (a legend that was great in Hughen's original version of his daughter), there was no "friend," and there was no nursery. There was no original wife of "Grace", and Hugh Crain's wives were completely different. These changes have changed the story too much WAY. Ez dakit pelikula honen ekoizleek pozik egon behar duten ala ez Shirley Jacksonek jada ez lukeela lurra oinez edo haiek ... BEATU DAUDEN (nik noraezean lortzen badu ... Hausnartzen zituzten zoroak ez dira gauza txarrak izan behar. batera !!!). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In conclusion, let me a few words of Luke ( "House" the word "movie" to be called for the replacement!) " This movie "burning to the ground, and letting salt of the earth! "It's still my favorite movie of all time, this is not a problem.
