Directed by Barbet Schroeder, he has performed an elegant and very funny maid on several occasions (1976), and now it seems that Hollywood's "thriller" numbers are made. <br /> <br /> John Grisham's material is very lightweight, with a crusader plot of television. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, an awesome and independent investigator specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is a Kennedy Kennedy police associate, and they make each other uncomfortable. It's not good, if two unequal university imbalances (Gosling and Pitt) are deciding on a Christian scene that decides to go wild on goose in a very clear and misleading court trial. <br /> <br /> Enough, but between Bullock and Chaplin does not produce sparks; In addition, we must undergo a series of shining bright flashes that illustrate Cassen's history in an important event. Then, of course, planes with a cliff side cabin are definitely set to OTT. Oooh ... atmosphere. <br /> <br /> See CSI instead of sections. The point is much more exciting.
