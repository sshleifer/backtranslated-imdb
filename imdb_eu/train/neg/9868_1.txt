I have never been able to comment on movies, but I have seen 5 clear reviews of "this movie" and I decided that I should weigh myself with my review. My teacher picked up this movie in the email, mixed with his Academy projectors (AMPAS, who voted for Oscars), and this movie was so huge that he joined our class. show us how to make a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has no plot, terrifying scenes, terribly edited (they are often used in photographic imaging techniques of "24" style). Shows (especially if it's a bad actress like the actress), they're most wicked. Someone failed to understand the point of an entry, that is, the plot configuration. There are no configurations! In the middle of the film, I and the other classes do not know how this movie would be. The inaugural cranium, which creates a murder, is never corrected, and now I think about it, it may be flashing, the rest of the movies, but it also cuts off. Scene directly next without express expression. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm in a hurry. At least, this film gives renewed confidence to my own ability to make my own films.
