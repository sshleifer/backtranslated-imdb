What was the worst film of 2003? "Cat on the Hat?" "Gigli?" But no! I think this is an atrocious curious film of the beginning of the year. Poorly written, poorly edited, and (if so bold) misunderstood, the "Order" is a black hole in the movie. The movie is not so intense that the smallest entertainment can not run away. It's not unexpectedly funny, such as "Showgirls". <br /> <br /> You know that producers are supposed to be a very intelligent audience. They changed the name of the movie, "The Sin Eaters," because they invented the Americans because they were stupid, but they could understand something, even if they were an observer in the movie. Instead, they represent a completely general title, and only the image of Heath Ledger's imaginative image is enough to access. <br /> <br /> And, hi, what do you know, they were right! My girlfriend, I saw the image of Heath and dragged me with me. Congratulations, producers, you know your target market. He also liked "Grease II", so he owns it. <br /> <br /> Around the theme, Heath plays a Catholic monk (the order you have invented) trying to investigate murder. his mentor Celibathic issues probably depend on the fact that no one knew the smallest thing about religion, and even less monk samba. The only other member of this request is alcoholic gray. As I wanted to see a great alcoholic back to the big screen, my humor attempts to remind me of Monty Python's imitations at my high school. If Python were automatically fun. You know the people I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I say anything more, I would risk creating disasters. Actually, the thing that ruined the movie for me was created.
