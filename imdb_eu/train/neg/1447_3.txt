In 1934 Shirley Temple played three major films and began to make a special name for himself. Unfortunately, the studio had to try to see what people liked. These two things included singing and dancing. Another was a short and interesting short film to keep people focused and face the Depression. You know the keys of successful Shirley movies. <br /> <br /> This film has not gotten any difference, despite the presence of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard, despite being a good director of Henry Hathaway. In addition, here are too many talky parts here, just boring, and become an excessive argument between Lombard and Cooper. Finally, you do not get the normal ending for the feeling you want. I think they learned after this film.
