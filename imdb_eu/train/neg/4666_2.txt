This movie is about a Japanese woman who obsesses calligraphy on the surface. <br /> <br /> The plot is totally strange. I can not see "sensual" or "erotic" tones. Earth becomes an ancient art form in pornography fetish. In addition, the scenes filmed in Hong Kong show, unquestionably, bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the central city center, bad living conditions and sound pollution. Throughout the movie, I'm still in the Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment "The Pillow Book". <br /> <br /> "The Pillow Book" is a pervert film, but it is boring. Seriously run away
