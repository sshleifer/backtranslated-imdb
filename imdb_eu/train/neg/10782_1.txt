The only scenes that make me laugh, where the other films with Christianopher Walken (the madman movie) were boring. The first hour or so, nothing happens. Jigsaw, what you want to be fun is not silk. jones douglas is really overacting.julia roberts old ugly duck work routine (yes right!) next to the girl (where did I see it before?) who gets guy. short.i really does not matter what would happen to the main characters. Cuchack was more interested in a movie that really conceived the suicide event.
