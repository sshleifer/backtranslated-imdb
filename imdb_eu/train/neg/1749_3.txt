I should say this was the worst film priyadarshan (with much better targeted venture kyonki releasing), it does not show a specific storyline and focuses only on the body showing some silly actress debuting and comedy sequels. First I think priyadarshan is becoming a recurring actor in his comedy movies, after being govinda and David dhavan in the past, because the publics were lost. So it will be good for the script and focus more on it. try some changes in its direction. Give us more weekly weeks of herapheri and malamal instead of more than one cheek!
