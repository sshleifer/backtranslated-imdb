First of all, I am a fan of Madeleine L'Engle and I was excited about one of my favorite books to make A Wrinkle in Time a movie. This movie, however, excited me. I apologize, but Meg was a book that was described as incredibly dramatic and fast, and it was considered very sad. In the film, he has no straight hair and glasses and is a "type of sport" with a deep voice. This is not Madeleine L'Engle seemed to be Megan. In fact, Meg was based on the nature of Madeleine and he imagined the way he felt when he was young. This is an important example as the book and the movie are different. So, I would say, if you want to see it with entertainment, see, but if you are a fan of dirt at Madeleine L'Engle and the series of time, I'd recommend to skip this movie.
