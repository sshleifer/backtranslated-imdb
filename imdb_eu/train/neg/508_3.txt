First film directed by D.W. Griffith; He appears happy happy King (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but wait! When the king leaves the scene, the queen plays the music with the palace minister (Henry B. Walthall). When the king knows his lovers, Edgar Allen Poe decides to revenge him. It's hard to believe that lovers do not listen to drawing on them; Even if the actors are stunning (lovers) and quiet (cement mixers) trying to look round. The sets look like "The Sealed Room". The performances are fine, and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** Screened hall (02/09/2009) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
