I agree to those who call movies "frat-pack". In spite of this, I can find something like Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell or Jack Black. But "Envy" just left me like a white horse that was thrown cold like Ben. This time, Ben and Jack Black are neighbors, one of them (black) finds an aerosol spray, stops the animal's steak and becomes very rich, while the other (Stiller) confuses envy. This is supposedly in the plot, but then it is diverted in other directions that are unwise. <br /> <br /> 'Vapoorize' is a fun thing at the beginning. The problem is: they try to keep the whole picture (it has a plate that reads Black Caca King) and it is quite laborious. But Ben and Jack are badly used; The energy level of these two shows is significantly diminished. Until now, the two best performances are Rachel Weisz and Chris Walken. Walken's hipipi-dippie fonts are very wrong and modulates the performance so well, a hint of some of the well-known other well-known characters in Walken. It's totally unbelievable, but still Walken is incredible. And Weisz is the best actor in the business who knows nobody. Although the screen is limited, it still prevails in every scene. <br /> <br /> The whole cross of the so-called Drama is Ben, in a jealous drunkenness, accidentally shooting Jack's White Stem and then ridiculingly frightens him to cover his best friend and scare him off. However, plots are not incredible, because Jack's nature does not do something like that. He plays a sweet knight who does not complete the harassment of the evil horse. You will be fully discounted. It's all filler. And what about uncontrollable knights, what Barry Levinsons wants to know about "Strangers on a Train"? The script is bad and directed by two directors. A Levinson recorder should know someone better. Maybe someone will invent something to make this movie disappear. Oh, wait, they already have.
