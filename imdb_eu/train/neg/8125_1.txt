The movie "The Bat People" is a really bad film that deserves the treatment of MST3K as a movie of "The Creeping Terror". <br /> <br /> There we are in a mountain range full of bats. . There are a lot of things to see, bats fly and attack, things, stations, emergency disasters and much more! All this, plus the mediocrity of the 1970s plus (here, think "Mitchell" here!), "The Bat People" really became one of the last episodes of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" series! Move around, it's horrible. It must be avoided like a plague if Tom Servo and Crow are not watching you. "The Bat People" - "Bad People !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 course !!!!!
