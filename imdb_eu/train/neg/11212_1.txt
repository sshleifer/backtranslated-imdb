The premise of this film was decent, but at the same time, it was simply bland and dull. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS The film does not work for the nature of death, it was unexpected, but even though it was a murder, it was not like that. Also, through some flashbacks, a secret is revealed that the event acts like justice. No emotion in this movie. For the first 20 minutes or so, this woman is calling her sister and listens to her message. It was very dull and boring. <br /> <br /> With softness, better performance could be quite good.
