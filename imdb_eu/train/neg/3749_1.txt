Wow, I love it and I respect everything David Lynch did. However, this movie is the first filmmaker's attempt to create pseudo-art. <br /> <br /> To give some examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is a visual filmmaker. However, visual artistic content (empty walls, "up" in the background). <br /> <br /> 2. David Lynch generally takes pride in the audio; However, you might hear the video camera rumor. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is very difficult to swallow the idea that has been linked to that movie. If not ... <br /> <br /> ... David says that it's a joke for fans to look for their website (in a few hours) to find that driver. I hope that, at least, this idea is fun.
