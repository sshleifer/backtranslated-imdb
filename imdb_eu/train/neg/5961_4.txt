Around the age of 88, it was over with slashers, so it was time to get rid of these older movies. Brain is well-designed, the script reminded me of Videodrome, but as I said later in a sweeter way. It can go along with the play. But the consequences that make you laugh, in fact, are called Brain a turkey, and blood is never shown. When you see this movie of the opening sequence, the hallucinations are good and they reminded me of Elm Street's nightmares, I remember that the phone was alive ... As you look at next. The visible skulls can be seen for everyone, there is no indication and the blood is not there, but there is nudity to perverts. I've seen worse films than this, I only want to do the bloodiest ...
