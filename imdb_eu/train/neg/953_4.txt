"Happy Go Lovely" got only two things. And these two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. M-G-M is a British version of Music Maker (Excelsior Films) with side-by-side stars. I would think that Vera-Ellen had taken that role in the end, which could have driven the status of a great music star. But, I'm sorry, Mrs. Ellen does not get that chance. <br /> <br /> It opens up with a horrible Scottish number and goes on with a dreadful tone. This movie is very heavy and sloppy. Predictable graphic farming is very thin, and except for David Niven, Cesar Romero (who exceeds the role of a producer) and Bobby Howes (who does not lose anything) is the rest. The boot is totally unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Choreography is boring, but she gives it to all Ellen. In most other music stars, he was never known (and could not sing and sometimes "danced", but "danced sometimes." But when he was dances, he was just being entrancing. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that it could become a star that the film did not have to give its instruments to shine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br />
