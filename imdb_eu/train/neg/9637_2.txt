Boy, bad movie! If you have not seen all the Burton / Taylor partnerships, I'm sure that's the worst. This wealthy but sick woman (Taylor, of course) is the owner of this beautiful Mediterranean island, when she puts a poet who visits a poetic traveler. In fact, the entire movie is just a talk festival, with no much more meaningful debate. In 1968, no one had made any head or tail in front of this nonsense, and as time goes by, it clearly leaves. If cinematography and a beautiful landscape were not worth it, it was worth a negative score. The only thing that is good about this movie is the loss of the stars necessarily laughed.
