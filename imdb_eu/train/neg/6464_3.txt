Marlen Brando's view on the screen is like a fisherman at the table, like the white-faced detail. Brando's performance is the only thing that makes this movie. The land is damn and slim (not comics). Attempts to give characters that represent other people's depictions seem to be disappointed ... these characters have a damp board. Everything about the technical aspect of this movie is nonsense or simply horrible. The director casts frozen frames and slip-shots without penalty. The story music has cartoons and destroys any type of dramatic effect. It's something I'm not really looking for in a movie, but it's also a wardrobe. Brando, the brave man could not put the trace away, I heard this movie called "David Lynch-esquire" and "funny unknown", not even. David Lynch's films are cunningly creative - this film is not at all creative. And do not mix it foolishly.
