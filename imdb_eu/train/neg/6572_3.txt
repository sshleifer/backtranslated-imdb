In my opinion, the title of this movie "Only Brave" must be changed to "All About Lane". A few months ago I went to a projection of this movie and I was very disappointed. Even though the director would like to make a movie about 442-year-old men - a long-standing topic that deserves to be directed at the film industry - in some films it is quite obsolete. Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were great performances. However, the director has never been the star of the movie. Sorry Lane, you're not the movie actor. Be attentive - theater theater. Gina Hiraizumi's film was a horrible movie. He never needed to speak and his appearance was not to play the role of Queen Miss Nisei. Some young actors were naturally beautiful and whose performances were superb ... Why did not they throw that role? Another important issue of this film was its action sequences. The Japanese-American soldiers do not fight against apparent German soldiers ... leave them alone. It was said to be a low-budget function, but it was a war-based movie, is not it considered a bit of a fight? This movie was a good essay, but definitely not very important.
