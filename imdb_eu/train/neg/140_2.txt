Valentine is a horrible movie. That's where I thought: <br /> <br /> Session: very bad. Katherine Heigle can not act. The other was not much better. <br /> <br /> The story: the story is fine, but it has been developed. This movie can be a great movie, but it has failed. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, some music was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Originality: not very original. Are you familiar with Prescott Paige Prescott? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Do not see Valentine. The movie is really stupid. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
