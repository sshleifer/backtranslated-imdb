Yes, I was sitting all, God knows why. <br /> <br /> It was a long afternoon, I did not do anything, it was cold outside cold, ok, all of them hands are excuses, but they are not the only ones. <br /> <br /> I gave the Darkling 4 stars to 10 - I've seen worse movies, but this is undoubtedly what's in the old rubbish bin. script, bad performance, bad lighting and bad effects. <br /> <br /> The story, which is never meaningless, is about this simple little family, Daddy, Mommy and these little girls. The viewer is "an identification", all of which were boring and annoying. You only want dark side to get each one of them. <br /> <br /> Paper is a chef and hobbies are cars. He collects a wealthy man named Daddy Rubin and collects cars and who is being "in the mysterious East". Rubin saves it in a bird and mentions it as "Darkling". <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Darkling explains about 3 or 4 things: a shadow that is not a person, all of us is darkness, and the Devil. Choose one of these descriptions because you're playing it. In my opinion, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Darkling's problem seems to be a friend. He gets a human friend and, finally, man is not happy. This, of course, brings with it a huge wealth, then a man who joins Darkling with disaster following. <br /> <br /> And all of us, it's a long and boring movie. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
