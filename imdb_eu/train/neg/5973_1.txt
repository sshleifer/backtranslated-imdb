This film Jerry Bruckheimer, since 1997, is another great example that best suits him: he premiered his film for a year and did not come with a quality film. I'm not a critical filmmaker, but this movie was foreseen. Each attempt to make a joke, in all attempts at a hard time, and a wicked attempt at the love story, I intended to announce myself. Get yourself ready and save your money.
