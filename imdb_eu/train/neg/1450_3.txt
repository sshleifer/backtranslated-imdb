If someone wants to really understand Hitler, read the history of WWI not the history of World War II. Find out what happened in that war, that the soldiers killed all corpses all the time. According to what they saw in the first round of the world, how soldiers were so insane, when they called them "shellshocked" they called them post-traumatic stress. If you learn the real horrors of the First World War, Hitler will begin to understand you. You can understand that human beings can be decentralized to death, not just their evil, but the only way to confront the horrors that have been around them. <br /> <br /> This film unfortunately fails, many others do it. You should read some books on the subject and watch the movie "gloria de los caminos", the only WWI film ever ever made. You will see the frustration of the movie soldiers, a sense of protection and a deep lack of human life, unlike most bullets. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this movie is really the key. Point to Understanding Germany. A lost war, where millions and millions of Germans lost their lives, without any real reason. Then the economic collapse will collapse. These are extreme factors. <br /> <br /> The loss of members of the family and massive poverty will lead to those who are always extremists. Unfortunately this movie has been ignored and it spills another waste to throw a pile. Since it does not really have a real value, fiction films are based on fictional characters rather than giving Hitler a better idea. They just throw them out of the name Hitlers so they sell more.
