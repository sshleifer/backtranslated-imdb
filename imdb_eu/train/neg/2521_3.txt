There are some problems with this movie, but the last line is that it has tried to do too much. The basic story is pretty good, but money was just the story to make justice. There's no quote about actually killing this movie. Stuart Gordon (writer / conductor) writes the credits of "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids", a box-office smash. However, the movie had a huge amount of money paid by Disney. Honestly, that is, when you do not want to make a movie. If it waited a few more years, the technology would be cheaper to carry out many effects. (he can find a business with money).
