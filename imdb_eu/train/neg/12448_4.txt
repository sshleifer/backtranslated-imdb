Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy, a leader in a Wild West group, and is a regular six-misfits, struggling to fight-to-break-even. The seventh member of the set is a female assistant to Billy, but these women never have a long time, and the chronic position is open. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke, the girlfriend of Eastwood at that time). It seems Miss Lilly, as Doc (Scatman Crothers) calls if he is to marry his deceased father's estate at the age of 30, would be his legacy of his long-dear father. Geoffrey Lewis, the cartoonist. <br /> <br /> So what is the drawing of this movie? It's hard to say. There is a romantic tension between Billy and Lilly, but the problem is that the movie is so annoying and annoying in the first semester that suddenly becomes a "group" in the middle of the film, not only unbelievable but the viewer has taken care of himself. The lack of funds behind the Wild West show is chronic, but this topic is not enough to touch the movie. There is a problem with Miss Lilly in the western part of the country, from the funds that lead to the ruin of luxurious life (he thinks his relatives and the press think they are dead). But is it really supposed to believe in New York and his hope that he will not be able to return? <br /> <br /> No, the point of that movie seems to be Billy. He is a family leader, beloved troopers who are hanging with thin and thin losers. Is this film blurry and fuzzy? or try at least. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Clint shows us his ability with a gun, and a film that looks like a grotesque-looking film that avoids bank robbery. One of the gangs arrested the draft; Billy gives power to the local sheriff. The tents of the show smoke; An orphan makes another. However, there is no plot in the world that happens a lot. With the exception of Scatman Crothers, the young person is quite funny. Eastwood does not go beyond his game, though it looks better, but he's not surrounded by so many bundles. <br /> <br /> And yet, the movie lasts 116 minutes. Who is? Good question? <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10
