One of Boris Karloff's real clowns. Basically, Karloff dies (he seems to be older than 120 years old), the scientist in need of cash must finish his experiments before he dies. From Morocco he is now financing, he goes to the south of France, where he goes to the southern doctor who tries to chat with enough money to prove his doctor. Money desperates with the young rich woman of a cotton baron who dies. If he finances money, he helps him keep his money and continue with a whistle (I think I'm married). If you think that you're watching the movie, you should read the other people I had to read. Why? I missed this movie for two minutes. I did not know what happened with its many characters and convergent lines. Little is written and it's not much said late, then I did not really care. Only strange interests for Karloff's performance. Actually, it's the only thing I've ever seen in Bela Lugosi's strange country. It's not every scene, but a few and he asks me how much they hung up.
