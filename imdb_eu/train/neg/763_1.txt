I love Columbo and I've seen all the episodes quite a long time ago, but this is definitely the worst thing. Heavy pile is unnecessary and confusing, the time of the audience and wasting the active talent of Peter Falk, who is very boring. "Land", as it seems, seems to be taking place alongside the slightest trace of some of the components of that formula with great success. A part of the procedures I found to be very mysterious (or possibly annoying) was presented to the guest character of Peter Falken at a wedding called "Lt. Columbo". If the producers insist that they have a secret to keep the name of Columbo, why could not they completely ignore this line if it seems surprising to you? As I said, this is all the pits and all the real Columbo enthusiasts would do well to prevent plague.
