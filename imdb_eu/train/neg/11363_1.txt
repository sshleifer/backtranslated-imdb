This movie was announced on the radio, on TV, in magazines, etc. Almost every hour or time. So when we went to Kinnepolis, our expectations were very high. But boy, how sad it is! It's a Hollywood style on a movie movie. Shades shows so clearly that we are not "producing great Hollywood movies". I'm not a movie critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. As my subject, it's nothing, and then looped. You only have to watch TV, without actually seeing anything. When we saw Shades it was a feeling. SHEAD IS SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTION !!!
