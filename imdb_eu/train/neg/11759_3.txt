It's not for those looking for a sequel to the South African mini-series in the 1980s. It's not a historical drama. On the other hand, it is a dreadful fantasy that is unrelated to historical Shaka, but uses his name for a moving story of Sinclairs about a African superhero about Jesus, Lincoln, Superman, and Nelson Mandela. . <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are loud laughs, as Shaka breaks into a chained cross, and will put him in a serious slave. You know, as if Jesus wanted to do it, it was not so proud. <br /> <br /> Actually, I saw a single version of 98 minutes, but I can not imagine that shit twice. it would be better. <br /> <br /> And what's a mum name ?!
