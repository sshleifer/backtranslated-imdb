I downloaded the movie yesterday, using quality internet, it was good quality! I was watching a great-looking movie (although I knew it was a flop), as the movie looks like a supermarket, Amitabh Bachchan plays the role of a villain. Although actors like him would be worthy of their roles. unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan has been stunned by criminals, this has proved that no one can resist AMJAD KHAN's Rgv magic, to return to being a king of the past! Sholay is an old landmark of Indian cinema, with all the stars, a worship of dialogue, elegant cinematography and a great soundtrack with a great success today. The good actor like Ajay Devgan's TALENTS ARE wasted and his performance was good. average. Prashant Raj, a newcomer knows what he does. Nisha Kothari has proved to be one of the worst actors and I still do not know how the RGV team is still. A song that Urmila and Abhishek have not seen in the excitement and the song Mohanlal has tried his best and worked on Susmitha Sen's work that somehow liked to work in this film. She was the original carnage of Sholay
