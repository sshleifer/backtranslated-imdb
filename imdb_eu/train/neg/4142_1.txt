This is the worst movie I've ever seen! There was no good saying about this movie. I've seen bad movies, but this one does. There are no plots and most movies are redirecting you to the movie faster, you can do it faster or wonder what the hell happens, you can not seriously think about someone thinking about this movie and watching it. I feel like anyone should sit down at this painful half hour. Please take my advice and do not look at this movie. I know that the waste time in your life is useless.
