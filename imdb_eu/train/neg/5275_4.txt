Disappearance We find couples who take up a family vacation in Mexico and have serious problems, due to the unknown reasons to visit a abandoned town in 1948 following the main highway. Mrs. Weaver's house seems to be an unbelievable initial, and has a tourist appeal until they enter into a family tonight and others start to get good reasons that others have had the same problem with serious results. Henleys has watched Blair-Witch-Project-skiing video logger out of the village's latest victims, which ironically shows the best performance of all the people in this movie. That Hamlin and Dey's performances are so much better than those that suppose, the "emotional effect" seems to me throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> It attracts most of the disappearance, because it has many suspense and good management. However, plots are unexpected and unexpected, seemingly meaningless. It's worse, however, that there is no understanding of what's going on in the movie, and that's why it's a bit steeper. In my opinion, film makers are focused on creating scenic streaming streams, which have cast all the elements of good story: land development, gradual explanation of themes and symbols that create a cohesive solution / result. <br /> <br /> The most difficult part of the film for the first three quarters of me, spreads and curiosity for certain parts of the plot, as suddenly as we were unleashed until then. It is worth the explanation: <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of the Indians on the walls? What happened to the original people of Weaver? What was the connection with people with dinner? What did Sheriff know? What did the missing boy find something? <br /> <br /> This, he thought, was a bad move, creating a resentment. I invested some hypothetical explanations on some of these alternate and some hypothetical explanations of curious facts, without the sole end of the authors being able to answer any of these things. These are some pretty cliffhangers ending next week to try to re-assemble, but a completely frustrating and inappropiate end-to-end movie.
