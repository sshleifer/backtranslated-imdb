OK, now what have I seen TRASH now? "The mountain of the witches" has been one of the Spanish Spanish farms and one of the insanity and, at the same time, it is very compelling. It's sensible nothing here and I doubt that it has been a collaborative script, but I can not shut it off anyway. He begins to shuffle himself with a sequence about an angry little girl who has killed her mother's cat. So, do you think this movie is in the children with bad forces? No reason, because after this introduction, the girl and her wickedness are no longer mentioned. Then cut the guy, who will ever see the greatest vibration in his model, that breaks his discomfort with his girlfriend. When he asks him to spend his vacation, his employer may ask himself to assign any assignment! Excellent movement The video starts at the end, which travels to an isolated mountain area to capture some peaks. No, he did not even pick a new girl (Patty Shepard) and before her topless pictures! Are there unusual events during the trip? Did you guess? they never explain. The girl wakes up in the middle of the woods, shouts everywhere screaming and someone steals jeep! Actually, cars are playing witches? Apparently, the assembly of silent witches is the owner of the mountains and practiced voodoo for foreigners. The soil is as close as I describe it, but I am a good choice? The atmosphere is more important here! "The Mountain of Sorceresses" is occasionally horrible, with amazing music and interesting cinematography. Picking up characters seem stunning and Patty Shepard is a giant heroine. This is the legendary European horror film, if only one person remembered writing a structured script.
