In the 1930s, Los Angeles was a golden age with its film industry and many other great potentials to become rich and famous and happy. People came to fill their dreams. The only hope they were to offer long kisses and welcome was a success and they found themselves in a terrible way, most of them starving, disillusioned and involuntarily alive, they looked for little respect for dirty bars and bad hotels. <br /> <br /> The young Italian-American writer Arturo Bandini arrives at the LA in a similar search - she opened her charm to write one of these beautiful rich women and to write a great career in the career. Until now writing a single story published in a dark tale. He wants to create a romantic masterpiece, he seems to be unable to produce anything without experimenting, even though he sometimes helps survive the local editor sent by the magazine story. He is proud to present himself in Italy, but his heart deeply feels as if his origins Italian feel burdensome. Once they dared to earn money and they dared to dine more than once and dreamed that he dreamed to become a hostage. <br /> <br /> She had a cold and sour coffee, and a curse fell from her insult, unpredictable excuses, and the relationship between her hidden love. The fact that Camila was trying to get US citizenship is, in her opinion, trying to achieve national nations. Although he is a stronger and more experienced person, his situation in Mexico's beautiful woman is far more difficult than Arturo. <br /> <br /> Is it obvious that Arturo finds inspiration to work on the novel? Is it possible that their love will eventually find the sun? Is their love been bad? <br /> <br /> It is very surprising to know that chemistry between Salma Hayek and the two main characters made by Colin Farrell does not work. Relationship has no raw and genuine feelings. Although Hayek's character is more intense, compared to Farrell, Camilla's arms have made him passionate and forceful that Frida's brilliant character is the same. Likewise, it is difficult to have a good nature, being understood and not understood and illiterate, using quite complicated characters and complicated phrases. Phil Marlowe's harder nature would fit Farrell better, although it seems strangely surprising in a vintage dress, he lost sight of a fragile world of thirty-year-olds that balances unbalanced love and truthfulness. to himself <br /> <br /> Enjoying watching on two screens is not well. Their relationship may be wild, but it is likely that thunder and lightning will not be a storm, what is the true passion without feeling unexplored feelings internally. It is very sad that the potential of such an interesting screenplay and good actors has been useless, and has become an average gray that has been forgotten recently.
