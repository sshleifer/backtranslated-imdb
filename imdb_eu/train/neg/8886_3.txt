He is not very impressed. It's hard to offer the ruin of this film because there is no development of the plot. Everything is clear in the first ten minutes and from there it sees dry paint. The play seems to be very poor, and it reminds me of the old Maoists' films about China's Chinese daily TV. It's very difficult to tell the women's role, Yuwen, because the story seems to be just like a wooden dummy. He reminds me of the fierce star Gong Li, a good Western actor, had a certain reputation on his face all the time. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuang's "Blue Kite" featured a longer film. But do not be fooled in a small town, the spring was established at the end of the 40s. Unlike the Blue Kite, the fact that this film is set forth in agitation is irrelevant in its argument, the waste of the town seems to be just a strange scenario. <br /> <br /> I wonder if he asks Tian Zhuangzhuang to focus on the Western cinema's reputation and is a different movie that is different from "beautiful aliens" or "hypnotic" and just boring and unmatched . <br /> <br /> Any film that matches the description 'overlapping', that is. I can not see here the concern of the Chinese film industry.
