I'm sorry to say that it was one of the worst movie ever I've ever seen. Despite being fascinated by visuals (for example, the use of color was absolutely astonishing), it was quite boring and disturbing (see insight for father / son). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Additionally, music is completely missing and you're thinking of Michael Nyman (soundtracks for most Greenaway movies he wrote) wonderful soundtracks, you can imagine what makes the difference. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
