A really short film. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, it's not rhythm and dramatically lacking. <br /> <br /> In addition to being very slow, Acre seems to be using the stock footage again and again. At night I asked how many times I saw it on the pitch. This little crack on the earth. <br /> <br /> It also has a fundamental error to think if the viewer does not know things. Instead of confusing it. So, there are any problems, without a signal we suddenly encounter, although marriage does not seem to seem right. We are convinced that Jacob is the worst peasant in the universe, it seems that he has spent little time in the farm and it seems that the land has been bought with an unnecessary acre. Beth has the key to a book store? There are several other questions that will later work on the movie later, much later, in fact, too late. <br /> <br /> And the point of Acre. Do horror filmmakers warn that large objects of inanimate are not horrifying at all? And if they want to be too acre, do it like that. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a fair fear, Beth (the best performance of the piece, and then the Jefferson police). ) Suddenly, he is under the sun because he is "medication". <br /> <br /> Looking down on the areas where the son who is missing for ten more minutes (he crawled out of the window when he was six months old) goes down after a poorly written scene written by the film. Bad Plinky Plon's "horror" music fails in the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Often bad movies can be fun, but not pure Acre, that is, bad.
