This is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. After about an hour I refused to see it and I regretted that hour. activity is horrible and there is hardly any plot. My intention is that someone created a curious form of an animal and began to make a story about it. Earning some ideas from some movies such as Resident Evil and Aliens does not create such a movie. If it was Korean's first movie, I would not like to miss a Korean movie trailer ... <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this movie is a good reason not to believe that the high score is definitely expected. I believe that all Internet-based Internet-based games have rated 8 films, even though they do not know what it's about.
