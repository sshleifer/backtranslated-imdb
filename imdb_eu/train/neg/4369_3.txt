*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a "thriller" in First National in the United States. Karloff Sartorius is a doctor, because he has to leave his research because his money has dried up. Karloff has to retire to France and has to start a medical practice. It is suggested by a conventional woman who wants to eliminate her older husband. Karloff knows that he needs money. Meanwhile, the wife is dancing about the town with a good toy. Karloff eventually injects the old geyser into poison and starts. However, his son (from other marriages) dies before he dies and is determined to change his will. When the wife tosses the beans, her son holds a handful of hands. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Karloff's nurse murdered Karloff to kill the old man. When Karloff knows that he has no money, he asks his wife to poison his son. Her nurse Karloff finds herself supposed to be and she's missing the hiccups. Analysis shows a poison, but not so long as Karloff kidnaps his nurse. <br /> <br /> To shorten the short story, the nurse escapes, saves the police and saves the son of the injector. Karloff. Karloff injects it and dies. <br /> <br /> This film has good points. Karloff is aware of and plays at the Devil Command and the Doctor once again. It is curious to see, however, a bit of stiffness and bending. We will never know why he walks. I suspect that the director thought he had made more malice. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the wife of his wife covers something terrible. French accent Although it's wrong, you still hate (or maybe you hate it for his work ...). <br /> <br /> Average below average for a Karloff vehicle. If you buy a movie VHS copy, audio is a bit dumb.
