There is a lot of hype related to this movie. So, we have to face them, even though the main reasons that one sees are Leo and Cate, because they are not the best actors in this movie. I'm not saying that actors are not, they say they're stuffed with this movie. The special effects were decent (and, in other words, filmmakers made a good job of looking after the ship), but it also has great IT errors. For example, when you enter the boat, you will see an unfinished blue screen behind your main characters. <br /> <br /> I am not bad, I love the story of REAL Titanic, but I found this film insulted to this story. The editing was awful: there is no reason to have more than 2 1/2 hours of film (except a biography of MAYBE) and they have liked the script and the script. <br /> <br /> I will tell you. It might have been better than I'd predict music (and not "My Heart Will Go On"). There seems to be a scene for me when the ship sank and hits the music that strikes. That may be the protagonist of the movie. As regards the whole atmosphere, it was very sad. I felt sad when Jack was dead, but I do not know what the director can do. I know that in a small walnut, the great story of the Titanic is immensely dramatic. chick flick hyped.
