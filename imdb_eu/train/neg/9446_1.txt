A totally upbeat adaptation of the great children's book. Raw and inappropriate humor, scary parts, and a nasty story about the boy's boy, trying to get a boy to school, is totally inadequate for children who want to see it. Young people from the book (3-8). Do not waste your money, your time, or your good opinion.
