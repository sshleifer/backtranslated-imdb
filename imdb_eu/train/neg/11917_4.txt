Genghis Cohn is a British movie about a British police commissioner at the end of the 1950s (very much), a murderer of a Jewish comedy that was murdered 15 years earlier while serving at Hitler. He returns the ghost and wants to live his murderer as a Jew for the murder committed. <br /> Otto, the German police know the name of this spirit, because it was the last thing that was killed. said Yiddish, "Kiss my ass." The police did not speak at all, so asked her until she found the meaning. Everyone who murmured the "kiss in my butt" remembered the name of the comedy called Genghis Cohn. <br /> <br /> There are men who kill the Police Commissioner's jurisdiction. , and there is no trace of help. The knives killed in a local butcher have killed men. The butcher announces his store is missing from the store while he stays in the back and onions, so the curator is a suspect. The first man is dying before the butcher's wife, so the butcher is a suspect. But he thought he was very busy with the men who had slept with his wife, who had been sleeping. All men die immediately after the end of love. <br /> <br /> I think it might be a bit more than the spirit of Genghis Cohn. It seems to be very good, as if it were in a smooth car accident. I can not guess that they are a British movie and they are known for being very polite. Part of his material uses his stand-up routing and I'm not very entertained. <br /> <br /> This movie was just a joke I gave it to 4. I thought it was a little worse than that. The murder of the movies is a mystery (where do they come from?), And it seems to be more helpful than Genghis. The Jewish culture gave me a little look, but it was a deep skin. Do all Jews love liver and onion sandwiches? Do you all say "shtoop" and "meshuganah" in the daily dictionary? Is not the most important thing we need to know more about culture? <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in a Jewish community in Berkeley, CA, and I was not the only person in the classroom. completely gray or white. (I have no gray or white hair). We were 18, and after 20 minutes they left the movie to discuss the movie. There were two main concerns: 1. The film was a clear heart and the future generations could not have the seriousness of what happened and 2. When the Holocaust survived, future generations do not know what happened. I thought that this second concern was ridiculous, and they told me that I did not have to worry about the literature I had and I would always like people who would like to see the movies. A wicked man kills 6,000,000 will never be forgotten. I write this last paragraph that day told me about my experiences.
