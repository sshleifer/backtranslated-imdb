If this is a worst movie this year - it's OK. The first promo indicates that Dhoom 2-style film is boring, and I knew first that it would be a bad movie. Watching Yashraj in a movie or maybe watching Curious But I was amazed by this movie, Dhoom 2 was even worse, and I expected Saif-Kareena to get Safer-Kareena's cool first Saif show, and what is Kareena so artificial and then Anil Kapoor God, what's happening in the movie strangely What role is it? What is it doing? His first scene is fine, but then he turns his action into a repetitive one and overcomes Akshay because he had a nice scene, but then the movie has bored and outgrowed his childhood love, Rajnikant-style children's scenes and all the boring scenes. At the end is another joke <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Acharya would direct 3 more films, if this film worked, Yashraj's strategy, money just like any other crap filmmaker Music (Vishal Shekhar) is common <br /> <br /> Performances Akshay Kumar extracts fresh film due to fresh air. Saif Ali Khan offers really bad times, Kareena is very bad, unfortunately, the ham Anil Kapoor is unfortunately disappointing and the show gets worse.
