I saw this movie, Joe Bob Briggs, stayed with Monstervision at TNT. Although he could not make this film a pleasant one. Until I finished I saw the only reason I taught video production and I wanted to make sure my students never had to be bad ... but I had to take all my hard stomach to sit around. It's like flirting with your grandmother with a 15-year-old boy ... to be painful. <br /> <br /> If you take the real movie, then you'll see it plunging into thinner paint and it will be more entertaining. Seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see the S-Mart trash movie, go back as if it were a rumor.
