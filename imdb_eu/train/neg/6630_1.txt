Recovery is horrible. I went to see tonight ... on the first day, planning and managing much noise. But in the first half hour, we knew it was a disaster. Not only does the hype create, but it also insults the original super-production. The script had gaps, the editing was dismantled several times. The great actress Mohanlal worked well. Amitabh was well ... the director wanted to portray his malignant nature but he went a bit about the board, which was so powerful. Suitable Ajay in such roles is also disappointing. Let's not start with the new type of Prashant ... Nobody would be proud of starting something like that. Rajpal Yadav laughed, but he could not smile at anyone else's luck, his humor and a loud voice. Nisha Kothari has proved that she is the worst actress today. In short, I thought that RGV was one of the most talented and elegant managers in India ... it failed to fail. He took on an enormous challenge and responsibility to call the best Hindi movie and make a mess.
