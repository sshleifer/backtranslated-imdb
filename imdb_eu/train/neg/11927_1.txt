Without a doubt, the worst film I have ever seen. I finally suffered, surely there was something to be here, but not. On the plot, when there is no clicking, it goes to the point of non-existence; It's a conversation that stops coming to the streets; characters are not developing beyond sketches; The set is topical. Even worse, considering his co-director, photography is so. <br /> <br /> The comments that lead to Get Carter, Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are out of the mark; Saints of Lives are missing their innovation, they only leave their depths and shadows. In short, his craft. An untested editor probably reduces the 30-minute short film, but this is a 6-million-year-old movie project; with the pain that causes himself. He has received funding (probably, just like Rankin) while other small movies are struggling to cash in on British film making.
