I love sharks. And mutants. And explosions. Theoretically, considering these parameters, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should be the best movie ever. <br /> <br /> It is not. <br /> <br /> The monsters look like a Power Rangers wicked, and roughly have the same level of rubber movement. That would be fine if the authors were not proud of their design. That is, to get a mysterious / scifi / horror film for a guy who has short rubber outfits, the shark will get a lot of time on the screen. What is given is usually vibration and rhythm. I suppose you suppose that it is so terrifying that the cameraman is too terrified. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to a person who is eating, the camera goes to the shark. The camera returns to the person who wants to eat, they only shout and armless. And like that. <br /> <br /> The costume is bad, the performance is inadequate, and the special effects are similar, but it is the farthest writing. Things happen completely randomly, people eat more or they can explode. WANTED TO BE FAMILY, the people who made this film had a definitive explosion ... a better attitude. Shooting characters is a great explosion of cars and cars. They shoot the helicopters, there's a lot of explosions. The canyon, the rocks, the trees, THE FRONT, have exploded, indeed, the horrible shark exploded at the end. <br /> <br /> Talking about, I do not like a crazy person, I find it hard to believe that anyone who has a giant half-gigantic half-shark had a huge sexual sex with a woman would find it hard to think freaky shark people a good idea for babies da. That is to say, if that person is not, crazy scientist in this film. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is that the movie is so random (and sometimes boring), even though its malice is not enough to really hold the person's interest. It might be good for your friends with MST3K, but if you catch a bad boy before that, do the opposite and change the channel.
