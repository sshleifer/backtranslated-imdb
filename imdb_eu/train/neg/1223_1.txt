What a weekend Two days ago I saw the first part of "War Games 2: Dead Code", now "outside". In my mind, I wanted to reach a decision that was worse in terms of pain. I think that "away" was worse. <br /> <br /> Other comments have been said earlier: non-realistic, non-logic, etc. - The only thing that really is to be added is that sometime I have felt a bit more women than women, I would recommend a Darwin prize if it really died (I only saw it in the first part, so I do not know). Shortly afterwards, I distributed two Darwin prizes (if possible) for their stupidity. <br /> <br /> And, Mr.: Produced by Kim Basinger? So he did not only know the script, but he was in charge of making money in vain. I think people who are losing a lot of people seem evil, because they could nurture and give money to few people, giving up 80% of those who watched the cinema and gave up 20%. the opportunity to show the stupidity.
