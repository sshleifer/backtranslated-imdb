This movie is pretty fun because of the great performance by Virginia Madsen and the beautiful Lindsey Haun. However, the film is so predictable that the reason is that before seeing all this. I have not read a Mother's Gift, but I hope Britney and Lynne Spears are totally different from this movie. If the music video is basically not finished with a music video clip, it remembers the entire plagiarized word of the movie.
