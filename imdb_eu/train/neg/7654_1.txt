It seemed to me to be terrifying and overwhelming reviews of this movie. I wanted to see what was going to be awful, but it was three weeks in theaters. Gigli is the only other film to manage. <br /> <br /> When the movie came out on DVD, I bought what it was horrible to see. I could not imagine the great attention that was achieved in this movie. After seeing, I understand. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me not get this movie without some cool movies. At first there is a good shot that shows the bullet that he has thrown inside the gun. And it's a way of looking at how the monsters die in this movie; But what you see old is aging. <br /> <br /> Begin with the first movie: Tara Reid. If the bad performance is a sin, then Helle would come up with Tara Reid as she is terribly terrifying at this amazing movie, it's unthinkable. And from every role, he is curator. Now, if he plays a bad sex toy and he's just headed out, maybe I'd be sorry for how he treats his character. It seems that Uwe Boll did not realize this, although it seems that if he got rid of the T-shirt, he thinks he would see them. He simply did not realize that making the film in the wrong moment at that moment made the film so horny that it was bad. And is it a Mexican song? I can not say <br /> <br /> This leads me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows some of the worst management abilities you'll see in a movie. I mean, I'd give it to the house of the dead (and I'm only doing it for a few movies), but HotD would get at least one B compared to that scrap of garbage. The movie begins with a very long narration that causes instant confusion (and a great narrator reads) and from then on, cuts are really stupid. This point is looking for a building that has been destroyed by Slater and Reid and the screen shuts down. When he returned, Slater and Reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly the entire army is joined. Eh? <br /> <br /> And someone is NOT checking this bug in this movie. In a moment, the team crosses the glass, but it breaks the glass before touching it. The Tara Reiden earrings change the color in the middle of a scene, and after slatering a friend Slater, you can see that it starts to rise. <br /> <br /> In the story ... I really missed. Something that releases the darkness of an ancient line and someone opens the way or something and all the bad monster will appear. It's just an excuse to have plenty of gun scenes (a technology that is so powerful here that the characters never need to reload in this movie), just BORING. <br /> <br /> When I bought this movie, I expected a lot of stupid laugh. I did not laugh, but I think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid.
