I read the back of the box and spoke with Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "wonderful! That will be great!" I was so wrong. The story was completely upset. Actually, I still do not get it. Do I think that all the people drink, smoke (opium?) And sex. Not that these are not good movies, but please! Where was the story? I finished the movie myself, and it was at the end, but the movie was almost over. If you want to rent it Do not believe in the back of the box.
