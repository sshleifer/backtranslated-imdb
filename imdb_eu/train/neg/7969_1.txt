OK to me and a movie that Joe Swatman has bought. Ok, it's not the worst movie I've reviewed this week, but it's still terrified. We've been having fun while watching this piece of shit. Monster Jigsaw is a mash of all the ideas of these dysfunctions. You know what it is to have when someone comes with a buzzsaw and a whitish shotgun, the movie was not as penetrating as we expected it, I mean deaths that are heart attack. Again, I think theater theater, the sum of the actors must be porn stars and that's why it's been introduced for some reason. <br /> <br /> It is a very bad end, it opens up to Jigsaw 2, but that will never happen, but it will not come. <br /> <br /> My ratings: <br /> <br /> 4/100 fun simulation (how funny we were mocking) 73/100 acts 8/100 in general 12/100
