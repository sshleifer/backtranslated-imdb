One of the worst movies. It's not fun, poor television style cinematography, performance. Sad to be able to barely walk the ancient ancient actors, and even less. Nancy Young can not play her mind. Immense direction Paired with the worst TV movies. Provisional jokes fall weak. The premise of the film is also meaningless. Somehow it is supposed to stop the wedding, but there is no logic behind its actions. The slow rhythm left her to look at her, but I suffered as a result. The old men are supposed to act as young and ridiculous, but it's fun to be rather fun. How did they get the money for that?
