Even though I do not like the type of person who denies the personal taste of others; If you want something, it's okay. But this film was horrible and there was no way. I do not like Ani Difranco too, but I can admit the guitarist and songwriter. But I can not believe it's a passionate quality for this movie. Many people are a way out of the exact portrait of high school students. Maybe, but it's all portrayed. It seems that the attempt at "Naked Gun" is a type of comedy, but it deactivates time; There are too many lines between each actor, if they keep laughing (there is not). Those who write the script were all over the place. In a philosophy they tried to gather a lot of controversial issues, almost never developed one of them (especially a teacher who set the girl). I did not laugh once in this whole movie. I was terribly humiliated by this attempt at humor and satire, rolling my eyes on the screen without losing anything.
