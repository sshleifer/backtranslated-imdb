With the title "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes", anyone who intends to do this either would expect a bad science fiction film, or b) a science-fiction movie comedy. Both assume a mess, with a dose of parody wet. Unfortunately, it soon falls. <br /> <br /> You never get to realize the movie seriously, I realize that, but I think it's fun to think, right? I found out they were just joking or in a few situations (that is, phone conversations, Russian olympian spying, steroids that ate cereals, Superman Loisen, etc.). The "Killer Tomatoes Attack" is an attempt to make it a classic cult, but it does not do it. A classic worship is a movie that is so different, it only understands only one group of people (or a similar description). The "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" may be any person of 8 years of humor. That's why worship is not as a film. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is a good actor: Sharon Taylor, Lois Fairchild. The reporter is thin and gawdy, but with a lovable personality, he likes to love and is a natural comedy. Unfortunately, it's wrong here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Attack of killer tomatoes" is not as funny as "Amazonas mujeres en la Luna" or "Kentucky Fried Movie". You can have some hilarious moments, so I'd recommend to watch it once. The avoidance of the director's cuts, the film's breaks by the producer and allegedly "lost" footage is dubbed into an African-speaking dialect (it can be found in print tape outside in English).
