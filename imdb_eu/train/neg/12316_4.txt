The director Jonathan Lynn has done a few comedies such as 'Greedy' and 'Clue'. This is not one of them. In accordance with the inspiration of the "Academy of Police", Steve Martin Phil Silvers plays the role of the former as a sergeant in the army. But the idyllic life of Bilkus and its unmistakable look at his plate is when an old enemy visits the base decided to catch him during the event. There's really nothing wrong. It's totally dull. It's not very funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman make some laughter, but they're better than that, and it's pretty painful to see thin material that works.
