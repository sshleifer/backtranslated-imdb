Dark Rising is your usual bad, of course, a horror / fantasy fantasy movie. An elephant has some strange and explanatory lands with holes to fit through with them. In most of the time I did not know what happened, but it did not really matter, mixing a story about the extermination of a simple demon huntsman from the infernal dimensions of evil witchcraft and a book of evil. They work on elements and characters that are unnecessarily absent or completely disappear. Playing is bad, but I guess I can not do much to say the truth with this script. There are two topless scenes, probably the only reason for a bad movie (like many other bad films). If you fail to pass this one, if there is no other place in T.V.
