Pyare Mohan will safely enter the blacklist of one of the worst movies in human beings. The movie, one of the many movies for the disabled, due to the great success of Black's, is a longing for the seniors to be disabled. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are just caricatures for disabled people. While black depicted emotions and landscapes of highly-regarded women and gave us a glimpse of his world, Pyare Mohan shows two red monkeys, who support half of the world with disabilities and who do not have half of the world to protect the interests of love. Anu Malik's music is pretty straightforward. Vivek Oberoi, a promising beginner with Saathiya, has quickly lost his balls to Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was never an acceptable actor and had to forbid film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just dangerous dangers without Thialnd's nightmares, save no one - except those mentioned. Boman Iran, as Mr. Toni Don, is quite acceptable. If possible, try the movie.
