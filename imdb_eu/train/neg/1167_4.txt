I really tried this movie, but in the end I did not work for myself. I've seen most of Kitamura's output and I found it to be very variable. Life, like all his films, has an interesting plot, some nifty sequences and reasonable creations. However, these qualities have a brief supply in Alive. The land is cool if there is no original and it can make a beautiful movie. Unfortunately, the slowdown is slow and it takes a movie age to go ahead, before reaching the planned locations. The action is just right, the last fight is pretty cool, and about the first about OK. The first one also worsens camera camera work, making less consistency. There are some interesting ideas in the conversation and some interesting ideas in the conversation, but the film still cuts down. The characters are not well-formed, well-interpreted, and the overall color and scheme is boring and boring. The movie is not entirely horrible and has some points of interest; The prudent use of the fast forward button may be better. After about twenty minutes running, this was quite a sensible scientific thriller. The film is very sad. We recommend that Kitumura be very patient and with great patience.
