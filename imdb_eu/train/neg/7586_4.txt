Summer Holiday Eugene O'Neill's forgotten version of Ah Wilderness is well-deserved by the adaptation of Take Me Along's Broadway music. Except for the song Stanley Steamer, another Harry Warren-Ralph Blane can not be remembered, which is also doubtful. <br /> <br /> After publishing this movie, MGM went to Mickey Rooney and did not think it was a coincidence. The film was made in 1946 and premiered in 1948, as a teenage boy, Andy Hardy, of 26. At the age of 17, youth was an old age that influenced young rebellion in a spirit. <br /> <br /> Rooney made four films to MGM from 1946 to 1948, this is Killer McCoy. Robert Taylor's A Crowd Roars Version, Andy Hardy's Love Love and Words and Music. In all of them Rooney arrived. In Andy Hardy, Mickey came to an adult Andy Hardy in the Second World War. Why she only knew Louis B. Mayer. <br /> <br /> Rooney's bad casting The summer vacation is getting worse, the original Ah Wilderness's Walter Huston here puts his dad's attention. And in Broadway, Take Me Along, when he won the Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, he played with Uncle Sid, Frank Frank, the great universe that played Great, which is the main character. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven goes to Judy Garland as a sweet and brave friend of Rooney, and Marilyn Maxwell plays Rooney's adult education show. At the original theater, O'Neill has a prostitute, but it was the Hollywood Code, so everything that Marilyn did was a young Rooney. <br /> <br /> There were really many talented people in the hands. They make one and the best, but summer vacations fade pretty quickly in a cold fall.
