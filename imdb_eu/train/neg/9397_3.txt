Most of the episodes of RMFTM were seen as a teenage boy from "Cliffhanger Theater" a few years ago at midnight at night and then again at Mystery Science Theater in the early 90's. Time has not been good. <br /> <br /> Certainly, I can make special budgets for low-budget quotes for the 50th. (IMO Commando Cody's flight scenes were better than George Reeves / Superman in his TV series). And I can also give bonuses for improvement, improvement and "choreography". except for the guy who rules the moon's ruler. It is very confusing. Unlike pretendors, it does not look like a despotic rule of a foreign race. Shiny conversation works well: everyone breaks lines to break things like sutures, wasting them or interrupting things like "thinking" or "introspection". As they all do, the viewer is able to dive in a bit, and even more to my modern sensibilities, it does not interfere much. <br /> <br /> My writing and graphics really excite me. I do not talk about the sunny weather in the moon, or a baking soda reaction boat or a flying dressed up / down and "slow / slow" control. I do not feel the disturbance of resolutions against Cliffhangers that end the chapter. We are talking about the memory of our supposed heroes that are more rigid than fence, and that they have not accumulated memories. And though the dialog box is drawn as a express train, the plot passes through the same movements repeatedly. <br /> <br /> Punch: Cody commands and their friends are a secret science laboratory that is in charge of protecting the Earth's (or at least US) level. But his office is not a guardian or security controller. They also have locks on the front. So the bad guy goes on RIGHT IN and goes over the Cody bell and his staff ... not once (perhaps understandable) but several times. In the second session they also kidnap her female assistant. And they never got the smartest. To prove my point, allow Cody to emphasize his jumble on his suit, and it creates problems and does not succeed in catching anyone. He does this again and again. Cody also takes the ship to the Moon (she prepares a female assistant), lasts about 30 seconds and immediately returns and returns. Cody catches some Atomic Ray player ... and he immediately loses the bad guy, who could not worry. And like that. <br /> <br /> And we can imagine that Cody's efforts were so important to save them from the US Coast Guard, with carbines, some helicopters and some tank or soldiers. Two recoveries, instead of working with the local police at all times. This was a military operation, but they acted as part of "Gangbusters". <br /> <br /> The stomach is pretty hard. I think the creator was deeply confined in the field of his story, using budget and time constraints ... and I appreciate that Cody is a really sensible man (even if he loses half a tenth). But I can not shout "DOOR! BLOVER DOOOOR !!" When gangsters enter their lab or attempt to hit the ship and there is no security measure in the landing area ... not a barrier (!). <br /> <br /> It's OK. I saw between the three Republican magazines "Phantom Creeps" a better plot and "Undersea Kingdom" ("hah!") And "Radar Men" was a better hero, but it's a good time. <br /> <br /> BTW ... why do "Radar" men? They did not use radar, they used the Atomic Ray Guns. The title would not have been "Ray Moon Atomic Gun Gun" men. "
