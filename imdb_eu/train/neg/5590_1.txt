Horrible movie A young painter who hangs around a young girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil makes his movements on his side and has some of the most important lines in film history. Richard Burton looks like death in this movie, and we think he looks "sixty years old." Playing is bad, just like in the plot. The characters are awesome, as well as the story. It's hard to feel everyone's feelings for this movie, except for a man who plays Larry Ewashen's Tatum movie. This movie is a waste of time. If you're a tatum enthusiast, it's like me. That's why I rented it first. Do not watch the movie. It's very bad and you ask that PAPER MOON might be. It was not there, NEWS AND NEWS OF BIKAIKO are good, but have not rented this film yet. And if you're a fan of Burton, rent something good and not fossil.
