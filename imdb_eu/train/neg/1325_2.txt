Richard Dreyfuss is indeed in this movie, but in a small part. NO "obsessed" is the filmmaker. It is a group business manager. Check the box for the movie. There is no erotic scene with Sondra Locke, as advertised, if the term "erotic" is not quite a lie. I would not have thought that the film was Richard Dreyfuss as an important character. While I realized that, in the 60's, Leonard Cohen's Suzanne "famous anthem was an artistic influence, as well as the recurring lines of James Joyce's" Ulysses ", an interesting reference for the end of Ingmar Bergman's" The Seventh Seal. " and yet I found a bad attempt to unify similar elements and symbolic moods. "Last year in Marianbad" and "Un Chien Andalou." If you like the idea of ​​an eccentric artistic group, there are many high-profile films, "Bye, Bye, Brasil" and "Cecil B. Demented".
