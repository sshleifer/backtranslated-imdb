Down to the floor / (2001) * (out of four) <br /> <br /> Blake's French: <br /> <br /> "Down to the ground" is a deceptive and desperate comedy that can be sitting at home. Theatrical comedy Chris Rock plays a television show that looks like the sky. Speaking of the sky, the film is based on the film "Heaven Can Wait" in 1978. It was a good movie, and that's a good idea, for a team of scriptwriters to take decent material and turn it into waste. Chris and Paul Weitz have lost almost all their goals. From the concept to the storyteller, "Down to the ground" fails to fail; This is a very bad production. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock standup is mystical comedian, both in this film and in real life. He plays Lance Barton, whose director (Frankie Faison) feels even more sorry for him on an amateur night in a local theater. Shortly after the screenplay proves that its talent is missing, the character dump trucks with high-speed cameras. The death, considered by Eugene Levy, is wrong before Lance's number is gone. God's assistant (Chazz Palminteri) is angry and Lance decides to leave it for a while, if he gets only one 60-year-old whitewater body. <br /> <br /> The Old Name is Mr. Wellington, and his life has problems. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge), with his assistant (Greg Germann), has a close relationship with stealing his money. But it's well that Lance, in the hands of Mr. Wellington, is in love with a young black woman named Sontee (Regina King). Meanwhile, there is a batch to kill Wellington, trying to get a better body at Lance, and deals with the mixed feelings of Sontee. Wellington's state of affairs with hospital status. <br /> <br /> <br /> "The Earth" has some good ideas but it is full of a fascinating and vibrant love story, full of materials and recycled materials. The biggest problem it gets is Lance as Wellington Wellness. Chris Rock is a celebrity and advertising actor, so it will not be in most of the films; All the characters see the new Lance as Wellington, but we see it as Chris Rock. This is ideal for the love story; We think that a young woman would fall to Lance, but, actually, she's really an old gray hair. That is not so persuaded. <br /> <br /> The horror comic situation involves seeing an old man doing funny things by a young black man. What lacks the inspiration when the characters are in conflict is unknown. Check out "Something About Mary". In a fun scene, the characters endure tremendous experiences, not according to their will. Here, the Spear knows that it is in the body of an older man, and older men would not normally do things. Lance did not know when he could have the potential. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the concept: we never knew Mr. Wellington first, so how can we compare Lance without knowing what his body is originally similar to. To get rid of everything, Chris Rock has to pay attention here and the character Rock is too much. He recites simple and painful ordinary templates; His conversation is so obvious, timeless and correct. I hated the humor of the movie. There are so many jokes and comic situations. Chris Rock is like watching Chris Rock, it's not a character in a movie. <br /> <br /> Let's emphasize the "Down to the ground". Mark Addy does nothing worse in "Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas". Eugene Levy and Chazz Palmentari are well thrown, but they are subject to a scaled script. They are good qualities that can be mentioned at that moment, and if you remember another week, it's not likely that I will come.
