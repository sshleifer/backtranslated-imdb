A unique opportunity and the director Indy could make an interesting movie about a rock musician on the verge. It could have been a good film, as if it were to traumatise the traumatic past of John Livia and his psyche. Instead, John Liecon's attempt to identify John Livien's life is ridiculous. John Livien's suicide mother's hero was John Lennon and wanted to become as powerful and productive as Lennon himself. Instead of focussing on John Lennon's music, and instead of focusing on the great ability of others to learn about their life, Lennon's heritage was a confused and confusing drug addiction. man I'm a fan of John Lennon and he reminded me of a "crazy" person obsessed with Lennon's murderer, Mark Lennon, with Lennon. Lennon was a man who had someone else's killer of Lennon's personality crisis. Do we have to remember this? John Lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty, and I was keen to see another disturbed person, as the star of Lennon's obsessed movie and I did not show his beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono thanked John Lennon for his remembrance, giving him the opportunity to remember his Central Parks for their fans, and remember John. Instead, the director of this film used the site to try to commit suicide of the killer. I found this so disturbing and shameless to Lennon's memory. Peace killed an absurd death and killed a violent death around him and he felt a terrible wound for Lennon fans. The movie completely ruined me. It could have been a decent film, but it gave me a bitter taste in my mouth. John Lennon and his family will rest in peace and remembers no murder about this film.
