I never wanted to be a member of the club, especially this one. <br /> <br /> Starr Andreeff is a single mom / stripper. > <br /> Leave a vampire woman and die. <br /> <br /> He starts pushing the blood and John Savage encounters himself asking Michael Cimino's phone number. Savage <br /> <br /> is also a vampire and Andreef wants to join her a little vampire <br /> <br /> family, a vampire who is a British vampire <br /> <br /> > Starr's attack and the bad red thread (I do not do it <br /> <br />). <br /> <br /> The family does not want Starr, so they try to kill Savage and Starr <br /> <br /> and Star's child. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot that John Savage should forget the drama. <br /> <br /> She spends most of her time on the screen to show more faces. <br /> <br /> Hugh Grant Jolt Cola on a bender and reads all her lines <br /> <br> /> Farrelly Brothers is making a film. Andreeff tries to write the mischievous <br /> <br />, but the scriptwriter / director goes to Ruben <br /> <br /> for all the vampires, staring, eating her son's dreams. > <br /> and buy raw meat, to fight the blood's wishes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The movie is extra gory but not in a wild, "killer <br />" language mode. Here, the gross gore and never justified, has just happened. <br /> <br /> Simply, it's on the budget. Most R scores in Andreeff <br /> <br /> are aimed at the collaborators, who focus on the scenarios of conversation <br /> <br /> in the routine of dramatic habits. The budget is not <br /> <br /> vampire! Here all vampires must eat prey. <br /> <br /> A wonderful idea, you've already seen George Romero <br /> <br /> "Martin" <br /> <br /> In 77 minutes, and after Ruben's attempted <br /> <br /> arty direction (skewed frames, blurred scene), this is <br /> <br /> tiring, dull and dirty. Leave this club and take a shower <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> This is due to strong physical violence (gun violence, sex) <br />. /> violence, strong gore, ugly heels, nudity, sex <br /> <br /> references, drug consumption and adult situations. <br /> <br /> <br />
