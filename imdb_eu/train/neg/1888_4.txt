This film remembers "Irr√©versible (2002)", another radical art movement with radical and radical aspects of human nature. I did not like the movie, but I can not say that the movie is bad, it's innate. "Camping Cosmos (1996)" they also remind me. There, a low class character lives in a Belgian seaside camp. The same description of the people that live together, in the face of will, and the fight against the characters that do not match. I also thought books by French writer Emile Zola, a writer of the style of naturalism. I did not like the movie and I do not like the people there. Everyone seems plain, without any basic taste. He could ask why he lived. Apparently, all of them are part of a great farce on this planet, forced to live up to their will. Or you can say hell is in this world.
