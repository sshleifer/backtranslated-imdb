A splendid cast that is wasted on empty writing. There were ten or more young people gathered in the summer camp. Could it ever happen in millions of years? It's just fantasy and it's boring. Become a teenager again? Do they reflect their thoughts, games, good times? It might be possible to try it but, after all, the answer is: No. Is it an intrigo? Any suspense? Horror Comedy? No previous ones. Who can play as a wandering man in the way he drives. This movie liked me; I tried to like this movie, but my brain was denied.
