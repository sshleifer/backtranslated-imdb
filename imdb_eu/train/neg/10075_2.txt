I'm sorry, but Adrian Zmed of TJ Hooker could not keep that sequel. I crossed the movie half as it was a mistake of the original. Then this crazy and crazy scene of motorcycle racing (take into account the only film directed by Patricia Birch); and sadly I realized that they wanted to be serious. I got a kick in the opposite team, after losing the "wheels" due to the usual behavior of the original Grease, the second movie was to be used by motorcycles. Ashamed of Carrington's character, I would hate what would happen to them later: maybe mopeds? <br /> <br /> I have never bought a huge subject: Hunky-Australian boys - I can not - Outsider-dominated-school-erg-do-for-guy-stupid-looking biker helmet. Disney story was terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> So it seems that you can ruin the good thing, Michelle Pfeiffer's bubble gum music. The only thing I got from this movie was the idea of ​​the number of points to be given ten.
