The territory is not so original. If someone has not seen "L'ultimo bacio", nothing new. A wealthy Roman city in a boring and false life, everyone who asks everyone to think about. After half an hour it's boring, because it's easy to understand where the story ends. This is because it's easy to see the moralist Muccinus in this film, so the hardest part is also normal. It would be enough to summarize in the first 2 minutes of the movie, and the film's purpose was already said. I've seen a family since the age of 30, I do not like to see a movie that wants to show reality, but his thoughts are consistent with pushing more than normal. Muccino is really good at putting the cameras in the right place with the knights, and I'm not the only one in the movies in the initial film ever crying. Perhaps it would be good to see how the family is in reality and I do not blame something. Morante was just as frequent and unusual, but a bad movie!
