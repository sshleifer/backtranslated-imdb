Although a director, who is very successful in his professional life, is very well-known for his life, a boy with a down syndrome and escaped from a home. The two characters are very rare and seemingly less intelligent will show you the beauty of little things in life ... This argument, somehow, Amelie's pleasant atmosphere and sentimental music, I did not expect but a hideous, moralistic movie. However, there were some interesting scenes (the boys are sometimes violent), and the interpretation of both actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to watch the movie. French cinema has the ability to demonstrate something about life in general, as opposed to the stereotypical American filmmaker. But, therefore, it is much more depressing because of nonsense, the death of a boy after seeing him impossible, a charming tone, the happiness of the family of the executive, the cheap morale, the unbearable daughter, the unbearable guy. shakes from heaven like Michael Landon ... Really bad, in my low opinion.
