Why does Hollywood feel so rewarded that the need to rebuild the movies (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes), but it's much worse why Hollywood feels that wonderful beginners did not rebuild their need for horror movies. Night, The Amityville Horror) It's like being original when these remakes fail when they create the atmosphere, nature or real fears. The night of the prom night is so flat and unusual, but due to erroneous reasons. <br /> <br /> It's a bad excursion, a joke that fails to do so is a bit of an interesting and sad event. Hollywood Horror is dead. Even though The Hills Have Eyes and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre riots extracted their franchises, blood buckets and decent land. The night of prom is almost bloodless and I do not even mention a bad plot. Sealing the killers is not possible if a horror movie is more fearful ... the original. <br /> <br /> One of the most popular films of the 80s is feared by cinematic filmmakers. High school dances can be really awesome. Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) has survived a horrible tragedy, but now it's time to leave behind and celebrate the style of her promenade. <br /> <br /> When Donna arrives at the end of the night, Donna and her best friends prepare for the second big drop of high school at the dawn of the day. But Donna is ready to look at the nightmares and in a brighter future, the man who had fled forever returned to dance. A disturbed murderer is freed, and he will kill anyone who is trying to avoid him. <br /> <br /> Who can survive to see the graduation day, and what will Donna do when she is forced to face the worst? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis will collaborate with young smokin dresses, looking everywhere in beauty, when they shoulder their shoulder over their shoulders. A plot that argues to see is likely. Witch is asking me a good thing. <br /> <br /> Without many jobs, McCormick gamely tries to tense upset by waking up situations. At some point, a girl goes back to the floor lamp (a lamp) and McCormick can jump. Desperate times they are really disappointed. This cabinet is not based on the latest IKEA product catalog. <br /> <br /> The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and the Catch of a Predator, surely, is a horrible and horrifying movie to launch into the terrific obsession with glamor and social beauty. This is not a movie. <br /> <br /> My final verdict? Avoid with all costs. No one likes Prom Night, nor is it disappointed for those who enjoy hack-job remaking. Because of blood or fear. One night you will be in a hurry to forget it.
