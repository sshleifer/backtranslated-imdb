This script is incredibly incredible for a CNN or sleeping. <br /> <br /> My dad's captain, for 30 years, did not believe me when he saw the eyes of the movie. <br /> </ p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> Of course, this was not in the nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, the fire in the kitchen is a fire that is any ship, nuclear or not the most important. Drilling at the time is just a Hollywood script. After being arrested by the captain, he detained him, carried his keys and opened the gun that kept the gun. This is stored in minutes in a well-guarded room. He can not run away, it's like a prison. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that my dad had a dog on the boat, however, we can see how Hackman left the bar in the control room. That's never done. My father made a dog in the place where he washed the mess. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington make three stars that pay for this movie. All the rest of the bulls ** t. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real thriller about a sea rental: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
