When I could see it again, I would be physically ill, so that the movies are so annoying ... psychic, if you do not believe it, and believe in other remnants that promote the latter. They are calling here "Arimen Recycling". Puh-leeze. <br /> <br /> This story has been made several times for the first time with films like "Heaven Can Wait". Also, it's got a lot better done. It was bad that Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson were losing their talent. <br /> <br /> At least a cute movie and a wise language. This is the liberal quality of this film.
