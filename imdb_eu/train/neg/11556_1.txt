Oh, these Italians! Castles about gemstones with extravagant and curious women, thrown into the gothic atmosphere, and relatives who try to inherit it, can all be very interesting! If you've watched a movie of this kind, you've mostly seen them all (MST3K's "Screaming Skull" is the perfect match) and "The Night Evelyn Cove is Out of the Grave" formula. the numbers, and it's sad. The wonderful Erika Blanc is also spoiled. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
