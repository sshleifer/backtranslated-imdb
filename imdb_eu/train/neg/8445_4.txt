For me, all the works of art must be judged: Form, Function and Meaning. It seems that Guernsey is cultivating shapes - pleasant shots and sometimes interesting plays. The long wait suggests the function that it can complete with suggestions. For non-texts, the story becomes a quiz. The introvert character suggests that it is deep, but sometimes it turns out to be something. This movie is like introverted people. If you have not read the synopsis, you can not see that you have committed suicide (and why you have no answers) that changes Anna's life perspective and makes them suspicious. - Why do not you talk to me? Sebastia asks her. Anna does not answer, she's looking for some time without saying a word to her. What is the function of this shot? What does it mean? My question is like Sebastiaans: what does this movie mean? What is this movie? The answer to me: it shows us little people with a passion for a glass of water. The story of their lives is easy and boring. The motives behind the actions are not shown. The rest: covers, rooms, landscapes. Enjoyable and artistic, but without any sense to use 'instructions for use'. In my opinion, this film is made for other artists, not for the common audience.
