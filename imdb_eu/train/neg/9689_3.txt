In a sense, it's like "Oztar's Wizard", in Paris in black and white and Riviera. But he thinks about possessive love, destructiveness, and moral decadence, designer costumes, plans Riveria, expensive cars and much more interlude music and dance, in one day of his life, Vincente Minnelli. Librarian, a dark and dark plot found in opposite directions. (Was this the Talented Mister Ripley model? Is there a connection between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
