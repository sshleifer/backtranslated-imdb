Since Katsky-Csupo's tyrannous "Katsky-Csupo" is a mythic and horrible heart in the series of "Rugrats" series of cartoon and fun series, they must have no idea whatsoever. After dumbing all the characters, adding even more stupid ones, some voices (though I love Nancy Cartwright, NOT Chucky Finster!), And I do not have a sense of continuity (eg. I saw Kimi in an episode. Every day, Tommy and Chucky each had a puppy He has achieved, but in the following section, the aforementioned dogs never appear), you believe that the creators would kill the spectacle. But noooo. <br /> <br /> It's sucking everything I say about it! Although it's not as huge as Kimi episodes, everyone is even more stupid than themselves, including my grandfather (my God! It was the best character of the show, but now it's not the real goal). At the end it is not necessary to fluffy, and this and other crappy new episodes ('98 -'01) is a thing that is different for children that can interact with adults. Whoa, what a fun thing! <br /> <br /> There's no star "The Rugrats All Growed Up." Klasky-Csupo, please destroy this show before you get worse.
