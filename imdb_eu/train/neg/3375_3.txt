Hello, for everyone, if you've seen "The song of rain", you remember Gene Kelly's scene dancing in the rain. You also remember the dance number Donald O'Connor, "Make 'em Laugh." If you've seen "Royal Wedding", you'll remember Fred Astaire's dance floor. If you see "Jailhouse Rock", you will also remember the dance number of the same choreographer King himself. <br /> <br /> We are missing it here In this presentation, the numbers could be successful in dance. The closest to Chuck McGowan was "I Can Do That". Some of the most talented people on the stage are not doing a big dance show. Richard Attenborough was the culprit of the bankrupt. He pointed to the camera on stage and thought it was a good thing. Sharing people in a Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas casts him as bad as in a western one or comedy. It's good that Michael Douglas is in the movie, where we wanted to make someone cry. It does not work here. <br /> <br /> The performance was good except Michael, of course. A good movie could also be done using scenic production songs, but someone should think about the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm going to call them the first time I expect them the first time. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
