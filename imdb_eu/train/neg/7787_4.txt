Watching from an academic perspective is more interesting than this from the entertainment point of view. I am making reviews based on delight or entertainment of the movie. That's why I give 4. If it were valued as an academic film, it would get a score of 10. <br /> </ a> A very interesting way is filmed, like a sound pseudo-silent movie with sound effect and reality. The division and understanding of the division is inappropriate, and it is interesting in those aspects. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, the movie has a boring element, I do not find it entertaining to find everything. They are especially disturbing. It also has some very interesting images, and some interesting concepts, but the relationship between characters (especially among mothers and children) is quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie will either like you or not. For me, it was interesting from an academic perspective, but it was not a good watch, and I probably would not return for the second time. <br /> <br /> Looking for 4/10 for entertainment. 10/10 from an academic perspective.
