I loved the original It has been excellent and will always be. Curiously enough, I really looked at seeing again. Again, I'm a bit against it, because there is a lot among them, but that has been somehow fascinated by me. At first I really liked it. Caine is superb, as usual, and Jude Law holds him next to her. It was very clear how modernized and working. It's the last seven minutes to make it really good. The original is far removed from the fact that this is not a matter of being clear and it's just annoying. The end of the original was fantastic! So much tension was built and it was very compelling! This? It did not create a lot of tension, but in frustration, Cain decided to become a homosexual character. If they were trying too far they would be different too. And then ... BANG! The law is dead. Roll Credits. This movie is worth the show, but these last seven minutes actually dragged on. Pity ....
