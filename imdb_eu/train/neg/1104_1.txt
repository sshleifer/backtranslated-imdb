This is the worst movie I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new, but it's a cartoon, so who cares, though it's beautiful and fun? <br /> <br /> I will not go as deeply as characterization, or I'll be here all day (although it does not say that, it does not change the character at all when it's convenient for the plot), but those who wrote the script and visual direction are forbidden It would be as much access as paper. Thumbs down I would cut the buttons. <br /> <br /> "Squeeze in an object / ratio. Cut the character back closer. It looks like a wise character, and the viewer does not understand it remotely. Repeat several times with different objects / atrezzita." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Make all the rocks that are not very careful about the characters, collapsing against one another, and generally destroying the rain. They may die at any moment, but they remain afraid and afraid when they see a damaging and near-pastoral green remote. <br /> <br /> All this is just for the writer's convenience due to events, actions and long-term behavior, and the story is straight to save or think about writing. . <br /> <br /> This is the CG Plane 9 cartoon, but it does not make Ed Wood a liver factor to be fun. <br /> <br /> Make a difference: spend your cartoon on the budget Pixar movies.
