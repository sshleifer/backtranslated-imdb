I recently saw it in a VHS hanging antique tape and I remembered it. Now look, I think it's charming. <br /> <br /> The first time it was published, almost everyone admitted it as a gay teenager. To kill the house, a mother reading her book "1 Teenager In 10" is the most popular book of the time. David Warner plays a vampire hunter who plays himself, that is, of course, the case of a wardrobe. There were no gags and joke lists to ensure that no one missed it. The producers enjoyed it with fun, and they also hoped to make it clear. <br /> <br /> But I do not think a teenage mum will look at this movie today. . In some places, where there is education and culture, gay teenagers have had a terrible fear of passing through past times. But I am sure that there are many dark and wicked corners on our continent.
