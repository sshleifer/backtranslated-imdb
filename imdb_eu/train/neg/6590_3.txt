The opinions read for this movie were quite decent, so I decided to check. BAD IDEA! This is another movie about a ghost to revenge a team mate. The story is stupid, Ringu mix two fragments Prom Night, I Know a sprinkle, the last day, and add a tiny bit of White Single - now mix it completely absurd. There's nothing new about this plot, and the topicals that I'd love to love so much did not entertain again. This movie jumps from one past to the other, and I realized that everything I had was meaning was still meaningless. The characters move from sensible to psychotic with an eye gesture. When talking about the characters, they are all your favorite stereotypes, rich selfish lawyer, egocentric actor, baseball star, voyeur video, bitter girl, pretty and erotic girl, nice. , black black cat ... and I do not mind any of them. Perhaps he could do the work for a better writer; There were some decent scenes there, but in general, the movie was a mess. Also, I should mention some videos of "shooting". <br /> <br /> This movie is not an Asian horror, but it's still bad. If you want to see some creepy images in the dark, or just want some senior people to laugh or just want to shout "you are stupid!" On the screen of the movie, or you just have to be another Asian horror to the hose up manicure someone asks you how much you have watched - this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Those looking for a decent plan are looking elsewhere.
