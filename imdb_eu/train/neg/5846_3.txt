Yes, this is one of these films, so horrible, so whispering, so sad that you can not laugh. I watched comedies, good comedies, and I laughed less than my wife and I laughed around this movie. Other comments give a good idea. Characters are so unpleasant when you cheer up the mice, you ask how bad you are doing, whose primary school class was in charge, acting - oh the actress - talk about tired conversation and embarrassment. <br /> </ p> But the rat, yes, a great rat. Why did not we see the mouse was surprised at the end? Often, "big" is not shown until the end is limited, because the budget is limited and the good effect chews a lot of money. However, I believe that filmmakers concealed in this case were ashamed that it was best dressed up as a guy dressed in the third world odontology. <br /> <br /> The highest part of the movie is the elevator scene. When the rats could not hear any noise (erratic rhymes migraines?), The main dude assembled a fire alarm to ensure that rats were safe. If you ever saw a couple of rat vals doing a generous blood like a geyser, this movie is for you. You really need to rent and watch. <br /> <br /> But not more than 99 99, right?
