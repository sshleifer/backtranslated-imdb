The land was sad, the girls were sick and allegedly the Italian male lead was not heard anywhere. Someone told them that the guys were good at this movie, but it seemed that they were full of mediums. There was no recurring feature on this movie. <br /> <br /> I think this will be a cemetery for actors that will never work again, except for the Olsen twins, with the exception of fascinated people for unknown reasons. <br /> <br /> I hope Olsen's twins are the protagonists of staying away from entertainment business. They have no place.
