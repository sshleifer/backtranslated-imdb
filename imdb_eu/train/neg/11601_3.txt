The nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth-biggest issue of Elm Street's Nightmare and the worst sequence series, even worse than A Nightmare Elm Street 2. I have watched all the DVD boxes and sequel to my birthday. The dream was the worst child, I was definitely surprised because they made the last two follow-ups. But I think they've lost their charm, the story was ridiculous and I was not happy. Alice just became annoying, it's not Nancy or Kirst, so her own movie does not work for me. Freddy would also lose his fear. This was nonsense. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and has a child, she can not be happy with her life. But Freddy has returned and it is not clear since he won his fourth film. But, nevertheless, he wants his son and he is born again in the world. Have you ever wondered if Freddy has parents? Well, what is the Nightmare in Elm Street: The Dream Child is investigating and soon finds out what Freddy is about childhood, and maybe she is the only thing to defeat. <br /> <br /> Elm Street Nightmare: All The Dream Child is a bad movie and an insult to a series. I do not think anybody could be happy with this sequel. The story was just stupid, it might have been said that it might work, but it was once again wrong. I know if you'd like to watch Elm Street's Nightmare, you should see it, but I do not recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> 3/10
