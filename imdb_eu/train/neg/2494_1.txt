What a joke I'm watching 1 Channel and I think seeing dry paint is much more entertaining. What happened to Caspar Van Dien, what happened to this nightmare. Tremendous influence, a terrifying plot and a dreadful direction. It's horrible, it's fun. We think it's a suspicion, but it's a comedy. If you want to see the play, if you want to see the most entertaining and subtle scripts, check this movie. When I was Van Dien, I would not ask for 10% of my agents, but I was attacking the process. What is turkey Not suitable for MST 3K! Insomnia would be a good healing movie. Especially I love the episode that goes to Van Dien aboard, and then I'll be back in just a few minutes! Taking advantage of the Secretary's strike, I think it's only written by potential writers. What a horrible movie!
