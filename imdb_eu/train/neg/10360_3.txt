I was looking forward to seeing the ads for this movie, I recently read the book and really liked it. The movie, however, did not meet my expectations. After reading the book, they finally prepared me for great tricks, when the stories that often go back to the movies. The characters did not seem to fit in with the book. The direction was weak. I was hard to enter the characters. There was no real connection with what was happening to the viewer. The interview did not explain correctly what was happening. He suddenly whispered and rushed. In general, I was very happy with the movie. If you do not read the book, it may well be. At least, surely you could enjoy reading the book. <br /> <br />
