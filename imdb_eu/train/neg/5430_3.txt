Priyadarshan: Every time a person has heard his name, his first thought would be 'comedy'. That is why this man, or, in other words, acquaintance is known. After giving great exquisite super-productions Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, Chupke Chupke's little train came out of his train and others can not remember. Now, with great movies like Dhol, it would be the first word that would make the word "torture" torture. <br /> <br /> It mixes bad and shameless jokes with Dhol, theater, poor suspense and idiocracy. It was one or two scenes that were fun about Dhol, though it was not spiritual, and second, except for Kunal Khemu and the historical grandmother, it was a decent performance. <br /> <br /> I felt about the action, Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi (if you compare the movie with others), then Tusshar Kapoor came later, then Tanushree and finally. The above mentioned two idiots. Kunal Khemu's mistake was in his jokes and he was also in his acting. Grandmothers, first and foremost, seemed like a ghost, it was also no fun, but rather stupid. <br /> <br /> The land was the same, seen before. Four boys behind the girls and money needs, but with lies. There is a bad man, foolish and dumb murderer. And, in the end, the good ones get bad and everything is fine. It's a mere idea to have a Dhol with a full kutxa. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is the length. After about an hour, you run out and you want to leave the theater. But in addition to being a critic, I am fully responsible for tolerating two and a half hours of the film. The film continues and the jokes are repeated repeatedly, and they are different. In a different place. <br /> <br /> If your mother-in-law reaches your home and starts. You have everything mocking, then send her to this movie and have fun. 10 to 3.
