In Batman the Brave and the Bold in recent years and quite well, it is time to bring about a serious blow to Batman's life. 20 years ago, since being a great fan since Tim Burton's first revival, I have been able to accept dark or dotting in different characters. This is not compelling: too many effects, bad intrigues and so little question. Batman's greatness is the diversity of his personality's capabilities and aspects: detectives, crime fighters, playboy, philanthropists, etc. Batman only shows him in his karate days. And, in a way, what happens, does Penguin be able to jest such virtuosity in the air without considering his compassionate body? And look at Joker, Blanka's mix on Street Fighter 2 and a stereotypical reggae man, which Batman fan might be such a betrayal? I'm not there anyway. Batman is much better in front of his name without the "The" article.
