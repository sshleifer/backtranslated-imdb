Why have not I ever seen and I have never heard litter about this movie? Right in front of my alley, bloody, lava-blooded, and a 80-year-old cheese atmosphere. For some reason, no one really interests, a staff of a Catholic university elite kills an unknown psychopath. When Julie Parker was recruited by the teacher, all the people who deal with it are involved in a strange or deadly behavior. This movie is great! There is absolutely no logic, consistency, and all the characters have nonsense about others. For example, a girl dies and her body is poured into a container. Then, and without a reason, the story suddenly progresses for three weeks, but the murderer never mentions or loses. Not even his boyfriend! Playing is nice and there is no nude to enjoy. The revelation of the murderer is very funny, because those who think they thought it was an original tour ... No, boys! "Splatter University" is one of the most horrible turkeys.
