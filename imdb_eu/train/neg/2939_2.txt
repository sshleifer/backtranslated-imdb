Others claim that "No, Luciano" is a title or response to the title of this movie. For entertainment, opera singer should be a great singer ..... it's not a great actress. This movie worsens. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes were good, such as a nice family movie, but then it's not a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti, like "Giorgio Fini", loses his vocalist a lot of times and "Pamela Taylor" (Kathryn Harrold) is a rescue doctor. Then, the singer falls to the doctor, the doctor falls slowly to the singer, both argue all the time and goes on and on. Harrolda is one of the things that destroy them and, after seeing here, I am not surprised that he has not become a star. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful landscape in the film, good shots of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the film. I was bored and I do not remember about the second half of that.
