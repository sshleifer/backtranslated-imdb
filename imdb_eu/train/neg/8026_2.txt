This boss asks him how he still works in the air. A couple has stayed together, marrying and being a couple of children, but all others have broken. What is this to continue? The show may be entertaining at the beginning. Every girl is swooning more than one man, almost all like it right away. Life is like real! Girls start side by side, follow each other and show their true (or we believe). But he wants to leave that man who decides who has married and he has lived happily. <br /> <br /> What is true love? How can you fall for someone to choose? This show is unbelievable. You thought it was a bad dating online, but should people go to TV to find love? It is not realistic. How can a girl be with a man, when he comes out with others, to get along with them? One of these questions is not answered and, finally, when the show is over, you know that there will be no happy ending in the future. Everyone knows everything is written.
