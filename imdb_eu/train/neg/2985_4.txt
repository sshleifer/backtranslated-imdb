When I had the opportunity to watch Zombie 3 (Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe), importing a Japanese Region 2 dvd, it was a fun epic zombie that escaped me. The transfer is straightforward, it's always good enough, it looks like it's always good if Anchor Bay does not look at it. Gore really stands out, as it should, and you really appreciate makeup and gore fx superb. The sound is awesome too. It's a 2-channel dolby but if you have a recipient of Dolby Prologic 2, you'll be able to appreciate music (really good punctuation), and effective, even if you have a cheap sound effect. There's never been a good sound, and it's an excellent overall enjoyment of transfer. <br /> <br /> I have never noticed how much blood flows in this film, it draws its mind from the shots that have been shot down from the head, the muxo high muxo explosive, the frequency of a zombie throat, which a woman smokes. ), intestinal munching, zombie babies and much more i Lost track. <br /> <br /> Certainly this is for hardcore lovers of the area, especially for Italians. There are excellent pieces and cinematography set, people do not give enough credit. If you see a terrific print and not a terrific copy of a pirate, it's a very different experience. <br /> <br /> This movie never leaves the second level, and I realize that the language is incoherent, it's a huge duplication. The play is a tough one, and it is celebrated as an incredible joke, but that's a charm. <br /> <br /> For me, this is one of the best films of horror ever made, you can not shoot it bad, so good, well. It's your highest incident. If the genre laughed, it would be a disaster, but it was played directly as an arrow and the result is a classic worship. nose in any traditional movement standard. <br /> <br /> A ton of sequence of actions, local exotic, excellent design, good, sometimes strike movie theater, theater theater, and non-consistent plot but still interesting, make-up, beautiful effects, superb music and sometimes ridiculous , sometimes awesome, but always fun, zombies. How can you go wrong with this movie? Everything is a classic worship that emphasizes the essay of time.
