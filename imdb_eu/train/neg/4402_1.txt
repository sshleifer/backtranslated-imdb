I usually like lesbian movies, although they are not very good. I think I can! <br /> <br /> But these are just better. Yes, landscapes and buildings are beautiful, and there is no short but beautiful erotic interludio, but otherwise the movie is just a waste of time. Annamarie alternates and raises / edits alternatively any drink that she drinks, and Ella is incomprehensible through this film with this abominable behavior. We never know why it happens or why Annamarie is so depressed and retired. <br /> <br /> If you had at least a close (romantic potential? well-known!) relationship between you, there could be some kind of satisfaction. But Annamarie asks Ella for a moment, "why do you love it?" She does not even accept that. It's never clearer, that is, nothing more than a lesbian live directly from a woman who is bored. <br /> <br /> Although the interaction between both women and local people can be a flat, boring, and, above all, incomprehensible, lifestyle and informational life. <br /> <br /> It seems like a good joke in the film, although I am sure it was sorry. Women travel to two seats Ford in the middle of the horn. But when they create a camp, they have a huge tent, bedding, sleepwear, and a table, chair and writing books! In addition, when we get on a ferry, we see baggage luggage that they think, even in the small Ford trunk. <br /> <br /> And throughout the movie, we never see anywhere else that would have a place to buy a gas station or gasoline. Mostly, they travel through miles of devastated debris. So where did the fuel get? <br /> <br /> There may not be too many lesbian movies, not good or bad, but there are a lot better than others, and there are very few. Leave this on rack.
