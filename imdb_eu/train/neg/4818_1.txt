I was about a 7-year movie when DIRE MONSTROSITY was released. In the UK, it was announced on TV in the summer of 1977 in a few weeks as if it were an incredible movie blockbuster. I was the first movie I ever saw in a movie and I came for the future years. Next week I invited him to see the new movie "Star Wars" and I refused. I have never seen before, to protest Sasquatch. Seriously, at 7 I told him that I was seeing garbage. It's so bad, it's almost unbelievable. No nonsense that should ever reach film cinema. However, I had fun in these years, that the director never read again, in regard to myself. NO EVERYTHING ARE EVERYTHING !!!
