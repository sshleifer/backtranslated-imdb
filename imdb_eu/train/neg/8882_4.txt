It would be irony to call a movie about a ghost that falls beyond evil and naughty, but here, GIALIGHT (1939 and 1944) is an undeniable combination of DIABOLIQUES (1954). While still dressed in the eye, it is so commonplace that it spills instead of smiles. However, thanks to the extreme constraints found at the end of the 1970s in British cinema, this stupid script was able to attract 10 stars - Jean Simmons Cliff Robertson (husband). title), Jenny Agutter (half-sister of Robertson's artist), Simon Ward (as enigmatic author), Ron Moody (nasty doctor), Michael Jayston (as a business partner at Robertson), Judy Geeson (like Simmons'). best friend and wife of Jayston), Flora Robson (as a housewife), David Tomlinson (notary of the Simmonsen testamentary) and perhaps Jack Warner (for example, a tombstone sculptor) - most of them have no part. Sorry to say
