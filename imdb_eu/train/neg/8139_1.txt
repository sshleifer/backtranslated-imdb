Or perhaps it feels like that. However, "The One People" is almost flat, a carpet, a flat figure, like a sack of flour, and as rock as exciting ... and as smart as age. <br /> <br /> Okay, insert a nail into the plot (a well-adjusted bucket, ...): a doctor (Moss) pricks a queen and cuts his wife (McAndrew) in the cave, then transforms herself into one It's - not exactly one, but one ... that kills the victims in the first person's camera view, like a creature that looks like a man ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But then sheriff (Pataki) is a business account. sheriff: hick type. Tired of people, steals the scarves that are wearing scarf, they smoke scarfs (FIEND!), Smokes in one's mouth with one of these cigars in their mouths and speaks at the same time and Buford T. Justice looks and sounds. "Smokey and the Bandit" and (this is the worst part) ... ALL YOUR SMALL FILMS FEATURES! <br /> <br /> The whole movie, however, is a television movie. As a week, crapola (guano, in this case). AIP is shouting! What did you expect, Oscar caliber? <br /> <br /> And what else can you say about a movie that has not been saved by MST3K? <br /> <br /> How to ... without star "The Bat People", OSO version or MST3K version! <br /> <br /> By the way, if this film continues, I'm buried in my TV.
