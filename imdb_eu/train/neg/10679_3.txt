I expected the movie "In The Line of Fire" or "24" as good as I had, but this television movie was a good thing. (On) cast could not foresee the plot and the actors had to fight (I really think what they try) through the script lines. When I saw the movie, I saw all that I saw in other films (better). There, behind the cars, great shootings, love, plots ...; This movie does not have. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** As soon as a woman sees another woman talking to the Cuban character, you know what you're doing (")" you're very close to the President, I see from my perspective ... " ) It's stupid. <br /> <br /> In my opinion (and maybe it's not good), I'd like to re-write the plot: <br /> <br /> The first lady will order her murder, because her husband is sick and tired all over Kuba because he was tired.
