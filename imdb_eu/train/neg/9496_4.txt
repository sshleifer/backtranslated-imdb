A great romantic theater directed by Clint Eastwood in the golden age (William Holden, which is surprisingly pleasing to this arrangement), which grew up between a nice hippie (Kay Lenz) and a real estate agent in Los Angeles. The script is modest, but not with some thoughtful episodes; However, the scenario is now a middle-age clich√©, with most of the images coming out like a puerile. It may well work much better with different behaviors: Holden and Lenz do not fit well (it seems that their height is so small that it looks less), it causes less intense scene discomforts. Dated, blurry-romantic, and especially unmemorable. ** ****
