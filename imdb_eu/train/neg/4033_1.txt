I would like to write a malicious review, but I do not do it by encouraging people. First of all, the movie made in a small budget does not automatically make it good or even lovable. In this case, the small budget is probably the only achievement in the movie, because it has prevented a large amount of money from horseback riding on a horse horse. Have you ever seen a comedy in the theater? Have you ever heard people laugh and think "why are you nonsense"? Well, even those twats did not laugh. Things were so bad when my cats got their first bath. This is not a movie, they are children ... monkeys are not images that make you feel moving in France. You need to go, there's a clown at my door .............
