I was happy to see the movie last week after reading the book. My 13-year-old son was also eager. I rented it out and brought it to the story that brought us a great life on screen. <br /> <br /> The baby, I was disappointed. This book was far removed from the book. George C. Scott is an excellent actor, but according to this, he was only 20% of all time. The rest of the time was pretty flat. <br /> <br /> I realized this was done in 84, most of the effects made before CG. But it was a very good movie-quality movie, especially the Jacob Marley encounter. <br /> <br /> They were more disappointed when they left one of the most mobile parts of the story: When the Spirit of Christmas presents Scrooge in a whirlwind ride around the world, watching people in the most exciting situations, still having the light and love of Christianity. <br /> <br /> I confess that Mr. Scott has done well with the "reformed" end of Scrooge. That was a refreshing portrait. <br /> <br /> Bob Cratchit could be slightly rude and down. And Tiny Tim ... oh I'm not putting bad boy actors ...
