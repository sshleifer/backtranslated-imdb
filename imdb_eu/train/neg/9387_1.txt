When I first released this movie I saw it. It reminded me that I was almost fifty years old. I saw the movie I wanted to make sense of sensitivity, so I consulted a review of films published in a major metropolitan newspaper on the following day. The reviewer wrote that the film was incoherent, indescribable, and inspiring. . A small research reveals that the producer was the husband of Leslie Caron, so the aroma of nepotism suggests the beginning of this film. Lists of many feature-length actors in the movie - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame and James Sikking, among others - suggest that she has a promise. But the death of this film is due to its dramatic script. The resulting "mystery" is so dark and the film is so small that the viewer leaves the scene and invisible scene. It seems that the movie detective is a mystery and a spying of thriller, but it's never settled. Suspicion is completely lacking. The main characters are considered dry and emotional types, inspired by empathy. Cinematography is pedestrian The result is that no viewer loses characters, plots and, finally, the movie itself. I do not have any wonder there is no pathetic film available for purchase. I hope TCM finds the form of this film and if it feels compelled by the air, it will safely fall at 4:00.
