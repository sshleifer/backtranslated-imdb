With this film, Bunuel manages the viewer with all the power of the film, as the film has clearly stated that his work is "objectivity". Of course it is not. For a reason, many scenes have been shot in the 'empty choice' (obviously 'weak goat' when it falls on the abyss, you can actually see gun smoke on the right side of the screen!). On the other hand, it hides an important information: Hurdes was the way a person's reason for the film was published. This is the disease caused by goiter, iodine (salt). This guy is the cause of his creativity and Bunuel took the time to do his research (heck, if he perceived 'cretinism' in a 'goitre' medical dictionary), he might actually say. These people (still undoubtedly). Instead, with the movie, he constantly judges that he speaks as "cretins", dramatically dramatizing actions that set scenes to create the show, all of which is very unacceptable. powerful objectivity. Bunuel speaks all the time in this film without giving a word to the people he is shooting. That's why he speaks, and yet, JUDGES says. This piece is a mistake for his roots, he thinks ideology and true shame as a great movie.
