Come on Friday 13th! It is not officially worse than a movie. I won this movie in a competition at the university, and the money was useless as it was free. Jack Jones is a really awesome singer who is trying to find some killers or something. At least on Friday, XIII. The centuries never got bored. I would rather than see my nails again.
