It's remake og Thing (1982/1951), I think, there are so many factors that previous films have denied. <br /> <br /> So acting is a bad thing, James Spader makes a superlow. Stargate himself reconstructed, with his coffee mug and a strange thought / movement, but this is what I did not even realize by other actors. You do not have the feeling of getting to know one of the main characters. And know the evolution of the plot slow, boring and, of course, what will happen in 30 minutes. Scoring / music is an ultrabator, people in the movie are in motion, people who would get a coke and a credit score, but it's a great shit. Some of the special effects are nice, if it was done at the beginning of the 90s. If you like Slimy foods, colds and emotions, not this movie. Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak and Striking combination between Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay. Now, this combination would be good if someone knew what he was doing, and they knew only one production, no one. <br /> <br /> <br /> Even though I've seen worse, I would not recommend the movie. Everyone, but if you have spent a cold night, and if you want something, it will go by slowly.
