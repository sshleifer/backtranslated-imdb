Sir! (And what comes out of the doorstep), this "movie" is bad! <br /> <br /> Previously mentioned reviewers have said a lot (this piece is rated below 3 and below), I want to add a few things: <br /> <br /> they needed three of their digestive products Among the boys, an Ax was cut and the broom was raped. The old boy suffers from the worst torture, the need to listen to the culinary desk at the endless and absurd babble (but we still have compassion for the vote of silence). <br /> <br /> The director cut off the monthly and final cemetery and reverse scenes, for about 30 minutes after our suffering. Emily Haack's tits (one point) was the only thing that made the film more sustainable. . <br /> <br /> forget it. do not buy do not waste time. and your attention. After seeing this my brain so fried (Scrapbook) I see the urgent need to see (and suffer?) right now.
