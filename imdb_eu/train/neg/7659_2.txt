Alone In The Dark is a BAD movie and the worst year of the year is linked to Deuce Bigalow. I would like to say all that, but of course the IMDb sets the word count and everything. <br /> <br /> I think that the wrong type of film is the worst mistake. Reduced budget drop, Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a great budget like Gigli, Superbabies or this guff. You will see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos, as the director has no idea. The director of such films seems stupid, stupid, just because he does not care about his audiences. <br /> <br /> It's more surprising that Uwe Boll (having a wrist behind his stunning head and already) has a real garbage beneath his belt) has created something that happens once in a blue moon. An incredibly bad horror movie. Everything is wrong Cheesy CGI, bad plot, random camera random cuts and malicious soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Alone In The Dark is a horrible movie that no one should ever see. Woo hoo! Review Give me up, I'll roll in 2006 and never let him know. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie.
