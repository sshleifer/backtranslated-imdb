In this film there are some beautiful photographs that capture some landscapes with beautiful light, which is surely cinematography is the best asset. <br /> <br /> But basically it's done for television. Although it has a lot of turns and turns on the plot, although it still remains interesting, there are no subtitles and they are noteworthy in Spanish. That is why the speakers who do not speak Spanish will lose it. <br /> <br> I was in a Christmas gift, it was a family feature for filmmakers, and Matthew Mconaughey "A Time to kill" and "The Newton Boys" was so wonderful. I indicated I wanted to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> However, in the DVD box, Matthew Mconaughey is a movie that uses this as a marketing game with some lines on the screen. After finishing the movie in just a few minutes, it's basically sensational and does not turn on the screen clearly, so hard fans again. This ally is not worth it from that point of view. <br /> <br /> Out of the movies, Patrick McGaw is great, though it is very easy on the eye, and his character is just so pleasing and enjoyable and caring, the real saint. For a guy, he should write it correctly in a ROM. <br /> <br /> So I would recommend Mcconaughey's brightness activity, "Time to kill", "The Newton Boys" "Frailty", "How to Lose Guy in 10 Days", "Edtv" and "Friendship. "Avoid and" Larger Than Life "and" Angels in the Outfield "avoid children as a movie or if you do not feel around. Non-children in the environment are just a talents, but children's films are quite fun, again MM is not an assistant artist if there are only a few. <br /> <br /> Scorpion in Springit is not a bad movie, but it's not stealing on the screen as well.
