"Do not worry about seeing this movie" would be a better advice if you like Marilyn Monroe in his other roles. This was a great disappointment, not only Marilyn. <br /> <br /> The story was definitely nothing, nothing was described in the VHS box. Simply there was no rumor, little excitement and too many bad places, most of all because he was trying to show that "Nellie" (Monroe) was so bad. This was not a good job of Monroe, although I did not have to see this character to act. "Some Like It Hot" was just enough proof for me. But this role was not for him, and it's not surprising that it was not one of his most popular films. <br /> <br /> It is also a bad thing, a film that had the loss of the talents of actors like Richard Widmark. Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /> <br /> Summary: It's not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.
