One of these "Dominique" films must be invented as "slow." Endless and repetitive sequences too (how many times do we see Robertson stepping down the stairs because he listens to someone who plays the piano?). Without a doubt, there will eventually be an amortized turn, which is unfortunately a second turn that only achieves a bad taste in the mouth. It's not a very nice movie.
