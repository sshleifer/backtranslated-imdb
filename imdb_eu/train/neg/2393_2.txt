I read Tom Robbinsen EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES as a teenager. I loved every single word. Sexy, fun and glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. When I saw the movie, I could not believe what was a sharp and cheerful garbage. How did that happen? A Hollywood person read this book and read it under "GAY PRIDE - WOMEN - LESBIANS". (It's a title of the book's Congress.) Now, no one who reads the book for more than 12 years does not need a real slogan, it's a real space trip over STAR WARS. The books, of course, are written by a heterosexual male who is a lover of IDEA (naked, all the time) but has never met. <br /> <br /> Still, someone from Hollywood said: "uh oh, better, give this to a Gay Director or Gay People will cause trouble." So they handed it to Gus Van Sant. No man is against anything, but even though Gay can really be - he does not know how to make a fun movie. Gus Van Sant made a fantastic fantasy of innocent boys and made male voyeurism a bold and literal Lesbian Power Recruiting Poster. Oscar Wilde's comedy is like turning Arthur Miller into a tragedy. It's not quite. <br /> <br /> Gus Van Sant has no idea what he should do with what he should do with the source material. He hired him the best. The true text of the novel is not ignorant (a man's direct fantasy, not a pride-ridden poster) was not bad, but it was strange to make choices. <br /> <br /> Fill out the COWGIRL SUPPORT. BLUES <br /> <br /> PAT MORITA AS "CHINK", there are few known Asian actors. Pat Morita, HAPPY DAY, was quite fun. But THE CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that Chink is a very funny man. (Gus did not say.) Pat also seems to know that Chinka is not. . . well, SEXY !!! In the book, Mr. Miyagi is not wise. It's like Hugh Hefner! It is an old goat's breed and knows a lot about Sissy and Bonanza Jellybean, nice and pleasant. (You see in the book, they are not REALLY lesbian. Do you think that this is a fantasy for a live man?) <br /> <br /> JOHN HURT AS "BOARD". OK, it's friendly. But YOUNG GAZTE IS IN SHAKESPEARE! You need a happy and outgoing person for this mission. It's tragic and sad to draw as a kind of resemblance to John Hurt. Paul Scofield hoped I would walk on all Thomas More clothes, and shook her head unfortunately. "Now, Richard, you know that you have lost the soul completely. Shame, my former student!" And yes, it was just as funny as John Hurt Caligula (pretty nice). But this was a black humor, playing with humor like a book. <br /> <br /> <br /> PLEASE use PHOENIX as "Bonanza Jellybean". There is no talent, no training, no problem. Fun, playful, cheerful, (especially) heterosexual, and love in Bonanza's book. The movie is shameless, passive, expressive and sad. As for women's taste, Robbins says in the book. "God knows that I love women, but there is no place for a man who adapts." Gus? Did you read this book? <br /> <br /> UMA THURMAN "Sissy Hankshaw" mode. This is difficult. In Sissy's book, the hero is unusually passive and terrible. However, a more actor actor can shine in his eyes, or sway on his journey, in a way that is to say the hidden power or hidden delight of his enthusiasm. Uma does not come out, probably because Gus never said that Sissy would have the chance to enjoy a beautiful little body and giant body. The girl is like a television movie about a girl that kills leukemia. <br /> <br /> This film is sour and dull. And I denounce Gus Van Sant!
