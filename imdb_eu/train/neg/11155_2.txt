The only reason I saw this was because I found it in my local library (and that's why I would be puzzled by wasting public money) and although it's a lot of tits and donkeys, it was not a long time. The quick-button button was my friend. Awesome management, pedestrian cameras, poor rhythms or almost operational, whirlwind effects, and one of the greatest script. There was no longing for the sight of life (such as the extremely weak and the boy). The best laughs are the "Making of ..." featurette. This tries to think about the bad implications of this HDV as if it were working on something special just to justify their efforts. it will be forgotten next week. Wait! Undoubtedly, someone Tippi "The Birds" Hedren, except for a bit of cooperation among all the people, "Friday 13th" with Hodder! This happened, I never knew, and I really did not like it. Look at your care, and do not say that you have not warned. This is film making, its most malicious and worst appearance. A good wife has just 2 of her naked women, and much less.
