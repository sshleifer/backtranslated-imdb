Easily the most famous of all Shakespeare's plays has been abandoned here. Straight red, watches, studio performance and performance rhythms break down good tragedies. <br /> <br /> In the city of Verona, Capulets and Montagues are feuding for centuries, but Romeo (Patrick Rycart) is a tragedy. Montague, Juliet (Rebecca Saire) falls in love, a Capulet. Blood is dumped soon ... <br /> <br /> The day of work, especially in the daytime scene, strengthens the play's energy. Energy is a story to be filmed outside. At the same time, the costumes are awesome, with socks too, and playful flowers. The battle between the scenes is so huge that it is much longer and longer. <br /> <br /> Patrick Ryecart is lightweight to make Romeo really effective. He manages the character's intensity when he progresses on the plot, but his elegant eyes and accent, often unobtrusive, limits his range. It is very difficult for the audience to connect to Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too young to be a good Julieta - she captures the ingenuity of the character but a bit of sassiness would be welcome. <br /> <br /> The support roles are not much better. Joseph O'Connor's Lauren's brother is well, but they have been cut short by one of their best. Anthony Andrews' Mercutio is a scenario and not a camera. Gurns and gesticulates are too many, and they look like quite hilarious. Alan Rickman, under his leadership, is hardly in the presence of Tybalt. He later developed and intensified to give a good screen performance of the following years, but this is not evidence. The prince may have a wonderful role with his short appearances, but Actor Lawrence Naismith fails in any part of the cameraman's part. Micheal Hordern will undoubtedly be the best part of this series. His cappiece is well-behaved and happiness to be seen. <br /> <br /> See one of the other versions of this story.
