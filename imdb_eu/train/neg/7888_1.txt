He did not know anything about the movie or he was based on the best book he sold. They tried to get the first scene from one scene to another, invent the best, the buried treasure and the list of death. That lasted about 15 minutes. I thought the movies were suspicious. I will not get bored in the plot and how bad it is to play it, but it was a must for any movie maker who gave more than two stars. I jumped to the hero until I entered the corvette. In the hospital T-shirt, shirt and tie came to jeans and jeans at the hospital. Could not get track too. I got a Christian theme, it's hard to miss.
