This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I do not like critics, it's bad. I think the problem is Kundera's novel. It is not impossible; It's like 99% of the work, it's unforgiving and the removal. He seems to be in love, his characters come out like a navel, and his novels are generally misogynistic. I have read many of his works (although his socialist realistic poetry was really great). I do not understand what happens. Characteristics in his novels (like auto-absorption) make a bad reading. In a movie, all the things that I liked about Kunderry increased. I miss something, but I do not think so. In a side note, I can not believe the Criterion Collection DVD. No movie is required in any way.
