Watching the Turkish film industry's improvements is very enjoyable, but Togan Gokbakar something more creative than I expected. From Scripture, I think it was not written as a learned man. above all, the forms of dialogues, which placed viewers in this position, as if they were not intelligent in many situations, often making the film unbearable. it also has an obvious end; You can easily invent the initial killer. The weakest part of the scenario is that it is not possible for patients with severe illnesses to behave normally, immediately as a professional. Everyone was looking for a chance to go to a heavy medicine patient, to act as a professional The common medical conditions that ordinary people could not use in the field of looking for the most dangerous patient, without a film protection, were a curious point of the film. and this scene was suitable for the title "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir"! They are not only weak sections of the movie. There were also numerous pressures on the film. The depiction of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy of Hannibal, the worst mistake he could make of his first movie, Togan's appearance! The rumors about the film's greatness and the interviews by the actors forced people to be curious and visually appealing. Gen is totally disappointed. I would be surprised if Saan was not famous, would Togan film be able to shoot with that number of budgets? I hope Togan realizes that the conversation was not a director. Hitchcock made it sensible and Night Shyamalan successfully followed! We must be aware that Hitchcock and Shyamalan are not yet expecting to be careful and creative next in the big industry!
