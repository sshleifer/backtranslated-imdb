I watched this movie (especially because Brady Corbet is there), and I should say I was not happy. <br /> <br /> Of course, computer graphics were amazing, but the story needed a little line. I also think that this film would be much better with more curse and blood, and the PG-13 classification. <br /> <br /> That would attract more people to see it -> teenage. What would attract more young people (especially teenagers) would be very close to Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds wall! <br /> <br /> Even though the movie was on the bottom, I still saw it and I thought it right!
