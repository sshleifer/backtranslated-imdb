In a film directed by Sidney J. Furie and not with Dolph Lundgren, but I did not expect much, but I was surely expected more. A one-user commentary on a single line-secondary action movie-was not uncomfortable for Lechgren's film. On the other hand, I would not be able to see that this movie was less than 5.0, but the movie was 10 points out of 10, it seemed pretty enjoyable for this type of production. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that 37.5% of the people who rated this movie (brilliantly) were clearly advertising progress, I saw DENTENTION for the first time as Nu Image is a regular junk. <br /> <br /> Lundgren did not persuade the former military to become a professor of history assigned to a difficult school. Its representation is just horrible, emotionless and invented. Disability in Lundgren becomes the scene of young offenders. Whether they are big actors or, as compared to Lundgren, they seem to be great actors, because they seem natural and credible. <br /> <br /> DETENTION has some elements that may be of interest to this anticipated movie. - A senior high school high school weekend, arrested for four years with a veteran war teacher and trying to break into a nasty criminals - but does the story (something like THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets DARD HARD or PANIC ROOM?), incredible situations, multiple clicks, and stereotypical characters has it. Do not forget Dolph Lundgren's main actor. <br /> <br /> Alex Karzis and Kata Dob√≥ play Bonnie and Clyde couples in love and give the most acceptable movie screenings. Sam Rockwell quote and himself, Milla Jovovich wants the version. In a movie that completely fails, their insanity and style gave me enough fresh air to get my interest to fall to zero bottom.
