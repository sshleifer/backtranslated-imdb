I saw this movie just to see what the hype was all about, and I was surprised when I was surprised today (6)? Oscars and 7.9 Ratings scored. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Bigelow, the most successful director ever, should be the best Oscar and best director, to this very bad movie, and I wonder why? Did anyone who failed to tell me a story about the bombing "cowboy" that did not disappoint me? Why did I continue to film this film as a remake of a bad western movie about a cowboy in West Wild Wild West with Wild Cow West. But is this just another set in the background on this occasion? Oscar was the director of James Cameron, and told us about stories that are remarkable for the TV shows? Or what about the emperor's clothing syndrome: most people realized that it was a trash, but could it just be said that they did not say loudly? <br /> <br /> And what was the end of what was the sniper scene that has shown that the shell bug dropped from high-resolution super-slow-mo to 'deep message' or something as if it were transmitted? "The EOD boy suddenly makes a good sniper and terrorists will get dirty all the time"? Was it anyone else who squeezed it here without any apparent reason? And can you get Oscars for editing and editing? <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, do not miss out on your card. Wait a few years until you run on the TV. You have not lost much.
