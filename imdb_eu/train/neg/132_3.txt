"In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum, Peruvian Amazon disappeared, a year later he left the forest ... naked. He was 45 years old." I think "Keep the river on your right" is "the modern tale of the cannibal". Actually, anyone who knows cannibalism will unfortunately be disappointed. The first semester of the film is like New Ginuea's travel record, especially for the art scene. In the second part we continue to photograph the Peruvian tribe of a canada, but that's why. Except for course, you are interested in filmmaking of a Jewish wedding, or Schneerbaum's favorite lovers. I give my love. Disappointed and not really "the modern tale of the cannibal." - MERK
