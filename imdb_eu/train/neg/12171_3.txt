As well as being a cinematic filmmaker, I usually find myself watching all of the films that go through my retina, sometimes I feel more damaging than my brain. If you are browsing the channel for the night, it happened with Sleepaway Camp II to cross me. Of course, I wanted to check out, as I heard the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but I never saw anyone (I'm ashamed). Since I have not seen the original, my criticism would not be taken seriously; For I think that what is wrong is completely deliberate in the design of Francoism. <br /> <br /> Now I am assuming a Sleepaway Camp franchise is a joke about himself. Hell, the name is also like a joke deliberate. Do you sleep outside? It's really fun. I appreciate the movie because I want to get something to do with the horror value of the camp, but I'm the one I'm. Acting in this film on Friday, the work was taken on the 13th by Macbeth's performance. Campy plays badly, but continue. Pamela Springsteen's evil, shocking reality, worked harder than to kill my interest. Regarding the comedy, I did it several times, but a few were far away. <br /> <br /> Eventually, SAC II was very boring and I wanted to sleep in the camp. Death is strictly fake and false. When you are looking for a good movie comedy slasher, I recommend Club Dread. If you go through this navigation of your channel, look and see what else there is.
