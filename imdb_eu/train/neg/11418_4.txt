Joel Schumaker wrote the script and a group of Georgetown students to face adult life situations. The story line is confusing, but some scenes are really good. There are lots of lost talent and time here. The film is more spectacular than the movie. These are Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. McCarthy and Moore are the most prominent. Lowe is very hard. Age is not so flexible.
