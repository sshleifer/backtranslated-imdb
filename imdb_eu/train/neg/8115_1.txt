This movie was a great movie to watch the experience I had ever experienced, and I had to see it worse, and I did not have the chance to stop at school! Without a doubt, the storyline was decent ... but I found it to be a terrible impact! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought his performance was wonderful. It was the only highlight, without it, that I could definitely watch movies. When I hear someone I say "chorizo!" One day I was attacked by a client because they called "that". It reminds me of one of the worst half hours of my life! <br /> <br /> (She apologized if someone offered her, I only say my opinion).
