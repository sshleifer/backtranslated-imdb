I'm glad to know that someone has done a documentary about being Puerto Rican. When I heard Rosie Perez, I asked ... surely you might know what Puerto Rican really is. What I knew ... was in Nuyorican. Well, however, I was worried by my popcorn. It occurred to me in 10 minutes that my initial attachment was correct. Rosie Perez does not have to know Puerto Rican. This "Documentary" is more of a first-hand, and it is very personal that the thing is to be in Nuyorican ... and all that comes with it. I know most of Nuyoricans. It has a sensuous, partial, and sometimes twisted sense of history. (How do they ... live here?) Yes, they are proud. As they should be! But many do not know about cultural reality, history or background politics or most languages. It was completely evident as part of the Vieques party. My personal account is about this matter ... at least I know what a fight is. There is little known that he is detaining ... and he only participates because it is "Puerto Rican Cause", I do not understand how to accept it. For non-Puerto Ricans, see this as a partial account of a woman's self-discovery and admission journey. Do not take this as a gospel ... so much is not true. Please consider the source. Rosie is an actor; not historian This movie is not, and should never be, the other Nuyoricans, their information base. Instead, it's just a step towards getting more information, studying and discussing reality. It comes from the eyes of that woman.
