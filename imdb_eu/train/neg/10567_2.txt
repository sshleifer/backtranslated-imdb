This movie seemed to be a case study for not knowing how to make a movie. As a filmmaker, I will give him 2 coherence. <br /> <br /> Problems arrive from the beginning to the end of the predicted plot on the plot, although previous war stories are expected to be successful. . The graphics created by the computer were too much to see a video game in points, and the director did not try to add a realistic story to the story. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​what he should do to work, but he did not find the information. <br /> <br /> The limitations of this low-budget movie project went away. A production that drags the image to the viewer with the story. The actors were not bad, but the plot needs more innovation.
