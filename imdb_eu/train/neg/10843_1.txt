Maybe all this was done, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen in years. It would be the best DVD! I am surprised that people have taken some rubbish and have spent too much money, and I'm happy to rent it. The true fans of this film probably have to be sadistic and gothic, without taking CGI or other effects, I hope Alex Chandon's lighting and SFX lesson learned to make a better film. The future, that is, still works. <br /> <br /> Notes to buyers are very depressing, DO NOT USE IT !!!!!
