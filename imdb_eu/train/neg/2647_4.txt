I'll tell Jeanette and Nelson a thing - even if it's a shameless musical, senseless and sullen music, it's still hanging on my eyes. Yes, there is a chemistry between the famous pair, although the material is fine paper. Score is almost an editor and does not exist. And even when circumstances are so incredible - yes, it's a fantastic one. <br /> <br /> Actually, Nelson has more chemistry than his real husband with Gene Raymond than SMILIN 'AS THESE. But, nevertheless, that film was much better. <br /> <br /> Forgive Jeanette and Nelson as much as the next fan, but this is underneath. Jeanette is more embarrassing than her "hep", with Binnie Barnes - and Nelson can only look at the most exciting situations. <br /> <br /> It only asks what this is. For example, Broadway in 1938. Surely, the spirit and style of MGM was far more evident than that of the weak production. The role of Edward Everett Horton does not work and an assistant player does not reject the appearance of life in this mess. The studio is like an amateur night, even with the help of a few professionals. <br /> <br /> In summary: the evil surrender of Rodgers and Hart music. It can not be recommended for MacDonald and Eddy fans too. And although Jeanette's excellent faults are shining with her gorgeous beauty, this film is not bad.
