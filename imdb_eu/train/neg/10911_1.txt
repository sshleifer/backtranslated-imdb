I remember how much I hated this movie strongly. It's not fun too. Any movie based on sex jokes and racism humor does not make money worth the money. In the first half, Rob Schneider drank a bowl of milk. Everything they could think was "worth doing, such as making a bad movie". Do not waste your time or money for this.
