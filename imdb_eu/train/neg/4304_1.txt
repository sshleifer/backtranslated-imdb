The TV series is a anti-propaganda film. <br /> <br /> "Muslims are good, Christian Serbians of Orthodox are BAD." <br /> <br /> That's the message. <br /> <br /> Using "entertainment" is nothing new to overcome a propaganda message. <br /> <br /> This movie is thick. <br /> And, apparently, many audiences and evaluators wait. <br /> <br /> I know better. <br /> <br /> Derbys, Draza Milhalovitch, have been preserved under the general and his txetnik. In the Second World War, a German-made 500 aircraft attack. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Roosevelt continued and, after finishing the war, he was handed over to the Communist Yugoslavia Tito. <br /> <br /> And since then, the US allies Milhoovitch has been involved in the media. <br /> <br /> This film is part of the anti-Serbian propaganda campaign launched by George Soros and the International Crisis Group (ICG), when Kosovo Kosovo "War" was over, NATO bombed the NATO tombs as a result of the bombing of Serbia against NATO . The "victims" of the Serbs "Kosovo" were filled. There were not many Serbs and Albanians (Muslims) that Serbian Kosovo businesses would not print the majority of media. It's true that I chose this movie. It seemed interesting to me on the cover page. <br /> <br /> Imagine that I realized that I was mistaken for renting a branch of propaganda machine propagated in Serbia. <br /> <br /> Instead of this propaganda, someone had to make a feature-length report to the Clinton Administration's willingness, convinced of the Congress and the American people about the complicity of the Muslims in Sarajevo government regarding Iran. <br /> <br /> I am not waiting for that care.
