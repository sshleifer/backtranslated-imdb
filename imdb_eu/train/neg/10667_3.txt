Do not be fooled by Burt Reynolds, James Woods, and Anne Archer with great names. They are just the rest glorified. Their scene was probably filmed one day or another. Whatever your reason for being in this movie, if you're an actor like James Woods, it's better to use it. For me, the bad side is a sign for me. The plot was not so bad. And the performance of most actors was above the average. Cuba Gooding Jr but it was horrible. It was so unbelievable that I laughed at almost dramatic scenes. And this was not understood as a serious movie that could be good. The scenes of the actions were not bad, but they did not make any special punch more exciting. Again, it was a better direction. Likewise, stimulation has been incorrect for such a movie. The main character started almost half an hour to perform the action. Thriller action over 90 minutes is too slow. Angie Harmon is the only factor. He does his best to do all the work. The bad director left him hanging. Yes, this movie could be much better with a brilliant director. Andy Cheng is not much experience as a director. And you expect a scenario of at least one action / action coordinator for his caliber action. Do not waste this time. Avoid!
