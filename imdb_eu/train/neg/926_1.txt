This movie, Tyrannus, who brings a gladiator out of the dead, calls what he calls Tyrannus to be returned from the dead. Tyrannus, after about an hour, we learn, Demonicus is also called. This requires the depth of the script and doubts about our personality, psychology and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The Tyrannus spirit gets a small list of its own (which says some people die in repetitive phrases in Latin) with the body of a university man. He uses a magical helm-control helmet for this purpose, which the universe voluntarily thinks, then goes to certain points in the movie and goes back. <br /> <br /> Mary is doing her oral sex. She wears a poor Sean Willian Scott and a Tyrannus Rollerball glove. Tyrannus does not have his light without reason and, apparently, is sitting next to a CG fire in a similar tunnel. Unsuccessful <br /> <br /> This movie is empty and it will get you injured. See.
