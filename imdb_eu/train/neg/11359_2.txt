The 3-D animation (which stands for the show) while doing well, most other items were flat. As filmmakers thought "well, it will be 3-D, so we do not have to work hard on plot or character development." And it's no children's movie that is no excuse. People draw three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's Dad) for three-dimensional graphics. One of the main figures showed that the only dimension was a Scooter of two-dimensional shape, which occasionally drew the ground with the need to watch it. <br /> <br /> And the absolute facilitator? At the end of Buzz Aldrin's appearance (after seeing a complete version of the cartoon story of the same historical hour), the screen and the good times will ruin the protagonists of the movie by calling them "pollutants" and telling them about the situation. It really was impossible to get on the screen. <br /> <br /> ??? !!! Would you like to tell children about Easter Bunny and Santa Claus while you do not exist?
