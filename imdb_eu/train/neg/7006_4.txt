Mark Hamille had to feel embarrassed with CORVETTE SUMMER! On this occasion, he uses a new type of "force" for his dream machine to have a bright red Vette. Another half young sperm moves another half an hour and looks bad in the wrong direction. Writing and editing works are amazing, with some scenes that you can not take. However, you expect it will happen and it's sniffing the end of the 70s. It could only have stolen a new, old-fashioned company like Annie Potts, and save that bad movie! It is an attractive but beautiful personality that interests you, and this is the best option to see in a bathrobe. Annie for Hooray! Sorry, Mark! I think the Force was not there with you.
