Dreyfuss plays the mafia that lost mind, but now he's "fixed". Lane is a girl who plays a girlfriend (Goldblum), who assumes something of her, Lane's sister (Barkin). <br /> <br /> A theater assistant with anyone stopping with all the stars. Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and Richard Pryor can not help this plot, because Dreyfuss does not prove to be "fixed" and tries to kill all those who try. <br /> <br /> You know, you were not aware of what was happening. In the first ten minutes, when Dreyfuss left him, he'll save you all of Goldblum, but I will save them. <br /> <br /> I really took the reason. This movie was shot at Diane Lane lately, and I've seen all his films. For me, the real cessation was not a huge plot, but it did not appear until the last fifteen minutes of the film (although we will hear it through the film). More than half of Cast's enthusiasts can not enjoy this movie. The supposed part of the hanging was making me laugh at what really was happening. <br /> <br /> From 10 stars.
