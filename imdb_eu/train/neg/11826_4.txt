It seems something dull and ugly to see something that is something different to someone watching something. I was thinking of Jordan baseball playing, but it's the same with Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This film corrects and directs correctly, but it's a script. Martin made a great effort to adapt a classic story to a comedy "Roxanne", but this effort is impossible to put Victorian drama into the current scene. If you want to see a story updated with old stories, rent the "Great Expectations".
