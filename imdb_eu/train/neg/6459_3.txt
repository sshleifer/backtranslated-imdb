Such an actress is so disappointing. Marlon Brando plays and is a great character. The movie is not funny, you can see an unconscious message "DAMN CRAP !!!", "SEARCH BADY !!", "Extracted TV through your window," and so on. It is evil and shameful. The foolish territory, apart from humor, is something else. Decorated rooms, colors. It makes me sick, everything is very colorful, it can cause epilepsy. I usually do not like the movie about the decor, but I was annoyed with "Free Money". Avoid with all costs! "Free Money" - probably Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but the audience does nothing! It is viewed at one cost account.
