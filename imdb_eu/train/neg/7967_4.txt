I might not have been an incredible admirer of the original "Creepshow", but it looks like its sequel trashy anthology perfection! And to think that way I'd like them, I'd like them more. After five years of predecession, George Romero joins the EC Comic style and will be screened for three stories by Steve King. Even though, the direction will be given to Michael Gornick. The film has a different Gornick brush. But most of the guilty Romero's writings should be static and credible (especially in conversations that go through the first and last stories). Moral messages (mostly from bitter sorts of characters) took a black mood. Oh, it was painful, and it can be said equally with the vivid musical score of cartoons. He connects three short stories (Old Chief Woodenhead, The Raft and The Hitchhiker) together with a nostalgia (80s) story as an animation. I liked this segment, and it was a bright light character from Creep. <br /> # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # The Old Chief Woodenhead story is open to two elderly owners (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour) in a general store in a dying community (Dead River). Obtain the robbery and eventually kill a couple of murders that live in Hollywood. In front of the store there is a wooden statue of a chief of India. <br /> <br /> - Listen to the waffles of Gate Kennedy. And invited for 10 minutes about what he has committed to his "excellent" community. What a pleasant time is nice. Well, like Kennedy's lectures, this is a monotonous, colorless element that has no fixed premise. Dark script is plain and the plays are fine. These two factors add my headache. When the Indian becomes a way of life and becomes a vicarist, the goatmen fill a very fast death (even shame). The outcomes were successful, but what hair is with this free source. How could Hollywood hair on? Ugh! <br /> <br /> The second story, "Second butt", smiles like yahoo-teens who can go to a isolated lake. After swimming in the middle of the lake, they are trapped in the platform looking for water as a creature that looks great. <br /> <br /> -No, this is much better, much better. Beginning at the beginning of basic teens becomes a mysterious difficulty that is filled with tight and claustrophobic tension. And it does not copy even between nakedness and sword blinking. It's quite slow and that's also humor. The end is surprisingly ironic with a beautiful touch. Performances by people can be acceptable without making a big brand. Gornick's direction is worse and worse. Still, this time the bass guitar score is correct. The creatures like mud slurry (like many mentioned) look like a black featherweight (yes, that's what you are reading!) Floating water. <br /> <br /> # Finally, the three numbers will end with "The Hitchhiker". A wealthy but sexually-impaired woman is back after returning home after she's been a man, but it's too late. If necessary, by analyzing some ideas, if necessary, it exits the road and accidentally hit a hitchhiker. Instead of receiving support or support, her husband hopes to get home. Soon he is afraid that the deadly body of the murderer is scary. <br /> <br /> -I'm not terrifying, but I really did not get into this ridiculous and hilarious exercise. Compared to the first two, the tone was different and the fun bone tickled instead. Lois Chiles agreed that the main task was to make sure that he and his small conversation constantly became unhappy and extremely tired. Live makeup effects are well displayed and drip with vision. When he hits Hitchhiker, he is a murderer, cheesy and executed. From there, we hear repeated killer killers that we constantly kill and repeat? and repeat the line, "Thank you lady ride!" This happens every time he decides to run. Many kill you dead dear. <br /> <br /> "The Raft" is a second story and unpleasant and well-designed effects that raises a less secure sequel.
