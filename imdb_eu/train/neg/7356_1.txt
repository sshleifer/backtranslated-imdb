This flick came in, as it began, in the afternoon where I was home with a touch of flu - otherwise I would lose it. Maybe that would be the best. <br /> <br /> I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - they were very good performers and I thought it might be worth it. It has proved in some ways that it is one of those fascinating stories. <br /> <br /> Zoe McLellan does not recommend her talents, except Jayne Mansfield or Loni Anderson. on the floor Unfortunately, his ability to act - at least here - is that they are Mansfield and Anderson garbo or Davis, by comparison. It seems. <br /> <br /> The white skin of nutmeg is plain white, owner cat, to scare young youth skin. and he has kept himself in his house, and a bunch of doophus (including young walnut) in a bio-risk facility and an absurd result. At least I expected the element of the scene or graphic to be reminded at least realism, credibility or some empathy / sympathy, but it was in vain.
