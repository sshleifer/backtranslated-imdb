I like Ok, B movies ... I know what B represents. But that is horrible. I am surprised by the overall score. The only features in this edit of this Flick are (especially) dash effects. Do not get badly written, this gore is abundant in this film, but a few effects really jumped up (like a "probe" like it was great). <br /> <br /> I think this film was shot in a camera. Reason - At least renting a Betacam, I've seen porn production better production (and better acting). <br /> <br /> In the act - suck! But not as a Troma or the Full Moon. <br /> <br /> The story - invented! But it's what you get in such movies. Very loose! <br /> <br /> Sets and props - absorbed! My 16-year-old brother makes more elaborate sets for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Duplication and conversation - suck! Broadcast voice (I would not even call you) and any other word "S ** t" or "F ** k". <br /> <br /> There are tons of horror rated and classic B / splatter films that are not so hard. Please do not waste your favors in this tricky one!
