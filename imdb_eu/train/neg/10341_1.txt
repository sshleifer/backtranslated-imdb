I rented this movie from the Library (it's hard to find a good reason) without just knowing it. I am a great fan of Plath, and this movie was totally disappointed. Bell Jar (1979) has never seen one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's a great writing, because it does not move away from the original novels text, because it does not overcome the focus or intentions. Scenes are poorly built and do not bring the viewer to the spot. What is the hollow voice of Plath's poetry? Lady Lazarus has little to do with Greenwood's situation; Plath's poetry was utterly misused. Marilyn Hassett was incredibly incredible due to the partial casting of Esther Greenwood (or at any time in any 20 years), which was plotting at age 32, and was partly unable to play. Hassett is all emotion, not craft, not dexterity. Direction is half-time; The director only covers what it is, and that's not much. The only reason that I gave the movie 1 is 0. Sorry, Sylvia, someone else has to wait for something to adjust your work.
