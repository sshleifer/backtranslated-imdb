I really wanted this movie. I love Kenny coldly and spenny rice is charming. I do not like likes spenny Spenny has ruined this movie. Kenny and his hot girlfriend have to leave the movie. <br /> <br /> However, it's boring with a scene with Roger Ebert. There really are not too many celebrities in this movie, and most do not say more than one line. In general, this movie was a disappointment. I would recommend watching Kenny vs. Spenny with the 1st DVD season (free for 3 times). Regardless of this production, I am very pleased to see The Paper Chase.
