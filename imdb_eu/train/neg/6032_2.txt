I am a Christian in the theology taught in the Left Behind. That said, I think Behind Behind is one of the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> To be a good movie, you need to have a well-written script. Left behind was a wonderful time around. On the one hand, the reverse of the book is different. Sometimes it's about taking 400 pages of a two-minute movie, but I've seen some changes that make sense in this movie. <br /> <br /> Another thing, there is no character development zero. When the characters in the story are kept (I do not say), it's clear that the book is clear. The film is lightweight and artificial. The book is well-written by people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham, but it seems that they are constantly given treatment on film scenes without notice. A character that is angry at another scene (I'll never tell anyone again), seems artificial. <br /> <br /> As a Christian I realize that this movie does not like this movie. , but I can not recommend that I have made a movie in a good conscience. Maybe it would be better to make the first book in 2-3 movies. In any case, they must realize that Christians must be regarded as serious as filmmakers, we must start a movie in a quality way. I know a lot of effort probably behind Behind was behind, but I see that way.
