Bad film is very bad. <br /> <br /> Well, real real movie for the people is a good thing. It's not me Life is also predictable, bad, evil, trivial, nonsense, sometimes. Perhaps people say that this movie is genuine. <br /> <br /> Too much commonplace: you're black, you're a criminal, you're damned and damned, whatever you do when you shoot someone or you're done; Do not allow children to play with weapons, it can be dangerous; and then go to the church, then they are good, very good ... <br /> <br /> Before that, I did not see a bad movie. This is perhaps not the same as the importance of photography in the film. In this, each out-of-season scene is a bit light and distant. The color balance was not corrected. Oh! So far, "movies" have been rated over 300 films, and this (3/10) is never the least.
