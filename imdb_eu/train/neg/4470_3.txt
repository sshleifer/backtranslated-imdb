This is a comedy, but above all it's a bad taste, and it does not cause a smile to be remotely in the movies. The film is about a couple that is looking for a child and shakes the images that would be portrayed in this situation. For example, the fertility clinic scene is not very fun and, in fact, it is quite shameful. It is a bad excuse for a people wearing lead and hard hat as a construction worker. The lead woman is younger than 20 years old. Both drivers are not very attractive, they are not attractive and totally convincing. There are hilarious and absurd scenes of the movie, for example, a budget company, with no humor. 1/10/10 I represent the only reason that is the brand of Shirley Maclaine, which contains any other type of pic, and a decent music medium (although it's old).
