This movement reminded me of the Tale Counter of the Street. It has the same idea that people get to deserve it. I think this is always in a story of the Crypt. The same thing happens. Bad performance I like the movie that most people did not like and I did not expect much. Every time I see a movie by Stephen King, I do not expect much that all his films are awesome and novel genius. I read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books. I love how Carrie played a real story, and the whole book is like a bunch of reports and theories. It was so good. But I noticed that both novels were not like movies. Film versions were very different. From these two novels I assume that all his novels change greatly and the endings are always cheesy. The end of thinner is the worst. So, Cheesy. I want to read the book to find out the true end. I want to offer everyone who plans to read Stephen King's novel before I see my hand before watching movies. That way you will be happy in the book. I want to do with all the novels that make up the film. I'm sure if they went into the movies, they were good books ... and the script was very wrong.
