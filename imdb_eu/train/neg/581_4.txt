Before going, I have to accept a great fan of Bon Jovi. In fact, I've been attracted to the DVD case first. I probably bought it as a great horror hobby and enjoyed the first title called Vampires. <br /> <br /> But that's not as good as half. Jon also did not save me this movie. My main problem is simply not terrifying. In addition to the character of Jon Derek Bliss, all other characters do not even make an impression and you do not care if they die less, especially vampires, drug addicts and annoyances. Vampire woman is just scary or sexy. Rather than a 14-year-old girl, it seems unexpected, so blood is disappointed. Another big problem is that everything is "bright". There is no twist or fear. I know that the first vampire set in New Mexico was not an evening in the field of horror, but it still forced darkness and prediction. This film has no such tensions. <br /> <br /> The story is the same as before. Vampire Berzier's cross wants to be day by day. However, stories are even more curious. There is no factor in knowing the master's master, in the original vampire, as in the first film. You really do not mind what it is. There is no master army. Instead, it hides the old Disneyland attraction in an old ruin that looks later. <br /> <br /> So you really do not. Lack of scams, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting stories. Personally, the real decline for me.
