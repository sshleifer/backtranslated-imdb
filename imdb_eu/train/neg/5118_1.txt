I'm a Christian and this movie is a huge performance and a real state and a frontal view of Christianity. You may even see the "Remember the Titans," and at least the soccer culture of Kristen without mixing as a steroid formula. Let's take a few in-depth comments about what I was worried about. 1. The school was Georgia and the academy was white. I was not seen by a single black school or player. I face white academics of the "Christian" South and only build their distinction. This is disturbing when the film changes Christianity and changes the life of Christ ... changing the segregation hearts? (Note: I loved the black coach, such as the white team and all the "giant" players.) 2. The critics of all the Christians about this movie were critical. Parakeet people can be bad, bad shooting, bad writing and bad movies. If we want to compare it with another soccer movie, would it be the same charism and energy? <br /> <br /> 3. The same half-century Christianity that was shown was much less realistic than me. Christianity To read a little sanctuary and pray for the beginning of a complete life change, it is not asking when anyone else is going to hear what the Christians say. We want to sell Christ as healing. It does not have to sell it, and it does not have to attach to such bizarre lifestyles. It is not surprising that everyone considers Christianity to be anti-intellectual using this real presentation. <br /> <br /> I know this film can be inspiring for a few people. For most, it will not be. It will not give you a real picture of fights and heart tensions. The most important thing for me is not a Christian or any intermediate. He has values ​​but is short as positive thinking as a 'pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps' message. If you live with people living in the battle and / or the third world living conditions, the majority of churches will be empty in their religion today.
