In spite of the heavy storms, a short break with a drunken and organ grinder, a gypsy and a monkey, and a stay in a sanatorium, Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle's short comic Buster Keaton and Al St. John is just funny in a fun way, even if he had a pretty funny Arbuckle sequence with Buster dragging flirting with "the cute cute" scenes at the end of what we'll see at Great Stone Face, as we laugh at movies. It also seems that a lot of scenes are too short and have been released. However, if you are Arbuckle or Keaton, Good Night, Nurse! definitely worth a look.
