Oh, my God, I give this film ten stars for eight reasons. The last sequence was once again effectively handled and it was completely ridiculous. Here's what got those three points. That was not the other. It was not fun to be, it's much more obvious, but dubbing, dubious voices, they said, often ridiculous. Actions and / or non-performers are also excited and / or dropped on the screen. For example, when the whole town dies and a small group of people is standing on a balcony, it is seen as a kitchen glass, or "try" to escape from the church. <br /> Mayor of criminals: I think something happens outside, so you should climb up and look at the window. <br /> <br /> hero: well. <br /> <br /> Frequently evil: now it allows some idiots to get out, so that the fire is totally ineffective and varies. <br /> <br /> Insert this sequence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> no flesh or skin zombies, and he will take them away and I will escape! enter the sequence that happens. <br /> <br /> The hero (on the top): he is trying to escape again, he is stupid, and he has left the door open, he's stupid, it's a nice view. <br /> <br /> woman: where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There is a vision of everything there and the whole neighborhood and I are putting away, where could it be land? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, nobody put things in the screen for 10 minutes. so watch the first movie with a couple of friends, make some drinks, and be sure when you get to see it, you will be totally blind and everyone can sting. And there was no shame.
