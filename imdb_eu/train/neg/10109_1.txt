BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; The man continues to get the absolute garbage and is ironic, he loves his shit. <br /> <br /> I never saw a movie by Ulli Lommel, but I was surprised that people think that their stuff is so amazing. At the beginning, I do not add six identical ones like these, together! After reading the comments, it seemed strange to me that he was really a guy. Here's the worst thing. <br /> <br /> The credits did not end with a pathetic movie and I quickly realized that the audio was badly dubbed. The performance was very horrible and the same was the camera's shots. . The easiest edition is the worst. This movie did not make sense and I could not take it anymore, as it would end, and I only had 45 minutes for the movie. I could not take it anymore. I was losing 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> DO NOT USE THIS VAN!
