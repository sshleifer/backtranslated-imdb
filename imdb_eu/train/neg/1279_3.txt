In this movie, three stories are told, that is, if it was not known as a vignette movie. Manufacturers link three drawings to minimize Martin Kove, but you never see anyone who wears Kove. <br /> <br /> The first landscape Vivian Schilling is sexya, a woman who is afraid of a woman. The sun (Adrian Monk seems to be brave), paranoia is only at nighttime. You will literally call Vivian to do some screaming stuff. It spends most of the time in a surprising night that shows its striking features. But his worst movie is not the nail. <br /> <br /> The second language is owned by Bill Paxton, a portrait of a roommate in Hell room. She allows her to take full advantage of her room classmates, and she does so. <br /> <br /> The last landscape was fun because it frightens a man who will lead him to death at any moment. He drowned death in an olive tree. <br /> <br /> It is not very interesting, it seems that the movie is generally chopped, very thought out. Bill Paxton is a must for fans.
