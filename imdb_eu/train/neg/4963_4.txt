It was another attempt to announce the science fiction channel. I do not know who wrote the script, and he interpreted the poem, but I'm sure some 17-year-olds think it would be wonderful to have a crossbow in the film. AAAAAAAH! When I saw that part, I lost all hope. Then ... Christopher Columbus went aboard the appearance of being a ship. When they arrive at Heorotra (which is supposed to be a scandinavian boardroom), the White Squadron decided to look like a huge hector stone castle. When I saw that part ... I wanted to scream. I really wanted to be a good movie, but the science fiction film has not yet produced a good film, so I do not know why I got the hopes. Oh ... and Grendel and his mother are also stupid. (This is a comment on "Grendel") If science fiction channels read anywhere ... there are some good tips. WE DO NOT LIKE THE PROBLEM OF USING CINEMA NO INCLUDED, THE SCIENCE FICTION IS NOT OUT OF YOU! And besides CASTELDIA, YOU ARE USING YOUR CINEMA, Castels like STPHEN BALDWIN! DO NOT USE YOURSELVES OUTSIDE, YOU HELP YOU!
