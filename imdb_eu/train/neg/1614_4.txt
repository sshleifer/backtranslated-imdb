Steven Soderbergh addresses his latest campaign to export Bolivian revolution in the second half of the revolutionary biography of Che Guevara. Che Soderbergh's holy look comfortably had to go on frogs after the Cuban revolution and "massive executions" after the stupidity of his adventure in Congo ("This is a history of failure" in his Congo magazine), with the support of the Chei Bolivian government To fully concentrate on trying to concentrate. The last act of Guevar would be a disaster. <br /> <br /> In what happened in the first chapter, we continue here, because Soderberg's delaying his film, to investigate the Guevara observer's face. Bernicio Del Toro like James Dean in East Eden. The problem is that Guevara has little success in gaining, and soon finds himself and his famine reliving their friends in the heart of darkness in the Bolivian Jungle. Werner Herzog, Aguirre, the wrath of God Soderbergh fails to make the metaphorical jungle opportunities increase the despair of the warriors. He seemed to be more in charge of keeping Che Che nimbus over his head than studying the panic among the dead. A time is in Herzog, where Che is sitting next to a sharp knight and screaming, but generally Soderbergh's scene is still flat. <br /> <br /> In his two films, Soderbergh clearly shows Che group, which is why his view is still short and narrow. It takes too much time for Chek to build his monument and very little to develop relationships with his flame protagonists, especially Fidel Castro. Even worse, it makes a slow and unpleasant approach to the never-ending. It was believed that Eisenstein and Vertov thought it was enough, since deep changes were much better presented with a broad style.
