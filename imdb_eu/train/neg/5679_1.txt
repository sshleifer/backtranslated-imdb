The real footage of the original movie was so confused, I felt my stomach and finished closing the movie. The one who can give the movie mixes more than 1 score. I know the movie's intention is to impress, but it shows the true footage of a pig's pig (I'm backing the vomiting I write) - Please! I closed the scene with the baby being decomposed. I covered my eyes to that time. It is not surprising that this movie was found on the HMV packaging. I really do not want Uwe to watch other people's films. Those who like this need therapy.
