First of all, I also expected another hero: an excellent job for action genres. Hide Tiger Hide I only have Dragon parts, but I can imagine it is better than HoFD. <br /> <br /> Hero's basic elements can be found at HoFD: magnificent landscapes, brilliant cinematography and honest action. I mean, if you do not say if you can not understand a word, without subtitling, but you still take care - this is a good performance. <br /> <br /> What went wrong? It starts with political intrigue that goes into a love story. Worse, it's a television love triangle. I think you have three characters, they will fall for each other, for no good reason. This movie basically falls off after I've been jailed (I slept about forty minutes). At that time the writers almost changed. The rest of the movie is a character like "wind". Ick. You must also extend the disbelief to determine the correct actions. This is not the only one for this genre, but because the story is weak, you can not wait for the action, and then, when it's fighting, it's really not good. Starting from the beginning, but then the movie ends with gas.
