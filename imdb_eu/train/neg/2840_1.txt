Two old friends will be sent to Japan to obtain the results of a genetic research with black videos that stole the movie's early ninja films. First of all, they need to learn some ninja skills, because "the ninja can only overcome the ninja". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The whole movie is so absurd and predictable, that's why it's not hard to say: the plot itself has been seen several times before, characters are briefly drawn, the direction is sad and the script is not surprising. as well as the final stage, which reduces the film's (trash) value. <br /> <br /> Although the 80's hard-working windmill that understands the movie of a trash is a bit difficult to find this movie. . The spectator does not offer anything spectacular, simply at a visual level and not at the plot. Shurikens are considered and katanas are swinging, but it's not enough to lead the film under direction and recurred in similar battles after the first 30 minutes of hearing the most listened audience. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to recommend to anyone in the movie. Although Franco Nero's "Enter the Ninja" is a serious condition, Sakura is behind the American-style ninja assassins. No pilot at the visuals, and in a short time he is trying to find beautiful scenes in the movie: No. In all, one of the greatest ninja movies ever seen. He does not want to know any interest. Trust me around. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 10/10.
