The first ten minutes of "Just Looking" take the direction of most of this movie. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14-year-old boy in New York, in the 50s. She wants to see two people sexually. Who are the best people who are considering? Well, of course! How nice! Unfortunately, in regards to Lenny, she catches her before seeing anything and is sent to her uncle and uncle's wife to sleep in the summer. <br /> <br /> <br /> Lenny wants to see her uncle and wife sexually. However, the wife is very pregnant and now they are not sleeping together. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his friends spend time around a couple of girls around the clock. They have a small club where they sit and talk about sex. The problem is ... it's not in the innocent and charming 1950s. I have never had any reason, but it seems disturbing that these kids talk about masturbation, blows and sex. Such frosts may work in a movie like "Kids" (1995), but this movie seems perverted. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is completely lost in Hedy, an ancient mental model that becomes an object. Lenny's Inspiration. He must be far away from chairman Jason Alexander's chair. "For Better Or Worse" (1996) was horrible and now this. What waste? 1/10
