Film awesome. I live in London and the plot is so ridiculous in research. No one can terrify the London subway. Every time there is no serving at a time, the maintenance teams work there to analyze and repair the routes, etc. Even those who live there are not likely to be. Or even if it's not possible to access a mobile phone today and even if it's possible ... <br /> <br /> Finally, the worst thing that happens next to the train after it is there. they can get graffiti on them. Although this is being monitored, due to the large amount of network security cameras, it is another thorn side by side of the story. (Remember, in general, there are more security cameras than any city in London in the world). <br /> <br /> I do not know about the set in the city, maybe I do not know about it. , but it's not a high-quality movie, so I was not able to break my credibility and try to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I would give it 0/10 if that score is! Perhaps I'd never like the most popular movie I've ever thought of.
