This was a great obstacle that could be very short. <br /> <br /> The opening game was a waste of the Doom Legion, but I think that the only way to eliminate demolitions was double-DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfect had to put extra hours. Kerry von Erich, I-C Champion, has been lost here. And that was the third perfect ppv for a row where I jobbed. Remember before a game has never lost. <br /> <br /> The second match was very good, probably the best of the night. Ted DiBiase and Undertaker were excellent; While Jim Neidhart had one of his most remarkable WWFs, linking to Honky Tonk Man. Koko B. Ware continued to have a new first customary custom (remember Big Bossman and Yokozuna?). It was Bret Hart's prediction of his only career, he returned twice and almost survived the match. Both DiBias and DiBias fought at the clinic, with the point of the match with DiBiase's Dusty Rhodes. <br /> <br /> Although the members were the first team to survive all its members. and only the only four survivors from the 87th to the second), the match was not a squash. It was the longest game of the night, and Jake repeated in his 88th only against the four men and was dominant. I think I could really annoy. These days, the party will end the other party. <br /> <br /> One of the most amazing championships ever was the most amazing. Possibly the worst fighter, Tito Santana was a nightmare inspiration fighter, painted by war, and Boris Zukhov, Tanaka, and also the Lord of War in the last survival. It was so strange that he was seeing excessive attitudes, and then returned to his minimal career. Sgt. Slaughter has done well to eliminate Volkoff and Bushwhackers, but that was not surprising. He was Titus. <br /> <br /> I think the only point of survival was to win Hogan and Warrior together. <br /> <br /> This show was boring and matches too. short Undertaker's debut was really fun, but I'll remember Tito Santana.
