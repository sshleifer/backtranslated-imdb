Garson Kanin wrote and directed the "current" Las Vegas and intergenerational spheres, wrote and directed the first effort since the 1940s! David Janssen, with his son (Robert Drivas, who plays like an older Jason Bateman) is the owner of a great casino that is close to his son. Every scene in Janssen approaches in the same way: the defense with a shoulder chip. This role plays cool and setting-back Janssen asks too much, who knocks a grouchy put-on husband on hope (even Chew Don Rickles and cries out as him)! His son, in search of his personality, does not do well, comments Vegas has taken to Vegas (he has been in for ten years) and the dissatisfaction with father's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is very nice as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Willaims is as funny as a show at a show. Sadly, "Where is it" does not mean that it is more for older adults, than for today's rumors of adult etiquette and their children, that is, T & A fast shots and extravagant gemstones. Most of them have been covered so far. ** ****
