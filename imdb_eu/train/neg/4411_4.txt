Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but has no business head in a small budget movie. He really does not have much charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has much more presence on the screen, and unfortunately it is not the main character. Most of the screen time goes to the Rooker in the brick-faced facial. <br /> <br /> Danielle Harris (from Halloween 4 and 5 films) plays her daughter, and she is very funny and funny, but she does not even write her mind and she gets one of the main characters that kills her boyfriend. There are interesting roles here, including Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait and Stephen Furst. Unbeatable observation of what happens with these characters. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays Consigliare as a local mafia in Padre, and it's hard to tell when a movie is being performed comedy. Tim Thomerson is also a movie. It seems that the low-budget action movie has been in very small budgets. Thompson is also in low budget comedies. There were so many comedians and comedians in this movie. Is Yakuza a parody of a movie? It's hard to count on some points. There is no doubt that Yakuza is a little action. <br /> <br /> Thugs and Goons's powerful support is threatened and thrown out. Some of these types of films are in the comic book shop or look like piggly-wiggly boys. This movie is very different. Sometimes it seems like a comedy or a parody. Then, on other occasions, it acts like a good movie act. Then it is thrown to the end. Without contribution from Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi, this movie would rate a Zero in my low opinion.
