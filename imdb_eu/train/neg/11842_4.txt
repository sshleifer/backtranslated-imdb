Kirsten Dunst is a great actor. You can always say "acting". I like Izzard. The plot is boring. The viewer does not have the true links of the characters, who never really know who they really love or even care about. Slow and dull film, some laughs, but not very funny. The plot does not in any way double or suspend. You can see each landfall one kilometer away. What is this movie? Comedy? Drama Who is it for? You do not end at this film.
