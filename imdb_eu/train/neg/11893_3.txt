** Spoiler ** can contain <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kong Kong-like outfit (used in KINGKONG VS. GODZILLA in 1962) is a great deal in these loud monsters. . Kong is helping revive the Mondo Island and help lunkhead hero and other good guys around this time. Vampire-like criminals named Dr Who - funny, it does not look like Peter Cushing! Kong finally duels the Who's pride and joy, a giant robot that seems to be a bad metal sculpture of Magilla Gorilla. Like many Honda movies, it has had little merit before the American audience crossed it and added footage to it. The animation company Rankin / Bass had a hand in this mess. They should be stuck with high school programs.
