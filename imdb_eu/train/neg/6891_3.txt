It starts very well, it is built for the beautiful entrance and the main characters, but after about 5 minutes, charm is lost. <br /> <br /> The character is the same as American Pie and Loser. The innovative cast or support that Pie movie promotes to be a commercial success. <br /> <br /> Honestly, Heder's performance was pretty bad. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did their best, but they did not get any significant plot or screenplay from there since the film does not push any rhythm or clear logical argument. <br /> <br /> At the end it is predictable. As they come along - so I have foreseen to check the spoilers box for this line. <br /> <br /> My advice: Avoid getting up to it if you really do not really do it alone or listen or watch it, and even less, you think, the producers cheated you for half an hour of your life.
