I read the comments that you should have learned in a very strict British school in the seventies. Maybe it's true, if so, then this movie is out of date. <br /> <br /> ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************* ************* At the end of the day, all the children against the government and against the corporation make sense, it is undoubtedly a better solution for the society not to torch a Mad Max incinerator. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main characters can be left but they do not. The reasons for doing so do not make sense. It's not enough to explain why the character's development is. Shooting a series of innocent people means that it is never explained or explained. It is said that the war is the ultimate creative expression, probably the only revelation that all the characters in this movie may have, and it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Assassinated characters are not fighting. The organization is killing people. I thought about the place where all the explosives were used, or at least the sanctuary, which would have a greater symbolic meaning, but they did not. <br /> <br /> lt; - This movie is a teens teenager's nightmare, to fight against the enormous authority, even if they really need to. It has no moral, symbolic or meaningful truth; This movie plays the fantasy of "power" assassinated by teachers and people. <br /> <br /> If you make shotgun killings similar to Columbian or virginian technology, it's a rational and rational way you do not like teachers and organizations, I think you love this movie. If you're just like me and you're doing a way to live yourself, blind you (blind men) and not rebel against "man", this movie is young and boring. <br /> <br /> <br /> Also, you might say that there was a lack of money financing, and the story seemed to cause a lack of attention deficit. <br /> <br /> In short, it seemed like a sketch. Good movie, but it does not work hard in conversation, character development or morality, so ... that's wrong. <br /> <br /> ... If it were ... I could only get my two hours.
