There are beautiful landscapes. Writing oral phonebooks. With smaller players the show would be nonsense. 'Art must be lifted by humanity or BS.' There is no mention of the art of all those quoted to indicate the effect of mankind and the dark side. Those who do not even say the head hide their shadow. He was wrong, he lived in the darkness, and he drank his dark side and did not spread anything other than the landscape in a single dimension. There was not a breathing organ in his work, nor even his pain. The artist was limited to a dozen different landscapes. The characters' debates were in school, always the writers wanted things they wanted. I liked having read the first comments I liked here. I had to punch deeply to see the agreed ones. I think the big comments are related to the movie. I only moved at the end once. The boy was passive. The landscape was nice and music was ridiculous. In my opinion, I do not show anymore.
