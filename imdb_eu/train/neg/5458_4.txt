This movie is a pathetic attempt to justify the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau. To do this, they will throw a 19-year-old youngster, which is probably not "doing it". It was not possible for them to be 12 or 13 years old as a boy, because all the love scenes were amazed (even though they were allowed to do so). Mary Ann's boyfriend was the age of my nephew, becoming a pedophile. Sixth level, people. The definition of Pedophile does not have to include a large number of children. Everything you need is one. <br /> <br /> I really do not like it because of its education or its unhappy marriage. He had the responsibility of his disciples not to live well. The reason given is bipolar, avoiding diagnosis and taking medication. It is understandable, therefore, that he did not think rationally. We hope that he now understands his actions. <br /> <br /> Now, when both Vili and married, they are two children, I pray that their medication is clear and clear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
