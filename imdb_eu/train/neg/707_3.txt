"Holy Feasts?" No ... When ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The All Saints' Party's storyline and topic was published? <br /> <br /> What a wonderful name is the loss! There is never a story that has the biggest connection with the "All Saints' Festivals" story. There is also a story about "Soul All Day" that refers to the term. Why do you want to use this title if you do not want to add any story or theme about "Soul Day" or "All Saints' Feast"? <br /> <br /> Improper reflection and amateur writer <br /> <br /> How did the great talents attract this clunker? Writing is so amusing - people who know each other in life enter into large lectures on the history of their lives for the sake of the audience. There is no way people talk about each other. <br /> <br /> What did the director think? <br /> <br /> Management is wrong! He feels deliberately deliberate and a style. In a single scene, the character cries out "Get my hands on me" and nobody touches it! The targeted scene is bad, however, the initial battle of the film is very dramatic. <br /> <br /> Excessive gore very fake, Silly Battle scene <br /> <br /> Dead people are so much fake fighting scene. It seems like a sunny nighttime live atmosphere! You can view the pending streams waiting for you to watch the camera. Everyone plays the scene of his death like fourth-rate boys, every rumor and every little noise is excessive. The blood of the victims of warfare is so excessive and carelessly applied, it seems that someone has used the ketchup distributor and wears the red lines with costumes dressed up. War film. Will Ferrell and Mike Myers are waiting for you to ride a horse and deliver your penalty. <br /> <br /> Who would have real life? <br /> <br /> Writing, conducting and smarter questioning is the essence of this scene: <br /> <br /> A little girl is under her father's hanging body. He is very badly mutilated and undoubtedly drowsy his blood. Even a completely stupid died! However, he is very monotonous and repeats repeatedly the "father, father ..." looking at someone outside the screen. The child in a repeating line of the camera delivered a belief about the belief and credibility of a child who was not an actor. <br /> <br /> Even though the boy's boys could have been in theater, the scene is totally incredible. The little girl was not in the middle of the battlefield after basking in the basket - surrounded by hundreds of dead, there, quietly, there! The natural instinct could have screamed and frightened the baby, fled from bloody massacres! <br /> <br /> Would we think it was terrifying or laughing ...? <br /> <br /> <br /> Exactly what is the extravagant detail, which gives the scene SNL satiety, is it hanging out? A big hook in his mouth and cheeks. It looks like a fish in a hook! Undoubtedly, entertaining details will find the whole scene fake and bad. <br /> <br /> Fantastic La-La-Land, Mother and Daughters are the same! <br /> <br /> Another entertaining detail is what you see as the main character of the little girl's mother, at the end of the scene and in the next scene, which is 20 years later, looks exactly like that. the same! He is still young and beautiful and now he is the same age as his daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost turned the movie there, it was a great director and writing, but I tried to see Louisian settings and I liked all the actors. I do not know what bikini players thought when they accepted these roles! <br /> <br /> Who was the target audience? <br /> <br /> An overwhelming blood and a misguided violence openings scene is curious with the story telling series that they have. At the same time, there seems to be a strange way to start a movie all the time, it seems that women's reading is focused on novel novels. Unusual tone difference!
