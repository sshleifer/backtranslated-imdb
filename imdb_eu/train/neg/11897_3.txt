He demonstrates decisively the continuation of William Lustig's "Maniac", without the impressive performance of Tom Savini's and Spinell's compelling performance, that "Maniac" would never be worshiped as a success. "Vigilante" is misguided, with a simple script that tells you everything and everything is predictable at any time, and all the actors are also half-performing. The movie that gave me the meaning of "Deja vu", Lustig saw "Death Wish" before doing so many times! (* 1/2)
