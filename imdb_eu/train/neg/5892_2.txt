Clearly, Hideo Nakata's Ringu (Ring, 1998) and Hongurai expel Mizu no Soko Kara (Dark Water, 2002), which is touched by Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000), but is very silent (corpse with red eyes ?)), a weak and weak story (it's hard to find a terrifying picture message). I was afraid of these two moments when I made this film, which caused unexpected hand, and I realized that after Oodishon (another Miike Takashi, 1999) I stole a few hours and stole all the movies. Of these were really terrifying, I can not watch the movie just like sold to the western reputation of big Japanese horror films. Two out of two.
