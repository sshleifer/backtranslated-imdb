The rather depressing precedent of the first movie is not the interest of the second person. Focusing on people "running" cube removes one of the voltage inside the cube, basically we do not feel like inside. Much of the movie is boring, and it becomes really awesome with eye glossy high sorcery and green eyes. After that, however, it goes down to the darkest unexpectedly. An appropriate ending is adjusted, if it is included in the first. The script is horrible in the worst case, and with little direction. Much lower monitoring
