It was a stunning young girl and a terrifying horror movie. The horror or "thriller" movie and rumor is too much love. At that time there are only a few tensions, close to any other place in this genre's film. They were not "tense" too. Music became really dramatic. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of symbolism here, so elitist critics label "a horror movie of a person who thinks". Well, if they think, I'm sure they will do the same: money loss in the video rental store. and, in general, it is poor. It's just wrong and it's not what it's about to announce.
