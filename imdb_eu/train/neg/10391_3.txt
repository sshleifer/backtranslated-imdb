I have watched Gator Bait movies, and it's almost the same. A male degenerative group suffers from a sexual assault and systematically breaks its revenge on each of them. Apart from these films (far from being), sexual content is not glorified. There is a lot of facial nudity throughout the movie, but the second one is never sexy. Some rape scenes seemed very little, but the film only tries to reinforce the need to see the need for audiences to become a revenge. <br /> <br /> Film is weak, it's not a different way. Keeping interest in our natural desire is that this woman will take revenge on her attackers. On your Grave On Spit it's not a movie you expected to deliver a serious moral, but I was glad I saw that it had a large amount of violence caused by the female head, because it did not happen. A T & A movie. <br /> <br /> B-films stand out under the control of nudity and teenage sexuality, and I Spit On You Grave definitely has a B-movie and has more than part of nudity. Nakedness does not drive on the plot. On the other hand, the only thing that drives on the plot is rape that is empty, to revenge against a rape group. These guys have been in the same form as Gator Bait, and it seems that the main challenge for writers has come up with exciting and new ways to kill, but the movie can never be more. B-movie just gives no messages, but merely worthy to satisfy the audience's joy. <br /> <br /> The problem that leaves it is that it is necessary to sit through sexual assault. Curiously, the first half of the film is a section that includes the most bumps (but not much), but seeing it is very difficult. We can even lower the point that the woman gets revenge as long as we can see that some deaths are so elaborate, obviously impossible (at last, the empty lake at the end seems to have embraced the meaning of the lake - the boat engine and its genitals pressed against the propeller; While the woman is wearing some of the last word and the cable comes up, but this movie only fills up with revenge. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) Do you know that it's all about making the movie, when the last boy dies at the end of his death This woman has never lived happily, has not written her book, she does not leave and never returns to a nightmare, aboard and motorcycles enter the lake, while only the movies remain. But what else did you expect? <br /> <br /> Oh, and you read the phrase? If you decide to watch your time, try to break or burn the man the I really expected them to look for them?
