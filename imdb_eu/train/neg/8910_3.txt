This film has a very simple but somewhat very bad plot. The entire film is about a new dimension to a girl who has a door, and a few years later the witch opens herself again to some friends (including problems with overcoming her other boyfriend). camps, new partners ... another girl ... that is lesbian and of course there is no specific reason). Unfortunately, the devil continues the girl that has just arrived. Unfortunately, this one has never been explained. Where were they? Where did the devil come from? How did the baby survive in a place full of evil demons? Who made the training and how would he wear Gladiatore? The play is awful, but it's hard to tell, because it's so bad writing it might not do anything. I gave three that the fighter was pretty good and the effects were very entertaining, though they were very cheap. I would not recommend it, it was not quite bad to be fun.
