Yes, indeed, it could be a good movie. A triangle of love, (forgiven for poetic license, but not a triangle!) An interesting story, sadly wrong. The image is very rare sometimes, sometimes well, images are crowded and look like narrow eyes. The sound requires more attention (usually in Romanian films), sometimes light and color filters are poorly selected. The soundtrack is short and does not help. About play ... sorry but the best actor is. Others are immersed and can not convince the audience. The performance is poetic when it is realistic and when it is real when it is poetic. It's a picture for adults who indicated it. It can only be very disturbing.
