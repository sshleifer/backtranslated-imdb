This is a melodramatic, regular Bollywood movie, without becoming a favorite Western critic. The script is playful, the performance is supreme and cheesy. The only reasons to watch this TV series are the wonderful songs called Mangeshkarre and Meena Kumari's legendary curtains. Watching the actress watching the actor was dead, and after the release of the film she drank after she was 40 years old, she is fascinated to see the catastrophe. Her husband, Amrohi, wrote and directed, but did not lack the ability to perform this task well. Bollywood has featured feature films.
