It's a movie about animal cruelty. In the form of a marathon race, we represent excessive abuse of animals, as well as literally a horse in death, in SLOW MOTION. The guy who did this spirits cleans spiritually his conscience from the horse's burial, which, of course, is still dead, after being tortured. This is one of the most malicious films that I have never seen. When Gene Hackman and James Coburn come to the finish line in front of their DYING animals, we admire their spirit to end the race. The producers and the director would put them in a marathon race; When I finish it, I decide to breathe for about 20 minutes.
