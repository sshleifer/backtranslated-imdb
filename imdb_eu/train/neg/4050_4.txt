This is a relatively young obsolete movie to showcase the desire of freedom in some British dehumanizing schools. Yes, yes, as in the army, you learn to obey and obey. Yes, he dreams something else, but he breaks his dreams and violates the optimism that exists in the door of life. Great <br /> <br /> Basically, how can you do this in short? Who is the pretender that does not create cinematic challenges? The result is a declamatory movie. Do you mean it's boring? <br /> <br /> At least the old man has helped Kubrick with McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, a truly powerful social satire and nothing unrivaled sentimentalism.
