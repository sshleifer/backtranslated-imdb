"Nacho Libre" (2006) <br /> <br /> Director: Jared Hess <br /> <br /> Actor: Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Héctor Jiménez and Darius Rose <br /> <br /> MPAA rating: "PG-13" (some rough activities, including conversation, humor) <br /> <br /> Say what you want (I know some people I do not know), but I always thought "Napoleon Dynamite" The movie was fun, not the brightest brick on the wall, but the fun movie, though. Jack Black is also very funny. Adolescent adolescents worship at times, but it's fun, radio showers. I rarely had a comic book by Jack Black, I enjoyed it somehow. That's why I was very pleased with the writer and director Jared Hess, "Napoleon Dynamite", and Jack Black joining a movie about a Spanish fighter for storing an orphan. My only reservation seemed to me to be a very thin plot. Sadly, my only reservation came to fall into the whole movie. This plot, "Saturday Night Live" or perhaps even as a review on some of the shows like "Mad TV", would be perfect. Unfortunately, the plot is immersed in rough terrain and roughly half an hour and this comic joke is blurred. <br /> <br /> Nacho settled in a Mexican monastery and became a brave man of the Lord. The feeling that protects the whole monastery, Nacho (Black), now the monastery chef, has decided to pursue his dream profession to continue. As the financial monastery has been small all the time, Nacho decides to join a fight in a championship to win money and to provide a monastery orphanage. This plot is very sweet and cared for. Jack Black looks like a perfect movie. He looked at what he did with "Rock School". Well, in my affliction, this plot has almost completely ruined an offensive and gross humor that removes the heart of the film. It's a way to understand jokes and stupid moods as a spectator again in Hollywood, of course, perhaps it's a general thought for teens, it seems a lot like this to enjoy this movie. He would definitely like to see an obese woman who appears as a mouse on the ground, but do not expect him to get an award for admission to the film. A seven-year-old can do the same joke. <br /> <br /> "Nacho Libre" performances are good. Jack Black again proves that he is absolutely horny and he can ever make comic books on stupid and stupid lines. Unfortunately, this film was not enough. He did not follow anything and one of his conduct was the only reason. I did not listen or listen to Ana de la Reguera before, but I can now say that she is not only a talented but also one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen. He clicked on the roll and it worked well. Héctor Jiménez, with Esqueleto's partner, Nacho's theater theater, constantly laughed. He did a very nice job and it was very effective with Jack Black. Darius Rose, an orphan named Chancho, has not had many lines, but what I can say, I enjoyed it. It was wonderful. The rest casts their work. It is unfortunate that one of those films that are wasted are wasted. <br /> <br /> "Nacho Libre" does not work. His land is very thin. The heart of all is full of humor and pure humor. I rarely laughed and, where appropriate, he was a member of Jack Black or another. And that leads me to the "Nacho Libre": yes, cast. Throw is good because there was no better word, they were sure. They hit all of them, they had a great chemistry together, and they dropped as much life as possible in the flat screen. When Jared Hessen "Napoleon Dynamite" kept me entertained the whole movie, I was amazed that I was bored with "Nacho Libre". Something is lost here and I still do not understand what it is. I know that the movie "Nacho Libre" is not good and, nevertheless, it is not entirely equivalent to its cast. There's a small reason to see Jack Black's work. But if you are not a fan of Jack Black, avoid this movie like plague. I like black, but with this movie and with this review I have finished. <br /> <br /> Last thought: Yikes! This is the continuation of the hysterical "Napoleon Dynamite" surprisingly in Jared Hess. <br /> <br /> Overall value: 4/10 (C +)
