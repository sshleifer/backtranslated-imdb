I really invented this movie in the theater. It was really sold out. The truth is that the worst movie released in 2002 went to Solaris. <br /> <br /> Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a "tough" street pharmaceutical company, is terrifying. The baby is shot so it's going to go clean and invest everything with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things go pretty well, Jack jumps to his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). This was a very late film, so if they did not reveal it in the preview, it was perhaps interesting. But they did it, so it is not. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is only one interesting thing about this movie; everything is previewed. If you've seen a preview, you've seen the whole movie, so you can think of really hard to fill in the gaps. Go to the website, download the preview, save yourself $ 3.99. There is no single surprise, it does not become the whole movie, other than the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I hope someone is shooting at the head of the soundtrack. Twice a year. Most songs that would be released by music would be like Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan, and I can break the continuing track of space with the concept of that concept. He had less talent and less musical abilities. <br /> <br /> The performance is inadequate, the script is a crime against humanity, and the Denise Richards strobe is 67% and 32% ziploc bag. You know that bad things are John Leguizamo (The Pest!) In the division that plays the rest of the plays with the same abilities.
