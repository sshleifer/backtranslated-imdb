The producers of this nasty adaptation are trying to do something that is impossible. <br /> <br /> High-quality actors, who play well in the main (with some notable exceptions), who are very good at it. performances Penelope Keith is as good as Aunt Louise and Joanna Lumley Diana. Everyone does their scripts they do well. <br /> <br /> For good use. The average groups would be included. It is not like a house described in Nancherrow, although the house that Dower House is very similar to. It's clear that the Dower House is too big. Later, writers decided to take the whole story to the UK, surely saving money, but with little imagination I did not doubt that they could rebuild Ceylon. <br /> <br /> Now bad. Script. Adaptation is so badly so difficult to condemn the word. Edward does not die in Britain in battle, but he is alive, blinded. He looks briefly and then suicides - why? Loveday has changed a young woman, very much in love with Gus, to a sensuous farmer, love can love her love for a tear (less than a short encounters). Gus, a man in love and passionately, is ready to give up lovingly without complaining. Walter (Mudge in the book) starts with a shrewd married husband with a generous family man. Jess becomes a psychologically disturbed woman who does not speak. Aunt Biddy still has a problem with drinks, but now without justification. The Dower House occupies weapons, but with a rather short scene with the feared armies of Jess. Although Miss Mortimer's breasts were very nice, I could not see how the show was going on on the plot periodically. Nettlebed is a daily Dobson. The word limit prevents me from following the list. <br /> <br /> It's a sequel (I've lost interest in looking after this nonsense) and I'm asking myself to keep track of the story that's made. It is difficult for Rosamunde Pilcher to admit that grotesque perversion of his book; allegedly lost control when he bought the rights.
