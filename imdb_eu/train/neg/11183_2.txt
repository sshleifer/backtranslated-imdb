"I know people" is not necessary and nobody cares. Despite the efforts of a Talent Talent, <br /> <br /> Pacino offers a typical visit to Eli Wurman. the first advertising agent in the past that is perforated throughout moral life corruption. But unlike Michael Corleone, it is impossible to have an emotional investment in this nature, his dilemma or his destiny. The film explains the preparations for Eli's political motives, paying attention to a customer. (Ryan O'Neal, underwritten partly good) the latest "dirty cleansing" - in this case, the evil actors who helped the TV actor involved. Tea Leoni brings to this assistant his usual star power, although the script does not work much again. As Eli Basahua is, Kim Basinger gets sympathy even though he is not thinking about the plot mechanics. <br /> <br /> This movie is like Pacino who likes to see things and cares others. Unfortunately, I'm a strictly amateur amateur and director of "People I Know". That's why, a limited release of theater and a fast DVD trip. Let us be warned.
