What time to lose! "Sky Captain .." I tried "6 times," about 6 times, and all the time, about 3 minutes, I start doing something else ... any other thing! It's really a boring movie, the play is awful It's a sad writing, and, of course, I wanted to love the director for the first time, and I wanted to love it. I think science fiction, old fishing feeds, and Flash Gordon and Metropolis, but my God I was wasting money, I worked for Paramount Pictures, and I wrote Sherry Lansing in 1993 to use blue screens for screen tests, which told me he never said that he was having any interest or need. Sherry was right in 1993, but He had to forget when he regained this dog's blue screen shot effect, but not the whole movie. We should not forget that Jude and Jolie are not excellent actors (but easy) before their eyes) Paltrow's high school performance or the effort reminds me, very badly, can work under a good manager. Fun thing is that the Sky Captain director will continue working, even after this dreck. It's trading, not art!
