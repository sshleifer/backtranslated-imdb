This film was considered not very technological at all angles. I was standing and everyone saw it coming out of the theater, their lives fluttering their eyes flashing in their eyes - their eyes were wandering around their neighbor, asking only if they were. I mean, how could it really be a bad movie. Nobody admits, Emperor Wears is a classic case of No Clothes. "Who am I to question a movie about a guy who paralyzes a jet liner?" But it's true, everybody in the audience is thinking about writing now. I plagued my faces. <br /> <br /> Of course, only Lois is switched on by power; It also does not make a cup of coffee with Superman With Glasses, because the jet liners do not stop. He can not look in his "eyes" to his soul's depths or something like that. In older Superman, he had a close relationship with him, the number 1 was, of course, a priority, but he strengthened his character that he was "torn". I bet Henry Kissinger with Clark Kent to win Lois. <br /> <br /> Now it's official, Kryptonit makes it with Superman to have lunch at McDonald's. person <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN "ONE" The land loses its father and then finds his true father, captivates the story in every step of the way. He is a human being, he relates to people and feels love for the people, relates it to high schools, relates them to people who feel different. He says. Superman Returns relates only superman and seems to be "doing a job" when saving people. Lois likes something close to Clark, he really loves him but he can. I do not accept it, and when it enters the image taken like Superman, the love of rocks casts it into the rocks. Without Superman, Clark was in love (at least, the film indicates whether or not to plan). Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN, Clark is like a handful of pile bats, Lois. Literally <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN TWO I saw it again again. As a child, I enjoyed the "thought" I had, but now I know he was ENCOUNTER, and he also had to see me again and again. If I saw the baby Superman Return, I would also hate it. <br /> <br /> There is so much heart and soul and superpower in this movie, it's sick. Superman relinquishes love on the world, and on the other hand, Lex Luther has got something fantastic in the sleeve. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN THREE is now a story between Superman and Lana. and Clark, only mankind has won, and Clark's inner self has won the power of Superman, when SUPERmoral disappears and SuperHUMAN (as man stops his superpowers) disappears, Superman is in love. SUPERPowerman, but who loves SUPERMORTAL and really SUPER. And when Clark says that "he prefers" to Superman, he gets bored, he has made a human relationship again. Whoever wants to accept it, not only for the steel bending capacity. SUPERMAN RETURNS HAS BEEN ORIGINATING. <br /> <br /> Clark will crush crossing humanity again. In addition, the superpowers are INERESTING. It does not only use the correct force. <br /> <br /> Coal converts a diamond to his wife, because he owes his or her, love is the only thing that does not push her to use her powers. <br /> <br /> There's nothing in Superman Returns. In Superman Three, we can see the damage caused by the plots against the world of Nemesis ... we see suffering, how Pryor and others affect it. There is no harm, esp. Lex's emotional plot of sinking to the United States. We see a glass globe that spills into space. Superman had a great deal of creativity to stop the first three of the Superman plot, he could not only "access" his superpowers. In the first, he had to stop the missiles in two directions and then broke his universal command and resigned his life to save Lois's life ... (He was thirty years old!). In the second, he needed more than three more boys, but with the Lexian genius, and criminals with immoral tactics, Superman's overpowering was not enough, he had to work another and outsmart ... Superman III, again. His superpowers were not enough to win ... He had to shake more than one computer he had calculated. He could not attack it directly on the computer, because it previously calculated it, so he had to use a good acid. After the computer was attacked, the computer became lethal, and since it was found to be acid, it could be used as superconductors because its superpowers could turn off the fire. He could not take the water, so he froze the lake and suspended it on the fire. Now in Superman Returns, the island falls outside as the UPS nighttime temperature. He does not need to think about "using his super power". And he showed Lex Luther's splendor at the level of premedication of a litterless junkie. <br /> <br /> He got rid of that island in the outer field, after connecting a cryptonite to a KNIFE. In the blood and on the island he washed the spores of cryptonite on his face, but just like his eyes and nose removed, there was no Poupon Gray.
