JESSICA: IRUDIA A HISTORIA is a fantasy story. The theme is made with dread, but the comedy is closer! <br /> <br /> A killing woman will come to die among the dead. This is what this film tries to pass on as a plot. Nothing more. The movie is a series of unrelated connections with a man who had a relationship with the woman before the dead. <br /> <br /> <br /> Immediately after the beginning scenes, this movie has a "direct look". -DVD ", as well as gems like VACANCY 2, the film has no direct or creative meaning and, undoubtedly," Direct-to-DVD "is a bad name! Poverty is direct, with suspense, fear or tension. they unfortunately play theatrical elements and represent a more boring thing than perhaps the worst misfortune that you can possibly endure. <br /> <br /> The whole table is completely in-depth, not managed by a single actor involved, but also show the smallest successful hit. < br /> <br /> Many individual scenes have a great deal of time with long breaks between interview exchanges. I do not exaggerate! <br /> <br /> The only reason I give more than 2 points to this movie is that some of the most impoverished assets make a worse and unwanted conversation They made some laughs, I'm saying this phrase "little." This is not one of the films "BLACK or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE", in general, like Hysterically Laugh. If you want, watch the movies. If you want to watch a good horror movie about ghosts, see THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, EYE (original Korean version), THE GRUDGE, ONE MISSED CALL or TELEPHONE. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is fortunate enough to prevent JESSICA advice: silence that keeps you awake. Do not forget that this movie exists. Do not think about it!
