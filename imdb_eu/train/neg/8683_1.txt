This show is not clear. That's basically what boils down. The "humor of the world", trying to avoid these writers, is to strangle the entire shrubs in the world. In another comment, someone mentions some ridiculous lines. Highlight to me George H.W. Bushek is telling children, they do not suppose why they do not want to watch television through Fox News. Wow I saw that the episodes were bad. This line is a good point for the series because it's patched. <br /> <br /> My problem is that the political satire is a problem for the political satire that people get their second season. I am a liberal of the Republic and I know that President Bush has not been. We all do it. But there is no excuse for the loss of time to get this poopie out. These writers put the genius behind the "Meet the Spartans". Their formula, you can tilt the topical jokes today, and you can throw out some of the worse material to actually write credits. <br /> <br /> Once again bad. Unfunny, and it's just that, more and more unfortunate for me, it's just like this fateful, but stunning and original shows are preserved after 3 stunning seasons like Arrested Development. Please, do not look this rough, one of those bloody green hippie killer, if you do not think Bush and the dumb word is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Bush's voice is sucked. It only emits a texas scene and exhales it at the end of the sentences. South Park admits that at least one voice is not accurate. If you want a fun political satire, watch Daily Show / Colbert. Or search Robot Chicken, which is visible for funny sketches political, stop motion action figure animation EXTREMELY done well. Find George Bush as Jedi Bit on YouTube. priceless
