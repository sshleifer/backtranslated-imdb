The psychology of this movie is very strange, try and figure it out. It is often billed as an anti-RPG movie, but it's really not so easy. Here are some contradictions that are asking (and anything) trying to tell you about the games. <br /> <br /> All the characters enter the home lifestyle, parents all have their parents divorced, alcoholic, and not alive, so they can be successful except for the time that they get upset. Tom Hanks is definitely the worst thing, another school has failed and still has a still missing brother. <br /> <br /> Sometimes he says he plays behave, as they create problems in true life. And surely, when they go to see Robbie (Hanks), they are happy and well-suited, starting with their adult careers, troubleshooting, eliminating games (Daniel does not want to design the game Games anymore), and Robbie's mother He was drunk and disgusted, suddenly Happy Housewife, who looks fresh and bright and flowers. <br /> <br /> Of course, JJ suddenly (and looks quite happy) decides to commit suicide, but the reason seems to be that he is a solitaire boy who does not have a data, and not his character. He dies, just like Jack Chick's famous trait (as it happens later), it seems that it's almost the same thing that ends up playing Daniels and it's just like everyone else is. It's just the only thing that can keep the focus on play action straight into caves It looks like hell.) And it could be one of the most beautiful scenes in the whole movie, Kate, who looks like a message from the chain, looks like a camera and says something. "Awesome monsters are in our head". <br /> <br /> The fantasy element couple in this movie are two muggers who spend their lives together to steal their dirty magical beans and homeless men. The repetitive theme ("The Way We Were" in the 80s) was likely to be at the end, but a way to launch a movie is really depressing and it does not look like a place. And for the last mystery, our hero, wearing a full-fledged Regal, has a psychotic rest, his character becomes completely and begins to search, so of course 20-minute street clothes vary. <br /> <br /> So maybe the movie is not irrational, but I think it's going to face an irrational issue. At that time, the circle of children with nails and pencils was infected, and probably they became aware of it, and they might be insane if they talked to your mumbo-jumbo. The first scene of the anti-paranoid game is summarized, where the reporter asks what happens to the police, the police say that the children lost in the tunnels and the possibility of some maces and monsters. The reporter acknowledges the lack of knowledge of the game (even if his children play), then turns the camera into a black suit that is blamed on all the games and does not accept any other explanation. In the end, it's not a masterpiece, but it's interesting to watch TV movies.
