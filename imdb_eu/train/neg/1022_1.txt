Starting with the poster (Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey alone), the whole movie was a scam. One stereotype after another, the movie was nothing, or at least nothing new. After 10-15 minutes, you realize that Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J are just paying you through a video clip. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story is sometimes damaged. the city, a secretly-engaged business and everything that is protected in the country, under the watch of a hot-shot politician. The highest and highest authority is called FRAT and what? They tried to thwart the police and threw them slowly - the suspects, girlfriends, call you. The police FRAT are rotten and brave, and therefore, it is a mistake found by a young and talented journalist (!!!). One hour later, after a series of scenes filmed and stereo-typed lines unbelievable, everything goes well and the last line is served: you can not overcome the system. Yes Do not see this film waste. Freeman and Spacey are almost 10 minutes!
