Without a doubt, the worst movie I've ever seen ... Someone can tell where I should laugh. There is no suggestion for an idea. The three main actors are the plagues, especially Sicily (I think it's Aldo) who can not accentuate the Sicilians !!! I do not know Dracula's dreams insertion ... Another way out of the worst Cabaret tradition is to make this "movie" longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do everything they can, but the so-called "movie" was very difficult. I would give "0" / 10, but the smallest brand was 1/10 and that's why I had to check it with a brand.
