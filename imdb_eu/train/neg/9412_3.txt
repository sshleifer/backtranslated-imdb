This film was at the Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney in Sydney in 2007. I did not expect the movie as someone else chose for me. <br /> <br /> I really like films that take time to develop movies, spreads and drops the story. Peace is good. But this movie was slow. <br /> <br /> Credits have to be two main actors. The sense of voltage was that of two completely different people, very poorly adapted, in a very confusing way. There was a lot of sad moments and sadness when we learned more about them. <br /> <br /> I also liked the setting and shot the way they were. He was a claustrophobic and monochrome and added to the intimacy of the film and strengthens the star of the characters. <br /> <br /> I do not know the ending. What was it all?
