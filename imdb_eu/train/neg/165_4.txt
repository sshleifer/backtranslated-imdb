While initially beginning to evolve the series, I can say that the pilot was smaller than I thought. However, there is still a potential for the series. Of course, when I first saw Voyager, I thought it was a potential, but he was very disappointed. However, my fats Enterprise will not be as bad as Voyager. <br /> <br /> Pilot's images ... <br /> <br /> The ball has good ideas and good ideas. issues I liked the entry The initial credits of the exhibition were of interest, with the progress of exploration and a good song theme. Scott Bakula is a great captain. <br /> <br /> Because it was very short for me, it was a "feeling" for the story to be in a great adventure. The story of the same episode was the story of the genre of "Trek", only superficial and sub-theme about the "exploration" and "first step of space". If you want to edit references to this first deep space mission, the plot would be difficult to distinguish Enterprise, TOS or TNG times. The central area did not reflect or direct the main theme of the series. <br /> <br /> Plots for starting the first mission would be enough without "action". Instead of isolated references on the exploration's novel, this might be the story. Here's a bit more nostalgic and philosophical (oh, we thought about a TV show again). The feeling of "wind" makes us feel and being "at sea" prevents us from saving and shooting. BAND is too captive. <br /> <br /> We thought human being was a man in escort established at school. New kids on the block rather than dive into a completely unknown universe. Unfortunately, klingons came to our home, instead of finding them. This meeting could be very historical and sociological. How do they affect different societies? Do not report it, SHOW it! <br /> <br /> I had to think more about `treking with a crew and a more limited technology than 'the brave first steps of strangers. I wanted to see something newer and cooler. The series wants to have a new concept, but until now I have not seen this new concept. <br /> <br /> I will finish the feeling that confirms the capacity of the series. There are some interesting characters. Bakula is wonderful. It has a potential blalock. The general theme is interesting, first of all, as we saw before Kirk Apollo 11, if future episodes address this beautiful and fascinating theme, we will have a show that will create legends. <br /> <br /> You shoot the arrow in the air ... Good luck for Captain Archer. <br /> <br /> Producers: THANKS AND MORE USEFUL RISKS * THINK *! :-)
