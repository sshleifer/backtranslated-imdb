As Southern Baptist, it's nice for me to give me an average grade of over an average movie. Without a doubt, there are not so many filmmakers in this genre that I want to offer. However, I must honestly say that "Love Joy Constant" is a low budget, a low key, a consciously Christian self. Earths are predictable, they are mediocre to act (I'm polite), and heavy editing. It could be a little more than a television movie as an average, but like a feature, he wants a lot. Continue to try the boys. Somewhere, you must be a real movie about Christians. G. K. Chesterton or C.S. Want to get inspired by Lewis?
