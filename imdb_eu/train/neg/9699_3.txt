Many people thought about the first movie, I liked it. This however. How to shorten a single word ?: This movie (and here comes the word): CRAP! <br /> <br /> But let's see it partially: Here is the plot: it's finally the old queen. He was removed from his castle, but his heir: the white snow has a different kind of problems: The Foreclosure Court, the father of his son, has been diverted, super, Spliss goes to the extreme, selling his gray hair and selling it. Complete the hair and the hair for the royal children. In his despair, Snow White seeks help from Bubi (Otto Walkees). She has to find the first six-year-old assistant and then she tries to find royal children or at least try to find the name of Rumpelstiltskin. <br /> <br /> The whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend; In it, the writers were very drunk, but to write the press script they entered into the studio. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some good jokes. For lovers of the first party or for other actors, it is not even worth buying a DVD. Believe me. <br /> <br /> Simply keeping the film forgotten as a whole, it's the performance of some actors. That's why I gave the movement 3/10. Unfortunately, the script is so bad that one or the other actors do not get a bad story. ... they do not do anything fun here. <br /> <br /> There are still many great actors in this movie: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen ((especially funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as mirror, Helge Schneider and many more. unfortunately, all these comedians can not complete this bad book. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's nice for hardcore lovers, but it's not just ordinary movies or DVD buyers or buyers who are worth the money. <br /> < > I'm sorry to rent a movie too.
