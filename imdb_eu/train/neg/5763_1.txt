<br /> <br /> "Do not leave for Hollywood veterans?" (Wayan brothers "asked") thats what hollyweird demands and thats what he got. However, many of these recent decisions have been a huge mistake. <br /> <br /> The director is without a current audience, trying to recover pratfalls and physical gags instead of entertaining conversations. Disastrous I know, the audience knew that and CAST knew it. <br /> <br /> What a shame was, why did you ever think of the change of the directors? Wayan brothers, however, acted like four first-person figures, just like the farce and the dull. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
