This movie can not be said to be bad, unfortunately, because they are pretty hurt. If there is no real spirit or imagination, a thin plot extends to the boundary and "jokes" (foreseeable and untraceable) are extended, so long as the path is too much, because boredom and burrs exceed the viewer. Another point that marks the dreaded decline of John Waters, and we recall that 30 years ago, "shocked" or fun does not work the same way as 30 years ago. We've all seen before, and it's no longer breaking taboos, because it has long since evaporated. A great miss.
