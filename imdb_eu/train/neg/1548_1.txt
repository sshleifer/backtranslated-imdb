Lorne Michaels once again proves that there is no business that produces the film. <br /> <br /> I would think of "Superstar", "Night at the Roxbury" and "Coneheads" after the most enjoyable. At first, perhaps, he does not know what he's doing about filmmakers (and many will argue for what he's doing for television). The third time in the SNL for the third time of the welcome is avoiding long feature films. <br /> <br /> Personally I like Tim Meadows, and I think he had a wonderful movie in the right movie. . Pena is a talented character after watching a movie that is wasting a movie after a bare situation, and covers everything with a horrible scene of songs and dancing. Here he laughed because the movie is so bad, because it's not fun. <br /> <br /> Well, at least we can thank you for the fact that there are no other characters with SNL tired about this movie anymore. It's very bad to get this big screen.
