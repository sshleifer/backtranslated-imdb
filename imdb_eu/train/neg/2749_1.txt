This movie was very badly written. The characters did not have depth. They would never have made a movie. My 11-year-old son could write a better script after Hyung-rae Shim. <br /> <br /> He was the only actor to not suck the guard. It was the only fun and compelling series. <br /> <br /> I love movies and it's definitely a good idea, but this was my list on list # 2. Being Demonicus <br /> <br /> You really thought it was a good movie, you need brain surgery. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie creatures were there. Dragons ... why did they call D-war?
