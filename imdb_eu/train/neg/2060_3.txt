The repressed housewife (Angie Dickinson, the bad fight, treats us to the body with a great deal of scorn) is bored by her husband and decides to make a branch. This is a direct conclusion to a high quality prostitute (Nancy Allen, I'm clearly wrong to negotiate if she can take SHE home for 600 nights) and her psychologist (Michael Caine) murders. If you want to break Palma (sorry, give "tribute") Hitchcock, see "Sisters" instead. I am confused with "Dressed to Kill" with a technical style and skill. The earth is absurd and tired. An amazing fanciful fan of horror is a fascinating series of dangers and some marvelous graphic murderous sequels that dated the 1980s.
