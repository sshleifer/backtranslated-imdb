A movie that tries to be more intelligent than its makers. the film twists and transforms it into a "surprise" of fear, in desperate attempts to invent audiences. Offcourse's scenes that he thought would "dirty" her. This pseudo-intellectual session and just sleep. The same goes for other "actors". Plots are pretty stupid. In fact, it's not a crime, but in the end, terrific land is very dangerous and boring. <br /> <br /> However, the film creates a lot of interest in the middle. It's worth a lot of unnecessary clock on a boring day, but do not worry if you have not lost this. <br /> <br /> Just like me 4!
