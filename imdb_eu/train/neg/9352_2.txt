You can often tell that movies do not appear in the narrator's great usage. This movie appears throughout the device. Richard Jobson does not intend to write some of these films directly or even financed, adding his credits to the fragments of semi-autobiographical writing, along with some beautiful edits that make the story confusing and depressing. real art house. Kevin McKidd gives a good performance. Everyone else is fine. <br /> <br /> The budget constraints brought all of the scenes day by day, most of them at night, though they know alcoholic beverages, especially if they know how to work on the day, so it adds to me. A touch of realism. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this movie is a server that fails to age with a 20-year-old age of one day, a more extreme version of McKidd's problem. From 18 to 30 the clothes are not changed anymore. Bless.
