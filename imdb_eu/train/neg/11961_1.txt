Everyone who is less attractive in this piece should be able to look at each other. In addition to her wife, heroin addiction and a woman with a partial wife, we have explosions all over the body, due to the repetitions given by an excessive son. Now she breaks her breast milk on the kitchen floor, warns Helen Keller of her hands holding water. We have a husband who protects his wife from prostitutes just because she is her daughter (she accelerates because she has quickly come to him) and ends up killing her co-worker, making her body sex and then cutting it off. We have a baby that is disturbed by his classmates, and he comes home and plays with his mother. You see, it's circular. Deep, right? The terrible moment of this terrible journey is when the father dies his son's pain. It's good that this turkey had shot the video, because it would have lost the expensive movie. This guy who thinks this artist is interested in this slope is really serious, it's not surprising that people think he's insane. We saw this lie on the movie and then we called "Zero Woman, Accused". Oh God, something was worse. What happens in Japan these days? Patients, patients, patients.
