I was browsing through Netflix and I hit this movie. As a child, I had a good reminder of the book, I wanted to explore this. This is the movie you want to enjoy. <br /> <br /> It's just seen. It is very boring and interesting. I think it would be like that for the little children too. It does not have the magic of books. This movie is not horrible, but you will see that you are not looking after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are still curious moments. The witch's nature is not very good. It behaves like a family just like things are happening. I know this is a children's movie, so that the elderly publics do not have to look deeply, but the whole movie has been written and produced, with no experience ever. <br /> I started to skip the DVD in the final moments of the film, and when I wanted to fix it, I turned it off and I returned to Netflix. I do not like it. Skip this movie and read the book.
