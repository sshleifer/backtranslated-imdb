Losing time and money! My hubby and I saw this movie - after previewing the previews and thinking it could be "fun". WRONG! The film is about 90 minutes too long. They are trapped in a script written by actors and they can not get out. The jokes are weak and fatigued, and it is not a naked pursuit of Wilson to be able to retrieve a part of that film. Special effects ... are not. I wanted to see the wires and the wires on the weave. And the effect that people could not seem to have had a faster superhero controlling the fight or scenes, was covering everything with a fuzzy screen whirlwind - which drove the hideous effect quite well. Wilson's assistant was a man of no excuse and Wilson did not have chemists with Uma or his office staff. The sex scenes were not sexy and the funny scenes were not fun. I think I expect too much of these actors. He was not a very nice person, so I was not thinking about anyone. In homage, young children, Bedlam and G-Girl, had at least one chemistry. In general, a super stinko film - I would not recommend it as a rent too - money would be useless!
