The movies have left me with some feeling of confusion, which is not wonderful. As I saw at the theater (how I ended up, I'm not surprised) I had 90 million dollars of hateful and derivative garbage, the main impression as a bit of a movie like this other illness, "Do not answer the phone" - worse. The dizziness of all, rape and everything, is displayed without distances (like the hard elements like "The Last House Left") and the victim (perfect?) And shows the contempt of those involved, leaving the viewer to look. Sadistic voyage In the end I wanted to take a shower. No credits from the director
