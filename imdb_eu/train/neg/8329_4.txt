I question the importance of Queer Cinema, it seems to be a homosexual encounter with violent attitude, because there are some clear statements about homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> The three stories are mixed in a bad way. For the first 15 minutes I tried to paint inadequate narrative, that was not with me. The weak points were repeated repeatedly, as if it had not been the first 10 times. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was full of conversation. A longer 45-minute Boy's Brief than just a feature film. There were some erotic touches, male nudity and sexual appeals, but in general, the amount did not equal its parts. <br /> <br /> The first part: Boxer / Stalker story was the strongest and still felt. thin throw Does Bob work for four years now and now he has faced? I was sorry to conclude that their cat mouse game was not enough to be developed. We needed more information about them and we needed less parking / lock scenes, as Tim says expressly: "What do you want?" <br /> <br /> The second part: Danny wants his friend, Tony, to overcome him. Tony does not care, but does not appear to be interested in studying the implications of her erotic pastness, even after her nakedness. This story, "The correct boy with my friend friend, is having fun" is a major transition. "I think I would be gay and perhaps would like to play it because I would like to expand his head and do it with N / M style." A very important thing to leave. <br /> <br /> Clearly, these stories took half an hour their points. The third part that touches man and woman adds to this thought. Also, it was not necessary and nothing added to the movie. Yes, the actors did a great job in these situations, and the four male directors were very sexy. Make-up (blows and cuts) was matched with a talented grammar show. <br /> <br /> This story has not had any effect on the gay flesh policy. The film does not give any expression, the waste time it lacks, and it does not have enough or enough to make thoughtful investments. It's a fatal mistake for amateurism, which is basically impossible to take seriously.
