The problem of this movie has been shot in the worst camera and the movie is faded. Perhaps, anyone who was in the camera could just hold on, be seized or something. They play in this movie and too much on the movie. Well, it vomits every twenty minutes and I think that some bulimists or something they did. It was disgusting. Then, it's annoying and screaming, and it does not stop until the credits roll. Also, I do not like when all my friends were shot (or I do not know) and goes in vans and put band aid. That was really stupid when having that movie. How much gas can one person get for a siphon van? There must be a lot to do when the gas station is running out of the rest of the film. It was a great movie and I would highly recommend that you never see it all your life.
