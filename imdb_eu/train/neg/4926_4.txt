I saw this movie for 2 reasons - I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men forced them to make a stupid movie. Drácula liked the idea that Judas Iscariot was a rebirth, because he explained to all Christians that he was contemptuous, but not so much as this idea of ​​so many camps was. This movie, with talented Gerard Butler, I see how I pay for her rights, to truly acknowledge her and to remind her a way to mythical Christopher Plummer (I still see another five people and another). DVD features I had more than just the same movie.
