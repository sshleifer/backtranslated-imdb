This film is about non-establishment type (aesthetically and sexually), which is one of the basic non-romantic needs. In spite of the great players, Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant and Cynthia Nixon, through a puerile screenplay, are practically conversant; that's not it. The role of Nixon has the best lines, but often goes home too much over them, a saddled error on the director's time. Klimax grotesque is used by any available clich√©, whether worn or not, and ends with this strange comedy essay.
