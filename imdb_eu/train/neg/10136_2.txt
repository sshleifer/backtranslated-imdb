Nobody can like the movie for the merit, but if you enjoy humor and schloat for MST3 quality, this is for you. It is based on "Road House", due to its absurd character. The bad writing really threatened me instead of "I want to get people out of the way." F-14 carries the carrier, but when they enter the F-16! Without signs of anger or skepticism, Segal went back to work a few minutes before, He hid the Seagal's "head cleanse," and Segal removes bullets and kills the knives to kill them, so naturally, the guardians throw their guns and fight them with knives, it's just a handful of grenades, but it explodes. Without any aircraft, Segal will return to California - a long way, in a European way - even 20 minutes away from the Alava Naval Airport, the CIC of the Carrier has 3 black computers, two screens with four TVs and wallpapers and maps of the images. !
