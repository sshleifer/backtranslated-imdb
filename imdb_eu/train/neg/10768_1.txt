This movie is like Canadian and British. Men are stroked / drunk, and then they scream almost everywhere in the scene. Is the story of women unnecessary? I do not understand what they are Each scene goes through, or even worse, they are like cattle. Apparently, Canadian women are seriously deceived or hippie hulk chicks. Maid is a standard, with her lover and her evil mother, we have seen humor before several films. <br /> <br /> Here each character is a kinky stereotype. All of them need a shower without mentioning the look! And with George Wendt's idea of ​​any sex-related scene? shudder ?? It's enough for anyone to make a gag! Did I watch the movie that Samuel West was there? But I can not understand why it would take such a role. Maybe he needed money. Ian Tracey is an excellent actor; That is to say, with only one moment without redaction, but its talent is wasted. <br /> <br /> Like the rest of the plot? three imbeciles trying to get their drugs back? note - or Karl ?? Who is the dead man, but who is really a person who is really alive (Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Rebecca, although I am ashamed to think of comparing these two films), why worry? Karl is so wonderful that you find a wonderful state of death. <br /> <br /> At the end of this nasty movie, I thought that all would be better off with him!
