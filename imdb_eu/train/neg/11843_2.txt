Only one event does not mean that there will be a good script / movie. According to Peter Bogdanovich's Cat's Meow, William Randolph Hurst was based on real events in a cruised cruise. The writer has paid more attention to creating extravagant characters than creating a story to create a bizarre character. It does not seem to be an important moment in the story; For example, when Hurst shoots the producer unexpectedly, he thinks it was Chaplin. Based on the essential element of a story, the wrong hat that someone plays is sad. The story tries to be a dark comedy, but The Cat's Meow will lose an important part of this equation. No empathy exists for the characters. It does not matter who to shoot, who killed, guilty and who is innocent. There are no strong characters to animate. As a result, they are difficult to handle conflicts, and final results are outstanding.
