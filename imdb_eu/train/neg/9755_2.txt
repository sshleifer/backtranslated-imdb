This Naschy 1974 solution is directed by Leon Klimovsky, and it would be a look at publications and short photographs of ships that you think is that this medieval breakthrough between "Inquisition" and "Sadomania". Unfortunately not <br /> <br /> This is a raw reason, a tortured, sequential, nakedness and the agony of a PG. Naschy (I'm a fan of myself) Gilles de Lancre, "Marigu de la Naci√≥n Antigua", has its own stuff. Unfortunately, the pantomime is evil than any other thing. We get this feeling with this film (what we have seen before). Strictly so Naschy completest alone.
