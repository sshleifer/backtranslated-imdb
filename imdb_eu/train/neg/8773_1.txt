If you have seen fewer movies, it may be a big deal for you. If you've watched a lot of movies, it's a joke. Real heroes are very badly depicted. There are a lot of flashbacks, and more importantly, the battle scenes are stupidly interpreted. New characters, a good direction, they should do a better job, but since there are all bollywood heroes / heroes, you can predict what will happen next. You are not sad when something happens, the emotions that are protesting are terrifying, especially since we saw the actor in other 1000 Hindi films. It supposes a realistic movie, but it is not shown. Sometimes you ask: soldiers have a thousand weapons that move and bombard Pakistan and do not cause their bombs. Are the packages really bad at the target or the managers seem stupid? It was very good to play a few characters, but in the plot, in terms of action, it is wrong. This movie could be short for songs, if they flashback.
