It's a kind of movie that I fear most. Arrogant and negligent, he presents the draft of the Colombian conflict, which gives rise to an insult to all the people of Colombia that are so cliched and dumb. The performances are godawul, Grisales (his bare scene is utterly pitiful), to Bejarano, Fanny Mickey (who looks like Tim Burton's nightmare out), Díaz, who carries a life of a character, so makes a remarkable effort-Dimensional, so hidden so badly written is a mustache. The old end, so brave, at the end, would Ed Wood bend. In all ways, cinematography, art direction, clothing, make-up, editing and, above all, management, has always been the director of film, Jorge Alí Triana, but at least the previous film was dignified. I can not say anything about money, Colombian filmmakers plan to learn a lesson about integrity, integrity, and responsibility, especially from the fiasco's average fiasco.
