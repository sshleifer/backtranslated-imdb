I'm not a fan of Freddy Krueger, but this does not mean that Robert Englund and other nightmares do not like me in Elm Street movies. I think Robert is a good actress. No one else plays Freddy Krueger better. But, no fault of Robert, he sucks the movie. The play is awful, the argument is very weak, and Freddy Krueger is still the only part of the cast that is still visible. Friday 13. franchise (I thought the new version was the best in the series.) But this is not one of these films. The original was good, in my opinion the second one was better, 3rd is well but I'm not all seen. Do it, do not do it when I see the same error I did.
