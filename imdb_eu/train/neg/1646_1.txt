I like films about morally damaged characters, but it was too much. The performance was not great, but that was not a real problem. It was a feeling I put into the 20 minute movie of my stomach hole. These characters were empty. They did not have a deep approximation, and offered to the cruelty they showed each other as friendship. The analysis of the darker sides of a group of characters can be wonderful, but these characters must be personal or they are only cardboard cuts. These characters were cartoons and the image they gave was just ugly.
