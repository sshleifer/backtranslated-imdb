I think I've seen worse movies, so I'll give it 3, but it might be a fight for what you might think! Maybe Xtro (bad and dull) or possibly Fraud (just dull), but it's hard to think worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's say a poor Under Siege, who plays the poorest man, Jean Claude Van Damme. The only way to see Casper Van Dien was, afterwards, what happened to Starship Troopers. Yes, it was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know. <br /> <br /> From this site, it has entered the TV hell ... Casper, be sorry ... please! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I just turned around and there is a decent half-film called Criminal Law ...... now I'm angry, the last 1.5hrs !!! !!!
