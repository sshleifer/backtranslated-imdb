... This mini does not improve with age. I saw this and originally sent the battle, and they liked it a lot. At the beginning of 2002 I took WOW and W and R novels and I was even more surprised. Then I decided to see both again and invest $ 200 plus in DVD sets. I've both seen the minis in painful details and I realized that things went back - I'd have to buy novels and borrow DVDs. <br /> <br /> Do not think it's abysmally a miscast? Read the novels and see yourself. Is not this dated? Look at the reaction that has not been transmitted and the age you have not seen (the reaction of these warnings has a horrible look at your abdominal laughter). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, this little miniature piece by bit - Dan Curtis chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Yikes !! The quality of production, music score, the excellent story of conversation, at the end of the 70's, became an opera by a superb producer / director. The date was dated on the date it was completed. <br /> <br /> These two minis were beautiful in the original issue, and then we all saw that they were great, a nostalgic cord that reminds us of the young days. IMO - This mini does not play almost reputation with its reputation and it makes it worse.
