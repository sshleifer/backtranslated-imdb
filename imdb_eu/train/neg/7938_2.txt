A family that includes old-fashioned attractions in the father's coffee table, will find a strange old-fashioned show. When the van of the family vanishes from one side, they were forced to cancel a jail prison before a prison rupture. <br /> <br /> Various films have been the underground horror 'freak', Tod Browning's beloved 'Freaks' (1932), from the hilarious 'Freaked' of Alex Winter (1993). Both are classics (or with Freaked soon). 'Side Sho', however, will never be. And if he ever gets a classic situation. . . Well, the sad situation of our genre will be revealed. When the film's 17-year-old daughter is older than her mother-in-law, this film has not advanced much. It was a great handwriting, but not entirely horrible. . . boring. Management was inadequate, and the strange effects were strange and unbelievable. The play was abysmal and casting was even worse. Anyone who does not believe in the ages of the ages of these ages will not be able to meet a teenager for a long time. It was not enough to meet any gore and violence against any other quality. . . And when there was a bit of violence, it was not well done. And, I can not forget the ending battle scenario, honestly, the worst ever I have ever seen, the movie I've ever seen. In general, the horror movie is easily forgotten and misunderstood, only at the bottom of the dollar bundle. <br /> <br /> Last ruling: 2.5 / 10.
