This lifestyle style movie takes victims of divorced middle age, and then the genre goes back into the nonsense of cartoons. <br /> <br /> Here, it's the star of 40 leading adventure magicians. (daughter away from college) begins a new life after her divorce, as a university woman's friend opens up a new dress shop as a frank expansion franchise deal. Although friendship has created his architect / landscape gardener (maybe black). But afterwards, the horrors of the horrors of medieval women, to leave a room that took another 20 women as tenants, begins to "take" their lives. <br /> <br /> What a younger woman this threat really makes the gardener lightweight and offered him a glass of drink * that he ate * a terrible divorce! He cooks the available bills by turning the thermostat down! bad in the fridge! And hangs on the living room (African) in the living room ... And so, maybe the cat has also died. Yes, this is a bad thing. But it is ridiculous, especially as it becomes a campaign. The reality of the character is that a small part of it would make this prissy woman insane. (Why rent rooms and horror for horror?) A much younger woman?) <br /> <br /> This younger woman is getting more and more manic. control seized And our brave 40 must learn something to fight against that evil (and, of course, looking for a cheerful heat) 20. But this problem is. 20 When something starts to cause problems, it uses POWER, and just flirts or with a sex with a guy, and the consequences escapes. (Well, it looks really good in front of 20 things. It's not generally used in that way.) <br /> <br /> Moves through the premise device. divorced 20-bedroom rented-in contractually-paid rental. I do not know about 40 of these things, and 20 have got some help. Renters have the right to equal the entire period of the rental of the youngest woman, who uses the fixed price through utilities. Although a disappearance procedure is happening, something soon arrives that older women get a temporary restriction order, because they suspect 20 threaten something. You know, the judge sympathizes with all the misfortunes of a sweet and handsome girl. In the end, the 40 "heroic" battle for THE HOUSE begins. Woopie !! <br /> <br /> This movie is a realistic or irreversible thing that TROk (or protection orders) are very easy to say that women do not have to get anything more than their own, though they are generally. Only easy for humans. Sometimes they are justified and are motivated to take control of the house like here. In fact, girls who have gone along with their guys can often rip them out of their homes or homes, based on unfavorable evidence, but they are unfavorable to threats, and sometimes they do not even hear about it. Even when listening, it is impossible to prove that the threat claims (proving to be negative) are more effective than accused accused evidence. (This is true is the only field of American law), and it is a sign of an attack on feminist abuse and the failure of organized groups to cause failure.) Of course, this may not be the subject of this. Movies throughout life. <br /> <br /> The explanation of the absurd basic premise of this movie 20 is something psychotic and does not take medicine. However, it does not make sense. After a successful marriage lawyer, there is no help, even his help (the wrath of his wife). THE HOUSE continues (technically, to expel this divorced time over time). The youngest woman after the divorce is in ALL OVER THE SAME, after another 20 years, STOLAT is her husband! (The husband and wife are not at all quietly and basically asked him roughly - it does not matter, he has not yet sent.) <br /> <br /> The protagonist is enough to look at the age. But his views, attitudes and focus are so small, they do not appear to be imaginative, or beyond lifestyle, they do not care. Well, I believe that, as I think, the majority of the caregivers of life are judged by the average score, they score little. (I continued to see that it was only very bad and that cartoons had an external appeal. I could not see how far they would take it). <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** (If this is possible, this one). <br /> <br /> Well, here is an idea. The film ends with some 20 out of prison, its 20 male colleagues and sometimes a lover, and "said everything" and "take care of it". to continue his medicine) - and then to deceive him and return home. There he climbed stairs, with a knife, something constantly devoted to the devil, who is doing a bath through the light of light, thinking that the youngest woman is out of his life. There is a fight - and something that makes it 40 - adding 20, with a hypodermic needle of anti-psychotic medicine. Then she begins to stroke her, like her mother, and both women have a connection, a moment of feminine solidarity! How sweet
