Well, I like being honest with Kira's sex scenes and I've been buying it with all the audiences, but unfortunately I have not seen many of them. All sex scenes were short and differently, like all B music videos, jewelry and crisp. The small plot arrives at the end - Kira's new lover is a killer. Pull it! How much impact! Why do not we name the Academy Awards? I can not imagine that the movie would feel like a R-rated one (Mine imported from the United Kingdom, 18). Conclusion? Put it down and away, so you're not guilty of me. <br /> <br /> Score: 2/10
