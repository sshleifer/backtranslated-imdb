It was potential I saw Creep and I thought: 'Oooh, this is a lot of interesting.' However, interesting plot sites have either been unexplained or ignored, as never before. The main character was angry at the whole movie, and someday my partner and I cried out dying. There are moments that are astonishing / horrible moments, but the moments we're so annoyed with are weaned by the weird ones. It's one of those horror movies that is awful and horrified for some time, but ultimately frustrated and leaves you in the vicinity of trying to get in the movies. <br /> <br /> The only saving of this is a bad movie, but if you're more than a character who likes criminals, you will know about a loser.
