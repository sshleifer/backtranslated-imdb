The character of the movie Demi Moore is selected for SEAL because of its appearance. At first it was bad and from then on the movie fell. The plot was absolutely compelling. There is not enough willingness to achieve a tough military unit. This movie did not convince me about the physical ability of women to carry out the necessary work. <br /> <br /> I mean that women and men are basically the same, everyone is insulting the mind. Sexual differences have an interesting life.
