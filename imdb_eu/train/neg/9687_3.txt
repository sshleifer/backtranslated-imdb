This movie is incredible. <br /> <br /> The beauty of sexual intercourse between men and women is degraded by a group of men and women, the only ones described as wickedness and misfits collection. <br /> <br /> Greenaway acknowledges the inspiration for Fellini's "8 1/2" movie, but Fellini is titan of world cinema. Greenaway is not. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < with lightness sleepiness. <br /> <br /> It's an invention, divided into chapters of movies, written entry to each one, as the viewer should guide the film, just as written notes remain. A few seconds on the screen, it's not long enough for most viewers to ignore reading. <br /> <br /> With regard to women, only two can be seen, such as Palmira, as Polly has done. Walked and Giaconda Natacha Amal. The rest is unusual. Women and men come out of horror of reality in dark fantasy shades. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Greenaway means that sexual fantasy does not mean happiness. Women are depressing, given their services for money. The relationship between women and men is reduced to a commercial transaction. <br /> <br /> No cheer, happiness or love in the film, in fact, some scenes are very unpleasant: <br /> <br> <br> A suggestion of a relationship between father and son, Philip and Storey Emmental , John Standing and Matthew Delamere respectively played. Giaconda has had two children pregnant, the first fetus is aborted, and for the second time, men send a destination chosen from a flying book. Both men perform sexual intercourse with a woman with no legs (half of women given in the title). Beryl, by Amanda Plummer, a beast born with a pig called Hortense. Father and son share women among them. Women enjoying sexually defeated. Father sleeping with his dead wife. <br /> <br /> Honestly, none of these scenes are shown, not just explanations. <br /> <br /> In the case of feminine degradation, it is not surprising that when the film premiered at the Cannes premiere. It is more exciting for the film's actors to defend, showing again that women have no boundaries and women are going to exploit men. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Greenaway's style of direction is apparent, is the victory of style, the victory over substance, the film art wisely accompanied accompanied <br /> <br /> <br /> Greenaway tries to achieve subliminal surrealism, but only shows the banality of human relationships.
