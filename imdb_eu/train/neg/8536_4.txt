Steele is a typical production of the novel, despite the fact that two people with tragedy have met with each other. I would not call this spoiler, anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how to end ALL. If you do not want to know a lot about the plot, do not continue reading. <br /> <br /> Gilbert's character, Ofelia, is a decent French woman and her husband and son have lost an accident. Gilbert must stop the films that need to have an accent, but another good actress, can not get any stress. Brad Johnson is also a great actor, Matt, who is recovering after a bad divorce. This role is gentle, compelling and compelling. <br /> <br /> Two girls on the beach got together, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accused Matt of being a molester for talking to kids. . They become friends all the time and then the couple fall in love. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between two outputs is not great, although I do not think the talent of these two people is the question. They did the best with a script that links to a predicted plot and stereotyped. Two people come together, tragedy, greater tragedy, the secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they unite. I want to have more than that, but it's a short time. <br /> <br /> I wanted a restless entertainment, and I got it for that. Regarding the genre of romantic films, this is not a memorable one. With Janine Turner, a "secret" is much higher (not a Steele book), as well as Steele's first books to become a movie.
