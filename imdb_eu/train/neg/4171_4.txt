I passed the title 15 or 20 times in Blockbuster, something I wanted to see. I can say that the honest movie was a night I wanted to rent all this. <br /> <br /> I will give credit to those who are better than "Dracula 3000", but that's it, but that's it. It's pretty easy to say, because he did not have Caper Van Dien. There were other things that were missing in the sword: an interesting cast, interesting story, good conversation and originality, but you assume that you can not have everything. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** a foul group of vampires (one of them was a vampire ... go figure), they flew from the mining colony to find out all the vampires they could find. The crew is: ordinary captain, not rightly (who dies at the beginning of his death), his first book, an inexperienced first team, a vampire vampire hunter (not a handwriting), a crazy cowboy and really, ASIA really donkey Comedian, "hard" woman ... almost the sound of MTV's 'The Real World'. The captain dies with a whirlwind (and, as a result, smaller parts of human anatomy), his first agreement ... blah, blah, blah ... everyone hates ... blah, blah, blah ... I could keep it, but as I have said, about a hundred other genres are used. <br /> <br /> The effects of cheese and why Michael was. This Ironside movie is out for me. Vampire vampire hunter (it's not a typo yet) was pretty hot but, of course, waiting for you to show more than its duplication, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I was the worst movie I ever saw, as I actually rented Starship Troopers 2, but wait for this on Sci-Fi Channel.
