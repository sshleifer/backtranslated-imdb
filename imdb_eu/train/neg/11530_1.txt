Over the last 10 years, I've been working on a number of professional organizations in three independent struggles (including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars), 2 fighters on different television programs and we've struggled. I have never seen a star absolutely dear to the level of love, talent and abilities, and high quality production quality has been found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. As a type of fighting video, too, the term abuse is incorrect. Shot with the lower dollar cameras, the fight for playing domestic videos is basically in the back yard. The sound quality is bad, the quality of the video is bad and the performance is awful. They will wear "warriors" wristbands and ski-masks, and they play together with various objects and fight in the middle. Sometimes "matches" are in the grass. Sometimes in a backyard trampoline. ALL MAKE ANY SKILLS LIKE ANY SKILL ABOUT BLESSING. In short, do not worry about that. Whether you are interested in this DVD as an entertainment or as an academic (in my case), you will be very disappointed.
