As I considered the Babylon 5 series, the original that presented the series was a bad start. Later, there are many more believable and much more credible elements, but the rhythm of The Gathering is slow, make-up is pretty poor and the plot is confusing. Worse, the character of the first episode is bad. The evaluation board shows that many fans are ready to face these problems, I recall that Gathering almost revealed to me what a spectacular series became.
