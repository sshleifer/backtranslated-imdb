The plot of this film hangs on an important point: the murderer was also responsible, caring, and caring. It is not possible to be a father and a murderer. But that man dies a little boy and dies without provocation or reason or emotion. This girl was the daughter of someone. I do not think the father of so much caring for her daughter could be the cold daughter of someone else's. Or else he could have been so cold and still worried and he would take care of his daughter. And the idea that an alleged murderer would ask her to take her daughter's daughter to her daughter is not believed. <br /> <br /> That said, the characters thought they were actors. Changing the eye color of Scott Bakula seemed to me to be cooler and more threatening. You can not see it in your eyes.
