I am facing the idea of ​​a great American epic of War. This is not. (And yet, there was Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson THE PATRIOT. But digress I.) <br /> <br /> I saw this film before an MGM Studios (now Sony) in an advertising projection. came out The audience had a great deal of hope for this expensive period written by veteran Robert Dillon and was directed by Hughe (the famous CHARIOTS OF FIRE) and was the star of Al Pacino. <br /> <br /> But he did not take it. People began to be angry at the seats, whispering wonderful remarks about Pacino's shameless accusations - he supposed to be an American dominant being of Scottish (and!) - and Nastassja Kinski has who thought he was little emigrated. England (!!). Then the story started and everything went down quickly. <br /> <br /> Motivations were mixed, conversation was horrible, events did not have a historical or political context. The work of a plot made sense of coincidence; Pacino and Kinski were supposed to be the second or third side of the lovers after each other, it was a joke. Donald Sutherland gave him an unpleasant game as a British officer. His accent was on the map. I think that there was no English actor available. <br /> <br /> A lot of people stayed. Those who stopped stopped trying to avoid horrible rumors; I left it, at least, it seemed to me that the fight scenes were good. I was wrong. Without a doubt, Hudson chose to shoot cameras, though not Steadicam, because the sense of scale ruined the news as 'authenticity', which lost its sense of scale. <br /> <br /> There was a half-hour television reviewer before a few lines: (late) Gary Franklin Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could say that he frustrated the behavior of others. And surely, on the next day of his television segment, he starred in the movie "10" on his famous "Franklin Scale 10 and 10", because he reminded him about the nightmare's breaks during the nightmare. I do not know when they saw art. What is a jester? <br /> <br /> After this disaster, Pacino has not been the star of the film for almost four years. Hugh Hudson did not regain his career. You can not say that you have not warned.
