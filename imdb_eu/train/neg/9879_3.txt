After watching the movie, I was really surprised when I saw the high score in the IMDb. <br /> <br /> 'Fantasy lord's throwers' is an adaptation of the classic children's fairy, depicting a smooth and sharp story. The protagonist, Fox, (or 'Foxy') as Bogians, Bunce and Bean try to make a huge robbery. It's true, a short one, a fat, a lean, or anyway. <br /> <br /> I do not know where I started from my criticism. <br /> <br /> Well, I am "at the end of my teens and I have never been a fan of Roald Dahl, but I liked his material quite well, read some of his books a child, and Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory repeatedly I've seen them. This movie, however, is fighting for audiences. Is it for kids? Adults? I still do not know! Many "jokes" would receive a child, especially Mr. Because Fox is visiting a lawyer, for example, or complaining about being poor. Also, children (I suppose) is expected to be sympathetic to the character of stealing and killing children's children. I'm all in the food chain, but you will almost see Mr. Fox hanging his boys on his neck! Certainly, is it much more? And also the plot ... well, it's boring. I was only better off with hope, but more and more I was angry with Mr. Fox and his stupid decision with his son Ash. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, humor falls. I laughed at once or twice, although I accepted the attempts at joking. I think that part of it is that the voices are very flat and monotonous. Voice actors have no sense of comic time, but only seeks out subtlety of humor that works only with some media. George Clooney aims to illustrate Mr Fox with an amazing and pleasant, but his voice does not have any characters. Meryl Streep has no emotion, I did not notice Bill Murray's role in the final credits, and Ash, about twelve years old, is about 30 years old. <br /> <br /> I love the animation, especially the stop motion, but the visual style has been a little bit scared to me. The characters are tall, sharp and unhealthy. They move with little lightness and often animation is amazing. There is also a "mid-range" characteristic; 2D components will be added sporadically and without success. The characters look directly at the camera and they talk; it was very wrong. When Kyliek looked at the camera for a moment or two, he did not move, and he had a round in his eyes. He really liked me. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential. It seems like a lot of people still like - check out the comments. It may not be for me.
