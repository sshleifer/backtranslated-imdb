In five films, Rick Sloane's way of thinking was how hard it was for the fusion of the coldest. This movie is completely criminal. Before looking at this movie, I thought Manos: Hands of Fate I had ever seen was an unfortunate piece worse, but at least Manos moves so slowly to save sleep and pain. The biggest tragedy of this movie is to bring old men to "locked" Hobgoblin to the final scene. I saw this movie was the absolute waste of my life.
