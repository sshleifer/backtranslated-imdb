Thanks to Dan's commentary on Dan's worldwide review, I realize that it is hard to see people working hard for people to watch a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> I do not have any words, I do not know where I sat tonight to start writing a really cool movie - Dan in Real Life. I thought the characters in the previous films would be something of their kind and I had the opportunity to enjoy conversations, but like others, I felt uncomfortable and I cast my vote. <br /> <br /> The conversation was so intelligent, the family cookie cutter was Walton's family and the movies have been impressed so many times and someone thought that it was an original idea. <br /> <br /> Please, do yourself and give yourself a terrible scare. If you did not believe all the readings from the first comments, it might be like sitting in a different theater.
