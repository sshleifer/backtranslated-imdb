I like mute films, but it's a bit too much. As I wanted, I said that I could not get the time I spent. I do not think a movie version is approaching the book. And do not try with kids, they can be awful. And Mrs. Pollyanna played, how old were he? 38? I know then the laws of labor were different ... THE PEOPLE ARE NOT.
