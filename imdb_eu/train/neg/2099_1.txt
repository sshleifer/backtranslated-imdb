NOTE: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (Do not take care of, and also apologize for hats). <br /> <br /> He is angry with an unnecessary voice, a nonsense much worse. It follows nonsense and unnecessary drama. . That's wrong, but put it in a precise way. <br /> <br /> We think space travel is a dangerous company. There is a complicated system with malfunctioning, radiation, stress-related illnesses, etc., and unexpected things happen to a certain extent in unfamiliar environments. They knew the wrong things. In fact, things went wrong. It's called learning. It has been acknowledged that Appollo 11 has not been safe in current standards and was a huge political pressure, but the overall functioning of the technology was impressive. <br /> <br /> I did not even look at several mistakes / comments: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon prepared a lecture when something was wrong. Well duh I would like to do that. After all, it was the root of the propaganda war. <br /> <br /> 2) NASA provides green light, if Appollo 11 would blow. (This is "implicit. However.) Yes, that's why they let people and press time in real life. 3) The capsule will not work. It was not like there was a chimpanzee. Who survived? It started for the test and the rocket exploded, the capsule was accelerated away and with a drooping cap. There is a video, you can probably find it on YouTube or at least look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> 4) One interviewee says an explosion has destroyed the beautiful part of Florida. I can not suppose that it is aimed at hyperbolic mode; For I do not feel so bad about how it gets. <br /> <br /> 5) Then primitive technology was compared to current standards. Actually, nowadays, quite a bit of primitive software and hardware is used, the reason is not to fail. It is even worse for spacecraft, because their computers have high components that can not undergo radiation. (And craftsmanship itself needs to be pilot by hand, however, so it would not have a complex system like B2 guides.) What were "computer screens" rather than "computer screens"? The fucking technology is the same. Actually, television monitors were more accurate and produced. <br /> <br /> 6) "If this object is not rocket, it can be the only thing". We'll see this happening. But the statement is wrong, who said it is not a rocket part? A person interviewed is flying at least one thing and does not know what it is, it is an unidentified flying object. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Earth's radiation paper seems to be its crunch. It would be thinner than a space suit. <br /> <br /> 8) Neil Armstrong is a footage that I appreciate thanks to the death of flying in practice; I did not see it before. As I said, a part of the obvious technology may go wrong, especially if it has not been tested, even if it has not been unprecedented. <br /> <br /> <br /> 9) There was no disturbance due to the different routes of soil erosion due to the irregularity of the Moon's density. Likewise, there were no "five-second fuel left", which was "fifteen seconds left before the mission was canceled and returned to the command module". <br /> <br /> 10) A "catastrophe" event chain "usually causes disaster. I do not know how to put it easier. This, however, is a good example of rhetoric used. <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br , like a pleasant baby. Fun things. <br /> <br /> 12) When all of the people who are in the process of repetition have been lost, this phenomenon is completely natural and avoids contemporary technology that was known at that time, but its seriousness is implicit, but very deliberately, 13) Never lost a transport of the same space, the voicemail proving that this "truth" was evidence of Appollo 11. A dump of shit 13 Appollo's loss was near, but there were two real disasters uprising and re-entry when they were, respectively. In any case, compared to the Saturn rockets, so to speak ... well, okay, stupid. Without forgetting that, it seems that successful packing missions do not make the audience interesting. <br /> <br /> 14) What's the hell with UFO? In the movie context it also makes no sense. If you have not done so with the entertainment, you do not assume that you are targeted at a specific audience (including people with no understanding of history, science or rhetoric). <br /> <br /> Even though it's a movie point. it's dark "Closed so far," there are some sentences that are "publicly published for the first time", but the movie does not blame or offers any lesson that can be expected from a lesson or emotional film. . In the old tradition of sensationalism, there are many conversations and we record parts that are often out of context or fragment, except "NASA scientist". Wow, so astronauts were very nervous about the effort? I like that. What happens again with the movie point? Yes, what points? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < And believe me, I am a guy who enjoys me as absurd documentaries; This movie is not funny, exciting, curious, nothing.
