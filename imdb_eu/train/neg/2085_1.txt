I have seen one of the worst films I have ever seen. I think it's a man who wants to be able to speak in mouth with pleasure, it's almost 14-year-old fantasy children. The room in the bed room was the supreme scene and an intimate momentum was reduced to the biological functions, the gas transit through the public. First and foremost, in all other scenes, there was little sex in getting a debate, how long did it get from the next sexual relationship and from whom it should be. In addition, dialogue and performance were very poor and poor, did not feel, and lack of content was filled with noisy sex scenes. That's really fun because the concept is really interesting, but it's badly executed here. Please do not think if you want to see people under the age of 16.
