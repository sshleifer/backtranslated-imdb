No doubt, intelligence is a product of the young, this piece is very attractive to people of the 20s who are still trying to find their place in the world, obsessed with all the neuroses. However, I can not imagine that it is particularly striking for those over 30 years of being able to look at the navel, narcissistic, humorous, or insignificant. Another problem is that the peripherals, filmmakers, of course, only contempt. , they will go through some caricatured comics that are absurdly comic, which they do not link to in real mode. <br /> <br /> However, filmmakers who have grown up in the video game have to give them some style-style ideas and can use them in every book-editing trick to create an existing plot. . There are 2 points to remember here. First of all, be careful among lovers. Secondly, although we live in YouTube, nobody will report their daily life on screen treatment. But young filmmakers have the right to make their own movie, and to find something that others can identify for 20, it's getting better. However, at the end of this film I was not able to think of the latest generation, as far as age has come, in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications. As long as each child confirms how to calm down constantly, and all of them are worth 15 minutes of their exposure, the resilience and unfortunately ability to fight does not seem exactly the strength of this generation.
