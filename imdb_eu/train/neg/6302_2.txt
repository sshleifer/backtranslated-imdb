The British heritage film industry is under control. The shooting of classical novels is not bad at all, but why do movies need to be filmed by talented men? This movie tosses it out of Orwell's harsh novel, which makes it a dangerous and dangerous romantic comedy. 'Aspidistra' may not be the best work by Orwell, but anyone who reads may forget the excellent description of poverty. Orwell does not emphasize cold and appetite, but the insult to poverty. In the novel, London is a silly, gray, cold and boring city, and Comstock says it will explode from the bombing. But this movie is going to end up worryingly, and it creates a wonderful nostalgic journey through the charming London of the 1930s, which is lit up with golden sunlight, and the unusual and cool lambs of Lambeth are also eliminated. cockroaches and wonderful prostitutes. Comstock's poems about heavy wind over the streets of dirt disappear completely in chocolate boxes. The worst script is the constant courage, the old jokes and the intertwined conversation. It's very frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play with Gordon Comstock, and has great movie actors. But it's nothing. I was angry at this movie! The history of British literature is something of its richness, complexity, and power. And what do we do? We use gentle gentlemen, who are focused on soft and want to become a bleeding for people who feel "getting some cultures" while they drink Horlicks while silent.
