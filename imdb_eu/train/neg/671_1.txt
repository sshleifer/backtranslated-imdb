Poor performance, no script, no plot, a conventional killer, no suspense, no original configuration, repeated the person behind a wardrobe / bed / a mirror repeatedly. boring, and NOT in a pre-eminent way, and no one has ever "really" dying (at least not on the screen), which at the same time can call it, called out right and everyone feels eve MORE spend money on their input on the card ... it's a horror movie, without LMAO fear. Most people who see you take a ketchup bottle and look like someone that spills across a plastic sheet. <br /> <br /> There, a young man was screaming in the theater and you have to be afraid of yourself. This was either drunk or at that time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have a life and I do not review it I write it often I really hate it except something, or enjoy it incredibly. > <br /> But this film is AWFUL and I feel it is my duty to warn you, DO NOT donate money to Hollywood and encourage it again! <br /> <br /> One thing is to rent a movie "bad" in the Weinsteins blockbuster, another that you need to sit in the theater. <br /> <br /> Also, in case you want some remake nostalgia, forget it! This is not a remake, nor imagine it again. It's not terrifying, it's not passionate, and it's not as nice to be "fun" as others say in the IMDb ... it's outdated and wonderful. <br /> <br /> Here's what the film is about to take: Brittany Snow's drawing, which stands out above all in the plot, is that Jonathan Schaech must have a sexual connection with JS. "Cardona's" The Forsaken "has achieved another role as a killer (because it's terrifying because it's like my poodle, and it's almost incredible for anyone to die) and for some reason (duh) the hotel's return to the suite never comes back. What kind of person would not mind when promising the prom king and queen to announce candidates, and a great girl will not appear to somehow? This is my warning. I did not waste any money as I did. He also likes "original", but Jamie Lee Curtis is a fanciful fan, but he's not as bad at all (he's horny or rude, but if you see that, he'll understand why I say what I say).
