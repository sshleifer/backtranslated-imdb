I do not have a biography in Lincoln, so maybe it was a detailed portrait ... <br /> <br /> And perhaps I use the non-alienating and realistic portraits worshiped by birth. Excellent as Lincoln, honor and the savior of our country ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Although Henry Fonda made a brilliant Lincoln, he seemed like an insulted portrait of his "portrait, I am a simple guy." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> [All provided by Bushie Jr. We believed that the campaign was a "normal boy", so we would not mind being rich and privileged, but it's another story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> only fake ideas with the simplifier. Laws regarding rights and defects. The film is not a very good defense lawyer (he puts his feet on the table and laughed at the witnesses), and most of the result determines the chance / luck. <br /> <br /> In addition, partly, partly, partly. This was financed by Republicans (in the face of a playmaker democrats), and partly because it was just the feeling of that era, cinema is sadly religious, racist, and conservative. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time in this film!
