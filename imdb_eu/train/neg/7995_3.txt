I remember watching this movie as a young man, but I could not recover the title during the horror films and I think myself "that's the title?" This movie is a type of film / insect attack by destruction that is a bit of a combination of movies, with significantly less star. Likewise, it is boring, with a television set, where the film fades away from the scope of ads and others. Land has invaded this type of station by the ants. I think they were worried about a construction, or something that was happening nearby, but do not mention me. It was the most memorable attack on me for the whole flick: the first fall on the swimming pool fell into the pool and also the scene of Assault attacks. This is also a surprising end to the use of cardboard tubes survivors. In the end, like most TV movies, this movie is very dear and not very scary, unless you're scared to see at least an ants.
