When Ben (Red Foxx) finds out when his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) escapes from her brother, her son Norman (Michael Warren) starts to download the story of his evil. Without saying that, Ben does not take it right, and he continues with many complications - Ben Norman tries to try to be homosexual (Tammy Dobson). The movie movie is much more fun than the movie itself. Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN ... is it written originally for the theater? It was a disaster in New York. Concerning play, I acted as a production of the theater community in the 70s; and no one has complained that the far-off beast does not play clearly. He proved quite funny. It's a pity that the wife of this movie does not do the same thing. <br /> <br /> This is a fruitful movie. Red Foxx, XX. One of the most ridiculous comics of the century is fun here yesterday, Michael Warren (later on the TV shows HILL STREET BLUES), which Foxx can see. The worst performance and Pearl Bailey is not behind; Actually, only in Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson and Wayland Flowers have sparkles, and unfortunately, compared to the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Movies are not just movies. badly done, it seems bad. According to the film, this is the first big screen effort to be filmed on the video game, and then sent to the celluloid for the purposes of the project - and I think it shows. The film looks like a bad sitcom in the 1970s, with respect to the painted illustration seen during Norman and Garson's apartment. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad, they make fun, but NORMAN ... IS YOU? It's not one of them. I can summarize the reaction of this movie in two words: losing. Do not buy, do not rent, do not touch it with ten feet. Just go back slowly and then run like hell. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
