True, I think it's a bad effort for the Dominican film industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie is fun, but when they change the role of society (women who usually do it and those who do what they usually do), the movie falls. Be boring and not fun. Many things are left unexplained and the movie can be previewed at the end. Roberto Angel liked not his character nor the little one. I went to the movie theater, I expected to see a good work but I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film.
