Ronald Reagan and several US soldiers in a North Korean POW camp. They are tortured ... We learn that North Communists are bad people ... We learn that American beards grow very slowly during torture ... <br /> <br /> I tried to get rid of it, but eventually I exploded. laugh away Mr. Reagan was a scene that told the Communists he wanted to be. Then she asked for a brandy bottle. Then, with a cold stone, Dewey Martin pulled out a drunken friend to help heal Mr. Martin's suffering. Of course, North Korea's communist guard is a guy as they come. So, the drunk guard will be taken care of by taking Reagan out of a drawer, next to a series of empty boxes. I am sure that the box should have something; but, of course, Reagan has shaken enough to reveal what is left empty. You laugh! I think that "Prisoner of War" especially those who would like to work with family and friends. Otherwise, it's useless. <br /> <br /> * Prisoners of War (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest and Dewey Martin
