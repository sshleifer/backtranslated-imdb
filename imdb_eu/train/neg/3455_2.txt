Geez! This is one of the films that you have previously reviewed, but you did not. I mean, you did not do that wrong, but somehow you thought. <br /> <br /> To be honest and short; The worst, most boring and slashing ever done. I can not say anything about this piece of fun, since there are few decent opinions of professional filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The scene of death is horrible, bloody, stupid. Land is a good way to copy "Popcorn" in 1991. <br /> <br /> To make things even worse, this is not so good a movie. It's wrong. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwald wanted to do his best, but it was not enough.
