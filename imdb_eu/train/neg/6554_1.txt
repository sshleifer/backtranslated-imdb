I would not rate this movie, it's not worth it. I saw Pfieffer as a fan. I loved it and I saw everything I saw. However, he did not disappoint. There, each scene kept the viewer's looks ... waiting for something to happen, but nothing was done. He had some good stories but it was initially finished. Other characters had a potential, but there was nothing. The wardrobe and the dress was amazing. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I see everything and I can not find something I can ever find when I find a movie, but that was not bad at all. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing, there was a big cliff at last. The last scene awakens and says wow, eventually this film goes to places, then casts credits. Good pain. <br /> <br /> I mean, "Well, say, this is a movie that was more entertaining than it was, it was very well. I missed this .99 c√©nt. this .dud.dud.
