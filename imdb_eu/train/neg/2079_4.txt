I'm a fan of Ivan Reitman. I loved Evolution and who did not like Ghostbusters? Trailer you know that Uma's character is spreading to Luke. So when the appearance of superpowers on the one that casts on it, however, it is not paid. Then the shark did not get it. A slight giggle but once again everything was on the trail. <br /> <br /> No one has a good breathing diet like Uma and Luke Owen on his good days. With a smile on the ground, your cheeks begin to strike the zipper. This is a comedy, right? <br /> <br /> It is not horrible, it sits like an old cracker behind the fridge. It could be as wonderful as the superhero movies and feminism, but it fails at two points. We'll see Jason Reitman. can save the family name.
