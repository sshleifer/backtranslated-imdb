This movie can not decide what he wanted to be. There were several subplots, which some time later believed that all these elements would be together ... but they did not. If you want an "alien" story of "frozen waste", paste it with the 50s version (not innocent in the gore-o-vision fifty years later). <br /> <br /> I could not ignore the "foreigner" who was apparently RECYCLING to make INDEPENDENCE. <br /> <br /> The "Minimum Minimum" groups should be more effective if they have hired an actor and hired them. <br /> <br /> The scenery wins the masks a little. .
