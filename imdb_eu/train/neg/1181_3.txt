This movie was scandalously covered for so long that they sought ... an attack, mystery, etc. Everything was part of the film industry, but partly failed. It's a horrible comedy, horror movie pathetic, a lame erotic movie. <br /> <br /> 2 DVDs with photos, interviews with beautiful books, interviews, bestiality essays, etc. more pretentious than the director. For those who have heard about it, but for those who have never seen it, it seems to me great to see the movie really. It's a 1-disc movie, translated in English but with good visual quality. 2. The record has a cuts to the director, with a huge transfer, in French. <br /> <br /> What can I say about real animals? Kermit frog's hand puppet would be more effective and more moving.
