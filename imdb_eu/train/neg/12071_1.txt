Terrible ... it's just awful. The worst film ever I've ever seen. Over the years, I have seen bad pictures. The sound sucks the image quality, direction, performance ... and so on. The only ones (because they are fun, because they are so bad) are special effects. Generally, they laughed about 5 minutes. The rest of the movies gives you brain damage.
