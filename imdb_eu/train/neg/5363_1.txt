I did not think that this movie was worth the worst script, except the bad performance except Janine Turner, fantasy, stupid plot, husband-wife's husband and divorce. If you have never seen before the movie, do not worry, it's not worth it. Janine Turner was good at doing a good job. Terry's husband has won many cases, and his lawyer has also won an assassin who was not asertable. So he thinks so intelligent, but it's just a nut. His best friend has a relationship with his husband and betrays him. Pretty girl eh Yes peach is authentic, no. It does not have a day on the beach.
