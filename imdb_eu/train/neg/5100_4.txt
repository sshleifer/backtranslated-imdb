This anime series starts with great, interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully interpreted and executed. Everything is not immediately explained, hanging over the proverbial carrot before the audience, who dares to watch the audience in each of the following episodes. But think of your disappointment that the science fiction thriller / the giant robot's adventure is the backdrop to the exploitation of psychobabble and almost religious preaching. If you want to hear "You're OK, it's good for you." After tapping into negative language and negative emotional characters, this is for you. If you want to watch a good science-fiction movie, be sure to forget it. They were both original and substitute for me. All this, and this movie was very preaching.
