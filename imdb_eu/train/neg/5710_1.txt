Looks good on paper, Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer once again collaborate, this time with a movie heist, Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But, dear, Indiana Jones is Speed ​​2 speed. A sensible cast (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) are fighting against the brave guys and they are badly lost. The movie is a bit more than a long ad for Franco's commercials. However, these freemasons are not typical traditional stores and playing golf. Masonians are the natural descendants of temperate knights (and nobody mentioned "From Hell" or Jack the Ripper.) I do not think I've reported any disaster. There is hardly any suspense, it's not surprising and it's not clumsy, it stays. The National Treasury is intended by Dan Brown, but Scooby Doo is as intelligent as the section on humor.
