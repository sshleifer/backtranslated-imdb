In the 1970s, WPIX directed "The Adventures of Superman" for many days in the afternoon. Occasionally, we would be delighted to see the surrounding shows as "Superman and Mole Men" in the air. That day I always looked forward. Having seen recently, I was surprised that it was really bad. <br /> <br /> It was not bad either for special effects or for lack of it. Actually, George Reeves's Superman costume was pretty bad, it seemed to be more conspicuous on the edges of the foam to make it look bigger. And the truth is that Mole Men's clothing was even worse. Having a teddy cover would not have tricked a ten-year-old boy, zippers, sleeves, and rugged dresses, because the worn-out fabrics were scrupulously obvious. But those were forgiving, they were shortcomings. <br /> <br /> No, what was bad was the invented plot device. Superman has repeatedly failed to make the situation worse. Is Lynch a mob looking for creatures? Collecting histeric people or finding the same creatures, shows the dangers for Lois and PR society. Do you sweat the creatures? Once again, he stands up and speaks, but he does not save them until they are shot. Is Luke Benson, a town attack, shot? He tried to kill people with sensible people, but Superman repeatedly releases that man can cause more problems. Superman had many opportunities to try to get the problem out, but he never took advantage of it. . Only if they had given a good script to work.
