If this is not a better term, the movie is lousy. Where do I start ... <br /> <br /> Film photography - This was perhaps the worst of this year. He thought it was being thrown into the camera man from camera to man. Maybe they had a single camera. It gives you the feeling of being a volleyball. <br /> <br /> There are a bunch of scenes, random, constantly rolling. When they did 'Private screen', it was nonsense. Everything was flat, it seemed ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The color tones were far away. These people need to learn to balance a camera. This "movie" is bad and badly done. <br /> <br /> Plot - You need to be scared. If I were a SS agent, I would sue the producers. Marks Brothers seemed like radios and guns. Sutherland was in his '24' mode - I can see it for free. Eva Longoria would be a little bit better and would show much more. As an action bimbo was not much. <br /> <br /> I could not see a real plot, which the President Douglas attached to his wife. He never said why the mercenaries were trying to kill the dam. I do not see the President of the United States living in a tunnel in a building, like a rat in the labyrinth. p-l-e-a-s-e. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This movie is proof. I like the 'big screen'. When I was a baby. Many movies like this and I will leave. What has happened to Hollywood, so much by the Pushkin, how do you forget about the real movie? When I was the owner of a theater, I directed the old movies. With real actors, good stories and good filmmaking. <br /> <br /> 'This movie is a dog. Do not waste your time or money. I value this movie! Douglas is not right for this role. I can do more than his age, but that's just what he can take.
