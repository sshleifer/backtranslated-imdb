It's the only piece of trash that has been a successful television for Australian television without excuses. Home-grown husbands are boring, uninteresting, ridiculous, and they will try to kill you if you need to kill them. As far as I am worried, Big Brother is a decline in Western society, as we show society as we approach the slopes. What happened to the television, because society did not have the lowest common public announcement? This can not be classified as entertainment. It is true that Channel Ten can take away your soul. He was a respectable comedian with Rove McManus, and once he changed to Channel 10, he was no bigger. Except the Simpsons very intelligent.
