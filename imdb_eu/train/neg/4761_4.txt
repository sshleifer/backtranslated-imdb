Harold Pinter rewrites Anthony Schaeffer's classic theater, about a man who goes to visit his lover's husband and walks sideways. The original films were the protagonists of Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Caine has an Olivier role in this version and joins Jude Law. Here is a movie directed by Kenneth Branaugh. <br /> <br /> The impact is spectacular. Cain and Law are both gangbusters in their own roles. I like the clash between chemistry and personalities. It's really wonderful and good enough to see the direction of the script. <br /> <br /> Harold Pinter's conversation is crisp and sharp and often awful and I understand why they chose to write again (that is, up to date). to use surveillance cameras and the like). The problem is how script moves characters. Michale Caine walks the law with her modern home and sliding doors and panels, because she has no good reason. Conversations occur repeatedly in different locations. I know Pinter has done it in his plays, but in this case it is boring. Why should we be doing the couple repeatedly and legally going to sleep with Cain's wife? It would be okay if, in a way, we did that, but it did not work for the first time for the first time. The script does not make Cain's handling of the Law well. To begin, it will be angry at the beginning, so it does not turn around and you're not afraid to have it (it does not matter if the later revelation happens), why bother you when it comes to thinking about it. We do here, and while it's on the edge, it's somehow false, because it's so clear that we're forced to ask why Law does not set Milo on this. There are other cases, but they would give much more to say. <br /> <br /> I think I'm thinking about the backdrop movie, a lost movie and a bad movie. The missed options are the possibility of better fireworks between Cain and Law. In fact, choosing bad scenes and bad plots does not allow the creation of a tense and thriller. Instead, we get intelligent conversation and great performances in a movie that does not leave true movies. <br /> <br /> Although the great performances and the enormous interview are only 10 out of 10, the rest of the scripts just works
