As a filmmaker, I can definitely say that it is the worst film I've ever seen. I would rather not see the root channel again than watching the movie. The use of stereotypes, the use of parts of traditional coyote stories, and the use of little camera work only made worse Christian stories and bad guides. Writers and directors showed the worst traces of a colonized origin, the originals and portrayal of communities. If this person is an original, go home and be apologetic to all those who know about being an apple and have an inner humor and mood that they have developed. If this person does not have an original, they should seriously re-examine their white privileges and ask whether or not they are questioning whether they are racist or do not know themselves intentionally. My hope is that the native actors of this film had fun and paid at least some effort. If you want to see good Native films, watch Christmas in the clouds, dance me away, the Medicine River, Powwow Highway, Kea Signs ... to name a few.
