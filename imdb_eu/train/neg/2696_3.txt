I know John Singleton's intelligent boy, Boyz N The Hood, so how did he write and direct that? Commercial soap is "like a pilot for the first time in college" as a pilot, a paradoxical stereotype paradox without violent violence in a commercially proposed proposal. Who would have guessed that the rape victim would throw a seafood sausage? An angry individual would catch him by a group (and he would make a joke with a black man and a Jew - only laughter!) Even though Laurence Fishburne's terrifying storytelling story made me angry and I loved it, that is. All those who take part in this movie have lost their land. Except Busta Rhymes, of course. Great
