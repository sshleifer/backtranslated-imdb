Is not it now? Taking into account the good work by Danzel, Cliv and Jodie, the movie was never shot in a horrible / amazing movie. Yes, a couple of jokes, there is no anticipation, there is only one moment which is not honest, because both the director and the editor made stupid mistakes, it is a shame and a waste of time for us. Someone can tell why they dug a hole in the ground on the floor, who is the hell Rebe and how they knew that diamonds were in a certain cell in the ground, it could only count that day, but does that seem? Spike wants us to do a lot of things and do not stop lifting my eyebrows seems stingy ... it's just a movie studio studio that's just relaxing and enjoying ...
