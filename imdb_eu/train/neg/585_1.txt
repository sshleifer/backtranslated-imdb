The original movie, Man from Snowy River, is one of the best I've seen, almost perfect. Lady and the Tramp story in two ways - rich girl / poor boy and bloody ability. Driving, however, is not just an insincere attempt to take advantage of the reputation of the original, as well as the most horny confused Disney, as described in "Rambo Meers the Black Stallion". Stallion Black without charm. The young heroes are missing a three-year absence and suddenly he walks with Superman; The original and good film was genuine and compelling, but in an unhappy sequel it was reduced to a caricature. I have hardly been disappointed in the film, and sometimes when I was annoyed by this, they almost did not lose a clich√©. Without a doubt, the manipulation of the audience - what do you think of the studio heads with horse-loving viewers is that they put beautiful horsemen in order to be happy? The mess of a movie.
