Oh, where did you start? Cinematography was great. When I started the movie as the first landscape scenes I thought I had a good movie. Then Cgi Bigfoot appeared. He looks like the cartoon characters of Lehoin king and king Kong's love for children. They completely removed the credibility of the character. Without apparent reason, Cgi was a tasty cartoon. So, he shot me the whole movie. Money washed down by the CGI rogers like a roger Patterson. His bigfoot was the best, he never could. Again, I'm a bigfoot fan fan and I warned about this movie, but it was my compulsion to see this movie and the previous reviews warned me. After reading this review, you still say "I have to watch Sasquatch hunters, I have to see Sasquatch hunters." Then why did I lose my money to win a good win in such a terrifying boring movie!
