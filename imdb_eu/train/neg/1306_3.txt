(aka: DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Made for Italian Italian television even filmed in English and never was the sequel to the first movie of DEMONS. Simply, it was called "OGRE", which was released by the director Lamberto Bava. <br /> <br /> The American family rents an Italian summer villa. Woman (Virginia Bryant) herself dreams of herself, as a little girl who goes down to the old winery's winery, with a beauty structure that hangs on the ceiling. It is clear and covers the covers and the spider or insect legs hang from it. Green paint seems to emerge. <br /> <br /> Of course, the husband does not believe in something like that. The house is old and it makes a terrible noise in the middle of the night, and it has to be discarded. <br /> <br /> But then the same OGRE appears in XVI. What looks like a costume of the century. She looks like a wolf's head and attracts the smell of orchids. <br /> <br /> The film is not so bad, and at least half-hearted dialogue brings with it clever phrases that make fun of duplication. . There's only a few skeletons on a pond in a basement that looks like a real swimming pool. OGRE himself disappears just after the Jeep Cherokee family. <br /> <br /> Shriek's view was a faulty copy of the DVD, and the film that took a black half of an hour for a second for Shriek led me to make a mistake. Among the add-ons, a short interview with Lamberto Bava will be presented. Here he explains how this sequel was not, etc. ... along with some other Shriek DVD releases. This is pretty standard. <br /> <br /> 10 of 3 <br /> <br /> <br />
