Couple Young Mandy Pullman (Mitch Martin) and Roy Seeley (Matt Birman) are just relaxing on a beach in a small town of Galen. They decide to start playing jokes together. Mandy hides in the old cabin, raging and raging an unknown attacker. Roy prevents his help after listening to his cries but he has died. Dr. Sam Cordell (John Cassavetes) and his daughter Jenny (Erin Flannery) are two daughters after Galen killed his wife, Sam. Sam is Hank Walden (John Ireland) chief of police when Mandy and Roy meet. Roy makes an autopsy and Mandy treats her terrible injuries. Shortly afterwards, curator Carolyn Davis (Denise Furgusson) is also attacked and raped. A local journalist named Laura Kincaid (Kerrie Keane) reports on events and Sam suggests that a similar string of rape and murder occurred 30 years ago in the village. More rape and murder occur. Meanwhile, Jenny's boyfriend, Tim Galen, (Duncan MacIntosh) is dreaming of a strange nightmare, and he's surely related to something horrible. In Tim's story and into the villages of the past, Sam becomes the creator of a creature known as Inubus, only to play demon role playback! Under the direction of John Hough, horror movie is dark. Ray Franklin's novel based on George Franklin's slogan is slow to say a bit. It's not an interesting or exciting thing that happened and the end of my tour ends with one of the most boring events of the end and it just ends. As stories slipped into snails, there are some rapes, but they do not appear on the screen. There is also a unique scene in the whole movie. The monster is only shown at the end and has three short scenes. Everything about this film is very static and flat, the film does not have the energy or the rhythm. The operation is dull and you do not feel or care for anyone. Check the scene in the autopsy room, where you can clearly see the microphone on the top of the screen several times. The type of horror movie that you will forget one day. Real time, do not worry.
