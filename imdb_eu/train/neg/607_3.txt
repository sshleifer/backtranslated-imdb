The London subway is somewhat penetrating, with long tunnels, deeper and deeper mechanical underground stairs, and, of course, traces run. It is surprising that it is not used in horror films more often. Deathline seventy-five-a-half-horror stone was used as a Raw Meadow, which is the most widely used tunnel used for cannibalists and was the famous Werewolf American seclusion sequence in London. So I was glad that I saw someone wanting to get the ambient atmosphere tonight with the UK Creep production. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was going well, with a very effective credit sequence. That was really a rhythm, then the cover that created the premise that was hidden under the streets of London was hiding. However, Creep dropped down from here, and found that I was shut down after opening this scene, leaving me with the good impression of the movie. Not all the characters are incredible and impossible, even the Potent, and the director feels the need to overcome himself with social comments on homeless matters. In addition, he was responsible for displaying the "monster" full of lighting, which returns remotely horrifying and shows his name Craig. How can a monster called Craig? X becomes a type of file type, and reminds a Tombs episode. In fact, I wanted Mulder and Scully to appear and I would sort them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the case of bad sex violence, it is very graphic, disturbing and totally useless. It seems that the viewer is merely a blow to the intrinsic value of the plot. The problem is so top and horrible it really really numbs you in the rest of the horror, that is, it's a mistake, it's just half the movie. <br /> <br /> So you have not gone. The only essential feature of the movie was Ken Cossell, my favorite occasional occasion, to look curious. You do not often see it, but the others on the screen make another corner. As a sewer supervisor, it was a generosity blow, unfortunately the only one in the film.
