Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) became a widow when her wife suddenly died. Shortly after, Dr. Price is an expert on Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), with some alleged electronic gadgets that have received emails from Jonathan's wife Anna. Is Anna Jonathan trying to say something? Is this something about a big cosmic or global scale? It's good to see Keaton's role, but the stuck story is in a confusing and nonsensical point; The movie does not know how it is generated, as it does not respond to these questions, so it deviates from it with unrelated questions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < a long-suffering widow trying to communicate with her late wife. He is a bit like an actor, he left the theater's playwrights played fifteen years earlier. It looked a bit like it was, perhaps, more wrinkled than expected, but it does not have a sneak peek at Hollywood's quarter-quarter quarter. <br /> <br /> So Keaton does not turn. In a mediocre performance, it's the same script. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot becomes more confusing as it progresses, another tortured road ends. All this is good and good if the path creates an acceptable deviation, something that connects everything together and explains ... something. It's not a white noise; Jonathan knew what happened to me before I saw him first. <br /> <br /> Keaton really is the only reason to see this rubbish, though Ian McNeice's good help (Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Unger's interest in love.
