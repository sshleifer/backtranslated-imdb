Here we got the boring thing. They are better than its 5-minute shorts. why? It's only 5 minutes and 91 minutes or it's a long time. <br /> <br /> The drawing is nice ... eh ... last half hour, the rest is boring and not funny = (I have had my hopes, the trailer has been fun, but its rhythm The film is quite slow and unfortunately It's not fun. We're just trying to get together and we're laughing at the plain Klaymen ... it does not work. <br /> <br /> Perhaps next time knox. <br /> <br /> Maybe you're going to cut it again and adding better scenes would be a great cure, but it's not good at this time.
