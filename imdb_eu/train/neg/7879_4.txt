First of all, I must say that I loved the Animal Farm book. I read with my 9th grade class and it was very good. We decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. The movie was so annoying to me. The movie cuts some characters and many of the main points of the book are missing. He often jumps and explains nothing. If you were watching this movie without reading this book, they would be confused. The worst thing in this movie ended with me. At the end of the book was the strongest and the movie changed! Hope was that pigs and men allied and "melt", but they seem to be rebelling against the pigs. In short, I do not think this movie is captured by the true meaning portrayed by Orwell in his book.
