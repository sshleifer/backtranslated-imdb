Someone must ask Ang Lee. Actually, it makes a lot of people. And I'll start. I was never interested in Hulk's Ang Lee, because the reviews were unanimous. The first cable channels showed very little. In the end I decided to watch yesterday in the U.S., wow .... <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ANG LEE's HULK ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HULK ENVIRONS <br /> <br /> It was boring! Ang Lee's Hulk has hardly been achieved. Eric Bana was without expression, Nick Nolte was horrible, and Sam Elliott was unlikely (and that's not funny as an elegant character). In fact, I think that Eric Bana has chosen to simplify his description face with computer graphics - and it was clear that Ang Lee Hulk had to do something like Bruce Banner that his anger was not in the state. When Hulk fought a mutant dog, I got to make Hulk the worst movie of the superhero era. <br /> <br /> But something happened. With this boring film, about 3/4, it was really exciting and - I dare say - it is reasonably convincing - the extended state of action begins to emerge from a Hulk chamber in a military base, fighting M1 tanks and Comanche. In the desert helicopters and then walk the F22 Raptor in the stratosphere to catch on the streets of San Francisco. It was one of the best sequences of action ever made for the superhero movie. And I must say that CGI was pretty good. This does not mean that Hulk was completely persuasive. He did not need much more breaks than a superhero action movie. And that is a very successful one. <br /> <br /> Of course, the end was really stupid, as Bruce Banner's father turns something similar in shape, but the first long-acting sequence shames the heroic shorts of Iron Man. . And in general, besides mutant animation dogs, he recalled Hulk's CGI as being really real and really convinced that he interacted with his environment. It was better than I expected, of course. <br /> <br /> Ok, but what's wrong with Hulk? Guess what ... it's too boring! Hulk has little appearances and here's a great CGI for this movie. Perhaps in the version of Ang Lee it seemed like a fake look and the cartoon of others, but it also had convincing moments. Incredible Hulk was exciting. The skin tone and muscle tone were also not the appearance of a living being, that is, a type of computer-generated text. He was very absurd. Light, the environment and facial effects did not look like they were 5 years earlier than Ang Lee. And there's really no excuse. We are definitely just like any other director, actor, or director that can break a movie. <br /> <br /> Worse, writer and director this film almost did not learn anything. Ang Leeen "failure". All mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is almost emotional. The whole thing is so impossible, it seems impossible to be more fictional than a one-dimensional Hulk. The interest of love is not convinced (I have to give credit to Liv Tyler for more emotion than Jennifer Connelly, though both are pretty simple eyes). Tim Blake Nelson performs as much as Nick Nolte, even though he has only been in for a few minutes. Hulk really is not much in this movie, definitely much less than in the version of Ang Lee. The incredible Hulk was somewhat faster, but nothing happened, however, it's not worth much. Yes, yes, the bad guy is a bad look like Hulk. It's really much more interesting as man than monster. <br /> <br /> So, I can definitely say Ang Lee's version is better: if I can see the version of Ang Lee again, you might be able to sit through it to see good sequence of good actions or else a little more conversation I'd like to try to estimate (I'm just going to get into good parts). But absolutely not every single scene is worth watching Hulk incredible, only leave it twice. It's really under superhero movies. The CGI cartoon is an insult to the people, at least it seems to be trying to make realistic in the version of Ang Lee (except, of course, the giant poodio). <br /> <br /> Very mindful - filmmakers intended to eliminate the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk, almost exactly in the same movie. <br /> <br /> Edward Norton's credit is moving away from that movie.
