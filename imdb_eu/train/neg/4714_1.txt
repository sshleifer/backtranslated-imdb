Unfortunately I want to give this piece of waste to zero, unfortunately, I do not have to give it 1 to warn you that the deceiver of this cartoon is known to be a stupid fool! The characters seem to be drawn by preschool students, do not wait, I've seen that preschoolers do better! I prefer "flapjack of misadventures" with the horrific excuse of cartoon! Surely, I say the other, two words: RIP OFF !! Do you remember the Dexter's Lab section when you went down the volcano to the kite? Yes, Mister Fellows has also gotten wrong with that idea and failed! Shadow Lugia also pulled back in that part of the Pok√©mon parody (he also won this franchise!) This character is cheaper than the Mandink Dink Lab! Mister Fellows has to bring legality to this part of the crash! Everyone has their say, but those who like Johnny (RIP-OFF) are just lying to you. Do yourself aside, change the wait for this channel when it's trying to shame your screen!
