I really liked it. Please do not think I'm a fool, but I must admit that I liked this movie. I expected that it was bad, it was rough, but sometimes it's okay to relax and do not need to concentrate too much on a dirty movie that you do not need to watch? I did not expect any hidden meaning or morale, and there was no doubt, but it did not matter, why entertain me, and entertained me. Why were Ben Stillers (why Mary's "something is there") and Vince Vaughns (despite the fact that you write her last name, I can not verify jobs). It's a good idea to watch a movie if you do not expect it, and I'll take a stand for a jog, maybe run it, but I do not drive because I do not have a car, blockbuster video, or even a room, and they rent their toilet movies and sleep a night. do it Good day to the reader. If you have not said that this comment has helped you, I do not like it, he says, helped God bless you, you will go to heaven.
