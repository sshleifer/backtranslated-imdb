Only glandular kidneys - and please do not ask for more information - young virgins body and mind quickly wreck their wives, youngsters and old people. Except those who did not take part in medical trials, virgins seldom give up in their secretariat, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) retired and maintained. He'll get him out. <br /> <br /> A superb cheese ball premised on a low budget horror film. Being afraid of a body disappears, like ordinary Limburger, leaves an interesting taste. <br /> <br /> Surely, the play is almost scary, except for actresses who make fun of the actress (nano Rossitto, then played Max Max Beyond Thunderdome), Angelo Rossitto; This crazy brother, brother of an angel (Frank Moran), shivers a lot and has a fetish to cut virgin hair; Both became mother (Minerva Urecal); the wife's fool (Elizabeth Russell) sleeps in a toy coffin and, of course, a malignant doctor (Lugosi). <br /> <br /> A young reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters), walks behind the doctor as a strange orchid with a delicious smell of the victims. When the doctor and his wife invite them to sleep at night, a storm breaks immediately. This trace tells us some terrifying violence that comes into play. We all know that at the time of Hollywood all the unmarried women had young women, Pat might face unpleasant surprises. Dark passages, a penetrating laboratory where the dead virgin approaches the basement, the mausoleum in the basement, and later the direct threat of Patricia's glandular secretions. If he survives, he will give a story to his editor. <br /> <br /> If you try this moist slice cooked by Velveeta (and why not? Do not be superior), do not judge Judge Bela Lugosi's company here. He had a great impact on Dracula (1931), but my favorite movie is The Black Cat (1934). Dr. Vitas Werdegast is a dull and ironic man for the protection of his two young friends. When Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) carries a sculpture and when the man starts to take his life, the scene is excellent.
