The most striking feature of this mid-musical music of the 20th century in Berlin is cinematography and a wonderful edition. This is the first First National line of these sections. The story is very nice and similar to Miller's other two films (SUNNY, SALLY). The rich young girl who works with her condemns her with family, complications and lasting consensus. All four music numbers accumulate at the beginning of the film and we go long without music. Miller BABY-I hear you think and restructure LIVE. There are also no blue ones and you will not be the first. <br /> <br /> Miller here is very attractive and enjoyable, Irene Dunne reminds us of the way and delivery. Sad does not dance, this is his desire. SALLY continues to be his best movie, the second level of the second level, and the relatively poorly-graded SUNNY runner. Life shattered tragically before hospitals and antibiotics prevented from contamination. Watch this movie worthy of watching the hero of Ziegfeld in the twenties.
