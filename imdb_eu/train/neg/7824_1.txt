I watched the movie at the weekend and I liked it. The forecasts of the film rose and fell when I heard that it was made. Sometimes I could see something spectacular and I could be disappointed for a few days. <br /> <br /> However, I'm a fan, I had a great hope for this movie, but I was very disappointed at the end. <br /> <br /> While I love movies by Richard Donner, I do not like the changes made to the nature of the alien or to Superman and its powers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Singer chose the worst elements in Donner's movie and put it in its own version. <br /> <br /> While his Lex Luthor is somewhat darker, there is still nothing more than a cone and an ordinary criminal. Gene Hackman is more intelligent than he did when he acted. Kevin Spacey does his best to play Luthor, but ultimately he will immerse himself in misguided writers and conversations without conversation. <br /> <br /> Henchmen are two-dimensional, even though they are more than the comic sequence. Most of them literally do not have a conversation in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS AHEAD **** Mrs. Kitty Kowalski is the same person as Mrs. Tesmacher. It looks like Lex Luthor is just as bad and frivolous, but Superman worsens and unexpectedly shows Luthor after watching. <br /> <br /> The biggest feeling of Frank Rei was Frank Langella. Perry White. I did not like Donner films like Perry White, but he's at least one soul. In the end, he said and did, he was a veteran reporter who cared for the author and his good story. Langella is just the origin of the Perry White corporation. Superman wants to concentrate on the storytelling, because they sell articles while doing any other paper. It does not matter real stories, real mysteries like blacks and what Lex Luthor is outside of prison. <br /> <br /> As for Langello, the worst is DULL! Some actors may be quiet and simple, yet they let them know that they are not too deep water. Frank Langella is a well. <br /> <br /> Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. It's okay, but there's only one memorable movie again. It's not the fault of the actor. Its movement seems like exquisite, as the toe causes its slightest movement to fly. But it still seems choreographed and artificial. <br /> <br /> Lacked by Lois Lane was very impressed by Kate Bosworth. Sadly, again, the Pulitzer Prize for journalists and writers, is just as eloquent as a teenager of Dawson's Creek. <br /> <br /> James Marsden was the favorite actor of my whole movie, especially since he looked like Superman, even Routh. He does not know the message of Lois Lane without the superpowers, he puts an airplane, arrives at Luthor's pack and saves Lois and his son. <br /> <br /> The only momentous moment in the movie is that all the caught food is melted with water and the ship sinks. You see that they will be immersed in the water. You know that Superman will come in the future, but you still can not help feeling. <br /> <br /> <br /> As I said, the plot is very strange. As opposed to Singer, this is not a movie that is trying to get back to a superhero and trying to find its place in the world. When he returns to the world, he opens his arms to the world. Lois is only happy again. Although it is due to the possibility of recovering the opportunity for a steel man with Luthor Superman. <br /> <br /> Superman thinks he is one of the most stupid heroes in the universe. A large part of the museum's meteorite is stolen, Lex Luthor is out of prison, he now knows the powers and weaknesses of Superman, and he still can not use Luthor kryptonite against it. <br /> <br /> According to the movie, Superman's only thing to do is lift things really heavy. The sequence of actions is very predictable.
