After reading some very good reviews on this film, I thought I'd give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the movie, I thought I'd give it my opinion. This is my first evolution with me. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would move the fear of the genre into a genre, in any case not terrifying or scary (except for a few to avoid it). unfortunately one of them jumped for me.) I would say that I was encouraging this movie to be calling a thriller, I was not particularly happy! The movie is about a broken girl who dissolves several times. He visits the house he is drawing at this time, decides to add something to his home after each visit, a bit of a life, a small boy in reality. As long as the boy is friendship, he realizes that the world that creates his imaginary world is much better than it really is. Father continues to father his house until he is constantly adding that his father is wrong and his being bad. and the boy must flee from his claws. <br /> <br /> Think of it as being a bit slower version of A Nightmare On Elm Street but it's like a trip to the beach. <br /> <br /> As a result, my generous 3/10 will stop at least one of you when you see this brave!
