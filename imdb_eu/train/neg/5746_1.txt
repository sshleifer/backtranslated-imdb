The worst film that is currently distributed! I love zombie movies and I've seen them in the tray used, so why not? Oh my god a zombie movies and fans for the genre! Anyone who has made this movie has to cancel the channel and go to film school! There are so many gore dogs that have put some time and effort into the film and they have something that is not worthy of this film. I know what to do with movies and I'm sure why and there was a lot of money to be spent on Meat Trade, but no money or time was too good. You need to invest some books, guides, real cameras, how to make independent films. I do not know how you got a DVD release, but that made anyone who is a good friend or hit the head with the head on the wall. Gore films are not quality, the effects are weaker! I was so annoyed that it really is in stores and I can not get any money back. Please, watch this movie here and stop blocking it. I know I'm very hard, when I'm trying to get to the point where I only have 10 lines.
