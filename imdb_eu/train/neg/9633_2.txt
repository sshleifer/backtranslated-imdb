Is Elizabeth Taylor wealthing in the fortress of the Mediterranean island, judging from the Angel of Death, just as excessive or excessive - as usual? Actually, both Joseph Losey's director, called "Boom", is a direct blend of luxury luxurious settings. Richard Burton raises the Hill of Taylor without an invitation; He wore a samurai woven garment. Although this is obvious, this picture is very different, even though Liz's dick-philes was a failure (the collective star "What's the hell!") There was an attack on the career of their 60s. nadir here). "Boom" is a mess, messy and angry, it's a disaster - even Tennessee Williams's scriptwriter, "The Milk Train Does not Stop Here More!" Is said to have liked quite a lot of his favorite plays! * ****
