This is really huge. It could be very funny with cool aliens and the country, but it's just that. <br /> <br /> Some foreigners listen to the flow of World War II when a small country plays it on Halloween. They will come to earth to kill human beings, but instead of killing people become slaves and they do stupidity. On the cover of the film's skin, they show these aliens on top of the board in space, but they do not really do it. These are not aliens party, stupid cartoons are modest voices with loud rhythms. Jack Nicholson is a foreigner with the most tolerable voice and always wears sunglasses. Not only foreigners, the play is horrible. Writing, of course, is for children, because each character is written as a child. <br /> <br /> This is a dumb movie, only for kids who appreciate it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 ****. 100 min. PG soft language.
