The rest of the website comments I had to catch another movie, a movie screening last night, as the viewer was so bent on the conversation (I'm not even joking). As he filed a filmed filmmaker as though he thought he was approaching a bold new territory, when he introduced a homosexual story, the film uses images inspired by David Lynch with the interpretation of Fassbinder. The performances of this film are so boring and boring, as one of the actors would turn off as unmistakable. The worst thing is to be painted like a Miami Vice section. I do not know who the director is; maybe we need surrealist Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all the aforementioned directors show the degree of erudite sensibility here. I could understand the significance of this movie about ten years ago, but we have Bad Eduction, Mysterious Skin and Show Me Love masterpieces why worry this film? There's nothing new here.
