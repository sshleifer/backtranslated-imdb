I like film directed to people. Also, I think Hope Davis is a good job, so I had a great deal of hope for this movie. The expectations were soon cut short. <br /> <br /> The main mistake of this movie is the direction. There are many scenes with different scenes. The character of the film Denis Leary frequently uses Campbell Scott as a variant of the character. It does not work for me. This would work better than a movie as a play. <br /> <br /> There are also problems with the plot. It is important that the characters in a movie trip be different to where they started and started. I do not think the characters grew in the experiences depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> In the end, editing was not successful. It was very annoying to be exceptionally boring in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> I felt effi ciently in the movie except that the movie film failed in almost every aspect.
