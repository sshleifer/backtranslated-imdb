Oh dear. I was so disappointed that this movie was just a source of Japanese Ringu. Well, I think the United States also made a version, but at least it was a new redo. So so sad. I like watching Filipinos movies and I can meet some of the great things I know in a small country, so I can not believe that this should happen. Claudine and Kris are so great names, they would be surprised by plagiarism. Films aimed at applicants in the Philippines: you do not diminish to earn money. There are many Philippine filmmakers who place Filipinos and enjoy them!
