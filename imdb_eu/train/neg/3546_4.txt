Before Spoilers - Follow your watch. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this movie is that after Harry learns about the identity of three shanties - they have relative ease - they are still following their demands. And then he decides to make the whole scene that has kidnapped his wife who wants to explode his classical car (with that money), which requires a fairly high logic. <br /> <br /> Okay, So, Cini wanted to keep in contact with her, as the wife's participation in the campaign DA. I can see this, but why did not you hire someone to give somebody somebody else, or kill them when there is no evidence of their poultry (for example, Cini's body?). The first 2 movie was pretty interesting. / 3 of them. Then it falls.
