How has this been a superproduction? Dear God, I do not know where to start the movie. The movie was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the representation of some characters. The film was very bright, for example, something like lighting. to make the environment darker. The composition of some dead characters seemed like a horror movie. This is 2006! People are not afraid of other people dressed in heavy makeup. Most of the horror scenes from some Hollywood horror movies. Total rip! That's why I have not seen any tags. While watching this movie, "many people" are the only people who "scream". How often do we copy improvised scenes and replace the girl from the television coming from the next window? No matter how you put it, its still a shelf.
