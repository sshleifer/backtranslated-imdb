I liked this movie, but they damaged me a lot. The whole use of the Fishey lens and shaking editors did not feel the feeling of being in the world of methodology, but I think that MTV was watching at a few moments. The movie has never gone anywhere and the performance was a great performance. I love movies that look at the glittering worlds, but this film can not be considered as a horrible film horror or horror about addiction horrors.
