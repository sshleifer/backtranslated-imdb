I have seen Arthur a year ago (TV series and books) and I had never had a favorite show (if you are a fan of this cartoon, forgive me if it does not damage you, but this is what I think). He liked a lot of people, but I did not. <br /> <br /> The children's characters of the school seemed to struggle all the time (especially Arther and DW); I often shared each other, but I was gradually tired of all those who were tired of Arthur and his sister complained to DW (although she was written under her name), and DW was with ADHD (or ADD), just like Arthur's 4-year-old sister, who was sometimes stricken (Why Arthur did, how he was impressed by his habits, as his imaginary friend and his stuffed animals ...), Arthur's friends were teenagers, Arthur's books and parents, but he did not like them. <br /> <br /> The most recent cartoon of Rocko's arturo was not Arturo (no fault).
