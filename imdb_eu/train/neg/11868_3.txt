At first glance, this movie has got everything a psyche wants: a vampire storyline with a "under 18s", full of hyper-violence, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbian sex), some fanatics and even necrophilia. Police! But, then, the movie is a bad story (so thin), a bad performance, a ridiculous English accent, you think you're watching Bad Monty Python, bad music (hard rock in the '80s). , the end is a real shame ... Plus the sex scene is ridiculous, gore is not very impressive. And these vampires are reflected in the mirror and they do not fear for a day! You will be very disappointed if you do not see it as "Space Motocycle" or "Troll 2". I hope that Bloodlust will arrive one day under 100, because this is a real place. <br /> <br /> I would say it's still fun to watch, if you have friends and enough beer. 3/10
