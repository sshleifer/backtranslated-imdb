I do not know much about film making, but good films have to detect a story ... your characters have to start the journey and finish. Last Exit to Brooklyn maybe, but it's not in an unstable way, and I do not have a happy ending, that is, at least. <br /> <br /> The final quit in Brooklyn, a brutal strike in Brooklyn, set in motion in 1952, moves several threads of the story. Most of them feature some of the most popular characters, never walk the screen through the screen. But Brooklyn's Last Exit did not conclude the story ... leaves some of them unfinished, or to end the "artistic" oddest extraction. <br /> <br /> Two cases. At one point, and has spoilers. <br /> <br /> Travestite, a sad character (a character in the film, is important), plays a car and dies. And that's the movie for him ... he's gone well, he's deleted from everyone's memory ... his friends, enemies, lovers and nothing-nothing ... <br /> <br /> In a different thread, the stupid stroke, in secret and by no means, refusing to work, his lover, and the discovery of neighbors, is thwarted by thugs. The closing of the season is on the streets of Brooklyn, and the lights are very similar to the camps of Nazi death ... and the scene is dragging and moving forward ... and the body of this camera is a leading and crucifixed ... ppppuuulleeeeeeez. And, of course, for him too ... the brain's elimination ... has gone. <br /> <br /> Bottom line ... Any reviewer about this movie said in 1989 ... This movie is full of sleepy pieces. Avoid. And if you do not warn, the NC-17 physical, emotional and sexual grade is worth the NC-17 rating ... do not let the teenagers look.
