I Am Curious is really a two-part film - half of it's Lena is the aspect of experimental sex and the other half is the curiosity of its political / socialism. In spite of the intention of the director, both of them do not enter together. The director must be stuck with Lena's romantic side and made a film about politics. Political / war milestones, Dr. King, serious political interviews, breasts and public. The film looks like a fictional documentary than a movie. As long as the sex scenes are not of interest, you will be bored to see this dry film. Unlike many other reviewers, I think that nudity / sex scenes are excessive. If you want to see a real porn, I think it's a better option. All nudity is a great distraction from any plot. I think work has done a great job. Their fragments played a great deal. There are few exceptions that I see in the American films.
