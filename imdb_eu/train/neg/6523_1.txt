Please take a minute of my opinion. FILMS DO NOT EXPRESSLY - DVD VERSIONS ONLY FOR EASIBILITY. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I really want this movie to give you two stars. I would like to say how it might be, from 1 to 10! <br /> <br /> Here's how: Adaptation of the epic movie of Tolstoy's "War and Peace", scenes with historically accurate battles, thanks to the red Army. , and the adaptation of the scene to the scene of the novel would be very faithful and difficult, but it is worth seven hours to be sitting - if that is the case. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the film can not be seen - anywhere I know it. <br /> <br /> I try to see the version of RusCiCo DVD - which plays the very best version available in those lyrics and then retrieves the scenes cut in other DVD releases. <br /> <br /> But, one of the worst movie recordings I have ever seen is transferred to the DVD. The image is muddy and inconsistent, often strobing. It seems your brightness, color, and image levels ... but the problem does not end there. <br /> <br /> The sound is incongruously, noisy, in parts, it's hardly any. inaudible in others. <br /> <br /> And in terms of languages, it is a great problem for English speakers - the duplicate option has good actors, and it only doubles some dramatic reality and performance parts. , Randomly alienated from Russia and even French. <br /> <br /> The subtitle option is not much better. Subtitles are not displayed below the image, but they are above it: it hides the beauty (or parts) of the landscape of the landscape. Also, the subtitles are a bit of a bad translation (so as to approach the real words of the embarrassment of Tolstoy), and subtitles also seem to be part of it. <br /> <br /> So, if you maximize the color, brightness and image settings, and if you make the volume more expensive, * and * dubbed in English, you will still get an annoying movie. watch and hear <br /> <br /> Can this content be exceeded? You may do this, but in seven hours - who can last for a long time? <br /> <br /> Maybe someday somebody will arrive and this will recover - and maybe I'll see a masterpiece - but now I can not give more than one star to see something I see in the first half.
