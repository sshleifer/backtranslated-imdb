Familiar drama is the problem outside of television channels such as Lifetime that most people do not want to see. And those who are under review tend to feel upset and have news (or recent news) about current or topical problems. Films that explain or exploit human conditions are not very popular. Especially young people could be the favorite of Miss Lohan or films that are younger movies, not only popular but financially successful. <br /> <br /> The specific problems of this movie are cartoons. some characterizations All the characters in Lohan decided to attack (car, drug consumption, etc.) that his father-in-law had done about his wife. Although it is not possible, the audience would want to swallow it a bit. In addition, other parties, such as morman young boy, oral sex, or a good assistant to the veterinarian, as well as having a maternal mother, etc. Really helped this movie. He was more interested in the situation of a comedy, as he tried "one of his most dramatic episodes", he realized completely and made a well-written feature. <br /> <br /> Watching the DVD and listening to your comments, especially for alternate endings, you can see all of this sharp focus.
