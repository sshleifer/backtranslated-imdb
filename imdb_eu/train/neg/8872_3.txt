The main payer was not very good. Although everything was funny, somewhere, the story was ridiculous and the performance was inadequate. Payne's voice and nature were particularly annoying. The idea was ridiculous and the things that boys had to do in that film were even more ridiculous. I would not recommend the movie to anyone.
