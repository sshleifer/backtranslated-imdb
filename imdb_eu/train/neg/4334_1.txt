This movie had a potential and I tried to try it, but there are so many problems in the timeline: it's hard to treat it like a fool. <br /> <br /> Power rises at the end of the sixties. Carlito's Way is located in the mid-seventies. To make this film realistic, it should be set in the 1950s, if not in the late 1950s. Carlite said Carlito was running out of "morning's day". One of the main characters of the original film was not in this movie. We all know that Carlito knew all this for a few years. <br /> <br /> With a powerful climb Carlito walked on the beach, besides talking about retirement in paradise, what he wanted to do. in the original movie. In the same way, the predecessor creates Rocco and Earl characters: what happened to them when they happened, is it not clear that Carlito's Way? It's hard to understand how Carlito looks at events in Rise to Power's original movie that may have a relationship with Italians. Where are Taglialucci movies in this movie? Two films may well be seven years old and spend five of them in jail. It's like trying to square a square square in a circular hole. <br /> <br /> It is clear that nobody wanted to tell a good story, and they would like it much more than it by a gangster movie. and throw a character named Carlito Brigante in the story. The film had some good moments, but I'd rather find it better than trying to get in front of Carlito's Way instead of leaving that movie. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this movie, the only advice you can give is to think of a pre-quel linear movie. Think of Clint Eastwood's unnamed man like spaghetti western, that is, both of these films have the same nature but do not necessarily tie together.
