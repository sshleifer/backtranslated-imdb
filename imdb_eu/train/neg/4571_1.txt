What The Bleep Do Know Know The mysteries of the universe is an excited and daring look. We present the paradoxes of apparent-minded experts (one of which is not called) and they punish them scientifically forgot. Their interviews are cut into small and sharp segments and scattered on tiny plots. <br /> <br /> Films, philosophies, theology, and political affairs are pilfers, all of which are guarded with unobtrusive detail. , and then some prosaic and absurd effects that somehow emerge. Quantum physics will lead us to explain our uncertainties about the question of our existence and the directors of the cinema. <br /> <br /> Mistakes and logic is non-sequiturs. How did we start quantum mechanics and pseudo-scientific spirituality and mysticism? 'It's like saying two plus two identical ones, so that I can move objects in my mind'. <br /> <br /> There is no original in this film, and there is almost nothing correct. Disruptive audiences are mistaken for editing, invading and supposedly unique effects and general lack of substance. The tears raised by students will be frustrated by the violence they face in science and for any other issue that touches on this film.
