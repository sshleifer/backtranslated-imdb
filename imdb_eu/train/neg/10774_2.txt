What a stinkeroo it was !!! Linda Darnell was one of my favorites, much earlier in her career, but she was not very shaky but very beautiful and pleasing (especially in the film and "Blood and Sand") but when I saw this monster, His memories of the golden days quickly vanished. The story is incredible and insane, the second stage of acting, a non-contributor. In any case, I do not think any person with Tab Hunter, but he must have been the most boring man to be Donald Gray. In addition, I added a horrible (and not a color) picture. All of them had to be general when they appeared.
