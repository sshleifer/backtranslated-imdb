Like many people, I saw the movie in the theater '97. It was at least the average movie below, as "no" "Titanic" fanboys would like all the likes of a "masterpiece". First of all, DiCaprio is a great actor and does not look at it in any way. Because it looks like people look like it. His active "abilities" are essentially cheaty lines and trying to act sexy. Secondly, the movie itself is quite boring and simple: the girl falls in love with the guy, they are in the pack and then there are a lot of love scenes. Anyone with a QI of over 50 years will realize that this is not a genre. It's not an original He also thought that the director should drag it for 3 hours. I compressed a block of an hour without losing any land. As a result, "Titanic" is currently the most shot film. Why has he got so much attention and money beyond me?
