After the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", a group of directors decided to make a film based on New York-based anthology. Unlike the original movie, the stories in this movie sometimes go faster - when you enter a story, it's been done in many cases. And, it often starts and stops and it starts again - stories are woven. As a result, there is no title that consists of a story and has less structure. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Paris, Je t'Aime" was a hit or miss (mostly) hit), most of "New York, I Love You" were missing. The stories were more sexual, but they were much sweeter, and often awful. The movie was terribly dull and unusual for only some exceptional stories - and perhaps even more depressing music seems more. Now, understand, it has been a good quality music, but its dark shade really really cuts my wrists like me! Better amongst them, the story of a young girl who cast a girl on a wheelchair, a couple who spoke fraudulently out of a restaurant (even in the first movie) and the pair was there. That's so sad because I loved the first movie and wanted to love this movie. I respected what they tried, but I just liked it. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is not really a complaint, but I was surprised how many people were burning the movie. For a recent film, it was common to face our smoking culture. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you get the DVD, you will enter into two segments as the extras that are not included in the movie. Beat Kevin Bacon (cool dressed in fedora) with hot rolling ... and completely NOT last for ten minutes. The other is a teenager who films a movie world, including a very unhappy couple.
