Well, a person "why does not he remember this movie?" It's really because many people did not see it in 1978 and have not seen much since it appeared on TV. (If the videos were for me news!) During the 70s, some of the giant comedies, the film director intended to avoid this film. Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers "many" do not love. <br /> <br /> Here, Paul Lynde was more fun on "fun" or "Hollywood Square". He was laughing at Karen Carpenter, who was laughing at his career with Joan Rivers, in a joke that was lacking. Let's go! Similarly, it seems that all the famous "somewhat" names of that period seem. (The most amazing is Doris Roberts later, "Everybody Loves Raymond.") <br /> <br /> However, being a good idea for a story, a woman is pregnant instead of a woman. With the help of a friend of Crystal, Crystal is in the process of enriching the virginity, but because he was "overboard" he was pregnant! (Women's comments on women's positions in power). <br /> <br /> The crystals stomach grows, crosses all emotions and related feelings. Sadly, today's society is misunderstood. A multitude of people who have been attacked (I think). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Or, if you want, a manger (God only knows where he can go! Ewwww!) It turns out (there is no shock) having a girl! <br /> <br /> In addition to this movie, it should not be overlooked, the humor school is small or smaller. <br /> <br /> 2 star ideas for good ideas and some memorable moments. / Billy Crystal. Not only ignore the rest of Rabitt's test, it opens up a lot of time! <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Roddy McDowell has signed! (END)
