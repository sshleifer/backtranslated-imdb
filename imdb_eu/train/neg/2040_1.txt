This is the worst film ever I've ever seen. I'm not overly sorry, I told the Blockbuster guy that he had to get out of the shelves. The only thing that is interesting about this movie is the box. From the box he says "boogeyman director", so it seemed to me ... whatever, if it had been done recently, at least the pieces would not be too bad: - but after watching the movie and what they were talking about "boogeyman", look at the 1980s At the beginning of the decade he made nonsense. A great way to get rookie audiences accessible. <br /> <br /> I use them, I think they liked the name "Zodiac Killer", and they did not investigate the real crimes of Zodiac or their MO, or even more. He has been active for years. Every crime they talk about is unrelated to the zodiac, and "stories" about the original zodiac occur a few years after the Zodiac crimes. They compare the "Vampire of Dusseldorf" with the Zodiac, Fritz Haarman, and often speak of Fritz's "son". Zodiac and Haarman did not have anything similar, and it is reasonable to compare it with BTK, who also shot people, not killing people, chewing the neck through the neck. One of the factors in Haarman is not just correct, in a confused nonsense. His son also says "Do not forget, his name was Fritz Haarman 2 t's" ... It's just his real name! I think the search for serial killers was only written by writers / directors of google and created by Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. "These names seem like fresh names, let's make out about these films without any further research! Great idea!" <br /> <br /> Perhaps my favorite coherence in this movie is a way of experts and young people. The murderer describes the suffering of DSM-IV and is healing. "I was diagnosed with DSM-IV and I've recovered since then," and so on. Amongst those you do not know, the DSM-IV is a psychological manual for mental disorders. Anyone who suffers from the book, has serious problems! Haha <br /> <br /> Anyway, in my opinion, this is the worst film in the list of my time, and that's strange that the movies will reach that point. But if you are interested in watching the story of the series killers, you're not interested in seeing a real story that is not boring and not quite rational, I can say this movie. <br /> <br /> ... Oh, and I liked that you like the murderer of the "twin" killer "was frustrating." Nice touch ...
