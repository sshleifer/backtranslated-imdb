If you're a fan of Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal and Bill Cobbs, you do not need Billy Burke, Coolio or any other distractions. Massive talent is totally wasted on "Three Days to Vegas". My neighbor's holiday film is as interesting as the mistake of making this video game worse. If you want to see how to use the old cast with a good script, check out "The Crew". There really is not recalcitrant factors here, and seeing wonderful actors fighting against these is a crime. I liked it, but the superficial script scampers the audience, basically doing nothing to the actors. - MERK
