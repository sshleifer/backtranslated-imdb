Plots are so manipulative, counting on all credible and unimaginable decisions of their parents. The children are terrific because of the charm and division of lines, but as I said, the whole plot is all the people idiots, and in that case, their actions are more sensible (and at the same time all this). It is the only way to explain all the mistrust of the boys. Why would you immerse yourself in the charming boys to get the baby out of the sea? How did the baby arrive at the shore and at the same time the place where the search was made? Why would not both boys be informed at the same time that a baby is missing out at the same time, and that no one gives a picture of them along with their food and drinkers, all that excitement and literally everywhere else? There is no justification for the viewer to ask for this. Thinking about an absolute trial (though not formal) is overwhelmed.
