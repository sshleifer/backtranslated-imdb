You know what you get when you buy a Hallmark card. Sappy, trite verse and that's $ 3.99, thank you. You'll get the same thing with a Hallmark movie. From here Ernie Borgnine retire at the age of nineteen, precisely because we did not think he was dead. Little Ernie, Ethel Merman, married a few years ago, is a poorly married soul and the marriage lasted for a few weeks. In this flick, Ernie's feet jump first and portrays grandparents with her grandmother's length. We've seen it before. You can enjoy this movie, but do not say that you have not warned.
