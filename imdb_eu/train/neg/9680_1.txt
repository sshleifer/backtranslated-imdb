Greenaway is disgustingly disgusting audiences. This movie is incarnate, and it does not make any nonsense with a temporary incident. This is the main problem in Greenaway. She prefers hairstyles to start doing something really meaningful. Technical skills are not enough. He does nothing but blasphemy.
