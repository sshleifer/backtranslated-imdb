It reports a heavy sexual assault, along with some unpleasant radiation (including the use of a broom) half of half of the most renowned boarders in a school in Glen Ridge (New Jersey) is opposed by the student's "backward" student. (Heather Matarazzo). Case investigation and construction is distributed in the office of DA, where Ally Sheedy and Eric Stoltz are in charge. <br /> <br /> Glen Ridge in the case, rumors that spread through a middle-class neighborhood. where people jocks worship every community. (A father is a police lieutenant.) Nobody thinks Matarazzo. "Our boys would not be able to drop such a slut into the basement, never raped and sexually ill." The question is to create a solid case that Sheedy and Stoltz can ever do to get them to trial. Matarazzo is not an appropriate acknowledgment. He is desperate for love and friendship, and that is why he can easily help his false friends deceive him with fraud. A slimy reporter says: "You can trust me," but it turns out that the reporter can not trust. Another classmate, a girl who is very popular at school, is Linda Tripp Matarazzo, who is looking for her grandmother, but she plays her main questions about the incident and records the results! In this way, seeing the story is seen in a rolling coaster. At first, Sheedy and Stoltz seem to be the right case. But the community is organized against the law. Then it looks good again. The journalist then interferes. Subsequently, this obstacle is overcome, Linda Tripp plunges his nose into research, and publicly places Matarazzo's lien as a lie. (Well, he was really lying, but he was lying to his questioner to please him). It overcomes it, but Matarazo looks at the stand that he does not want to be a feature of being "backward". Eric Stoltz is well on the part of the prosecutor. I say that, for the sake of reason and I lived in Pago Pago at the same time. (I expected the boy was not in a Seaside Club bar. If that was the case, I did.) Ally Sheedy is a curious actress and it's hard to describe it. He did a wonderful job in "Fine Arts", but I did not feel any specific effort in this task, but it was a formula. I mean, no one, Stoltz, could not give a comic book story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Producers and directors made sense to choose the role of the victim Heather Matarazzo. The worst thing he could do was throw away the blonde and eternal red. Matarazzo, however, is ugly, it is clear that this ordinary quality is made up of grooming and make up. Writers do not turn their hearts and anything. She has a great love and she is angry at times, all that is good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Matarazzo's character is the best in the film. Jock are stereotypes. Mere evil They believe that, above all, they are part of the celebration of a beautiful girl in East Orange, a place that is much worse than a "Dolce Vita" party in a party, and left unexplained and barbaric in the trash. They deserve to get rid of the neck - and they do it. <br /> <br /> I mentioned this as a comic story and that's quite a lot. Our prejudice is not challenging. He believes that he believes in the truth and evil in the world. And we have no doubt about who it is. What I expect is not real, it's just a rhythm, a movie like this and a dozen other movies, but the victim collects LYING and photographs on paper and collects everything. A chip similar to right thinking is like us. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on a real story, we have seen all the others, as well as fictional functions. (Eg, "Acusados"). Some are good, some have a routine. Okay Enough Now, we can see the movie about the case of Tawana Brawley, where the young girl had disappeared a few days ago, when she had to cancel her friends, bind them and dirty them with dirt, so she could say that she was raped and raped by the police? Now, this is simply not a challenge.
