I am a fan of Michael Madsen, it is necessary to buy this movie and I have not bought it anymore ... This movie was horrible, I did not return to the store, I did not want anyone else, I did not give it to this human poison, I just rolled it to the trash, money No matter, the price deserves to be thrown out. The performance was not bad, it was not good or nothing. It was a great story, and it was something I overestimate. He was a little alcoholic man. His life was a bundle of garbage. I thought his horse, peanut, was a great device to show his innocence of childhood, would be a much better dog. I hate religion, so definitely, this end upset me. Heals all Jesus ... I hate that people like this know that they are great Christians and Catholics, and that time does not mean that the god does heal or nothing. The movie has been awesome if it's a chance to see it, spend it, or buy it better or rent it, and leave it in the trash and leave the coffee to leave it in the morning.
