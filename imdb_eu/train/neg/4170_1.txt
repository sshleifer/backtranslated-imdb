This is simply flat unwatchable. If somewhere else has a story, it is so deeply buried, beneath terrific characters and a cramped camera. Well, there is a vampire hunter team doing their stuff, and vampires kill foreigners. They pulled their heads out and spoke like Speedy Gonzales. As a cowboy dude you can imagine if a puppet of a horror puppet is covered by blood and rumor, you will get that. People are loud, shy, violent, and very annoying. Then there are some human beings, the CGI spacecraft is enormously pompous and impossible. These people seem like Hillary Clinton's right-wing extremists. Those who look after or take care of vampires with friends. <br /> <br /> Next, it's the camera's work. Do you remember how everyone hated the latest asylum-milling Rolleball remake? People who made this movie LOVE stuff. Here's enough to make three MTV nu-metal videos. <br /> <br /> Nuffek said. This is the smell. Comparing, Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
