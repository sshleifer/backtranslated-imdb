Where do i start The title of this movie I expected a certain degree of authenticity, I ended up dropping off. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or Lili Marlene; It's Hollywood (or film) based on real-life characters. I should have had a clue when I heard the German movie I heard a heavy English accent; The red blood text (title, artist) should be the second track. The story line is formed (Lale from Switzerland, Rolf Liebermann's parents were not deceived, Lieberman was not supporting the German smuggling of the Jews, since the original song was recorded outside the control of the NS regime, but it was not recorded at the station when Vienna was called Vienna, lying down, etc. ) Costumes were bad and bad for periods of time (where all the SS uniforms were used in the frontier guard positions of workers, those who left the war once used, etc.), the characters are stereo types (SA offices are basically out of a club when they were). Do not waste your time.
