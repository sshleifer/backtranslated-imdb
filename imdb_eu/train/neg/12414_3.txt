Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are superb who represent a different nature of siblings, but Winningham can only convince her or her role. Leigh, bar-band singer and alcoholist Sadie Flood play, continually leans six Georgia, folk singer Joni Mitchell older. Perhaps due to its double role as a co-producer of the film, Leigh appears to be in the corner: the singer is not credible, and although this is intentionally, the screen is too much time. microphone It is possible to get a de-force on the wheels, Leigh wire drawing and nervous and sharp lines; However, we do not see any talent within this character (Leigh is, of course, a strong actor, but the decision that he takes here removes us). Although Sadiek had the least karisma or appeals, he might be able to buy in the concept of fractures (small). As it happens, the risk of rising on stage is low. The director Ulu Grosbard will perform dramatic sequences and, during the last edition, Sadie's bar-performance shows the unexpected show of Georgia: he sings the song and it's a wonderful moment ... but really. Underline? * 1/2 ****
