What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Once a great director, a blazer ... now he is going downstairs ... Is this the same man who has directed the "Show the latest image"? Here, he takes a pretty interesting premise (even if he strives) and transforms him into a gum that loses his taste for the first split ... Dunst is not bad, but Izzard has Chaplin, and all other actors have their "appearance" They cast them out because they were not correct. Bad. "Paper Moon" rent again.
