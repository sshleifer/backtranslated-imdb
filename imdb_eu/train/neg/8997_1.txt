This is the worst movie ever I've ever seen and the exception of the "Hitler's Brain" that I've ever seen, the worst movie I've ever seen. When this movie came out, I was a fan of SNL and SCTV, so I thought the TV show would be the funniest movie that was no limit to the limitations to face. <br /> <br /> Writers thought that we should throw some loads of loverness, jealous jokes, cheaper sex, and hate a dangerous side in a dreadful comedy. Gambling shows are not supposed to offer any presumed gifts. The single-spouse husband and his boyfriend was a humorous high school. Sunsame Street was a touch of humor. The LA subway scene was a bland, bloody humor. In French House, "there is no difference", he was a French chef who is constantly around the blind, you'll get my point. <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase's only fortunate game lasted for a whole minute. This means that in this movie you get 60 seconds of entertainment. Yes, I have read comments that have surprised us all over the country of the 70's and you will like this movie if you're tall. Well, most of the countries in the 70s did not stonemate. If the impudent writers were stolen, they should be on top of medication. In the theater there were 4 other people, when I saw this movie. Of course, the word was not yet filthy how bad it was.
