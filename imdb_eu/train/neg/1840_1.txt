This "comedy", which I have never seen in my life, must be brutal. Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Walken, I can not laugh at homeless men? Something must be wrong with this image. This is the only movie I have ever released. I used free crossings and I still wanted to get the money back. Undoubtedly, I can say the only movie I've ever seen is CASA DE LA MUNA. The. ONLY worse movie I scattered it in the joke a bit, and that's it. Spending 2 hours billed as a comedy will take you to something more than a laugh, right? I do not know, filmmakers believe that the word "flan" was funny or something. And the other running of the bulls is really against the dead horse - literally.
