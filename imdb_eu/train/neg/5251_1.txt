This proclaimed "Talented Artist" XXI. She has easily managed the worst Spanish film of the century. Emotion, consistency, rhythm, skill, lack of humor ... It repeats the same situation repeatedly. The character is not developing. It does not show any violence or sexual content, and does not add anything to the psychosorist sub-genus. So lame cinema should be shown in the first film as an example "what's not done". <br /> <br /> Where is "talent" fish? they are almost seated; There are two scenes with two or more shots, and it is very hard to jump in the movie without having to jump into one shot event. The camera is almost never moving, as if the fear of "talented artist" feared to show lack of visual abilities. The actors that play the main roles act like amateurs, and cast support is not compelling. There are more holes than ever before (if it had never been) ... <br /> <br /> True, boring and talented movie director.
