After watching this film's movie trailer, I thought it was an original concept of a thriller, setting it in a competitive world of computer companies. This movie would probably have been a good star. But I did not see the first week before the release began, then it was missing something that was frightened by the week 2. I was patiently waiting for the DVD book, and then I bought to get away from home to see a nice night. It was better than anticipating the way home. The direction to start is horrible. There is no thought and the director completes a piece of it, so it can appear in the film. I did not use him in the future; I would not escape. Secondly, the main role is like Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe usually likes sweet characters like Cruel Intentions and the Way of the Road, but this is a supposed hero, when he runs and tries to portray his friend, he just does not look right. The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlan have no traits, but they do not do the best of their shows. The most prominent feature of the film is Tim Robbins's role for himself, and the film's temperature is a tough and mysterious way. The last point is another movie that fills the movie with a scene that you do not see on the film, and only appears in the DVD's deleted scenes. It's more disappointing, though some of these scenes are raw, they fill the gaps in the story.
