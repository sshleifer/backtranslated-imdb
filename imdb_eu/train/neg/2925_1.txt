After reading some good opinions and hearing beautiful oral things, I decided to rent Come Undone. I should say I should rather be confessed. The story has been difficult to follow, focusing on short movies that are very badly executed between today and the past. The characters, despite the best effort, have no interest. Sex is more than nudity. I never saw the movie seemed so necessary in the movie. It is a climate-friendly end and leaves many questions unanswered for a story that was not explained at the outset. In my opinion, it's a waste of time.
