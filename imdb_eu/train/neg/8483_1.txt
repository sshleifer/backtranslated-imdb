I just write reviews of films that really hate me or I really liked it. And, probably, I did not like what I was saying about the stars. Until now, I assume that you have read about the plot or maybe you've watched the movie, so I cut the summary. Let's break, pros and bad: <br /> <br /> Control: concept: it was created to be an interesting premise. The use of the theory of chaos was interesting. However, it was not so successful. I'm wrong, but Chaos theory seems to be a bad way. The incident happened more in the film than coincidence. I think the whole Butterfly effect will "bring God (s) into a tsunami statue." The presentation is really inadequate. Some people call this intelligent, but it seems to be another act. <br /> <br /> Storyline: It's just me, or it seems that Kamal pulled together to give him an excuse to play. ten roles? Land very invented; Govind has lost all the flaps in so many times in dark accidents (it only happens to confuse her friend with a packet that is being sent to India, which is thrown into an idol by a crazy lady, who has thrown over half, accidentally in the same hospital and the idol case with a famous singer She was confused. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> CGI: Oi god, CGI. Jaws 3 was worse than the special effects and the suckers. I immediately told the animated parts. The cousin of the year also knows that underwater cars are not like that. <br /> <br /> Tricks: Yes, now Tamil action scenes in the film are not realistic, but their accreditations were awesome and I was really up against the story. <br /> < <br /> <br /> Make up: I must admit, I had a better job than I expected. I thought that Kamal was playing some kind of skin tones, so that two white fake whites and a false Japanese Aikido caught in custody they told you However, it was still bad, I had the masks they told me easily. <br /> <br /> Songs: musical attention and an error in many cases. <br /> <br />> Asin: His character was probably a movie. He was loud, ditsy, and irrationally obsessed about that idol. I think I would die. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Plot holes and refrigerator logic: let me go straight: the laboratory monkey was smart enough to overcome the blocked password door, but there's no way to tell the mind a chocolate bar and a deadly virus. And then, the former agent of the CIA, after bottles, goes to India. Instead of continuing, he married for the first time. The famous Punjabi cancer singer could enter a small urban hospital in the third world and provide the best medical treatment. In addition, it is thrown into the throat with a bullet. It would be a death, but the magic bullet has cleared the tumor. When you read the right, BULLET eliminated a tumor. <br /> <br /> Pros ... Naidu character: maybe the only part of the movie was his comedy.
