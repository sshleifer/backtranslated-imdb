It's like saying the title of this thread. The impression taken from that film Marlee Matlin's character was always angry, so cynical and so pathetic. His first date was dancing with William Hurt's character. In short, I finished watching the movie four times and I slept four times. Watching that movie with a single intention ... I had an insomnia to overcome my problem because I sleep because I sleep. Sweet dream
