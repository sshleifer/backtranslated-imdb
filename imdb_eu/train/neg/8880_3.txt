This movie o.k. but it could be much better. There are some terrifying moments, but there are not many of them, so you can watch them again. A few scenes that you can do with fast progress and do not miss anything. The biggest mistake, therefore, is to predict it, which is why I rated it so small. You can see it but you do not expect anything.
