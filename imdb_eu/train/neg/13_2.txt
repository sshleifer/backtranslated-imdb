Poor land, planned violence, only semi-interesting characters. As the writer (one of the stars), he frightened himself, and added fantasy fantasies of drugs and murder to become "hot". From preaching rap and home soundtrack, family conflict, misunderstood, stereotypical and eventually boring. The title has also been done before - The IMDb publishes a HISTORIC CINEMA published in the 2007-2008 issue !! <br /> <br /> Note: We saw it in Showtime, listed in the synopsis of other films. As I walked half way down, I noticed that nobody was covered with police. Another stereotype would be interesting if it happened.
