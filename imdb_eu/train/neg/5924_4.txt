Diana Muldaur is featured on Star Trek for the second time, but this time he is another character. Nobody thinks about it: maybe it was hair. However, this time it is not a recipes of a god (see the previous section), but it is a very popular woman who has magical powers to communicate and watch a Medusa (crazy standard response). Unfortunately, the man who is in love with him is missing out on a few deck cards and is trying to dump Ambassador Medusa (strangely, in a small box) to travel badly. And, unfortunately, Muldayr is not doing well. The next thing happens as a man of mine and when I first saw the episode I saw it, I was quite enjoyable. Seeing all the men on board, Muldaur was quite absurd, and when Spock's activity became tiny, it was pretty bad. Do yourself aside, if you have not seen the show before, select another section.
