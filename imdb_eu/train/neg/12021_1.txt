That might be for me to say it, but it's unfortunately going so far as to date. Check out what you have done so far. They barely exceed 3 star brands. <br /> <br /> Why did I see the movie? 2 reasons Lucy Lawless and Heroes featuring Greg Grunberg. Lucy was outstanding at this movie, her performance is a complete movie. I hope I get a "superproduction" and enter into a bigger league of actors, it's clear that the skills. Greg was not such a typical TV show. <br /> <br /> The movie is classified as afraid. The "horror" is only a short blackout and lasts up to 2-5 seconds with a little blood. Personally I was called "drama / thriller". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But although the story is really interesting, it destroys directing, bad editing and acting (before Lucy). You do not have a real connection to actors, something very important in this story. You just sit feeling down. It's like watching TV a bad soap ... I think TV soap would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> My advice: be it from this movie ... or better for Michael Strogoff. Hurst participates.
