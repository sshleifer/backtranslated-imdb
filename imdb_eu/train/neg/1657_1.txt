This movie was worth five punches for my "hurter card". I saw this in the mid-sixties of Virginia. I only saw it, so I did not recognize it, while I saw it. He was stunned I have ever seen the most ridiculous waste celluloid I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> You know those who reviewed this movie thought it was horrible. I offer you this: if it were so horrible, what was at the box office? End of discussion.
