It's a good movie with my comments. This is a completely SUCKED movie. SUCKED - S.U.C.E.D. Story development is strange. Mia Kirshner has changed an innocent girl to find out about Chick looking for a fun party, to persuade her without reason. In addition, all the actors were too old to be university students. The students seemed to be about 30 years old - you represent the rest. I only watched the first ten minutes and started speeding up to find sex scenes. All sex scenes have no faces, no hurry, and most importantly. All sex scenes are silent, considering how many clothes there were. Please leave yourself aside and save it approximately. Conclusion: Story - 0, Sex - 0, Conference - 0, Score - 0 of 10.
