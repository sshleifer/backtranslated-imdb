A stupid story commonly used by Italo-Western parties, missing logic and logic, stupid stories, actors, dirty settings, drunkenness and dying people on a massive scale. <br /> <br /> This is nothing. With Django - At least in the German translation version, this German DVD is called "Adios Companeros" and Macho Callaghan has struggled with Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because he has killed his team (the only survivor). Afterwards, Butch Cassidy and Ironhead are struggling to fight each other, and the gang was split up. With all Ironhead you are fighting, however, because it is the biggest and most daring asshole. Yes, that is, without the intelligence of the story. Hehe Klaus Kinskik's Reverend Cotton is a small role (that's why I bought the DVD). He tries to distinguish between two men struggling in a single scene and "I said the importance!" It tries to dissolve. and another scene won a contest to throw ferrets and secondary nuts - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! <br /> <br /> It is also remarkable that JOE d'AMATO, aka Aristide Massaccesi, made a cinematography - I love this master who is not an exploitation thrash, so it was a "ahahh" for me.
