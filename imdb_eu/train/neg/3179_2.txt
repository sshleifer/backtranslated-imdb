I watched this movie yesterday in a movie. I had expectations of the movie because I like Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book's base. The movie starts well, it seems initially a nice thriller. Although fast, the movie mixes with interesting, never-ending characters and cares for anyone (like Marjoke) and wonderful editing. Big black movies have disappeared, a lot of scenes that jump over and over and that adds to the story a lot of chronology. After losing my story, I've seen the worst ever. It must be said that the film has a lot of explicit sexual scenes, probably watching Dutch movies. It's hard to mention good things about this movie. A third of the audience came out of the theater already in the middle of the movie and I did not hear a nice word when the movie was over. Avoid the movie at all costs. I actually destroyed the faith that I left in the Dutch film industry.
