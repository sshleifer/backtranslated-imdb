Well, I know the answer to that question. Get money! With Cat In The Hat, we have so bombarded ourselves with advertising and merchandise that we think we should have something good about this movie. I admit, the trailer seemed to me bad, but I had to give it a chance. Well, I should go with my instincts. It was the whole piece of Hollywood trash. Again saying that we have tried to say what is good for everything, it must be good. Less than 80 minutes of the movie, aside from the insulted offender, began to start with such a shooting. False attempts have tremendous mood and pastel landscapes. Leaps over the universe without direction or direction. That's right then ............................ yes, I'll tell, it turned out bad! I could not feel that I was watching the SNL "Coffee Talk" whenever Mike Myers opened his mouth. Is the cat being a middle-aged Jewish man? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were not even prizes, but Mr Myers would have to go under a rock to be ready somewhere in Austin Powers for a movie. F- is not a star on a scale of 0-1-1. Save your money!
