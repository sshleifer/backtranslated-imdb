It was the only price I paid for the sale of this movie. Everything that I lost at least was $ 3.00 and it was time spent sitting by this bomb. The crew of continuity was lost by the crew. When the female director and the men of the FBI went to the location of suspected killers, the FBI gave a woman a revolver. When the suspect murderer comes out, the revolver becomes magically automatically. Should a FBP agent be let out by handing out a civil weapon? I do not think so. Xavier is very attractive. It's very bad that R's rating did not look too much. It seems that a movie editor could cut the best parts of the movie.
