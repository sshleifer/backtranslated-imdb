I mean, really ... or, suddenly, I missed my humor or that's really a bad movie. It's totally stupid, ridiculous and not funny. <br /> <br /> Since I saw the preview, I learned that it would be a great movie, I do not think it would be bad. .. <br /> <br /> What happened with the good old days, in any movie that could be found in fun and clear lines? Did the actors not play a fun role to play fun? Now we find such films, Borat, Men Men, Scary Movie 4, where I could not find fun parts! <br /> <br /> Just skip this junk. <br /> <br /> PS (Excuse me in English)
