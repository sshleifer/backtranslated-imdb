Oh, man, how little the seriades fell in 1952! It is a sad thing, that Annie Wilkes (misery) annoyed the type of series. Heroes escaped from the trap, adding the scenes that were not in the previous chapter (and maybe there was not so much, when they say the wicked 7-8. Characters jump), but I think this series has the World Record Footage World. I mean, most stock footage is! And not just from other serials (apparently all bird sequences come from King of the Rocket Men, and fresh "melted rocks" in the second part of "3" are the Adventures of Captain Marvel, but they themselves! "Sequence the whole moon" sequence It's probably the shortest one, it's 30 seconds long and the characters never seem like Earth's atmosphere). 1 Episode Episodes 8 repeats! And Episode 10 is the scene of the previous episodes! (Did you ever ask why MST3K 10, 11 and Did you ever do 12 episodes? Well, they had to stop 9 again, so they did not have to do it all again!). <br /> <br /> You did not start with the science factor! Get ready to see the sun never seen! And their world They can not breathe Moon men? They smoked? <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough, it's too much Talky and stunts (usually the best magazines) are short and far. Visually, Commando Cody (or lemon-shaped ) the helmet is totally ridiculous I'm the only one who feels Rocketeers walked in a cooler way, although they were as bad as the movies (and the man was horrible). A tank-like vehicle is not much better, it seems that some kids have done in Halloween. The only positive thing that you can think about is that the actress plays the hero instead of the domestic muscle (hey everyone represents a right to have a hero, but it is very unpleasant ... <br /> <br /> It's not worthwhile to watch for nostalgia . See captain instead of Marvel. 2/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (BTW, check out the special mention of the Women's Libra pearl).
