In the 80s and 90s, I managed to film theaters. This is the worst movie I have ever shown to the public. It was a movie that was so bad that it was a movie to be an inspirational film. Gregory Peck, too, was not able to take that huge part from far less than half-hearted. Jamie Lee Curtis, in an unusual role in horror film, clearly showed that he still has not learned to play (he is still trying, but not getting much better). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, and here's a spoiler, the nuclear disarmament of the international nuclear will never happen because I'm afraid of kids to play in a small league baseball! Even Nick and The Disney Channel shows are not stupid enough to try to believe that dreck. <br /> <br /> This is not worth wasting when you watch on cable TV. It is not worth the price of the movie rental; it would spend your bucket on the extra micro crisis package offered better to go to another selected movie (because it can be better than that).
