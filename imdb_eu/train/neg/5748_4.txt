I must say I hate this movie. I do not mean Gerard Butler is there. A boring conversation about half an hour ago, I'm really sorry to see all of the people who care about the land, I began to quickly reschedule the scene of Gerry. I really do not know the end, it was bored with that. If Gerry was not there, I probably made one of two things: I slept or turned it off, but Gerry is the bright light of this movie, with most of his first films. If you're a fan of Gerry, do not worry, it's always as brave and as precious as ever, but if you really want to see the plot movie, you need good luck, just keep your milk coffee or soda! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... and that's the casting casting director that he made sense to put Gerry in this movie, even though he had no idea how to write his name!
