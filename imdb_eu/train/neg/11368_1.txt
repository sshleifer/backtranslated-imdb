This film was the most effective one to persuade a Zionist threat to more than one Muslim. And I am a Jew. <br /> <br /> Who will go to the school of journalism? Read an editorial? Freshman year retoric? Alarmist statements, which are presented in a pleasant manner, can be convinced. But by granting the possible arguments against the opposite, there are no feasible solutions (or any) sources and poor sources, the argument becomes an ineffective diatribe. <br /> <br /> And thank you for that - I would not want anyone to give up this racist trace that will leave anyone. <br /> <br /> A good lesson for me - and I hope it's a precautionary story - before you actually read about a movie.
