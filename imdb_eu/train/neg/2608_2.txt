My 10-year-old daughter, Alexandra, writes: <br /> <br /> I thought it was very boring, and I thought it was just a repetition of "101 Dalmatians". I can not wait for the movie. The best part were the credits at the beginning: it was nice and well made. The rest of the movie is not worth it. Thank you.
