I heard that Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barels, Snatch) was a rather stylish movie director, the problem is perhaps stylistic. Basically Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released from prison after being solitary for seven years, and in two years he loads his money. Jake was sent to Jake to send him to prison for revenge against violence. D 'Macha (Ray Liotta). In the process, doctors say Jake has three days to survive as a rare disease, and Mach is attacked by men. Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) borrowers are stunned by Jake paying money and doing extravagant work. The movie tells Jake through some flashbacks, and I think that, over the last three days, Zach, Avi and Macha's great revelation. Together with Terence Maynard as Paul, Andrew Howard Billy, Mark Strong as a novice, Francesca Annis Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith Doreen and Elana Binysh Rachel. They are sequences with little animation, the lines repeat twice in different views, and changing the speed for a few moments, all of which are irritating and irritating, is a crime dragon. Pretty bad
