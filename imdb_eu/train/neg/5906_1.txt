This movie was horrible. He sucked the land, the performance was bad, the edition was not there, and I want to throw the movie out. I had time to see this film again. The balloon scene was stupid, Mormon jokes were very old, they sucked the soundtrack, I did not see chemicals between the two chemicals, it was full of stereotypes, the local stupid "celeb" coffee ... I was guided by the "most", as I would like quickly. .. "stupid computer. The worst part is that these actors should play in the spiritual aspect, and that also diminished. This movie helps LDS beliefs to create darker-looking efforts to Hollywood. For example RM, Church ball, etc. Etc. I would like to see this movie and first insert a head into the brick wall. You will be more entertaining than seeing that bad excuse to see.
