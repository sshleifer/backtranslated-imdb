It was a big screen in the US television series for the seventies. It's pretty fun, but it was a lot of formula. Intelligent Martians encounter Earth and human beings that are not very bright. <br /> <br /> Common dizziness is caused by human beings, the bridge connects them eventually and helps them to get home. On the way, the girl also succeeds Hannah. <br /> <br /> This is a nice outing to some Hollywood stars I have not seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> If you do not have the time to enjoy it, you can not get any better.
