Sorry but it's terrifying. I have been told by some bad deeds about this film and some people and they hardly believe me. With this idea nothing is wrong; Japanese modern-day troops must retreat at the time of the Busido warriors and almost everything that comes with modern weapons. When the first troops realize that something strange happens, every person in the back of the car should say "Hey stop my stop"? Imagine if these lines do not play more than 15 times, and the movie is not lacking in grandeur.
