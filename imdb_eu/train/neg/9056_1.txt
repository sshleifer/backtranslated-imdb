The movies they often swore in my life, but this should be the worst. Certainly 100 material below (imo, that is). <br /> <br /> We continue with two pairs, Dodds (as Billy Bob Thornton Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson Darlene) and Kirkendalls (as Patrick Swayze Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) to go to Reno. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <em> Lonnie </ em> . Roy, on the other hand, does not make sure that this sperm is good if a physician checks it. <br /> <br /> Now I read the back of the DVD, but the girlfriend did not do it and it was about 20 minutes: "yes, it will end up with pregnancy but the husband can not have any child." In that place, because the movie was planned. It's boring. And annoying. Nonsense Offensive Amazing. <br /> <br /> This movie is the smell. Both couples started their car in Nevada, when two police officers were stopped, as they were not stopped at a stop. The boys know each other and, finally, the two officers are bribe with a beer case. This scene is not only meaningful for the movie and is not important (or most importantly), it lasts for about 5 minutes! Simply talk and talk only without going anywhere. <br /> <br /> I still think of an end to puke. It seems Roy does not have trouble getting his baby's dad. How many times does this happen in the movies ... try something new! The fraud wife finally forgives the husband and best friend for having an affair and luckily they all live. Yuck <br /> <br /> The best movie scene is at the end, with a couple of grand Canyon shots. Why could not they keep that camera for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> They would be expected more from such a cast (though Thornton really tries), but you can not really blame it. Writers, shame! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1/10.
