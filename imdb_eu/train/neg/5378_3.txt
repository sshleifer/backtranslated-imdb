I did not see much waiting for this movie, I received it in a pack of 5 movies, all of which were quite awful at about a week, and what can I expect? And you know I was right, all were awesome, this movie has some interesting points (and few of it) with interesting points, it has a pleasant touch from the camera perspective, it's like a dummy, which is wicked and annoying. Well that's really, the problem is just so boring, I could just assume that it was an attempt to build tension, nothing happens very much and it makes it completely tedious (I've had my finger fast in the Forward button, the movie but it's been given free) and a serious series is a wonderful band singer, they do not mention half how beautiful it is hell, I thought it looked a bit like this, and I did not even mention the murderer; I do not enter, it will not appear. In any case, as far as Star and London are concerned, it's the only reason to see it and except London's (it's really fun), because they did not have an active talent, I've seen a lot worse, but I've seen a lot better. Best avoid when you see your dry paint if it does not get bored.
