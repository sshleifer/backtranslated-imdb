"Fred Claus" somehow prevents this year's "Santa Clause" from making Tim Allen a bit more entertaining than that, but does not mean that it's enough to travel to the theater. <br /> <br /> When the holiday movies go, it looks like it's sentimental. But, in fact, this may be the worst worry as "Fred Claus," boasting David Dobkin ("Shanghai Knights" at the head of "Wedding Crashers") has a fun time at a really fun time. The splendid vehicle of Vince Vaughn and the fuzzy Christmas movie. In the end, both are not many. And Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz and Kathy Bates make up a cast, especially disappointed. <br /> <br /> Fred, Fred (Giamatti) is a younger brother and unknown by Vaughn. He left his parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock) once and for all to pay for his younger brother. Nick grows up as a Santa Claus (and as the voice tells you, time you and your family get frozen when you become a saint), while Freda becomes the owner of Yuletide-jaded Chicago repo man. Wanda's birthday (Weisz). <br /> <br /> He has a direct problem and called his little brother (he was apparently less than a decade) to get out of prison. Nick agrees, but only accepts support in the Toy store business for the North Pole. Fred admits with enthusiasm, but with his cynicism, the clashes with Santa and the elves, who are constantly cheering on him, even though proven efficacy (Spacey) is demonstrating the operation of the toy factory, he may be happy if these things fail. /> <br /> The film, as it has been said, has its own moments, but it lasts for a long time. Inside, they are among the pile of Christmas topics that were better managed by "Elf", and sentimental sentiments are as compelling as the fruit of the past year. <br /> <br /> As usual, Vaugnen has a bold charm. at the desk, but Dan Fogelman's scripts really do what he's doing. Giamatti, a bad flea under the garment, brings an iconic old charm to his iconic nature, but unfortunately, he must play Fred's second position. Spacey takes her face on the game, but her turn is usually as inviolable as the endless one. <br /> <br /> Eventually, "Fred Claus" is an unforgettable movie that falls under those who participate. Surely, there are worse ways to start the season in the cycle, but they are certainly much better.
