All the participants (and the audience) "The Candidate" should look for the good news about this movie. What happened to the South American story? What were you thinking about how Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw make their role as a cardboard cut? I've liked Gene Hackman's performance and / or all of the films to date. He was either disinterested (which I hardly believe) or is terribly confused. Richard Gere also liked it (and that's why I released it). But here he had no "power". She was never afraid and occasionally compelling. Eventually I was very disappointed. I really expected so much of this director and cast. If you can not find "Candidate" again "Wag dog" or "Bulworth" again.
