... and this is the movie. I think there is a negative life, damned by the souls will be tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch the movie in a constant loop of eternity. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe it's not so bad, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen with "Manos, Fate of the Hands" and I've seen a lot of bad movies. believe me <br /> <br /> This B is just a short film, one of the worst (or worst) of the best films? I really did not like it, it's a pair of comedians about this movie. relief Nowadays, a small comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the films focus on the adventures of these two oxen, rather than the "heroes" of this film, because there is less time than it. <br /> <br /> To be honest, Crown International actually destroyed the movie, adding bad music and editing the work. But in fact, initially it was a bad movie, so Crown could not do so much. <br /> <br /> This should be on the top 100 list. I would not want this my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> Actually, my B is a short film. It was bad, but I still liked it, despite being my star value.
