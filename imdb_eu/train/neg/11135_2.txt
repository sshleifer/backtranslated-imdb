What else can I say? The play, without exception, was amateur. Management and continuity were wonderful. Sceenplay was predictable until the last scene and tedious conversation. One of the functions of the DVD was called "Gag Reel", but most of the viewer could be a description of the audience's reaction. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest things was the comments of the director. DVD. He later said that he wanted to make a great production movie, and with the title, and that was achieved. Understand that such enthusiasm to understand how the movie has happened. <br /> <br /> Maybe the worst part was the monster. Darkwolf's suit was a monkey replacement (based on the features of the DVD) and he only looked at it. The mask and claws were slightly better than those of a beauty salon. The CGI effects were clearly highlighted and similar to a quality video game.
