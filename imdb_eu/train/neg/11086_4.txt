As it goes with Spaghetti Westerns, I would place it in the sad side of this genre of This Man Can not Die. It's not a movie that is particularly bad, but I do not know the brightness and brilliance of other SWs I've seen. Guy Madison makes his best head, but his charism in the screen is missing. With a notable exception, the rest of cast is not particularly good. The direction is inspired and offers few moments that I have not seen before. Not too excited. <br /> <br /> The exemption I mentioned is from Rosalba Neri. It is a clear witness to this mediocre movie. Unfortunately, the screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: This man can not make a bad IMDb for a month) Rosalba Neri plays Jenny Benson, Melin is a character. I do not know anyone can deal with Rosalba Neri as a man who has been mistreated by a man named John Bartha, listed on the IMDb credits. )
