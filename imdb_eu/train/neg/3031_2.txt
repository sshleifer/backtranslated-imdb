Tony Scott was very interested in Richard Kelly's kidney record. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model that turned out to become a model. This is his story ... "somehow." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Harvey's chaotic life makes us indifferent. <br /> <br /> You do not mind Harvey. Knightley acts as a rough lump that has not done anything that he does not respect himself. When people do not like punching and throwing away clothes and inhibitions when they ask for this situation, nothing is real and Knightly is not convincing either. <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is boring. Well, well, and for a long time I've heard that the music of the sources I've heard is stuck with one of the rarest. For the last twenty minutes, thanks to the bizarre Scotten "True Romance", we will meet two friends who will meet two of the two Domino teams: surprise! surprise - In order to get together at the top of Las Vegas casino. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this vibrantly-flamboyant conflagration makes Scott completely frustrating and becomes a confusing and nonsensical exercise in celluloid masturbation. . This is not a brave or experimental piece of art; It is a failure at all levels, since the life and dilemma of the characters does not give the point of entry. <br /> <br /> Mickey Roarke is as good as a hunter of reward, but in the background he goes away with the "narrative". Chris Walken turns a shame on him and Dabney Coleman, who is always strong, rarely uses it. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by a multi-layer layered surface. The shelf is still not considered pocket.
