101 drama of the live remake of Disney, remake of. Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) has been released from prison, after a doctor named Pavlov, a psychologist, tightened himself after "healing" (ugh!). But "cure" breaks when he hears the headmistress of Cruel Big Ben and, once again, he seeks to find the head of the dalmatian coat to make it perfect. At many different levels, the movie "Thanksgiving family schlock" is designed to absorb everything in the Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close plays like Cruella. With everything he has endured in this movie - a tight screenplay, an endless make-up, a cake at the end - I expect that he will pay a huge salary. <br /> <br /> (Speaking, where you will find a bakery factory in the world, a Rube Goldberg assembly line, and a light-emitting restaurant located in the same building), at this momentous movie?) Of course, the true stars of the movie are supposed to be dogs They have it. They work on "Macaulay Culkin" in this movie, "The only one in the house" has erupted all the gags. (Dressed among them in the crotch, running hands with trolleys, freezing, etc., etc., etc., etc. Nauseum.) I must admit, dogs have been quite successful actors. humans <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is completely wasted as a horrible movie Frenchman. The "dog-lover" retrieved from previous films - with two different actors - is completely boring. When they make spaghetti suppositions at an Italian restaurant, the movie is cut between two lovers, and their dogs at home, watching the scene of the "Lady and the Tramp" dinner. I thought: "Please, do not go there!" I especially expected humans to satiate their seats in the "Lady and the Tramp" - as Charlie Sheen did in the "Hot Shots: Part Deux" movie, pushing the sidewalk with her nose began to "spaghetti strand kiss". , etc. <br /> <br /> And do not start the annoying role with me Eric Idle's voice. <br /> <br /> Wardrobes were nominated for an Academy Award and the costumes of the film * are good. But they are the only thing in the movie. The rest is a cow that is sustainable.
