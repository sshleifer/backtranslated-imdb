The successful 1970s movie did not live well, but it was not good when it was released. However, it was a successful nation, perhaps because young fatalist love attracted public attention from the Viet Nam War. Oliver Barrett IV, a privileged Harvard hockey player, is in the plot, in love with Jenny Cavelleri, a Vassar music student who is proud of his work class. Jenny puts her father in her old school naturally, and in ordinary rebellion, it means that the pair are constantly married to the young people at the hippie era. New York draws on his dream job, but accidentally gets sick and dies at his terminal illness. There is a cover of contemporary film techniques filmed by director Arthur Hiller, but it is not possible to hide the story of old and old stories. It was unavoidable for me to end the end of it. <br /> <br /> Both O'Neal and Ali MacGrawk became stars with Oliver and Jenny, but they are incomprehensible, so they do not seem to be able to convey their depth or complexity. strong characters At least O'Neal is honestly honest in his weak challenge, but MacGraw is so woody and noisy, and it's hard to know how Oliver sees what Jamie looks like an impersonal facade. John Marley (two years before he found a small cut in the "The Godfather"), like father of Jenny's baker Phil, makes Ray Milland seem like Barrett's paterfamily seemingly like. The popular French music Lai has become almost parody for years. The quality of the DVD printing is good, though the only add-on comment by Hiller's comments. The strangest curiosity of the author Erich Segal (whose book is based on this) Oliver thought as a mixture of Harvard classmates? Al Gore, vice president and actor Tommy Lee Jones, had a bit of part in the film with Oliver's classmates.
