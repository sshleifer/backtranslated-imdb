This movie was premiered on the DVD in the US, and I was finally able to see this weird jewelry. The "SPASMO" and "BEYOND THE DARKNESS" also came with original previews of "Italian horror classics". Unfortunately, the outlook was the best thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> "ZOMBI 3" is really curiously linked to the evil franchise "Lucio Zuccia", Lucio Fulci. It started in 1979 with the same. "," ZOMBI 3 "is a thin plot and a handful of very bad actors, who keep their" horror "binoculars virtually close. Gore almost does not exist (people who face faces with green herbs are not afraid) and in English it goes through embarrassed duplication <br /> <br /> At this time the plot consists of some hidden military operations with some inanimate scientists (that is, a stupid man and his stupid bad side), that the death animation is supposed to be creating a chemical called "Death One." My ears If they do not have to be checked, I do not remember the "Death One" research question. EXIST seems to have only "scattered" evil souls out of the crisis during this festive movie. <br /> <br /> However, the body of "Death One" It is experimenting (with whom he called "I swear I'm like Yul Brynner"), and after being injected into his system, he stays up and his head explodes! Sound effects are very fun, stalks face With bubbles with green, the sound of "differentiated paper" can be heard. The "Death One" toxin is transported away and the hi-jacked is carried by the thief, but infects himself after cutting himself <br /> <br />. The guy turns into a zombie, but it's not slow before he decides to escape, an attacker infects him and kills a maid while pushing his face into a bathroom mirror (!). The military raises it against it and will immediately take action to eliminate the unfortunate nature of "pollution" and slow it down. They find an infected thief and burn their body, only smoke the smoke of the poultry that flies over the pile (!). <br /> <br /> We enter a group of men. The army is leaving, it is listening to "groovy music", which is extracted from a small bullet, to show off girls hanging out of windows and their boxes. Can someone say "zombie food"? Likewise, we also have a sub-plot that drives a car that leaves a girl and a boy who travels with his boyfriend ... They were contaminated with 'zombie' birds the same birds! <br /> <br /> The birds attack the boy's attack and the girl goes to the empty station to look for water. This is one of the funniest moments in the movie. This old building, dirty, rusty and, of course, abandoned, asks for a walk and continues to cry: "HELLO, HOW MUCH HERE? I WOULD LIKE TO APPLY, BUT ONE SUMMER!" He encounters a group of zombies, one of which is chained to one wall (!) And the other is a mat. When he gets crowded and astonished, he fled, but it is not when the gas station pulls out his power. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, birds are attacking bitch loads and a girl is watching. and infected. They bring the same source of the original infection to the second motel and this is the second funniest moment in the movie. After a few hours (up to one day), the motel itself is dusty, the vines grow inside and for many years it seems to be quite damaged. In any case, what is the best place to get this specific building? Needless to say, the group is interrupting many people when they walk together when they hit the stupid situation of a zombie attack. <br /> <br /> The third funniest moment is a man and a woman. Explore the pure town, and the woman comments: "FIRST STOP DUMP A!" Then a "push" from a balcony causes a zombie to penetrate into the infested water (Pirahna) and get the leg on its leg and make it a zombie for a few seconds! Meanwhile, his slow friend and infected HOURS hotel has slowed down and he's still becoming a zombie! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are too many incongruities in this movie, which films make them stupid. . For example, the rate of infected people is very different. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds, sometimes it takes a few hours. Some zombies run, others drag their feet and slow down. Some also make kung-fu movements, others hide under small lawns to strangle people. Some zombies also speak! The most entertaining moment is the "evil zombie" of the refrigerator, which makes it "rage" in the open air, and the "stupid man" who seeks food is "attacked." Pretty enough, her girlfriend gets rid of her throat with a "non-headed" counterattack (LMAO!). <br /> <br /> For me, there were despair lines. the zombie died We are never seen as returning to zombies; Indeed, we are the only ones who see 'zombified', a girl who is dressed in birds and bites her legs. In addition, I expected that at least one couple who died in the kitchen and / or the bridge was waiting for zombies. It's amazing that these zombies also take 'little bites' and then go to the next victim. <br /> <br /> The most amazing moment was the zombie fetus. A pregnant woman is in a hospital in bed. It seems that a woman with a lot of "knowledge of medicine" wants to deliver her child (!) And a zombie pulls her face before the woman pushes her stomach, bursts her hand and rips her hand. to rest your face Timeless! <br /> <br /> As usual, all the characters are the stereotype of the genre perfect. A megalomaniacal military officer is a pathetic, shameless, crying man who kills some of the awesome characters who kill him (that is, looking after a chicken). This comedy is really a movie. There was a lot of fascinating scenes, such as a cover with a grenade made by hand (of course, the whole budget was spent on the scene) and a man shouts a scene of climate: "I HAVE BEEN ... YOURSELF ... BLOOD!". The dresses are very bad - the same zombies appear again during the film, they are the same as "similar Asian" clothes that can be found in Bruce Lee, and beware of the 60th skirt, the girl at the hotel. When he and his boyfriend are in love with the infected man. <br /> <br /> The story leaves the story as usual in apocalyptic lines. A radio station that tells the story of a film arrives at a zombie and warns its audience at the "beginning of the end" while two survivors are in a helicopter. Almost asks you for the material "DAWN OF THE DEAD". <br /> <br /> In any case, this film gives a lot of laughter. Gore is a little, and what's gore is very convincing, even less unthinkable. The usual blend of black blood, thick green goose and weeping is made up of green muscles and "muscles zombies". "ZOMBI 3" makes a good rental for a party or beer and popcorn for a night. In addition, horror fans must be away. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 3
