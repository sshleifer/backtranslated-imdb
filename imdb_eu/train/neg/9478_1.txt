If there were a curious reward for the Academy Awards, this film would all win. He has all the gods, an excellent plot, special extreme effects and good acting skills and, of course, there is a superstar celebrity in all the roles. Well, this could be the scenario where the world was reversed, but it's not. It's the worst film ever made, it does not look like bad dads that read scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia, but it's also very low in special effects. For example, the demon costume (by the way it is essential to watch it) is the most horny thing I've ever seen. When I saw this red-black monster called, I could not laugh. And, among all things, it seems that a funny creature was transported through a tape. <br /> <br /> Do not do it with me as I did the same mistake. Since the IMDB certification was released in 2003, there were less than five votes and he thought: "Well, it's worth the shot, it's not bad." /> <br /> I do not lose any more words in this movie.
