Fantastic Mr. Fox Roald Dahl is a comedy based on a classic book. It is directed by Wes Anderson and takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a feature film. Anderson, a talented man, as long as I respect him, seems to have lost his light spirit. Anderson seems to have left that story to be a talents of talent, and if it's a bad movie, it would be his first bad movie. As soon as you go to school and start your first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day in film making, so I can easily get it. I agree to have a mind and a pleasant spirit, the animation is nice, but the film is becoming increasingly difficult, leaving the story behind and random random random shots. The characters are also good. Jason Schwartzman's Mr. It's what Fox is saying (George Clooney), Ash's intelligent son, Ash, and especially memorable. The film does not reach quite a horrible thing, but it's getting closer. I am sure that Wes Anderson will work on another amazing movie and decide on a different movie, and when he decides it, but, for the time being, forgive, Wes Anderson, this film was a great despair.
