There are many people who look very good in this movie. That is probably the best. Perhaps, it's even more worth seeing. "Loaded" Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) tells a young man who will mark his mark on the world. He is a son of a family with a good reputation, with a good reputation and is studying law. But like many settings, things are not quite as perfect as they appear. The hope of this family has a lot more love. Except for the school, Tristan's father leaves little in the house. This seems to be the result of a traumatic event in the past of the family, that is, it is revealed through flashbacks, but it is not written until the end. Tristan's claustrophobia surrounds his career in a very extreme way, to celebrate the graduation when friends put themselves into a club at the front. The celebration soon distributes some strippers at a beach party, and thereafter, Tristan Sebastian Cole (Corey Large) continues with a friend who embraces the world of drugs he assumes. <br /> <br /> Technically well-designed, this is a story that is no longer scripted and very exciting. Taking into account this film, some of the camera's constant tricks appear to be generally annoying and external, such as slowness, shortcut, frostbite and echoes. These are the types of effects that a director usually discusses about a person's perspective on drugs; except in this case, it was thrown at random points from time to time, when they tried to style it a few times. <br /> <br /> Despite the relative strangers, the performances were very good, especially with the main antagonist (Corey Large). I think we will see a couple of people in the future in larger and better projects. <br /> <br /> Of course, when I mention the actors, I have to mention their appearance. Hot-based rating, this movie is a score of 11. The women in this movie have an incredible look and it is almost boring to see what the film looks like. I'm sure the male characters are very attractive, but you should ask someone else to comment on it. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not recommend this movie, buy it, rent it, or watch it for free. Unfortunately, it's just not worth the effort you make.
