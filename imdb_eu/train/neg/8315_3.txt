What is wasted to make an interesting movie about an interesting topic. There is very little research into what is actually a straightforward man (or gay) working in the gay sex environment. Dancers continue to talk about their art if they do not have erotic components. They may not be rented in the order of prostitutes, but in fact, sex workers sell their fantasy and sell private dance lessons. From movies, they like to go to male clubs and think they're hiring "dancers" for private sessions. The plans of the club only show that women in front of the stage and "dancers" only see women in the audience. This is just the reality of these clubs. It would be quite difficult for private women to dance straight and couples. So what do they really feel for their customers and customers? We learn very little. Instead we will get filler. A gay entrepreneur who does not add anything to the right dancers. Drag the actions that tell us about the costumes, but does not know the dancers' lives and attitudes. <br /> <br /> The images of Mexico City are general. Sausages is a ridiculous phallic mill. <br /> <br /> This film is completely simplistic and should be interesting only for those who do not want to see pictures of some beautiful dancing boys. The rest of the film is an insult to gay men.
