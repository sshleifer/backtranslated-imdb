Platoon is in Viet Nam for the Rocky IV team in boxing for the heavyweight championship. Oliver Stone, the story of an American platoon experience in Viet Nam in 1968, is very devastating. While most or most of Platoon's occurrences occurred over the 10 years of the United States military involvement in Vietnam, there were few things that could happen to them in such a short time (weeks). war In Platoon, the men in plotter watch one or two days in a row: United States soldiers kill civilians, a US soldier who raves civilians, a Sergeant from the United States, killed another US Sergeant, an official US soldier killed a US official. Firefighters killed or injured, 90% died or injured in the plot. In order to shut off that movie, Vietnam's American soldier is a shameful experience. I recommended the two Vietnam War films (the TRUE story of the worst conflict against US soldiers) and the A Bright Shining Lie in HBO.
