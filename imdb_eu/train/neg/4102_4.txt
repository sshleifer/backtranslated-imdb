'Dead Letter Office' is a short film about a pair of low-budget Australian email service workers struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the play is wrong and the misfortunes of the characters' past and current ties are depicted as bad and excessively schematically. It's all a disappointment, however, is the portraiture's head office portrait: there is no mechanization, and it is impossible to know what employees really do. Note that part of the plot is threatened with the closure of the office, but this office was probably closed in the 1930s, if it ever existed. It's a pity, because the overall tone of the film is heavy and heavy, and there is a promise in this scenario: but some details will be convinced. In general, it really feels someone who has not really lived in real life. A student's movie, a concept and a scheme, but sadly something else.
