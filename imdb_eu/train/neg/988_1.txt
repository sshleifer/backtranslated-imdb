This movie does not offer any way. It has not got any success. The play is horrible, long and long dribble dull. In the end, they tried to make the scene of the last sex moving, but at last the parody of what the movie was about. Fill out the rubbish, I can not believe what this great movie is. <br /> <br /> And I'm very sure that Rosario Dawson finished this movie and, as a result, broke the Indian hit, which was an NC-17 film. The problem is not that adult movies will be sticking with this movie, like something like an OC movie or something like teens. Pathetic
