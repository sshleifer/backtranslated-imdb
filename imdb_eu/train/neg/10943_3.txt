This film is very bad, with a bad performance and Lorenzo Lamas is really enjoyable! All the characters are annoying (except Lamas), and there is no root or care for anyone! And the action is very boring. The movie gives us 3 criminals who would find a threat and disturbance, when they were looking for a bunch of bored, horny and simply shy kids! Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma, but he can not keep that shit part, and believe it or not, the opening was really enjoyable, but at the end, the center was very boring and I was a little sorry. Advance button!, plus Conversation is particularly enjoyable! . The bar that I like is a beautiful scene, but Lamas goes down the ditch and surpasses the rest, and the murderer dies the scene that tortures the Jennifer family. They were supposedly disturbing, indeed, it's really swallowed! This film is very bad, with a bad performance and a boring pace, Lorenzo Lamas is really enjoyable, but not enough, not recommended. Management is very bad. George Erschbamer does a very bad job here, with a half-camera, with a soft spot and a boring movie. It's a very bad act (except Lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is horrible here, and it has not been necessary to play, but it is very fun to watch, and has a wonderful character, and has had a great charisma, but he can not save it, and he has had no chemistry without chicken! (Lamas rules!). Josie Bell is terribly here, and while she looks decent she is not very persuasive and has no chemistry with Lamas. Cheryl Jeans is hot, but he did not do much, but he screams and fears, he did well. Robert Scott was INCREDIBLY the main nasty, and he was not threatening, he longed for another 2. The rest of the castles are bad. Avoid Overall! Avoid it! If you like Lamas (like me). 5 to 5
