I try to be very objective when I see a low-level preview. On the other hand, low-budget productions also apply a lower weight on budget-oriented production. I look forward to a great deal of anticipated productions and their studios. So I apply the toughest criteria in studio publications. But this movie was pure. Deadline The premise was awful. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was incredible in trying to solve high school highs. There was not enough depth to take him into his own person or his activity. Additionally, to make this movie more mysterious, some lighting scenes did not set mood, especially in the warehouse. <br /> <br /> Again, I spent another three striking movie.
