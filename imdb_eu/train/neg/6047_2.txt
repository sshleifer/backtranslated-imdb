French Connection worked so well with Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). The disaster that Frankenheimer directed (Raindeer Games and Dr. Moreau's Island) has brought us a special obsession with capturing Doyle and Charnier (Rey). NYPD's idea of ​​this fictional idea that Doyle would have to travel to Marseilles with the help of local French authorities, found at Charnier. I guess I'm wrong, but Charnier did not jump from the village with just 65 kilograms !!! If the street value is 32 million, send Doyle to find this guy, it was a little bit after all. Please! The story was weak. The play was awesome (except Hackman, the only one that had passed his part completely). The direction was in the whole place. Stage cuts were also awful. Please make yourself one side and see it twice for the first time and jump.
