I personally advised people out of this movie. In general, seeing is bored and there is no choreographic battle. Slow and not very persuasive. If you buy the Hong Kong Legends DVD book, Bey Logan is the only thing that deserves remarkable audio commentary. <br /> <br /> But, in any case, a Ninja movie has never been seen before. I have not thought of any, and, of course, I do not want to. <br /> <br /> In general, in terms of cinema, I have a golden rule: avoid any movie with the word "Ninja".
