I can not believe it to be able to do this. These people have to be a drug star and go with stumbling blocks. They must be tortured This movie is an abomination. It's just a footage of the first movie. The original is curious and does not make sense. Drug is like a kind of hallucination. Like a mirror with naked therapy. He also collected coins of any type that did not want to see the first movie, because Suzanna Love's character Natalie was called Lacey. On the screen he cried out, "LACEY, LACEY !!!!" da. 10. I give it to 10. MY GODA !!!!
