This movie is a classic about feeling, not about the quality of the film. Moves as unimaginable as possible, to realists. <br /> <br /> The unbelievable idea is based on an attempt made by two British soldiers and Hindu Gopus. Indians In the following scene, the whole regiment is seen drum and gaita watches. In the British Army, a sergeant does not order a rescue attempt, and if you overcome it, he will not try another soldier and a regiment full of mankind with an Indian servant. The rebellion of the Indians is very inept, it is dangerous ... they are hundreds but they can not be arrested or kill two recoverers, of course. At one point, the British soldiers cut stone blocks into revolts scattered around the rebellion, scattered around the revolt ... they ought to suppose themselves to be harmful to their eggplant. After shooting Cary Grant prisoners recaptured, lying on the floor, looking at the boy, the water is looking at the boy ... there is hardly someone who has shot in the back. The water boy fights boldly (it's nowhere) to make an alarm ... it raises it on a wall to see and shoot the bad guys, and throw a tear while it stays while trying to play more notes when it is shooting again and again and the lips break the weak call ... Cannon blows instead of the cover hidden behind, just like half a brain. This scene is worthy of comedy sketches. If they wanted to make a comedian from Buster Keaton, they would have to hire Keaton and they made it better.
