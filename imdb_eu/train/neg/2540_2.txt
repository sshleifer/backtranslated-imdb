I thought I saw this movie twice. Then I read all the other reviews and did not match them. Men and three young students, two girls and one boy, go to town to study the supposed fears. I still feel very confident about the movie I've seen, despite the disagreement of the reviews. So I'll put my review back to you: If you like the occasional "B" movie, like me, the Return to Boggy Creek movie is for you! Whether to set the sleep timer and to show off your favorite movie bonus or hang up with your friends. Boggy Creek, a dumb button, and a fun night you get improv. Look! Is the legend true? I think that we would just not know that, with such a stiff non-star. Maybe the wrong performance of the equipment in the special film at important moments? Is our blonde a male and a young hero in the chest? Technology was the only exception to the whole movie? You should check yourself to find out.
