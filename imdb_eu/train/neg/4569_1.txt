I can not believe that Muncie City was so hard to pay attention as to make this show possible. This show is like a bad face for the hard-working civil servants working on the face. In my life I have never seen my life so stupid. If they were billed as a comedy, but telling reality, it is a lie. I only saw it and I was amazed at what I saw. I wanted to see the guy want to go back with a bad boy. What would be a joke? Nothing was an exhibition bringing the real world closer. Muncie, the Chief of Police and all the officers should hang on their heads and not accept that they came from that city. No wonder it was not on TV
