How low can someone try to recover an old man? ST: HF will be happy to show you. <br /> <br /> If you want to see what to see if you want to see a Star Trek show, do not see this. <br /> <br /> Writing is lost. -Podge, the actors are small portraits of their characters and, above all, the design works are strictly dogs. <br /> <br /> As the captain looks strong, do not look here! Like the strong attitude of the Federation? Forget here! Starfleet mocked the mirror with her hair. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems that Spikey is trying to organize an essay with an engineer. From there it degrades. No, uniforms do not match, thank God. They are small or too large, stacked in collar boxes and mixed with TNG Seasons One and Two Uniforms in season 3 and DS9 uniforms. Any discipline and tradition of origin of this production without reaching the plot! It's only a good show about this show, it's a bit better with each season. OK, I go back. Who uses this CG without experience? Designers of this show. <br /> <br /> Do not worry, it's going to make a mistake for Star Trek, like me. It is also impossible to save the catastrophe from previous shows. <br /> <br /> When I saw that, I cried, my eyes probably blew in the blood and almost broke it. Bad.
