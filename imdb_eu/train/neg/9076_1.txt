Without a doubt, this has been the stupid, most serious and bad movie that I've seen for a long time. I was tempted to deactivate the circuit, but as I see a horrible car accident, I literally found it in every way as unbreakable and reached the finish line. I'm not in any way confronting the portrayal of the comedic theater on the screen. Animal House, Porky, Mary Some Something, Mary Pie, and Freddy Got Fingered I've found very nice in their terms. Mamie Van Doren's sponge-bath sponge is a double bath since it's brightest, the most amazing look of a geriatric nude. Editing and filming is impossible, the movies, which once finished, featured dramatic screenings of Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman, once it made me laugh. This is a useful target for the movie as a textbook, so it does not make a raw image. Oh, and it would be well used as herbal fertilizer.
