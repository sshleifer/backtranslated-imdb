I have traveled around 6 movies throughout my life. This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I do not know how I sat for an hour. At night I had to be in the coma. When I was 8 years old I saw the theater. I could not remember the name, but I know that Penelope Ann Miller starred. It has really damaged me if I lost comments. Yech! Oka! Barf!
