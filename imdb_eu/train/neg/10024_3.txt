The first lesson is that some filmmakers (especially Hollywood-inspired) should know - "style" is just selling. I translate it translates into style. Secondly, if you're bidding on selling style, this does not have to have a decent story. But it's not black. For example, three, Saif, Kareena and Akshay are narrators in various points in the story. But this configuration is not properly used. It's possible to have a better mix of narratives and games. The sequences of actions are from the 70s. <br /> <br /> The film's choreography is horrible. I think that Vaibhavi Merchant has slept in this movie. Vishal-Shekhar scored a good score, but it's not that movie. Why is Sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the Hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) not English by Anil Kapoor? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is saving the grace of the film. But he is in his stereotyped car. You do not mind missing this movie.
