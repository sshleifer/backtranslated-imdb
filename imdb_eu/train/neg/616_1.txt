Let's see; He kills a few dying children and turns his soul into a scarecrow. Neva will not happen! OMFG This fake stupid boy can not stand up to himself, a man who comes out of her handwrecked nuns by a mother. When he dies, he looks at the scarecrow and the spirit enters the scarecrow. The drunkard covered the death and gave him a suicide look, and he fell into it. Later on we see that the trailer is thrown and later it will meet with the txorimalo. They had a short meeting, he called the drunkard and he was "a loser!" The Scarecrow expels the building, calls it "father" and then cuts off sick men. In addition, we can see how the spectacular film has been developed. Then he killed many people. The people who gave it great difficulty kill him, and the random people started killing them. There is no laugh here. It adds punishment to each murder. When someone killed him, he made some karate tokens and ended everything with one of his symbolic titles. When someone who is tough to hear, "Here, it's a round corn!" then throw it in his ass. Or, for example, we can take the movie! A policeman was killed and the only person on the road was killed. The father, the sheriff, cried out to the madman, and said: "Hey, let's sleep a little!" He threw a dagger and threw his breast over a tree. At the end of the movie, he killed two men and "Gotta split!" and he killed two men with a mule and went into the head. Wowzors, this movie made me feel so bad about my pants. Perhaps the next day, if this guy gets a movie, he will not be gay.
