I do not know why I do it myself! I'm continuing to defend Dutch and Belgian films, and I'm going to have to get more credits and opportunities ... and then they're knocking your head in the head! Intensive Care is a terrific production and is probably the worst case in Dutch speaking countries. Dutch Dutch-American attempt to create horror franchise is clearly based on classical American slasher, such as Friday 13 and Halloween. Manufacturers and writers were very good at this, but it was very low. Intensive Care Product was a shame for all the people involved and, therefore, a real worship movie here. It is almost impossible to capture an original copy of it and only in special cases, such as "Night Weddings." For a specific 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and create a drawing ... then rumors and small brain sculptures change. The play's whole play is abominable, although there are some respected names. Koen Wauters is the leading male role ... This guy could be the most beloved and beloved Belgian artist. He is a dear singer, a lot of television shows and an idol of many young girls. However, he never mentioned what was the main character of this thing. Like all others in the Netherlands, he avoids persuading himself, the intensive care ever happened.
