0 * 's Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Under the direction of Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll's video game manager tries to recreate a nail-busted puzzle unfortunately does not succeed. Instead, the worst movie ever made! Although Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff are small celebrities, the movie lacks the basic basics of a movie, such as the story line, and the basic relativity that explains what happens in the darkness and the light. The film rotates completely and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And without mentioning the bad CGI used to make monsters. Although they were beautiful, the food was fine. True, this is a bad movie ever made. My final rating is 0/10.
