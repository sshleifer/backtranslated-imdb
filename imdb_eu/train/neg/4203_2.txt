A far cry from a security watch care company begins, almost immediately, the murder becomes mysterious and completely inane. David Arquette and Stanley Tucci are trying to take care of seeing the dense disaster, but some things are not possible. <br /> <br /> What happens, for example, that Gale suddenly becomes a sweet mother's image. Was Tommy drunk in the parents' house? Why did Heinrich want to destroy his business, even if it was false, to destroy his business, probably robbing his clients. Why do you think Tommy's sensitive Heinrich can be a murderer (it's almost a dream), and if it's compelling, why should not he go to the police? And why did not he turn the alarm on Gale's house, especially after leaving Howie? Of course, these facts are necessary to reveal the plot (and the term very, very bitter). And it might be forgiving if he gets the smallest comedy. But, from the description of Howie's rape, and the latest "jokes" about Gale and Gale and Howie still dead, it's more enjoyable and pathetic than the one that describes Howie's rape. <br /> <br /> I My comment marked the box that indicated the "spoilers", but I can not do anything else to lift something to disrupt the sky.
