Until now, I've been the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I've actually seen bad movies. I watched this movie in my video store, and the cover seems like a horror movie. I did not know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where do i start The film's shooting was profound and boring. At one point, there is a minute scene talking to one, only one car to go to the ranch in a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, he was silent. The whole movie is boring, an annoying and incredible conversation and, basically, no need to speak. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and make a good comedy. Otherwise, run this movie when you watch it.
