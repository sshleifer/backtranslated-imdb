"A Guy Thing" tries to get the feelings of "Mary Something About" or "Meet the Parents", but more photos are excluded from the rooms that have been cut out for both films. Fortunately, I rented it for 5 days, because I could not sit down for more than 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's a decent premise and I liked other scenes that automatically cover other men. Paul's incorrect errors (Save-mart's corrector was very good) but typing is completely awesome. The dialog box is squeezed all the time and when you think things are coming out right away, you do not need to be stuck with no visual reason. Also, how many jokes do you need in a movie? <br /> <br /> I'm not going to be wrong, humor is a great slapstick, just like in other films I mentioned, but this movie just fails. I love the bad Julia Stiles (Ten Things I Hate was great about you), but that too can not help me to sit through this terrible movie. Save your dollars and go to rent "Something around Mary" once more.
