The Wicker Man, along with Nicolas Cage, is not getting any good movie, but I can not really say that I see it. I would like to continue talking about the negative aspects of the film, like a horrible play, and the long scenes Cage seeks for girls, hallucination and then another hallucination, dream sequence and hallucination ... but it is not worth the trouble to face such a movie. Instead, for five reasons why you should watch Wicker Man, it's bad: <br /> <br /> 5. It's hard to deny that it's really awful ideas, the problem is a daring and not fun execution. It's a movie that inspired you to read the original 1973 movie, or to read the short story that is based elsewhere. <br /> <br /> 4. It's really aesthetically pleasing to a horror / thriller. It is evident that instead of using green screen or elaborate set shots in the location, we will see some great scenery. There are also many very well-formed shots. It's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actress as nature's power. Whether you're a fan or not, it seems impossible to get "normal guy" from Cag. There is always a person who plays a kind of resemblance or misfortune, and personally I like every movie that I look like. Whether Nicolas Cage is great or not, he always plays his or her own unique energy and never gets bored. It's shameful in The Wicker Man, but in a wonderful way. <br /> <br /> 2. A student could probably write a piece about this movie because it seems to be the most powerful feminist film ever made. "View" could be written: "This is what happens when women manage the management of society!" Likewise, the similarities between the "Summersisle" society and the bee colony are quite interesting and deserving. <br /> <br /> 1. If you're reading this, you might be very familiar with watching a very popular YouTube video: the collection of "highlights" in the movie, Cage running, and, of course, the wicked. "AAGHH! BEGINS! MY EYAK !!!" line These scenes are ridiculous contexts, and they're still fun, while watching the movie in full. <br /> <br /> I used the used DVD Blockbuster for about $ 5 ... when doing so, it's about dollar for each reason. It's a good deal. <br /> <br /> NOTE: This is the best version of the movie version, and it is better to see the small version that was added to the epilogue. Franco.
