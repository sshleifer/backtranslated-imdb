The worst movie I've ever seen from Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. There's no story, no humor, nothing! The sequence of actions seems like some advertisements that announce Akshay Kumar along with Thumbs-Up. The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle's great influence, but very badly executed. <br /> <br /> I did not get a lot of hope, but seeing this movie is a doubtful experience and asks "what did these guys think?" ?? !! ". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why did I not give it a rating? 1 Every time I think it's worse, Bollywood makes me wrong.
