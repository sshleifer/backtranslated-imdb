I will tell you something about this film. I've seen twice. I had a boy for the first time and the movie was pretty fun to me. I liked it I thought it was fun and interesting and the main character was cool. <br /> <br /> I saw it a few days ago. It was horrible. Really I do not know why I thought it was fun, but now ... I did not laugh. There was nothing very entertaining. It was just the mutual. The story was weak. The play is not special. In this movie, there are great actors, but there is still no-brain teasers. <br /> <br /> Being a racist movie is the worst thing. Really I'm not bad, I usually do not complain about racism in movies. However, in movies like "Shaolin Temple", black men complain about the lack or I've seen the black man of "The Street Fighter" or ... Whatever you get the point. People see racism everywhere. I wonder how they would react to a movie like 'Meteor Man'. Why? Why i'll tell you There is no subsidiary in this subsidiary. There is no good among the good people. In fact, there is only one white guy in the whole movie and the bad guy. All good are African American. Do not get bad, I do not like the guy good white or black or yellow or pink or green ... What matters to me in this movie is that we can see a white person. This is the only movie I have ever seen. It is not realistic. When there is only one black man in a Japanese movie, what happens with "The Street Fighter," there's no problem. Most people in Japan are Asian. If there is only one white man in an American movie, there is a certain problem. In the US, most people are white. A Japanese movie is just like shooting a totally white and a bad Asian man. It's just not real. <br /> <br /> That's it. I give the film a rate of 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I did not have fun with the child.
