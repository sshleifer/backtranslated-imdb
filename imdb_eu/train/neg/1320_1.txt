I had something I expected when reading this movie in the quiz. It may be that they could write a more exciting plot, it's a pity that they left me with Howler Monkeys. Alberto Tomba surely was a good skier but thank God (and we too) that he did not have the ability of the actor to win. He can not play, he can not speak, he can not move very well on the continent without skis ... Michelle Hunziker is a blonde girl, and all that. He certainly did not choose the amazing abilities of his awesome role, but surely his legs are pleasing. However, I must admit that Tomba could be a teacher actor, because his actor is worse, and that's funny, especially since it is not Italian. I laughed all the time, watching this movie. I found it so hilarious and absurd to laugh really, aloud, very loud.
