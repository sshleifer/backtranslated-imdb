It has only one movie error, unfortunately, this defect affects all the credibility of the piece. <br /> <br /> The condemnation of the Israeli occupation of disputed territories begins. There is no reason why Israelis respond. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. For this reason, Israel has taken over "lands", because these countries were lost in war. The film also says that Israel challenges the UN 242 if it does not comply with the resolution. The problem is 242. The Palestinians immediately abandoned it at birth. <br /> <br /> They can show some good footage and really think footage, but remember, seeing something, just what you hear what you hear and only half of what you see. <br /> <br /> All participants in this film are Israel's critics, and some have commented on their anti-Semitic comments by removing credibility in their own words. . <br /> <br /> Every participant needs a real lesson that is objectively taught, not by some Palestinian sympathizers.
