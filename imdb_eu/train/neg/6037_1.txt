Moron and girlfriends make some rituals to revive their dead, because the dead are unable to prove their lives. Not surprisingly, they revive a deceased soul that begins with an ax and the next day some college-aged people report the story of a camp. He gets into a guy with a sticky guy and starts telling the stupidities that tell the story. The group calls it a police officer, who sees all police officers dazzled with blood and thinks it as a lion (?) And soon focuses on a murderer who may or may not be a ghost. <br /> <br /> Moronic small splatter film was shot all day long, but some characters are talking about flashlights and talking like they were in the middle of the night, and attracting attention to a signal. A man has a gun in his hand and the bullet carries it on the other side but does not charge it, when it eventually loads it, the killer has many options but does not worry because it would end the movie. early Then throws the gun! Likewise, the characters that do not express emotion are harmful and do not worry about their curiosity, having cut off their friends and shameless effects (the human heart looks like a chicken flesh, the car that appears in the end was clear, the model cars) and the horrible conversation and nudity of women blind does not help. And in the end, he tries to eliminate his inconsistency, that it was an inventive age that tells stories of university camps at the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> Then the killer becomes real in the last scene in parts. Again <br /> <br /> Medium-sized people only to accept unwanted laughter. <br /> <br /> * **** outside 1/2
