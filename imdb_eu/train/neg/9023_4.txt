I've seen anime, but I'm not a fan of it; and I do not read manga. This is what I say is that many reviewers who are currently doing this movie seem to have a backdrop. "I saw St. John's Wort", and although I was not a masterpiece of any of the imagination, I received "Shinobi" because, above all, everyone seems to love it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw that afternoon, and I struggled hard. Yes, it's very beautiful - slow water scenes, autumn leaves in the trees, as well as CGI eye flicker - stylish. I also liked grasses, costumes, fighting scenes, but they were generally bad as dirt. <br /> <br /> Someone seems to have taken "Romeo and Juliet", it is also referred to as translations. Starred fans - and some "X-Men" were thrown out in good measure. Both characters split Wolverine's powers. The beard was dressed up with the claws and the gray man had the ability to heal himself. Then you have a girl with a poison kiss - Poison Ivy (Batman). Why do I give women these powers? A Poison Girl shows her leg and then kisses you to death. Man, that's great power for you. And the other girl from yellow powder can make mistakes by rubbing her hands. The other woman, one of the crossed stars, has a hypnotic look. Wow <br /> <br /> I reached the end of the movie, I quickly sent it back, and I saw a little tragedy than I expected. Some compare it with the "Flying Daggers" and "Hero" home. Do not make that mistake. They may have similar resemblances, but they end similarities. "Shinobi" is an amateur - other films are made by an experienced filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I'd like to avoid this movie unless it's 12 or 18 years old.
