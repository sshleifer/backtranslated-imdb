Cliff Robertson, a marvelous husband married to a wealthy wife, if he had never been here, gives a wonderful theater performance; Director Michael Anderson "Marked Down, Thinking Zombie, Less Than Life," continued as he trained Robertson's effort through his little bullfight. The other parts are not better; Jennifer Agutter, renowned for LOGAN'S RUN, is hardly a defining role to play. If the quality of the performance is three times better; if they were to fill some holes in the holes; and if the stimulation was given by adrenaline, this dash could lead to an acceptable standard in Hallmark. So its rating is so inexplicably high. Chronic cancer can not be considered for a while to catch up with DOMINIQUE. The night telegraphs could not take longer than they would take away.
