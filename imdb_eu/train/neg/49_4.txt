A road movie that is very tender and dull, hip and modern, with a style of editing and extravagant camera angles that only sleeps. <br /> <br /> Throwing lost, writing is stupid and insolent. Lalo Schifrin's only soundtrack is the only thing that is worthy of it, beginner and very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> You can do it, the bad opinions and comments on this line are absolutely worth it; it's just garbage. Of course, that's their charm, everyone would not drop a glass of beer to watch a drop of a movie, but save it on the storm you did not do anything any more.
