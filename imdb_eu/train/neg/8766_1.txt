I should put an alarm on saying that the movie was not going to be seen. A good tribute fails, in a marvelous way, almost almost as an insult to the memory of these brave men. The special effect was tremendous, but I did not expect the director to value the total technological military defeat. How can fire fires usually burn a gun with a minute fire at 1/10 speed? How can the soldiers carry the grenade after burst? How can the artillery shells survive when falls of about 20 meters fall? How does the shells of artillery fall on both sides of the road and not the same way? <br /> <br /> Because we did not rescue me, there were clues and conversations. I was dying. Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and Pakistan se jyaada musalmaan were standard conversations like Hindustan me hai and LOC cross mat. At least say the way. <br /> <br /> Written by Shobha De is true. The director worked without scripts and shows. There is no flow to the movie. On the one hand, there is no sudden progress. It is only one subsequent war with the general war scheme. The scenery scene is horrible. The Navy chief of staff does not think it. The worst part of the theater is the people cut the separation footage four-hour movie in 3 hours.
