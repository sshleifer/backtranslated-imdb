Eventually (very long) I finished watching this movie, because its stupidity and nonsense were wonderful. Many people who think it's hard to believe (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) would be willing to take part in this fiesta. In 1968, maybe people really * were so kind? The Earth seems to have written agendas written by Latin American Latino writers with some agenda. The superpower is in conflict and the Russians are really boys, the Secretary General of the Communist Party is a pleasing and spiritual man, and suddenly, after 20 years, he sees clearly and will imprison a prisoner to the priest of a Siberian gulag. The priest immediately becomes the pope according to coincidences. We can see the secret process of voting poverty in the Vatican, depicted as the most divine gods that you can imagine. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the Chinese communists achieved the traditional socialist economy by half. death They want to launch a nuclear war in order to solve this powerful and powerful path toward communism (to rid the Western wealth of capital directly to Chinese capitalist workers). <br /> <br /> Our old friend, General Secretary, is concerned that the Pope calls on him before his coronation to request that he be satisfied. Fifteen-year-old boy is in Chinese Peng Chinese who looks and behaves. In 1968, people thought what the look was about how you will laugh at the ground. The Peng company demands that Western capitalists pay (that is, after all, it is very logical, that capitalists do not always have to pay socialist insanity?), And that the Pope must sacrifice something equal to ordinary common cause and social justice. <br /> <br /> So, when the Pope appoints him in Rome, he commits himself to the whole wealth of the Catholic Church around the world to feed Christ with our poor uncle. That's why he saved the world from the necks of the holocaust. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are also small sub-plots. I'll give him three Oscars for stupidity. <br /> <br /> Sometimes Anthony Quinn looks pretty hard for the Pope. Zorba is as compelling as Greek.
