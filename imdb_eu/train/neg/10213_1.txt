He liked a lot of people who liked the movie, so I feel bad with a bad review. After 96 minutes, I feel like I have to do this. Where is the plot of this movie ?! I needed to get lost, waiting for the story to start and nothing happened. Surely the endings were "somewhat shocking", but they did not create it accordingly. I forgot who was half-time, so they did not really develop the characters. The performance was so epic, it was especially compelling, but I saw it all the time. So ... without giving anything, I must say, if you do not want the actors of the movie, there is no real reason to watch the movie. I could mistake, but I did not understand why there were so many movies or too much. I can not decide which one to be, so I judge yourself. I do not know how to rent it would be a good idea, the cost and everything ... <br /> <br /> Argument: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Conference: 2/10 Overall: 3/10 I think it's very high, my vote I got up.
