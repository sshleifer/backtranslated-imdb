With children, the movies have been looking back at the beginning. Although there are some exceptions, most kids can not work and after a few minutes they are usually annoying. The people of Paperhous have captured the worst of the world, because they are very annoying and do not have a resilience. In short; they are garbage. This is not good considering that they are taking it, and above all, it's not good, it's almost impossible to think of this movie because of the actors who smoke this movie seriously. This is a pity because the loss is dead because the plot is not (it's not entirely). After drawing a picture of a house in his notebook, he continues a young girl waking up in the fantasy world. Soon it seems that this world can be manipulated by its drawings, and therefore decides to make several changes until the dream becomes a nightmare. Oh dear. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this line line provides a nice base for getting a fantasy horror movie. However, it will be lost through fatal failures. First and foremost, although it may be a premise, it has been a great premise for many inventions; The movie is obsolete. The central plot is not played at all, and the result is completely boring. The lack of voltage is another great mistake in the movie, because each sequence has more attention (due to lack of ideas) because we've been dragged into a point that you have not been paying attention to. Thanks to some great parties, the movie feels like a movie. This is expected by the kids out, but Bernard Rose decided to report the story; as the horror of the movie is horrible. The movie is also a cursory, and the "love" between two leads is very frightening and it's very painful to watch. In fact, if I should talk about this word, I would choose "painful". The paperwork is badly played, ridiculous, very crisp and fuzzy. Keep up your mind, see something else.
