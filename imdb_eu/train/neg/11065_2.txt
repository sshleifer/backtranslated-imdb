This movie had so much potential. Anyone who follows Jeffrey's story knows so much detail in this movie. There was too much time and effort on Dahmer's homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption. Where was the character's development? The origin of a criminal is always interesting and Dahmer is no exception. Is there a movie that she put into her adolescence when she started killing her little animals and making her boyfriend? Instead, the flashbacks that try to explain the origin of the killer are going to be a great deal, but the main point of Dahmer's development is failing. Likewise, the country was the reason why the story was fascinated with this story: how he kept his body in the apartment and what measures and measures he got to achieve it; his cannibalism and the desire of the flesh, etc. I have been able to continue, but summarizing, it has much more points of the film for its sexuality and not enough dreadful; It's the movie "Dahmer".
