Steven Seagal ... how could you have a great part of that movie? I rented this movie, usually because your movies were pretty clean. I've lost a lot of respect in such a horrible movie. Very bad taste! I'm sorry to rent this movie. Steven, if you continue working on such movies, I think your route is over. My husband and I have liked to see a lot of your movies, you can always manually "manually" maneuver and make it clear ... and, moreover, the language is quite clear in your movies ... but this is something else. I'll think twice before renting your movie.
