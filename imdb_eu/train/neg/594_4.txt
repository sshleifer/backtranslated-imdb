I only rent Creep and I was not surprised at all. I do not feel anything in this movie. I felt sick only that it was gore moving. <br /> <br /> In the living room I was often desperate for some time, that something would happen with this movie. Do not we see all this? I did not like the characters in the cage in the cage. I felt damaged. Again, I can not think why Creep was alive and did not die? There are several questions to answer. <br /> <br /> Someone mentioned the references to the game Silent Hill PS2, and I also see similarities. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, not a good one. judge yourself.
