I watched this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival, Dr. Dr. Uwe Boll attended. <br /> <br /> The movie is simply very, very bad. And no, not the usual Uwe Boll's "so bad it's really entertaining" way, but it's just a bad thing. The land is about a man with a horrible life (apparently a court in the past), he can not get his job and with a horrible wife of 900 kilos. To get rid of the toy truck with a bird flu virus, this man leads his uncle's worship leader. Al Qaeda also has designs for stealing toys, and the following is completely incomprehensible sexuality and violence within two hours. <br /> <br /> The effect is horrible (except Dave Foley, though, though). ), jokes are never over the extreme extremists that are being thrown out and people take a pooch. It's a satire, but I do not know what it is. <br /> <br /> Think of "Plane!", But made by South Park creators and without jokes.
