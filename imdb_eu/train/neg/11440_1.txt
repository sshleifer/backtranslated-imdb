Otherwise, I'm one of the worst movie ever I have ever seen and I never mean. My wife and I got bored in two minutes. Being boring is very credible. Women (non-lesbians do not bathe together) and do not "unexpectedly" kiss. Brothers and sisters have not lived together for 30 years and they dance together dancing together and dancing at the central park. Men do not hide their wife and sister at night before the wedding and then discuss her with her. Totally horny <br /> <br /> Heather Graham is probably the worst actress in today's films. It smiles as it has to be weeping, and vice versa. The only good movie has been Boogie Nights - and that's because it's not working. <br /> <br /> I can not stress this bad movie was bad.
