It's really a great movie and 2 hours of your life. At the same time it is tender and offensive, it has a lot of nudity and violence. However, nudity is not so exciting, and violence is repetitive and boring. Moreover, the plot is not that hard, the characters are realistic and undeveloped, and they are some of the ones I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I've heard this movie is fun, but it's not. I did not laugh every time I was watching, or smiling. The authors of this film tried to combine a comedy movie and failed in two accounts. <br /> <br /> Some of the bad films are very funny, because they are very bad, but this is not one of them.
