To get the album, this film is not surprising, but it's hardly an original. In 1998, the film called Talia Shire was similar to the film The Landlady, but with younger characters. <br /> <br /> Amanda Lear has had a bad life, father abuse, doctor, headache. etc. In the end, he relinquished happily at home, under the guidance of his ill-advised physician ... to kill himself and kill him badly. (Now it was an original), the doctor financed his doctor before his death, and buried his backyard. Richard was in love with the blues singer. If you've seen Landlady try to know or die the rest (Richard and Richard) (including internal roadie). <br /> <br /> This idea is a big part of the previous film. Stuck in his nose, when he nods his nose, watching the popcorn spitting with a bowl, holding his body. It had original material, beer bottle was a wild thing. The importance of the movie was shown by Amanda's beautiful breasts. Disability, but not waste time. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 4
