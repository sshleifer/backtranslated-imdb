Obviously I was watching BG. I love S1, I liked the 2nd season, the 3 season was fine and I loved it. Yay, it's a spin-off show! I did not know about it, one of my friends informed me. I was really excited. <br /> <br /> I saw the first three episodes ... A piece of junk! Teens by drama party. No science fiction ... well, hardly anyone. At the end of each episode, we can see a Cylon. That's all. Who cares? Were the recipients of the next female audience under 18 to decide? Senseless non-religious religions speak, weaken, scary ... and others. <br /> <br /> You're still sad to see that there is not at this time. Stargate ruined, BG over ...
