"Lies" talks about a link between a 18-year-old boottoothed student and a 38-year-old man, a couple of protags, half-time screen naked, and half-skinned and naked sexually pathetically naive. It seems a little more than an excuse for a sex scene. With a low production value, including healthcare appliances and fake softcore sex, including a bad comedy and theater mix, "Lies" is redundant. With just 2 hours, subtitles and so little substance, "Lies" is not recommended. (C)
