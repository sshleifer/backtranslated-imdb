I do not know when I first started watching one of the worst movies a long time with great enthusiasm. Anyone who has just visited London has clearly agreed to this setting ... there was no London. Snipe's character made it flush to the U.S. for a simpler way, to return to the U.S. without a single problem. Then convince the girl and grandma to visit him in America, how the land is not in the grandmother agrees ... it's a killer! Well, that was the end of the movie, but unfortunately it's not much better. The British police drive a lot of cars. I'm sure that in the eighties Vauxhall Belmont was behind a taxi, but a modern Subaru Imprezza was out in jail. So19 or they met the gun they tried to portray someone who was trying to make portraits happy with his pistols, he continued with Snipe along with the CIA. There were kids walking, but they told the police to shoot still, it's in London? No, no, I live. From central London to the airport (to discuss the Heathrow arguments) In 5 minutes we get an unforgettable trip. The Americans also have a young girl with a queen, but lives in Elephant & Castle. What does the police say is that the British helicopters and Snipe location officials can not find in Snipe and try to hide behind the stairs? The train station, of course, was not the UK's land and battle scene effects were horrible. The plot was very poor, boring, and a thousand times better written and shot. But in this movie there were some prominent actors, what they thought and please do not let them go to this movie! This movie does not seem to be what you want to know, if you want to concentrate on the dramatic aspects behind a task, you need a sturdy plot with landscapes and credible settings, that is, the viewer has time. If you take it and value it and make a mistake, you will notice it. If you want to play all the action movies (ie, no), they can be placed side by side with the continuity and the landscape.
