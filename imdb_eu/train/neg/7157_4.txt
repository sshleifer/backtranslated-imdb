1st View on 5th February 2002 - 10th to 4th (Dir-Michael Almereyda): A curious story about a druida witch, who wants to capture eternity by inheriting her grandfather's body. At least I think it was a relationship. Stephen King's The Shining is a mysterious quality throughout this film. The difference is that there was no campaign in Nicholson's film. All this is taken seriously at the end, some lame one-liners and mood litening attempts have not worked. Screenings are not the problem here, but it's a story. However, it seems that it does not work well for the audience to understand a lot of information and not what happened in the film. Christopher Walken's challenge is very small, as the grandfather's uncle, which is obviously the invoice to sell the movie. Do not buy this gimmick and try this movie. <br /> <br />
