This sequence is very different, it is incoherent and "plot" (really) and tries to be a modern exaggeration (ridiculous, period, and character-style styles) and nice. They make jokes made with animals and they are too much.) The actors of the film are on the plot of the youngsters. Although Glenn Close (and usually very good) is through this film, De Ville herself parodies and Sunset Boulevard! It's a movie that is not looking. This is an excellent example of a bad sequel and an error. Although Basic Instinct 2 has a plot, characterization and acceptable behavior. This is not. It's bad
