This movie was horrible. Okay, my favorite movie is 'The Wicker Man' (1973), so it was a bit too late to go. <br /> <br /> It walks through the plot, trying to throw away the elements of the original keys, so that the word "remake" is very doubtful. (It's not a virgin, but it's allergic to the bees. WOW!) There are so many things that are unfamiliar and unexplained, and a horror movie does not know about a horror movie. (How do we emphasize two people in a car clearly tidy at the beginning of the movie?) Cage looks haggard and confused throughout, and her character is called "Rowan!" in the slightest noise. The heads of Originals are angry, just like homage. For example, some events reflect the originals (when the girl from the closet closet dies when Woodward / Cage is dying) and some direct lines of dialogue are directed directly to Anthony Schaffers's screenplay. <br /> <br /> If certification is to provide a better and more detailed analysis to others, I can not work to write any more about it. There is no substance of any kind. Throw the scrap yourself with the rest of the remakes with the best films in "based" movies (in this case very bitter).
