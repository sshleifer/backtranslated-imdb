Peter Sellers plays with Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), the chef of a pirate ship dying after the previous captain. Although he has witnessed an underwater treasure, he begins to lose his memory and the treasure he gets is empty. In this way, Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate ghosts (by putting an ad on you?) And it will help you take the treasure road. He realizes that someone might bankrolle this sensible movie. He was replaced by Goon Spike Milligan Medak and Medak's talents in The Ruling Class, you can surely imagine what type of curtain and lighting scene is on Milligan's chair. Peter Boyle has appeared in the first 10 minutes of a short film as the captain of the condemned pirate. Probably, the young Frankenstein was released and preserved the same year, so that he could remove his resume. The dashing behind-the-scenes powerful-behind-the-scenes Scratcher looks for himself and Seller both looks quite disappointed, even looking for Sellers' makeup and pretty hair. The film was about to know that this bombing was filming. I can understand disability with lines like this: <br /> <br /> PIERRE: (it will hang) You will pay for it. <br /> <br /> SCRATCHER: No, I won 't. I will do it for free. <br /> <br /> And that's GOOD GOODS. It's amazing for me that Sellers still have a good deal of fruitful material on the gangs, but this has been available for more than 15 years now at VHS! What's up to the showcase and the United States's "A Show Called Fred" television series from Great Britain television and directed by Sellers, Milligan, and Richard Lester?
