The guy knows no cinema. Well, it seems that he has made some interesting theater plays in his youth, and they have deceived the Communist censorship about two acceptable films that had more successful political reasons. All of this is very good, but be careful: use AID! The scene is unbalanced, without proper start, and with the confused content and void. It does not say anything about the subject, so it goes beyond violence, nudity and pipe language. Why is not it possible to keep alive the corrupted corpse of cinema-art and profession? Why do not they make sense?
