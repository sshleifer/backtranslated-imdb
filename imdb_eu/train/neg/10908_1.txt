No movie is fun. I thought it was a premise, that it was offered to him a curious thing, that it was that it was a curious thing, that it was interesting and it offered some laughter. WRONG! There's nothing funny about the movie. For example, it is not fun to find a goat in the middle of a farmer's yard, unlimited. This movie is being dubbed with a good movie and it's just fun. <br /> <br /> We all know dogs eat anything and anytime anytime. With the main character, everywhere, it's not fun any time. It becomes a clutch. <br /> <br /> I think Rob Schneider, an acceptable role. According to this, it is not a bad actor, but with corrupted material, it is difficult to comment on quality. However, Coleen Haskell, another half of the HUMAN-ROMANIST (it also brings the romantic number of animals with an interest in the main character counts), it seems very embarrassing. Apparently, he is playing a vacuum away from all the rest of the film's actors. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you want to be boring, repetitive and boring material.
