I only saw these first 30 minutes and I saw everything was empty. I saw the scene as bad as Ed Wood. No, it was a hundred times in BIZKAIA. Ed Wood is the star of being the worst director, but it's not true; This stupid fray was the director ever. <br /> <br /> The American police have a German accent! The "Police Commissioner" was hanging on a table at the "Police Station" on a table. There is a struggle between the enemy, so that the points are not TEN FEET. <br /> <br /> This police pulls women down, wraps them and stores them. She tells her police partner to wait in the car. Then the warehouse is taken from a warehouse. The police partner believes that there is no reason why his partner may be a bad cop who dies, but he does not know for sure what this is because ... it's earth! The conversation is completely stupid, the play is horrible, and the characters play in a stupid way I've seen on the screen. The police partner is absolutely clear to the smoke and storage of these women illegally and brought them back to the car with a chariot bag, and yet, the pair, who is there. Everyone does not know what's going on! <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is the whole hack. The film was stopped in 30 minutes, I could not take it anymore. I've seen one of the most prolific films I've ever seen and I will not lose more time writing this review. <br /> <br /> TOTALLY WORTHLESS.
