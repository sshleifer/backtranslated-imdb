I've given these 4 stars, because it has many interesting topics here. Among home violence, sexuality and many taboos there. Gore-away I never called for such horror of fiction. <br /> <br /> It looks, it is depressing and hopeful. I do not like the end but I'm happier, I'm really tired of having a "human suck" pattern that prevails in all the movies. I know that nowadays the title of liberal arts can not be achieved without a change of hatred, as a human race member, but as a writer / director we propose to be different than others, and remember that ALIENS are evil aliens that kill GIZARTE RACE! Right now, if you are reading this and believe that humanity is worthy of death, go out, search for the lake and swim until your arms are tired. So you're not going to write the next movie or write down the next book asking them to stay alive. It's amazing, not thoughtful and boring.
