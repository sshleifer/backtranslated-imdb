I was looking forward to this movie. The premise was interesting to me. I stayed inside, even though I found the actor, except Helena Bonham Carter, no doubt. I expected that they would wait for my time, but, finally, they asked me why they took care of such things. Maybe it's worth getting a message in George Orwell's version. If this film got anything, Orwell's classic inspired me to read. It's hard to believe that my story could be as disappointing as this adaptation. The filmmaker's message, "If life is worthy of everyday life, then they have succeeded." I will not recommend this film to anyone; I was wasting 101 minutes of my life.
