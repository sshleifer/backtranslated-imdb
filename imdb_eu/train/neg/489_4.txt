The play is good, the women are beautiful and the men are beautiful, so if you are looking for a soft, well-functioning porn, the movie is for you. Otherwise, you have lost your time. The motivation of the main characters, especially the headmistress, is often a mystery. It could have been true: the truth presented in the film, not necessarily a historical truth - and his lover was jailed for a rape that was not committed. Did he protect his father, somebody who was sitting somewhere, when he raved a bad case? Was he protecting himself when he suddenly worried himself, because he only realized his art? During this time of judgment, this enthusiastic woman turns into a dreadful eye. On the contrary, his lover begins as narcissistic jerk, becomes a judge hero during the trial. At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifice himself for love. Of course, since deeds are not good enough, he's never seen again.
