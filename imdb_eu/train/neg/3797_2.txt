Years passed by Alex Rain (the first film directed by Olivier Gruner) in a terrifying plot that man has replaced with machinery, however, since then, the war between cyborgs and human beings has been created and we have lost now, that is, the supermarket. He is the daughter of Olivier Gruner's character (only inherits half of the minimum ability of interpretation). I believe that what I think first is at least a movie that is linked. However, when a supermarket is created, it is concealed during the hunt for a future reward hunter in 1980. a confusing mix of science fiction. Nemesis became a cult hit, I saw why I liked the people, although I did not have that movie. Nemesis tried to create different ideas with ecstasy, to develop a beautiful look and to offer a lot of action, almost worked. Nemesis 2 has no ambition, Terminator's cheap stumbling block, with a Muslim female musician. The actor is so misunderstood. Olivier Gruner seems to be a masterpiece of theater, and there are explosive spheres that are not the main action. original point of sale. I confess that I am not the original but deserves to continue better than that. Also original, such as Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and Thomas Jack and Earle Jackie Earle Haley featured good cartoons, this is no one and this time it's a cunning movie. In fact, when I saw this, I inspired to add the half star to the original. <br /> <br /> * from 4. (Bad)
