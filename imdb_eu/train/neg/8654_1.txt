The film was completely misleading and the material bonus told me that Corazon's heart was dark, that the river was replaced by a road and the ship became a Jeep and it was Walter Kurtz Osama. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Supporting attacks on US 9/11. <br /> <br /> I warned that the movie was removed from the "Documentary" section of the video store and would be placed on the War-drama field. For almost all fictional events.
