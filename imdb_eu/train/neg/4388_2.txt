Oh, I know what you think: "With such a title, I can not go wrong!" Yes Yes. I also loved the title, but I hated the stupid children who played the "little Satan assistant" man, and I also hated my mother and sister and daughter, and her boyfriend. Man, to somehow agonize! This is not just because of the 10/10 reason he got the low budget, they did it well. But, man, I hated actors, stupid! I know it would be bad, they saved a lot of money for a murderer only using Halloween masks, and in the end the costume of Jesus was also stupid. Oh, agony, do not see!
