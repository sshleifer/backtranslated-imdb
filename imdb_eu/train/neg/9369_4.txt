Although I heard a bit dry, Scott Bakula saw everything. At the beginning of this film, I had a great, hopeful and classy-looking Scott-get-girl and finished 20 minutes before. it will go great. The plot was crazy and unexpected and very clear. I would continue to cross my fingers and all of this would be a misunderstanding, until I was getting rid of the credits and I realized that it was not happy and happy. Unfortunately, I felt I was let out and I quickly jumped off giving a quantified leap to Mr. Scott's good reputation!
