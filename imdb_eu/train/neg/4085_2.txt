"Sir" John Gielgud has to become senile to be a star like a movie like this. <br /> <br /> That's right, I think one of these films is considered "art", but do not mislead ... It's rubbish. You can retain "art" that you can admire in a frame, so that movies labeled like this fake are incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> In this work, Giegud recites Shakespeare's "The Tempest" while camera cameras are perforating. Naked people, one of them is the baby that is swimming in the pool. Wow, this is a true and authentic stuff "art", is not it? This is an example. Most of the story is meaningless, it is impossible to continue, so liberal critics fear that they do not "understand" when they give them great value to save their false egos. Do you want to read her books?
