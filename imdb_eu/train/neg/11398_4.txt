I especially saw this movie as Brooke Burke (like Jill's), I briefly found LA in a commercial model in his first feature film. I was looking to see more of her, but she thought she had a very good job. It is a beautiful and fashionable television client and, as it is not a model, it was not surprising. He asked me why they killed him and what happened. Maybe I failed. <br /> <br /> I was not sure about the genre of this movie, and although I like actors it was a university audience. I tried to keep an open mind that I was not thinking about the favorite horror genre, but I felt like I had overcome the gag. It seemed to me that they were dragged in some places, to guess what power the evil teacher had in certain places, and like other films, as they had not been fully completed. <br /> <br /> After writing two scripts, I know that many of them are difficult and maybe even go to personal opinions, how many movies you've seen and learned, and what you relate to at any moment. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, I thought it was interesting, but not a pleasant and endearing plot for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) returned to the portal and would end up stealing all of them and score higher.
