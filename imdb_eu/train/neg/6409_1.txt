I saw the movie yesterday ... I can not believe in this site's opinion. Those who give more than one star must be Buffy fanatics. Well, I am Buffy's first-class fan, but I know that. At all levels, this film is horrible. Technically, you often do not know where you are in this movie, even in a scene, poisons jump crazy without reason. In terms of cinema there is no logic. He is emotionally silly and tries to be a psychological thriller when confusing. The wrinkling of red films is a cheap way of transmitting "atmosphere". Before the last act, I had a much longer time without him without patience, but it was very fun for my friends to turn MST3K off with the riffs. After leaving Buffy, SMG has 2 successful films, although it lists "Scooby Doo" resume. Gellar is a good actor, but probably (or his agent) can not find the vehicle. And Mr. Shepard, if you have trouble paying your mortgage, I'll send you a few if you promise to re-appear in such a movie! (Also, Patsy Cline's real estate property should be defamed!)
