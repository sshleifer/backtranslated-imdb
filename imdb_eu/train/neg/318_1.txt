I stole this movie when I was at college again. I tried to see three times, because the second wanted to see two friends. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard the movie, but it's fun, it's fun." Wrong! I can not see this sinking cigar after dreaming of boxing / insult against boxing, where smoking your zinger with good zinger causes your physical pain. You would think you're terrified of a horrible comedy, but you know it after seeing it. I'm not paying for that movie. I've seen Steven Segal movies and I've seen roundabouts twice ... but I still can not see.
