If the scale is negative, I'd be happier. Sushmita Sen's look was nice and Nisha Kothari's bright future, but the producer and director destroyed the enjoyment of this story. The selection of angles, everything about lighting and not trying to remember what story. Oh, first of all, if you do not have songs or dances, you can rip your ears from your head. The movie could take up to 1.25 hours and it was quite good, like "The Seven Samurai," but the director and writer did not go into the direction, although "the people" finally sought and helped to find the spine. This movie fails at several levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, script. They name the parties of any movie - it was DAD - probably, the host food was also bad. I've never seen in Indian (Bollywood) movies seen 6 years ago to see something wrong.
