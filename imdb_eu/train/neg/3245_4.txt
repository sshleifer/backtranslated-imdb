Many debut films by David Mamet have been denounced as a real movie of thought, a film that questions everybody and everything. I recently saw it recently and I could not understand it so much. <br /> <br /> She is a psychologist at the Margaret film, also a beneficial seller. Margaret has become disillusioned with her profession and with the help of others. He tries to correct this, helping his patient to settle the debt of the game, with a shark called Mike (which Joe Mantegna plays, only to see this movie). He immediately learned that Mike is a really trusting man, after almost encountering him, he is robbed of immediately after being acquainted. He is shocked, when he sees it, he returns and asks how to show how dealers work (that is, when they want to use the topic of a new psychology book). Then he falls and helps him in a long engagement with him and his associates. <br /> <br /> I do not like to go to the details, but it is revealed at the end of the film. The event of the entire film was made by Mike and his friends to make Margaret exchange more than $ 80,000. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the final big tour was predictable. The couple presented their scenic appearances and curious lines. Not only this, but the audience (and the main character) know that they are against men, so it's really surprising that Margaret is the same? In addition, Margaret is an intelligent psychologist who is well-known expert in reading, and yet, she allows herself to be very easy to read, and to bear in mind, Mike knows very well that he is believing. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Margaret is thought to be a link to the beginning, but eventually, to be able to work, he had to do something that man could not do. First of all, he decided to help solve the debt of his patient, first of all allowing him to collect men. If it had not done so, all failure would fail. It's quite reasonable to think that a psychologist should not settle a patient's game debt alone. Not only that, but what are the accounts that the man decided to appear in the right place the same night? They only came to that bar every night, hoping to see them? Another thing that can not be predicted was that Margaret was forced to go back to see Mike again and taught her trade tricks. What happened? And yet, the whole concept is based on this premise. <br /> <br /> I had another problem ending. Margaret knew that he was aware and Mike decides to take revenge on his revenge. Initially, Mamet leads us to believe, but that falls, so the final end is down to a gunning Mike airport luggage area. In a way, he felt himself ineluctable to finish the movie about his own profession. Not only that, but he did not recover his money. <br /> <br /> In the end, it leaves the movie blank and it does not complete it. And I, just like myself, had predicted that Margaret would be linked to you, you will find it just enough to satisfy this revelation.
