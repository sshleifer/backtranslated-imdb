Rescue: From 10 to 10, Groundhog Day will find a movie of the Christian Coalition. It may well not be bad. Shut up <br /> <br /> Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) has been killed and perhaps killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry is very threatening and wild). I say maybe it wakes up and everything was a dream ... Or was it? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The basic problem of the movie is that these fifteen-minute plots (the first time it's done) is repeated. And when Claire wakes up and every scene is a dream or a substitute reality clearly, I stopped to watch over Claire and I wondered what next twilight would they have to throw together. <br /> <br /> I was promoting a session (honestly, it would be more sensible), but obviously one of the most obvious wandering sorcerers (Think the Village or Below) has come up. Yup is faster than Donnie Darko's director. In the Sixth Sense horror films, the original Invasion Body Snatchers, Happy Birthday to me turned all major tours because public audiences were not expecting an explanation on the left field. (Clearly, although the canoe ended Friday it was worth a shake in the 13th) <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the rescue screams with all the scene changes. Other shameful deeds are the soundtrack to the piano note (although dramatic songs were worthy) when it is clear time (Claire's dishes, Claire's mother's sub-sections), as Claire says that there is a series "everybody there is there" the killer around. <br /> <br /> At the same time, some of the playwrights (Claire's mother, Maureen Olander, who looks like Mary Mary's zombie), the first actor shows the low-budget roots. <br /> <br / Two halves can be too light and not nearly clear. The rescue maintains your interest in seeing how this mess is resolved. The problem is not really.
