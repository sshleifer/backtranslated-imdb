Roger Corman is a small budget, horror / horror movie. A DinoCroc is formed when prehistoric genes are handled when amoom runs. He dies the first machine of machinery, and then manages the taste of man and, after escaping, becomes a rapidly growing terror. There is no character at all, but they are not the focus. Two of the two giant dinosaurs and a few of them will see some of the best "killing" scenes in a small budget movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is three confused characters. It's a dog with a legged leg and croc becomes food. Nothing left the dock, but the feet of an ankle. Highlights are the roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. Pathetic Matt Borlenghi and Costas Mandylor cros is a professional hunter professional. I was very impressed by the fascinating Joanna Pacula, as doctor P. DINOCROC fears fear as if it were pickling.
