China's critics and Chinese fan-makers voted for China's biggest film, and I'm not going to say anything about it. When I saw it, it was one of the most generous melodramas that was unfathomable, directed and performed with blandin, for a main character. Wei Wei (not laughing), has been a married woman, married to her husband Tuberculosis (Yu Shi) in recent years. He is the descendant of World War II, and he lives with his younger sister (Hongmei Zhang), who has not suffered a lot of money at home (when the rich man was married). Close to each other, the husband's boyfriend (Wei Li) is old as the wife's boyfriend has been a teenager. He thinks he's escaping with his husband, although he does not know his husband, he thinks that his little sister might attack her partner. This is the configuration, and there is no place where you do not expect. I have seen the remake of the director of the Blue Kite, Zhuangzhuang Tian. It's half an hour longer, and it's really dull, but at least it's pretty. The presumed classical one is quite unbearable.
