I saw a movie I thought I spent almost two hours, with all good actors, that it was worth seeing. I could not believe it when I finished the movie and I absolutely do not know what happened ... I was fascinated to use this time for something else ... I tried to figure it out, but it really did not have any idea. Thanks to those who gave thanks and explained to all those who ... well or wrong, is better than knowing nothing! Who was the dark movie woman, when we saw her two times away? How did the First Medal know that his husband was cheating? At the end of the film, Kat finally said he knew the truth. Does this mean that we will end the game 2?
