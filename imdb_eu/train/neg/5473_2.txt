I have never seen one of these original SciFi, this was the first one. In my opinion, correct, directing / producing, set designing, and judging CGI effects on CGI fictions is fair. Comparing with Hollywood's typical production is unfair. However, I can say, in general, that Azteka Rex was not the master of Werner Herzog's Aguirre, God's anger. <br /> <br /> To start, I will assure you, yes, I confess that this movie is. More cultural collision with dinosaurs. In addition to being a TV movie fiction movie, the story I am going to explore is an underlying context. Internal symbolic elements are sufficiently evident. As a result, I learned in history, theology, mythology and film: it seemed like an aggressive conversation and plots. I do not ask my guilts in the name of the producers - as I said in the movie. But I'm worried that a large part of the demographic youth of this movie probably rely on television to offer lessons about history and cultural diversity. <br /> <br /> The main problem is obvious with the character. Ayacoatl (it's not a comment on Dichen Lachman's interpretation, but how he wrote his character, though I'm saying that I have to do a job to get Emmy's effort). Through its nature, European Spanish actions are justified. Function in Rios The interest in Rios's love affirms that Europe is a good way because it is European. There is no other reason. Actually, the viewer intends to bring the Aztec to the connection with Europeans, who knows more about Aztec dress, language, ideology, etc. - so the Aztecs are contradictory and 'backwards'. Â» The viewer is not only the viewer of the ethnocentric perception, but the story seems to be trying to make the audience's convention - if Aztec was not able to get a plan - it's not better - to kill a dinosaur, punji sticks on a bed. <br /> <br /> It is true that a Spanish subgroup is represented by merely robbing the temples and their persecution. MesoAmericans. There is also a scene in the Christian holy man, considering Aztec achievements: "Agriculture, medicine, calendar, etc." - In the end, the Aztec warrior is still depicted as the main antagonist of the film, even more than in "thunder" (later). He portrayed a portrait, double and romantic European Spanish, trying to consume consumed mushrooms for a hallucinogenic head - an important spiritual ingredient for Meso native and semi-American religions (again later). She feels that she can feel far away from her and Spanish. <br /> <br /> Now when we are studying the true nature of the story (revealing Christian issues on the table vs. the Gentlemen's issues) from a symbolic point of view - viewers can call trumoi muscles as a representative. In this philosophy, it is the Mesoamerican ideology / theology, that is to say Is it portrayed: blood, compassion, cruelty, evil, perhaps evil? On the other side, this group of Christian walkers, led by a young Hernando Cortes, portrayed as naive but noble generals in the dark world of the Aztec world. Also, the name of the movie is Azteka Rex, who thinks they are dinosaurs. However, the Aztec Rex translates the Aztec king, the head of the Aztec state or the head of "statehood." (That's why the title of the movie was changed). And so, at last, we see Aztec as a new king? The rest is Spanish, Rios. Aztec Rex is a new European ideology, referring to diseases, blood spills, war and hunger, which are native to the Americas. Rios symbolizes European ideals - as the presenters of this film would have to remember (Cortes wants to point out the 'practical-yet still noble') European. When you look at the American Holocaust, to tell the truth: is not the symbolic component of the story of this movie backward? <br /> <br /> Azteka Rex is worst a bit racist, or should be aware of it, ignorantly. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know it's just a movie. I understand everything to be fun, but at last we thought Rios was the father of the last Aztec lines? I wonder what the origin of the Mesoamerican people would have to think about this end ... about myself, I thought it was a bit indulgent. <br /> <br /> The best movie helmet plays Ian Ziering. It's obvious - at least changing the look of Ziering when I was watching the 90210 yuppie, I brought many conquerors into the heart of darkness. Ziering really proves himself more capable of being an actor in this movie, I actually bought it, or at least I forgot that Ian Ziering was anyway. I do not know who his agent is, but he needs more work. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's been nice to see Jim McGee again. I was a fan of the Scrooged scene-robbery in 1988. <br /> <br /> Alexander Quaresma - DeusExMachina529@aol.com
