And I thought it was a bad beach, one of the biggest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Do not blame yourself for some awesome screenplay, if someone has a sense of cinema, give yourself up in the background. The cross between the Village and crappier script. Its start captures beautifully, and then, as the plot progresses, it does not make sense, and do not start to finish me! What was that The only thing that creates this movie is Nicolas Cage's usual humor and amusing fun in a fun state. If you go to a super-production and this is the only movie you want to watch, save $ 5 and go back home and turn a flame on it, and some wonder why I'm just saying the easiest thing to keep in mind. and you will go there!
