In 2005, he gave us a "fancy gore porn" shelter, and he gave us Live Feed in 2006; The hostel is not so decent. Live Feed continues the same formula as the first movie of Eli Rothen, this time the boy's children are just like in Europe than in Asia. Plots are directed to these dumb, one of which has annoyed the locals, to have trouble. They decided to block the locals from the theater and kill them. Although I had heard a few things about this film I watched, I expected that I could still be at least half decent, because Ryan Nicholson's director made a 45-minute rape and honest revenge on 'Torched,' but that movie falls, because most are ridiculous or boring. . The film is trying to get back to the good times of the old Grindhouse cinema (the hostel has done well), but it does not really come out. Surprisingly, taking into account the previous works in Nicholson's special effects, it's even less spectacular ... even if it's much better than playing it! I can not say much about this movie ... it's bad and not in a good way. Avoid it!
