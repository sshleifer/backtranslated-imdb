Waste time Film begins as Saw's clone, but it's worse. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely horrible. Endless is ridiculous and the story does not turn out, it's not surprising, and it's just a bad ending. I liked some of the characters, and I expected that everything could end up in the end. It just will not happen. The total "Wrestler" does not end up with this good performance. I can not believe that I'm seeing that time. It's not "funny" as many people say. A man in Maska forces them to kidnap and imagine people who are connected. It's a long stretch of connection and, first of all, he had to shoot the main actor.
