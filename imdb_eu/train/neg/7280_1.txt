The review of this program will be as short as possible. Jump. Low budget, not fun and inadequate. As bad as writing, it's still bad. You need to know all this, but I will continue to write it without any need. <br /> <br /> It's a movie in three segments, each parody with other movies. With this specific idea MUCH funnier is a movie "Movie Movie" with George C. Scott. Very dark, but worth looking. The MM movies of the 30s made a parody, making elegance, precision, and dryness. <br /> <br /> This movie was not there. At the end of the 70s, at the beginning of the 80s, he made an alleged three-part parody. Only (I have hardly ever heard) the movie makes sense. The first is, I think, a parody of "Kramer V Kramer", in some way. Peter Reigert does his best with the deed of dirt. The second is a parody, I do not know what ... Danielle Steele's novel? I mean, can you watch such a story on Lifetime TV, but in a movie theater? I mean, I remember in the 70s, I was there. This is a parody-opera parody about a young woman who binds the power. These types of things usually parody, so I do not know how this was necessary. <br /> <br /> In the third segment, "Municipalities", we are somewhat easier. I have indicated some elements of "The New Centurians" and "Dirty Harry", both of which were created for almost 10 years. Yes, nice and old. Robby Benson plays the ideal young rookie (senior wimpy), Richard Widmark, who acts like a senior veteran of the police who drinks Whiskey sitting in a police car (OH! Stop! My sides! It's really a police car! Not in a hurry!). Consider this "Animal House" The first film was added as "National Lampoon". Wow It must be thrown five years off from this stack of pimples, it's amazing. I was able to continue selling the vanguard of one of the most avant-garde and original voices of American humor (National Lampoon, its first 10-year magazine) to begin with. Slow and slow slip to a world where there is no longer the magazine and only exists as a trademark for low-budget "comedy" movies. Capitalism (and cocaine) is another reason that continues to be very bad. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film has a bad time. Do not waste 90 minutes. I want my back. Quite a bit, it's Fred Willard!
