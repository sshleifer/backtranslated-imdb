I'm Scooby Doo where you're grown up and I still love it. Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and Pirates and Tom and Jerry are a cartoon. This show is good for the children, the voices are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are superb as perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), the subject is a tune tolerant and enjoyable animation. However, it is a disappointment. I usually do not like Scrappy, but it seems like the main character, it's boring quickly. Puppy Power's slogan, Scrappy is more annoying than usual. Half of the gang is missing out in the first year, so to speak, was not Scooby Doo. And the jokes and story lines were generally sharp and abominable, untimely monsters or evil people were continuing. In the end, they are not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: get a clue, but this show is a disappointment. 4/10 animation, voice, theme tunes and children's pleasure. Bethany Cox
