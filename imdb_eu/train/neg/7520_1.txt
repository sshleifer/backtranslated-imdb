This movie proves that it can not judge the wonderful outlines of the DVD. You have shown that you should learn more about a movie you want to buy (or get it with Christmas). The start of this movie seems really promising. Well, until you fill in the characters. Pumpkin Jack (a guy down the street) brings a book full of witch releases, a book that leaves him in a haunted house every year (where the movie is). Then there are some soft soft drinks, fighting and core softwares. After that, the action of the movie is done over an hour. <br /> <br /> In general, Hallow's ending was predictable, nonsense and soft-core porn reminder. This movie probably has nothing to do with a group of friends with no better idea because it's a fun movie. For the first time, it is very funny to make the predictions of people who die.
