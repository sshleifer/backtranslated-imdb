I do not think Van Damme's movie will ever sting the universe's soldiers, but you do not know. This movie was good, but it was not as good as it was before. VD returns with Luc and needs to fight again. He tries to try two fun attempts here, but maybe the wind is worth it. VD is currently a child of Ally W. He showed one of those good ones 2. He was the Goldberg, who makes his famous move, I do not know what motives they called me. VD and Goldberg had some great battles. The last one was 1, but it was not so good. VD makes his best career in his career, as always: HELICOPTER KICK. However, the final end should be longer. However, it is worth seeing, but it will not be the original.
