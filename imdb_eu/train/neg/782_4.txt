Due to the wicked attack by George Lopez, the show is horrible. <br /> <br /> Never had fun with Mr. LÃ³pez. I saw his stand and I never had to laugh. <br /> <br /> She finds herself as a vengeance and her love against her is derived from all the pores of her body. </ B> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> This man will not end. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry to feel that this show is only for the Spaniards to represent themselves. <br /> <br /> The plots of shows are always cookie cutter with Hispanic accents. <br /> <br /> Comments scattered comments and scenes. <br /> <br /> Why play this show from 2:00 am?
