This movie is very awesome. Unfortunately, it is not because of filmmakers waiting for <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is also a serial killer magician, but it is not horrible. It's just your standard comic rule, the cross between Hannibal Lecter and Freddie Kruger, though not in a particularly cool one.
