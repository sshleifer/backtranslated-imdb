RUN ... do not go through this movie !!!!! It is aimed at very young children, it tastes the movie tears. Although the Gamera trilogy of the 90s was rising, this film fell. It's a slow pace and the monster is a good fight, but it's seldom seen. This movie was dry in the boxes in my box. The offer is very poor after a brilliant 90s series. <br /> <br /> ABOUT THIS OFFER PASS !!!!!!!!!!! Here is the top 10 event in the 90s Gamera fans will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. A mother of this movie, after fighting for her mother's death and losing her baby in Gamera, is a drama to face when her parents are dying of adult Gamera. At the beginning of the movie, maybe you will see the adult Gamera for a minute. He got his butt Gyaos some and destroyed the car ??? It's old and cheerful. Moreover, it looks like it does not look anymore. The clothing was cheap and fast. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The young Gamera you see in the whole movie It looks like Pokemon. It looks great and nice ... Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla 2 will remind you of the baby Godzilla. Now Gamera is very nice. <br /> <br /> 7. This movie is seen on a NASCAR race during a 3-hour rain delay. I watched this movie with 2 other Gamer fans and nobody was happy as this film progressed. People who are climbing up the road to the mountain have seen an Amestoy made of fat. <br /> <br /> 6. As Godzilla: Final Wars, this movie was a very small kaiju time on the screen. Final Wars was much more, really, and even better in the fight. <br /> <br /> 5. Children have the title. The boyfriend of all children and the handwriting in the 1970s is the death of the original series Gamera and the story is repeated in the 2000s. The most successful Gamera movie was in Sesame Street and went to a darker place. Why return the formula failed? This would be a new trilogy and the wrong sales of revenue killed the hope of following this story (thank God). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera lost its sign symbol. Today, it feels like an elephant with a strep throat. <br /> <br /> 3. This movie can create a new Olympic event ..... Imagine a relay race to send you very little children without any means. You need to see the end of this point to understand. Where were the parents Oh ... well, sending your children into the kaiji battlefield. <br /> <br /> 2. The special effects were good, but the sub-team of Gamera. Legion and Iris were better effects. The best effect was to show the apple-sized Gamera fly. It is not very impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This movie is not what adults expect from kaiju fans. The director attended the Power Rangers and shows. It's like a cross between ET: Always: Sunset Street Third and TMNT. If you know all the Kudos 3 references. <br /> <br /> Rent at least once or buy it once you buy DVD purchases.
