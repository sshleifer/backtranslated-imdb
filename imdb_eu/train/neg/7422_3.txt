Well, I can not get into the plot, but maybe it's just for me. The cameras are sometimes empty movements; However, this film has a charming vintage quality. This rhythm is true at some moments and occasionally with the chase sequence. Klimax was shuffled and disconnected, but still ... with Stella Stevens. <br /> <br /> Footwear are of interest, especially in the 70s on the back of Las Vegas. There are movements of some camera made by hand, and he thinks me a bit. But I do not believe that I still follow the DVD.
