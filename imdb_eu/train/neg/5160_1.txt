You will get a gift. Excellent wrapped Kutxa is one of the best hand-made steel lenses and shows the smallest detail. Then, it is wrapped in beautiful paper, handmade paintings by handmade talents. The whole thing is made of silk lace-up ribbons. It's like watching. <br /> <br /> Then cut the tape, rip the paper, open the box and find it ... nothing. That's TOYS. You enjoy the boats, or forget about it. <br /> <br /> The movie is not its purpose and purpose: War is not a good thing. Well, is not it original! Moral is so evident that it is almost unbelievable. What's more, the war was especially emphasized by the fact that bad toys were, above all, an upheaval, and the film simulates warlike innocuous toys. It is like someone who preaches a sharp and sharp sermon, just like "jokingly". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Like, the movie closes the study. Yes, the sight of sight is a remarkable and striking image. Imaginative multimedia captures colorful scenes imagined cinematography. But the images are cold and emotionally sterile. Like the script, the movie is a wonderful look and sometimes aesthetically barren and surreal. The toy is a movie that praises wonderful and special things, but shows that it is a creation of an empty and cold world. The movie wants to be fun, in a dull way, but humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, a successor to a toy manufacure empire, threw it into his shtick books, rather than a strange, cold-styled world that lives there. In fact, the topical reference and scattered sex promotions are very much in conflict with the children's fable children who are trying to make films quite unfavorable. To make this film, or to make it sensible, it must be set in its own universe, a remote Oz of Kansas. When the jokes go back to reality, the movie toys are becoming more and more evident. <br /> <br /> Barry Levinson's director's project said he wanted to do this. for ten years. It's clear why he was helpless to get in trouble. Just like the majority of the finished mascot projects (RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER and BATTLEFIELD: EARTH are excellent examples), due to the horrific director. Perhaps, Levinson directed and redirected TOYS so much that he did not get any new insights when he finally came to the sound scene. He has already died. <br /> <br /> Many pelicans toys are nasty, mechanical monsters and reflections. So it's the same movie.
