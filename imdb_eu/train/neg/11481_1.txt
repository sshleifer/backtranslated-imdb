And why did the protagonist, the scholar, the wise man cast on the ground, when he was ever in danger.

For this reason, why the main character refuses to make money and why the old man works like a dog that works the sense. If D-bag is a boyfriend, it's a long-term boyfriend, why a soldier is better. It's a good reason to be jealous and good reason to have a good reason to overcome the manipulation of his hometown and father. They are not all the characters that are elegant and others are "bad". How did they gather, however, a wine agent and sawmill?
