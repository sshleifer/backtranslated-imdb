It's a bad movie for any standard. The story of Match Point wrote intrigue and direction and a fascination (Woody Allen discusses his culture with his English classic murder and what can be done). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The ball, however, has no such thing. It's badly written, it's a wooden hope for both leads and the story itself is not of any interest. The genre of his own requires an explanation and explanations and explanations (why are the tarot cards and keys in the locked rooms under the French horns?). <br /> <br /> Allen's beautiful and awesome versions. Several Hollywood genres (Jade Scorpion / Curse of Cairo Purple Rose, etc.) have given us so much pleasure in these years. Although Hollywood Ending had the main idea. Unfortunately, his inspiration has left this moment.
