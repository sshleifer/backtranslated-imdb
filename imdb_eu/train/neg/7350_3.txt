Despite the bad reviews, I had to give this film. Ultimately, Shk Qi's super-horned HK and another 6 Eastern lovers perform all action as an interlibrary group of robbers. Are you surely worth seeing? Well, as the running of the bull runs, Martial Angels is hard to beat. Eye candy is good quality. Shu Qi is just as wonderful as ever, and the rest of the girls, including Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang, caught my eyes wildly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, to judge any other merits of this movie, Stinker is absolute! The story is weak, evil action and peculiar effects are pathetic. Clarence Fok and the producer Wong Jing gave us another picture. <br /> <br /> If you are one of the only reasons to see this Shu Qi, you would have a better watching of Sex and Zen 2. again!
