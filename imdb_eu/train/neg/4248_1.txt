This movie wrote mediocrity, laziness, and all writings. If you want to make a movie about a vampire that has been done for thousands of times, it's better to do a good job of a little girl. First I say that this movie did not cut. Some horror and horror films fail to "make a forbidden and fun way if all the stories are just stories". This, unfortunately, was not different, and as in every frightening movie, when you start from that road, it will not go back. <br /> <br /> And the end? How do the heroes work over and over the film, but they are mysteriously gathered at this time and they can not do it at the end? The end I wrote about a very opposite climate and part 3 I have never seen. Awesome movie
