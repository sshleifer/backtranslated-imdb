I should say that the "king" of Cowboys was ashamed; In 1948, the image was taken by Roy Rogers in the first film, and was the protagonist. Roy's character comes out in a modest way, as well as female co-operative Jane Frazee, Roy's and Robert Livingston's adherence, depicting Bill Regan's bad boss. The whole story seems like a bit of mixing, something that could be entertaining with something missed. For example, the legend called 'Hangman's Hotel', hangs out at midnight. When Andy Devine came up with Cookie Bullfincher, you would think that the story would get a bit of mileage. Instead, it would be better if some Bowery Boys movies were to be served. The deceitful hotel attempt under Genevieve was dull, rather than saying that Trigger's screen had more than one "Contract at the best movie". It is placed by a remote control. And then, with Foy Willing and his Sage Purple Riders, you will replace Bob Nolan and the pioneer children among music muscles. I do not know yours, but it was in the middle of the image and still I was looking for Pat Brady ... yes! <br /> <br /> However, there is still an interesting element here if you were hard enough to get rid of Roy's Trigger sports, which were still bad. Ok, surely it was a double excitement, but I did not see more than one in a Western Western fabric. <br /> <br /> Jane Fraze honors her image as a female leader, as she would do in four ways. Roy's other films in the 1947/1948 season. Under California Stars, he appeared as a cousin of Andy Devine, with Caroline Bullfincher. You are never quite convinced of what aspect of this story will come from, but it does not start when someone starts to shape it, and the guy begins to get on the side of almost always accidentally. <br /> <br /> <br /> The fans of old Laurel and Hardy would be amazed at how surprised James Finlayson was to be seen as a sheriff in Sintown. I'd like a bit of comedy written in his role, but he finally acted correctly. When I asked, when it was over, I could talk with Vanderpool (Charle Coleman) about the Cookies with me, but there was no reason. I think to close one way, as much as the thought of the rest of the image. It's tough to be hard, but even though Roy Rogers had enough, know that this was not his efforts. <br /> <br /> Say, Sintown - I wonder if Sin City was the place where it grew?
