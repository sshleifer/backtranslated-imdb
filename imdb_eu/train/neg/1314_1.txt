The worst part I've seen recently. There's nothing good about this movie. Plots are stupid, conversations make no sense, no sense of humor ever heard about humor. The actor does not play, they do not even try. The script is the same as Ed Wood and Uwe Boll in the same league. There's a good thing in this movie, in the battle. They are choreographed among the Hong Kong boys, and they are the only reasons to observe the Prince of the Sun. Although I assume that the battle is full of space, scriptwriters do not have to think around the story. However, you can stay away from this weird and absurd plot. Avoid Cynthia Rothrock if you are a fan of the dragon lady.
