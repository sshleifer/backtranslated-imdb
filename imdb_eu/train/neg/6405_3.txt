This is not a real plot, just a few short types of old templates. At first or twice I spoke. Although it's just 73 minutes, this film is a long-awaited and obsolete and tedious (because you wake up here and there you will wake up). Still a bad movie (and that's pretty bad) is a comedy treasure, with ANYthing, Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg (date movie, movie Epic, Meet the Spartans). In addition, the song sadly recalls the dull way. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 11 wounds, two bushes, 3 donkeys <br /> <br /> My street: D <br /> <br /> Code DVD red Additives: original trailer of this movie; and "Beyond the Door", "Dead Pit", "Farmer", "obsessed", "Power Play", "Sole Survivor" trailer and "Tremendous Taxi".
