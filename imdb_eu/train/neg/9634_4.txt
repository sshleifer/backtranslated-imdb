The ranking given by BOOM is unique to that of Sardina and Rome. Otherwise, this is the hard-fitting addiction of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (its downward phase) and RICHARD BURTON (its second phase). Tennessee Williams wrote "Milk Train Does not Stop Here Anymore" and he likes that adaptation of his play, but it was apparently the only one. Taylor hated him and Burton needed money. <br /> <br /> Either way, Taylor is a bean hill, Taylor sharpened and flashed on it, bursting to the waiters and exchanging a bad baby talk. When NOEL COWARD seems to be a visitor to another film, at the end he appeared. <br /> <br /> It's believed to be "sure to see" between Taylor fans. But if you are sitting by it without drinking, I'm going before. Unfortunately, this is how the movie actress seriously taken as Taylor as the film at the end, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton, he was equally deceived and called a critic BOMB. Decide if you dare to yourself.
