The plot seemed to be quite interesting. How can a murderous death murder of a real life become? Well, you can see "Wonderland" and find out. <br /> <br /> I heard the murder of Wonderland before I released this film and I saw the real story of the really sad people to be interesting. Unfortunately, there is a development of zero characters, so we never have the reason for this option or get the sense of the relationship between characters. The rhythm of the management was very boring. All this has a boring film. <br /> <br /> Dawn Schiller, a leading producer of Holmes's partner, was a producer, and that Holmes's wife was a film advisor, we should have this opportunity. to get some real vision of the characters.
