One of the most annoying films ever seen. I wanted to see it after seeing it. I watched this movie in America's History class, and its purpose was to influence the life of a Western peasant in the late 1800's. When we saw pigs shot and then they died, human birth, brand. Oh, and finally, the birth of a calf was alive and let me not have been bad at birth, but there were plenty of fluids in my room that most people took to the bathroom. The story itself is fine. The premise of the story is a widow and a daughter and they go westward to be the keeper of this cowboy's home. They live in a difficult life and it is interesting to see a detailed view of Western life at the end of the 1800s. But if you have an option, do not see this movie.
