He hates Everyone in the South may be mute, morally bankrupt, stupid, violent, religious nut or child molesters, the movie may be for you. Everyone is poor and apparently ignorant. In a scene, two-year-old men talk in a general store and say it disturbed their sisters before joining their shoes. The man seemed proud of his actions, and the other man clearly took the normal part of his life. Very nice. A teenager walks on the back roads that are looking for her sister and no one offers her help - although it clearly highlights food or lack of water (no backpack, etc.). Strathairn's character is not only boring and painful, but reveals that he is a believer in religion (which is Hollywood) that reflects the shameless character of Christians. The movie scene reminds us of Cape Fear (with DeNiro). Biblical verses promoted by a bad man. I'm from Iparralde, but this movie seems offensive to me, NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN ...
