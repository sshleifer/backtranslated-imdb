It's not around ... the movie is terrible. I've seen old Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu movies, I know the characters and it's the origin of the series, but it's still fun. However, the genius of Peter Sellers still shines with his portrayal of Nayland Smith's echoing with sadness, tragedy and stoic power; I have portrayed Peter Cushing's Van Helsing, but it's a play on Cushing's "Drakula" tenth on the screen of all the movies. BUBBA HO-TEP After the 1960 TV show, Avengers, the movie series BUBBA HO-TEP was a bit more serious. If you're Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers, it's something to be seen, but for everybody else.
