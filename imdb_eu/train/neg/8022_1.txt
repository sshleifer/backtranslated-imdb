I can see that someone thought a similar analogy, when I saw this film, was similar to what came to mind. The ingredients were said to be there, but there were no plots. Apart from the sexual scenes that are restricted by the pornographic edge of children (I think I could have edited or presented sexually threatening scenes more graphically), I would like a recipe for half that movie to be solved. List of ingredients, which are not collected in a finished product. From the beginning, the development of the characters and the stories are missing ... unfortunately, many times, we're talking about monotonous looping and thinking "Ahh-OK ... we want to know what the scene is going on ... or ... Who's it this character ... or maybe we will eventually know and value these characters ... or understand and share more with the relationship between these characters ... and so on. "But it's not such a luck! On the contrary, I was tempted to go off more than once, but I threw it all out. When the carrot was hanging out, finding only one W inside plots was just a ruse of harsh mini-land (and that's wrongly presented). Why I stayed at the end of the day is a mystery, it usually has better IFC selections and they have given 2-1 / 2 stars (another mystery). It's not that the characters did not like a title, or you could not identify with them or their entire society ... it could be much better than that. It seems that they have filmed around Santa Cruz and I was asking someone about the film school project. I wish I could give a better review, but honestly I lost an hour and a half frustrating and disappointing waste.
