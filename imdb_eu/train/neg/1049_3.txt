This movie has a great feeling on Broadway: backing, acting, "noise" and, nevertheless, that's it. The meaning of a Broadway without a bang. <br /> <br /> The movie is a slow pace, a different image, a song 'will appear' that reminds you that it's suddenly musical. <br /> <br /> Confusing: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Intolerable: Sinatra's fianc√©, surely, the pitch and the accent of her voice were not necessary. <br /> <br /> Beneficial: Mr. "I remember the numbers of my dice" <br /> <br /> Ready: Brando's song is low (it's very favorable!) <br /> <br /> Surprise: How much was Jean Simmons in Vivien Leigh Habana scenes? It's a bone structure! How would I die? Mrs. Leigh saw me playing the role of Brando.
