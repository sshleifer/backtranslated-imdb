Eh, not slasher flick particularly good. So-so, so effects, a decent yet known and uninventive soundtrack. <br /> <br /> There are three deaths that close a record that makes a pretty good scene, which seems everything goes. In addition, many people walk, without realizing what happens, or looking for red herbs; more time to die than people. There are other deaths, and the murderer is the same as a killer, it is not in front of any implementation. Similarly, the murderer is also innocent to kill the innocent. Personality is not revealed at the end, and the reason is quite thin, and it really does not matter. <br /> <br /> The movie is likely to happen in Christmas, but this is not an important factor. Christmas lights turn on a scene. That's it. <br /> <br /> It has a dark movie with a pale image all the time, at least I've seen. Some conversations have lost a bit in the opening scenes. It would have to be stronger than the end. We figured we were aware of what happened, although it is possible to do something else.
