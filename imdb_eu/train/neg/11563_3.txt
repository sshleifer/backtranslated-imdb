This Italian semi-horror movie is like a softcore porn movie and becomes a mystery among many mysteries to make it good and good. That's pretty dull and I really like this movie. . It is worth noting that there are many boobs that are spreading throughout the film. The story begins at the beginning of the movie when a young boy is arrested by a young boy who is starting to drive his cell, bend and seem to die. They nudity, but they never really murdered at the time of the movie. Then the guy will find a pleasant red head in a party, and begins with him and marries him. Evelyn, his dearly beloved wife, also has the red head he sees as he was. He also died in circumstances that should not be the business of the audience. Talky after a lot of scenes, the murder begins with snakes, foxes, and so on. At this point, it is easy to know what the killer is responsible for and what is the reason for it, then everything will end absurdly, which does not go well. This movie did not work for me, it left me with many questions and the last third of the movie did not have the first two-thirds of the movie boobs. Evelyn's death would have helped explain the movie as it emerged from Evelyn's tomb. The title given is not entirely misleading, as it ranks in the grave, but not on its own. Mostly lightweight is light, because the foxes are a scene and eventually there is a bit of blood. Mostly, I thought this movie was shameful.
