Blonde and Blonder was unfunny. Basically, the innocent girl version was Dumb and Dumber, but less fun, and too much background noise and music were used. BECAUSE THE WORLD'S BEST SOON AND MUSIC! It started to get boring, and completely inanan. He will not take it soon enough, and I feel like I'm feeling nonsensical. The only thing that saved me from this movie was the last 30. few minutes It seemed entertaining and interesting to me at the end, but that was the only part. Also, I could not help a bit like Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard's characters. In my opinion, he kept my attention. I would not like to avoid this movie altogether, but there are thousands of best films instead of spending your time and money on Blonde and Blonde.
