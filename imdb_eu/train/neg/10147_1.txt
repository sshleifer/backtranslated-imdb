I usually do not comment on anything (I have read other opinions) ... but this one, I have it ... I commented ... I'm sure I'm watching this movie like world-like events, F-117 and other tech-related things. but in the first few minutes and I changed my mind ... Lousy acting, lousy script and a great science fiction. <br /> <br /> The worst film I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Simply ... do not worry ... <br /> <br /> And another thing, Before I've done any movie, I've checked this user's comments and score on this site ... 3.7 points and I try to try this movie, I now think that I'm giving this movie more than 2 points ??????????
