STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The second part of Che's film takes the story late to the end. In the 60s, where humans have fought their resistance fighters in the South American mountains, without enough food and increasing tensions between water and groups. Everything crosses the border in Bolivia and the government forces the campaign to bring it down. <br /> <br /> Without moving between the time and spot movie, Soderbergh focuses only on the second half. On the action of the mountain, the experience is even worse. And more false, the score is dropped, giving the second part more airless to the air. It's just a boring film that never leaves the movie. You can not doubt whether Soderbergh's ambition or driving driver Del Toro was embarrassing to make things happen somewhere so badly different. **
