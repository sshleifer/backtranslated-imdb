Have you missed something here? This "adaptation" has everything that Brookmyres's first novel. Story, laughter, humor, political intrigue, characterization, plot and sense. <br /> <br /> Spoilers; <br /> <br /> Godamnawful, from the end. They made a mess of land, they had a love between Parablane and the police, and what was it all about, that Dr. Slaughter was depicted as an audience and who should be Annette Crosby? <br /> <br /> They seem to have done three-hour adaptation, and then shrinked 90 minutes later. (Although 90 minutes lasted permanently.) Please do not do this with other Brookmyres books (especially the "blind country").
