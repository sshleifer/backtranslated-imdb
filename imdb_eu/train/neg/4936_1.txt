I lost time and I gave this opportunity an opportunity. This should be one of the worst spectacle. If they have given shows that have sucked the prize, you should throw the category. The play is inadequate and the story is being worked on. Now the dinosaur was curious, but at least entertaining. This show lasted three seasons and eventually escalated. This new exhibition, based on ads from insurance companies, is not fun and really does nothing. Perhaps it's wrong with the original ads and how many times they repeat this show. He has come to the television and we are already tired of seeing peasant character.
