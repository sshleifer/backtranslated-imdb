My friend bought Â£ 1 for the movie, and then they were also very expensive. Although Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and great talented Burt Young are just as funny as making a movie maker, play directly with your ear. Barrika's tired of comedic techniques is tired - Sandler breaks down the fourth wall as he speaks to audiences and makes no sense of apparent sense of 'hot little girls'. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler plays a server in a cruise ship that wants to be a successful comedy to be a successful Woman. The comic resident of the boat - it is believed that it is unsuccessful due to the insensitivity of "Dickie" with the opposite genre, the Sheller gets a great break from Sandler's character. Dickie has not died, but the bathroom is locked, allegedly by the sea sick. <br /> <br /> Maybe in his mouth it hurts the worst film of all time.
