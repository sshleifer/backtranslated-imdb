As a movie buff, White Noise was disappointed, as a filmmaker, cinematography was pretty good, well-lit, good-looking camera, sensible directions. But as a movie, all other horror films that had just been overcrowded in the market were predictable. Despite the fact that the 'Chill factor' was a bit, the whole concept of E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) was not credible. This movie does not explain the explanations of some explanations, but has continued. The performance was far removed without portraying the emotion of the main character, like the latest thriller / horror film. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely not going to buy a DVD that I'm going to buy and I do not recommend anyone to watch. .
