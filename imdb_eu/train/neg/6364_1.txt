Absolute garbage, a 20-year-old van damme movie or an American ninja ... less combat scenes. <br /> <br /> Really true performance, like the whole movie, is not like a wooden sculpture. </ B> <br /> Look at this movie, which can be very bad, it might be acceptable in the 80s, but it's a 2006 movie, I do not have much love for the movie because it was not born in the 80s. <br /> <br /> If you like real fighting movies, watch the rumor and sponsor, these are martial arts. <br /> <br /> Laughing and seeing this unexpected humor today you can see what is serious.
