Inspector Gadget was probably my favorite cartoon of the 80's. I have enjoyed the first and second seasons of the series, as well as the Christmas Special Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas. Some of Gadget fans are being criticized for the second season of the show (1985), but they must be compared to 2002's "Inspector Gadget's Last Case: Claw's Revenge" 2002 DiC. . <br /> <br /> <br /> Being a gadget fan I could not see something that Gadget Boy had to do with sleeping See the Inspector Gadget animated animation option. I bought the movie, and I swore that it would be objective for me; I sometimes knew that artistic freedoms would be taken from series originals. I did not want to see yet. <br /> <br /> <br /> The round of the original show was not yet intact. <br /> <br /> Here is a short list of some of them. The bad reviews for this movie: * The song is not the original series. <br /> <br /> * Penny and Brain (originally in the series that was almost identical in Gadget mode) is missing 15 of this action. 20 minute intervals. <br /> <br /> * Saban & Levy's original music is not there, and the existing score is similar. (Understands that Saban is now a production company, but "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" has at least a good music, even without Saban.) * Do not expect Gadget Gadgets to be so enjoyable. -Popter, gadget-brella, gadget-mallet, gadget-coat (it was actually used but was not called the same thing), as well as its standard other hat and hand gadgets. In this movie, the legs of their device were telescopic, instead of the sources. Such things turn the true enthusiasts of the show and simply do not change. <br /> <br /> * The gadget with the original series now speaks quickly, supposedly, the "hip" convertible. All the fans of the original series enjoyed the van and vice versa of the van of devices. <br /> <br /> * The director Quimby is now very slow and even more so with Gadget. The original series was always grumpy, but this drives a little. <br /> <br /> * Penny no longer has a computer book. <br /> <br /> Is not it positive for this movie? OK, here it goes ... <br /> <br /> * Maurice LaMarche has done a good job to take Don Adams as Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> * In a scene, chief Quimby mentions a real criminals of the series of cartoons: Great Wambini (the classic "Gadget" villain of the second season, by Louis Nye). <br /> <br /> Are you looking for more factors for this filter? Well, you're not lucky. Life is making these choices and making life. Most of the life situations have an objective but they want to teach the lesson. Lesson learned here: Maintain the original formula! "If it does not break, do not fix it". Real Gadget fans must be clear from this movie; you will surely be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, DiC and Shout! Factory will release "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" after the first version of 2006, the first 22 episodes in the series. As an authentic hobby of Gadget, as the lover of many animations and DiC's 80's, 80's, I urge the viewer to "Watch Gadget: Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Christmas Sets". good memories
