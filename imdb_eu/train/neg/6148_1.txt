First of all, the movie was not reliable at all. I watched the documentary a few days before and the movie was not something like that. First, Nash was a math, and this is not to be a story about a man who has to be cured of the movie, and finally he found love. In addition, there are a lot of scenes where people are not well-known: where the scene of a bicycle was run at the university campus. In my opinion, Russell Crowe did not adjust to this part because he had no intelligent / individual type, so he could not really play. It would be very good that it was mathematician (similar to Pi) and not more than a lover. At this level, ABM was very hollywoodian and very superficial was also very good. Personally, I think that it was not stupid, nor even paranoid, and, if anything, people in that caliber know much more than "lesser servants." 5/10
