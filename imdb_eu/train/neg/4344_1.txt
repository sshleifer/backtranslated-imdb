If you hit yourself with a blade, write it with the script, you can reach the level of intelligence of this movie. There is no movie in a thousand other films and it's not much better in this film. Those who thought he was a hero called "Scarface" watched "Goodfellas", "Menace II Society" or "Dead President" and thought "MMM" "That's it for me!" I'd like the movie. I thought I would give him a movie opportunity, for a premise that was a premise. I'd better know after seeing Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs together. Everyone with 4th level education can be seen with the original Pacino, with a real actor and happy.
