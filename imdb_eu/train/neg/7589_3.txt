There is no script in what you start to do, and, consequently, the director can work. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they just did not say anything or react anything. The earthquake was also pretty bad. And I do not know how long the movie was to follow the novel, but it shows just two Jewish girls out of nowhere, so Arthur has a warm and friendly heart, but some stereotypes are nothing. And it also expels Camila in the wilderness, instead of returning to L.A., for catastrophic Catholic burial, at least it can bring flowers back and forth. Pathetic And L.A. The set was creatively created graphically. Nothing good The window of his apartment was real, curtains, sounds, wind. And Donaldson is always great. Since the physical Snatchers or Night of the Living has been dead.
