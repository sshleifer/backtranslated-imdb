One of those not one of those great documentaries. In Colombia, two guerrillas and paramilitaries, and two conflicting groups against the Medell√≠n villages. <br /> <br /> Weapons, drugs and death are exhausted. Boys under 22, not fighting in the middle of the war, are in prison. Girls? not women, girls ?? They will always react in the same way when one of them dies, with a cry and a cry. You have torn your head; what did they really expect? I do not know what is more worrying: night-time shooters and civil unrest, or everything seems like passively things. Or, seeing what that boy was drinking was not the first beer, what's up, 10? If one of these young men were able to move away from their situation and more, you should have more, how much would you choose not to stay? <br /> <br /> Based on this documentary, I'm afraid of everything.
