Someone had a great idea: Misty Mundae should make her own R-Lara Croft version - not just pulling up with two shooting guns, but also a topless one. It was really a great idea. The problem is that people who have been unable to create scripts or budgets. That's why we get almost a "movie" that is medium in length, repeating a lot of its parts (often slow), and is apparently shot in the garage. Misty Mundae's appeal is still unbelievable and incredibly beautiful and she has a natural beauty next to her. However, his two co-women here, with whom he shares a long lesbian scene, are not near his league. If "Mummy Raider" was presented as a Youtube video, I will rate it higher, but it can not be reached as a "movie" for DVD consumption by 1/2 a * 4.
