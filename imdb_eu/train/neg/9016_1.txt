Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi Channel (although I think it's called Syfy?) I have ever seen the movie. But since I've seen others, and I can say they are stupid, but this is really under the barrel. CGI is wrong, playback is bad, the script is ridiculous, and eventually it's not unexpected and there's no place (if you've seen Dragon Fighter, I'm sure I know what I mean, put a spoiler in my review). Also, this music melody was used in all the dangerous sequences. That was really stupid; they just play it. And definitely not the original; I know somewhere I've heard that (I can not remember where). This should be avoided.
