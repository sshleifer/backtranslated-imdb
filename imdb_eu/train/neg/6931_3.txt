A wealthy 1800-year-old is looking for a mentally ill neighborhood that cares for his ill-known physician. Despite being an initial hostile response, he is soon invited to good medicine and visits him. And, as the doctor shows, he speaks and speaks and talks! And while speaking, loonies run into mum here and there is no special productivity. There are some actions here and there (and some of them are quite disturbing), it's amazing how horrible and the brain is all - life and energy are missing, that is, a horrible movie of horror. Thinking of a chicken and thinking of dresses is quite tiring. After this tour, the more disturbing it becomes, after all, the detainees are taken to the hospital and tortured by their carers. Once again, despite this tour, the movie is alive in many places, especially when it is moving slowly, when it's just a curious ceremony or because it is just the group that surrounds people. The prison staff, starvation, staff can only influence the movie without any real impact. Considering this plot, it's hard to imagine being boring, but people who have made this cheap film exploit! Now, with the same plot and a writing, director, and executive director, this film could be interesting and worthy of a movie. <br /> <br /> You know, as I now think, this was the plot of a section. "Star Trek" for television! You know, "Lord Garth - The Master of the Universe" and this mad man of Kirk and Spock and his followers compel their pity. <br /> <br /> Last note: the movie has quite a bit. here and there includes a nudity and rape scene, so do not warn yourself. It's not for kids. In fact, the movie is nothing, it's not for anyone! However, in addition to the version of "50 Movie Pack - Chilling Classics", the print is so bad that it is very difficult to print everything that is very dark.
