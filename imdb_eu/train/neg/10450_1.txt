This movie was the worst movie I've ever watched since "Date movie". Instead of being afraid I was laughing at the whole movie. It was fun for the snakes to look for a specific part of the passenger body, for example, the eye, tongue, butt, chest. If we have seen the national geographic channel, the snakes will keep their body bitten. The snakes for each scene were bitten by travelers and struck the body of the person. I think the producer did not analyze the snake and their behavior. I can not believe my money wasted in this movie. So I do not recommend the movie trust in the dollar theater or wait until I wait.
