I still have to read the negative professional review of this movie yet. I think I ought to have missed something. At first intriguing, the three main characters gather late in the night, or else in an empty bar, and entertain themselves with invented stories. That's the best. After three different modes, the movie is divided into three parts. Then the boredom begins. In fact, the Felliniesque babushkas thread that makes doll-cheated dolls is an initial curiosity. Unfortunately, the director struck death by injecting a plot of land where he was going. Bottom Line: A thin plot of two hours. If you suffer from insomnia, you will see it in bed and sleep in good night.
