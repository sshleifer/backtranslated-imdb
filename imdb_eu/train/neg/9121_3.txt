This is not a horrible comedy, but it's very sad. He lacks almost no hesitation and loses the great value of production. There is a shaky end to end, Fu Manchuk will offer his dose of elixir to "Nemesi" and "he has been worthy of me, and now we can start again," he says. This scene, however, is the only reflection of the movie, at the beginning with the funny Kurt Burt Kwouk. (* 1/2)
