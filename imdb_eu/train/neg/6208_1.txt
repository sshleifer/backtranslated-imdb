There is only one word for this film. Appalling The director clearly has talent, but he casts all of Robert Carmichael as his character. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has a potential, but Cray can not use it. Drawing a little crime and then falling into depravity, it is the view of the British young Cray. Like the British tabloid, this film shows respect and respect for young people. Cray asked for help, but it's not worth it. The viewers are unaware of the cruelty of the world. On the toilet wall, like a piece of dark graffiti, the male body depicts male depravity. <br /> <br /> Some of the quality actors have small portions in this film. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville make two short appearances. The plays are otherwise amateur, Joe and Ben are overwhelmed by young men. Carmichael plays Daniel Spencer. Miranda Wilson brings Monica, the famous chef Jon Howon, Michael Howe; It is also a way to make it happen before such suffering. The film is never subtle and is treated with violence without violent action by Monica. War images are used to convey the idea that young men can not carry it out, that violent acts will also occur in "civilized" countries. This is true and is a symptom of our changing society, where men have positions with less and less importance, but Cray goes down to the male barbarian level, using violent and violent figures. The female characters of the film do not give relief. They are both victims, and in the case of Manville, their mother is cleansed. The community is represented as dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> This is Cray's first movie. I heard what he said in a Q & A Edinburgh session and it is not incomprehensible, but he lacks experience, and his film explains his ingenuity. The movie will be published this year, but I hope the company will turn it around without the need for this material that the public really does not need.
