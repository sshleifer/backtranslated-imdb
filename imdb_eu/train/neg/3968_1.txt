If you have seen the Brian Avenet-Bradley movie and the reviews on the IMDb, you know that most of the comments and votes are faked. NAZIONATU NI: you will get bored! People in the production team write their opinion (sometimes they even accept it). But that's not enough: they always click on the "no" when the movie is a negative comment. That's why negative critics always change. Believe me now! Otherwise, then you will believe it! <br /> <br /> Brian Avenet-Bradley is a good business man. Otherwise, it can not be explained that people who finance their films find it. (Okay, they are cheap, but anyway.) But as a creative person, it's an empty mistake.
