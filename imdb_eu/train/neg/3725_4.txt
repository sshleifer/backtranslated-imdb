It is an interesting treatment on the topic that is controversial (just read other comments about this film). It seems that you love or hate it and most people think that this distinction is made, if tribulation and endless times occur in the film. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie - and its sequel - made about $ 1.30. Production values ​​are the production values ​​of "Plan 9 From Outer Space", and the theater is at the level of "Glen or Glenda" (it is my forgiveness by Ed Wood). Apart from the religious message, the story is terrifying. Think at the most that something that might happen in the future of the story might be close, and it's even more terrifying. <br /> <br /> This movie and its follow-ups are not trying to try. Why did tribulations happen? "Left behind" and "Omega code" were all about "Thief" and attempted to explain all of the Middle East's policies and maneuvers. The net effect was "Thief", when he worked much better on the part of the film, he was trying to explain what was happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget politics and see this movie and what it's all about - horror stories. God makes them terribly frightening, God is terribly afraid. If you think about the topic, it has done the job - even if you do not believe it.
