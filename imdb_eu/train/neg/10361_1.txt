This ABC direct TV failure is not due to the great fantasy novel by A Wrinkle in Time. Mrs. Madeleine L'Engle introduced children and adults into a magical, fantasy and original world, unlike her. This novel, the first of its "quartet", takes on a beautiful life, universe and time. However, it is easy to understand any child or adolescent. Throughout the book, his strong tradition is prevalent. This adaptation is only seen as the attachment to the works of Mrs. Engle. True, what were you thinking about? The effects seem cheap and ridiculous, the plots are very different and the conversation is different. The conversation is amazing and it has lost all the magical features of the novel. This was a great attempt to take this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that one day an intelligent and honest conductor (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar√≥n) makes another book to take on the screen, and that really understands: masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared to boring, false and cheap art in the classroom, and it does not affect the audience.
