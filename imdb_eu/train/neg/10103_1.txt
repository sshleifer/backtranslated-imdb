I went this movie. Perhaps the title I heard was the main idea. I thought it was an independent investigation into the explosion of zombies, as well as attacking, grouping and zombies to attack the U.S. and alive lands. NON-DEVICE! A psycho-police officer about a woman with a weakened dying woman carries on what happens when a bunch of zombies climb from the tombs to get a good vengeance. As you can see, there is no involvement in a nation or region. Where our nation began as a result of cinema disaster. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, zombie women look like Victoria Secret, a dark eyeliner and a pale face. What are zombies, smart machines and cannibalists, intelligent and intelligent machine that eats them as a result of primitive basic needs? These zombie women walk like pedestrians and trackers, talk like black films, and they do not play like real zombies. Be sure to eat and die, but where is mindlessness and horrible desfigurement? It is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre, but laughs at this genre and asks: "why can not a beautiful zombie machine kill?" I would like to say that this movie is an indie movie produced and produced by garage verbs. I would not recommend this film to anyone who loves too much zombie genius, like insult and horror.
