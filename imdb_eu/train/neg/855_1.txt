Not the best movie currently watched. I read a lot of opinions about Shining and I expected it was very good. But the movie was disappointed. Sound and the environment were good, but there was no story here. There was no horror time. I was expecting a horror thriller movie, but there was no horror thrill. I scared the only scene the "scene" of the chapter changed. There are many parts of the movie. Most things remain unexplained to link anything. The story does not show us women or other scenes. It could be a good movie to watch in the 80's, but not XXI. In the century
