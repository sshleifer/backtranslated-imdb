This movie is bad. If you think of watching, there is only one decent scene in the movie and it takes around 5 seconds (Amanda Carraway's topless scene). The rest of the movie is horrible. I think higher theater plays have a better performance. The plot does not make any sense. The set was pretty penetrating and it was not good. It was very sad and very bad! I saw this in Starz, so I thought it was to be decent at least. The little description was so good. The girlfriend dies at the beginning of the film because she does not seem to have reason, after seeing the horrible video game. The scenes transition is very violent and just like someone is putting the clips in a movie. Just cuts from one scene to another, not smoothness. Randomly changing the name of the film change, explaining why the plot explains. In some audio, there is little point, it is hardly heard, and then there are loud voices in the movie. At the same time it's the same sound. This is the worst movie ever officially ever seen <br /> <br /> Event: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Story: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lame: 1,000,000 / 10
