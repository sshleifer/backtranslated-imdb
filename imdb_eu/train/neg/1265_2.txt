First of all I did not want to see the movie, the trailer gave me an impression of a common and promising movie ... but I found the amazing pleasure I had recently "Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité" "Laurent Tirard (" prête- moi ta main main ") was a well-written and well-written scriptwriter. I thought and decided that "Prete-moi ta main" would be as good as "mensonges ...". And it's not entirely. Writing is not bad, but it's not directed to "Mensonges ...", the actors are so generous (especially Charlotte, as usual) boring Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac. And, to be honest, I still do not understand the success of any failure, however, with that casting ... However, the story could be an excuse to create so many interesting sites, but it's not so good. Like Tirarden "Mensonges ...", even though he was written, an easy task, not surprising and lazy.
