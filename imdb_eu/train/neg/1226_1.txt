My, how did the rulers fall? Kim Basinger is an excellent actor, but it was definitely sharp when he took that role. This movie is mostly a bad thing: it overcomes the logic. Its appearance seems to be one of those films that could be appropriate in all the holes in the 80s and 90s, but in 2008 they are really stupid. The worst thing I've ever seen is I've seen Bone Collector and Twisted. <br /> <br /> Details of the story Details about Della (Kim Basinger) are making an effort to buy gifts. A group of rebels who have been killed by a policeman who has been assisted. Since then, one of those stupid goons is behind him, and he removes them separately with tool boxes full of tools. <br /> <br /> There are so many things wrong with this movie. As I said, the film overcomes logic at every turn and except Kim Basinger, the play is bad for television. Hell, this pseudo thriller is a bad TV. It is a blame for every mathematician who is politically correct (1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian and 1 African American who match a Caucasian woman, not just America). The way I killed Hispanics laughed me historically. The sex scene with the Hoodlum master appeared in the left field so as to be ashamed of the head. For lovers of bad films and I do not recommend anyone else. Kim Basinger's fans, especially, would not put this film on. Do you not want to watch an actor if you want to respect this movie? Of course, no. You were warned.
