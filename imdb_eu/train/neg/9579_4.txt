Here's a horror version of PISCILLA: DESIRE'S KINGDOM (they want!) Featuring Melinda / Mindy (RETURN THE LIVING DEAD OF THE 3) as a desert wake up by a warning bank by Clarke Candy, Johnny (Jason Durr). He ended the war on the border of the border bordered by Robert Englund, the sadistic prisoner (director, toupee). She and her pet pets are finally hiding at a petrol station, until their weather is dropped. Dogs become evil rats 'bitches' and Candy is talking a lot. In search of stolen robbery and many other incomparable numbskulls are added. <br /> <br /> First, Clarke is fantastic and explains what to do with that movie. You see and you will see someone who is very funny in slapstick scenes, very compelling during the horror scene and VERY sexy wigs and costumes, eye-popping, skin-tightly latex body ... and wonder how this actor is not a big star. It is very bad that the rest of this attempt to worship does not fulfill its promise. <br /> <br /> Sciamma, director and writer blame, who thinks that this extraordinary idea alone has enough to laugh ... but its ordinary gags. The toughest people and the stupid conversations are not the real representatives of humor. Another nail in the nipple; Movies seem like cheap, with many colors and drawings, surprisingly ignored photographs and desert places. Fortunately, it's in the film Sciamma Clarke, because it only sees.
