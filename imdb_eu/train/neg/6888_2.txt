This film is not intended, misinterpreted and misunderstood. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder is very annoying and can not escape from Napolean Dynamite's usual escape. Self-obsessed and ignorant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, although I like it in general, is a fool in this movie. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is right, but there is nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please leave this movie if you want to keep your soul.
