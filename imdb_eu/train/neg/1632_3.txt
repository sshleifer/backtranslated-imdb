Karin Mani (who?) The seemingly embarrassed project such as Charles Bronson, a hottie, lost his parents, grandparents, or something else to eliminate 'debris', and his karate abilities were astonished by young jokes. In order to stop a rape on a key scene and a moron is thrown into prison by HER, and so after a couple of cool shower scenes and after a seductive seduction of prisoners, the law must take their hands in their hands blah blah blah. I think there were a lot of such films. The script is common if you think it is generous. Manik is a type of research that will make his Death Wish debut, and I find this kind of occasional taste, but the movie is a bad device. The competent agents would lose themselves here, and would undermine actively the judge of the stupid fantasies and the producer's uncle.
