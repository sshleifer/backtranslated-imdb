I was in this movie. I chose Sheeba Alahani as the screen name, modeled at that time in Italy and I did not correctly pronounce my real name, so I chose Sheeba and then added Alahani to Alohalani. <br /> <br /> <br /> I never played before (and shows), but it was a very funny movie. Every morning they gave me "interpretation lessons" (obviously not very useful). They duplicated my voice (thank God.) <br /> <br /> David and Peter burst into a series of humor and jokes. This film never had to be taken seriously, that is to say, it was authorized to write taxes inside the information. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1 humor, but there it was "acting" for fun 10.
