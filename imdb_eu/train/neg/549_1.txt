I can not believe that the Indian film industry still puts this third dirt on Waqt. To start, the story is absolutely impossible? The spoiled son is thrown out of the family home, teaching himself enough. So what does it do? Immediately after winning some national talent talents making some leaps in front of a panel of judges (honestly I'm not joking here). Meanwhile, his father is a lung cancer but conceals his son, but he has survived to become a celebrity of his son, to see his new grandson and dress a new toy. <br /> <br /> Is it worthwhile to reflect? none of the main characters of this film try to persuade them any way. As in Indian movies, the family lived in a large mansion, and real-world concerns touched on. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the main losers of these films are smart viewers. The film made such a misconception. Actors, such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, will still be accustomed to those who do not believe in Bollywood.
