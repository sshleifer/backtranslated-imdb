Related to other Columbo movies, this can only be rated 1 (horrible). I really can not understand what other reviewers saw in this crash of a crash of a movie. I only saw the illusion of evil: to see what the director should do to see a weird or strange decision. Another reviewer suggested that Falken's sole management was his influence. role In fact, I think that the real reason was that the studio leaders had to be horrified when they saw what they had done with their money. It's amazing that they do not die.
