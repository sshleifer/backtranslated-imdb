What a boring movie! However, Nana Patekar only made Karisma Kapoor his girlfriend, but tried to escape from the village with her son. Does anyone say? The concept was not very bad, but it was poorly executed. The locals of Canada, and some of the local scenes, filmed well. However, in general, it was a short cinematography. It could be a great story, but it seemed like dragging movies. A person has a lot of stupidity, it's just three bloody hours. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole movie was "Ishq Kamina", which was only five minutes. Besides, the movie is like that.
