I have considered The Matrix as a science-fiction movie since 1999. I was given some time to talk to people. I thought it was original and sophisticated. I'm also responsible for Alicia Wonderland. I could never understand how I released Matrix. The Matrix Reloaded immediately released the DVD to buy it and watch it. <br /> <br /> Disappointment was too big. The array premise (the opposite of the film device) was clear. The philosophical premise of parallel worlds, alternative realities make purchases. However, I still bought it in the movie fiction film, if it remained strong in that genre. Unfortunately, it became a standard "to escape, to break, to rescue those who need to be rescued, etc." In order to make it worse, he came to be another martial arts exercise. The problem is that science fiction and martial arts films are two different types. Most clean, one or the other, the two mixtures do not work. It's like science fiction and love disorder. You can have one or the other, but not the film itself, or at least not the same film. <br /> <br /> Matrix Reloaded has solved these problems with Matrix Roles. The movies were at least thirty minutes, both sequential martial arts and long-haul. (This observation is ignored by the question of any negative review of the professional film: Neo Superman can do something about it, why do you want to worry? The answer is, of course, the demographic youth group, the theater.) Then there is a "love of depreciation" . Richard Wagner took over this land ten years ago. He was better at Die Gotterdammerung. <br /> <br /> So leave those who have left Matrix Reloaded. Martial arts fans surely guessed it through a science-fiction philosopher. Science fiction fans asked why they were sitting by the kung-fun party. Most men in public, probably, are bored by the stupid romantic aspects of the movie. <br /> <br /> What is your money to get a quote When you watch The Matrix franchise franchise movies: science fiction, fight? art or chunk? Each one does not create more than one of them, nor any movie enthusiast for fans.
