It's cheese Everything you want is a video game, if you look directly at sequences drawn from live action computers, shooting is really inexpensive to make special effects. This is. My friends and I had been watching for a long time, because the theater was empty and we were a bit closer. This movie really needs to be heckling. <br /> <br /> Plot? Was there a plot? OK, some giant universities or "later" are invited and go to one of the San Juan islands ("If they were going back to Seattle, they would stay alive"). almost)) to go. They get there and they all disappear, and the site has got a bit sunk (but still there is a vegetable garden!). With the help of a captain and an awesome coastal woman (a little harder than Cynthia Rothrock), they fight for a lot of zombies (some get acidic) and they have gotten a lot of legends. and mostly die. That's it. <br /> <br /> It's not as demonicus as boring, but not much, and even more severed (my alpha and omega are personal in relation to bad films - the first one is bad but fun to heckle, and the latter is just very freaking to see bad times more than once). On the other hand, if you expect a movie game like Resident Evil, run away !!! now run away! <br /> <br /> Okay, some important questions (without too much disaster): since the eighteenth century. Spanish shipyards from the 16th century entered the Pacific Northwest ????? Why is the smuggler gun in Pacific Northwest, and to whom - CANADA, shouting? Why it's not a big name (oh, forgive me, "island of the dead," shya, it's called right) Island of San Juan - and in the open air, still considering PACIFIC NORTHWET. And about 30 people attend: "Annual rumor", my patoot. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of cycling around. Many of them. They all have It must be a point of sale. <br /> <br /> Eventually, while the movie started playing with a little "parody" (I do not know what to do and I made iron), he did not go forward. enough close <br /> <br /> Okay, at last - a person with a randomly commented voice (no less than one voice) can "pay attention to his fiancé" to his fiancé. You can be sure that there will be fences at the end of the movie. However, there is no fence, but a couple of people are moving away from each other with the sword, however.
