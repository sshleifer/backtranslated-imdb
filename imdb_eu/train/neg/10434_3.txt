Did I do something or did the bad smell come from Daybreak 1 + 2? God was all there? What does God have to do with Science Fair? God's answer is just that if you do not think of a reasonable explanation. In fact, it is the problem with the series. Clearly, they could not create clear explanations about the questions raised throughout the series, such as how Kara Thrace was returning to a new Viper. His ancient viper and body ashes lived on the earth, why Baltar has an imaginary one in his head, why he has an imaginary Baltar in his head, and so on, "angels," or just do not explain. at all <br /> <br /> The last 2 episodes of land had enough to fly a wildlife. For example, why does Galactic and his crew make a suicide to save a girl (Hera), especially as Adam said, could he not try a rescue? Because they know Cylon's base location? This is not a good reason to sacrifice the life of the crew. And how did Anders know where to go? And what was the life of the main characters before the war flashbacks? They had to leave before they had forgotten something in the last minute. <br /> <br /> Those who wrote the last two episodes were not the same writers who created a great sensation until now. series Writing scripts was like the participation of evangelical Christians in the mission of extending "Word". Forget about trying to link loose ends on the plot, writers wanted to send important messages: do not put your faith in technology for your destruction; God is your last salvation (a lucky fortune if you have a severe illness that requires medical treatment). <br /> <br /> Imagine the latest film in the Star Wars series that "power" is not ... A Jedi gets power. Then, his spaceship enters the nearest star and lives in the woods with Ewoks. Would this be over? Not at all.
