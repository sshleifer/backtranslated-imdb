Tashan: The title explains the nature of the film. <br /> <br /> The films of this type are made for flop. What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces is that these films are not worth more than C-grade movies. Or some C-grade films have a better and more enjoyable story than Tashan. Fortunately, Tashan pretty much pushed him, he undoubtedly bombarded his ATM. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the most fascinating traditional flag of Yash Raj Films. What a hard-fought project was for Vijay Krishna Acharya to start a new one. Sanjay Gadhvi Dhoom tried to imitate his ways but eventually suffered. Comic books or cartoon movies that are unlikely to be viewed by audiences are similar to similar scenes. <br /> <br /> The story also loses its meaning and substance to the audiences' hearts to earnestly. In most scenes, Anil Kapoor reminds me of Rajnikant's Southern Tamil star in his body language and verbal expressions. I'm not a Saif or a fan of Akshay, but Kareena's prize would eventually go with Saipen instead of Akshay. I expected from the starting point, but at last I was distressed with my head. Saif is the main behind the whole adventure, while joining Akshay center. In any movie, the final should judge the story with all the characters and the prize or credit worthy. And Tashan loses that way and unexpectedly failed to succeed. <br /> <br /> Akshay does nothing to show his comedian talent, but he still reminds his previous films. He seriously needed to complete a new image for his fans, who would once again impress them. Saif made a great job at Race, and now he started to play his hilarious character through this film. But he has completely developed in the theater. And finally, but not Kareena. It looks really hot with a bikini dress and some of them complained too bent. But I did not think so, instead, it became bold. Yes slim !!! Women are a good factor in attracting older people (or, say, male). Next to them, it is very nice that Saif's son, Ibrahim, appeared early and that Saif was young. I also hope to make progress in its career. <br /> <br /> Those who love this Tashan want to confuse their minds or return to their childhood, or they mean accepting them in an asylum. The first director of Vijay Krishna Acharya, directed to the project that Yash Raj Films offers. In the future, the screenwriter should experiment and analyze at least 5 years before entering into practical guidelines. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I do not like classifying good stars for these dirty movies.
