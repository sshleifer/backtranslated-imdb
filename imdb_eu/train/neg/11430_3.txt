Okay, let me talk a new coin: polyphobia: the fear of poliamorets. This is only one of the feature films that make another one about three-person novels, that is, you can turn on a single centimeter and preach to find a monogamous solution that is so necessary and the only thing that is moral. Thousands of people only understand that being able to love more than one person, and that director does not have one of them. Bleh. <br /> <br /> Mark my words: in those decades, the polyphobia will be as big as homophobia, but guess who was very careful to realize this? On the right for the first time: the producers of this film. And he likes so much. Why do you make such a stupid and conservative movie like this? In addition to being openly unbounded, monogamy is becoming a sequential monogamy, which at the same time converts speed and polyamore. Open your eyes, people, please! <br /> <br /> This is a disappointment, what is rooted. (But, damn, I must say, Heather Graham is the best thing.) From 3 to 10.
