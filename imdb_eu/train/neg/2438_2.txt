This naughty ending of Koen Wauters's career was focused on "Night of Bad Taste". According to the commentary index, I was not the first and I am not the last person in Western Europe to learn this musician (it is definitely one of our best contemporary pop scenes, even if the Dutch have agreed). an actor Whether to try or not, whether it can not be judged. <br /> <br /> 'Intensive Care' is very enjoyable, but it seems to be uncomfortable with the participating movie. No one can blame. Verheyen's Hall of Fame is worthy of classification. The alleged Maniac incident suffered by the accident, but is alive and Wrathful is said ten times before, and even though a director with no original twists can deliver more than an innovative story and mediocre cinematography. /> <br /> IC meets a hospital ward and middle class homes. It's a sad rhythm. The tension loses the ultimate credibility of the musical score; In every aspect of the murderer there is a threatening melody; After that, the orchestra exits are dying, or, to a large extent, like a small budget. can do it The sex scene is free, but it's not so appealing. The Amsterdam couple could work. While we are talking about the couple's topic, the entire subgroup between Wauters and the baby does not work. A more effective emotional connection could be when the victims could be on the screen, which push the nerves halfway in half. I do not want to give other cast members the dignity of a mention, because they should be cut into small pieces. Actually, most people do it. What they remember most for the genre: beautiful nurse and two police officers. <br /> <br /> So, in a slasher, the cavalry has to be recovered only for recovery. (Anti-) the hero must take the evil one, especially through clear thinking, the old red cape often does not get part of these films; the invincibility that surrounds the killer can overcome the illusion. The return of the events, the death of Wauters, the doctor, has spared trouble. <br /> <br /> No people, I do not finish. This is not how the story goes. Wauters makes his heroic effort, but hits the "Angle Clock" near his anger. So it's up to the girl to get the killer drill and cross the doctor's head. Although this method assures death of the killer more than 9mm ordinary bullets, the doctor has survived to get the IC within 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Now, I would point it out. Intensive Care is a bad movie, only fans of Bad Taste can enjoy Verheyen's hard expression and do some of them to do so. For example, the mask of the doctor's clowns (necessarily) the parody value (Halloween) and the final opposite of the park (persecution at Friday 13th). <br /> <br /> However, let me finish the conclusion with a brief overview of some miserable items that give a little credit to IC. George Kennedy is not one of them. He has to undergo a monologue that has only been made by a PhD / French actress and will be terrified if he could drop a snake to make his name a great label. He could play his Naked Gun again, he would end up in a cow, but the screen was longer. It may be one of those last ones. I had never seen the fireworks that led to the fire, which he would push against a flexible barrier. It's a laugh. <br /> <br /> What should really be indicated about Intensive Care. Koen Wauters learned the lesson and offered it in his musical career. I'm asking you how many of the races in Paris and Dakar's races have been left before its senses arrive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
