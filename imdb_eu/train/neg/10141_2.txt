Steven Seagal, Mr. Personality itself, this time is the United States's largest Stealth pilot. The military is being asked to apologize (... who fled his memory on the base at the start of the movie, after being caught, one of the petrol stations that could break a group of robbers), if he was able to get a terrorist base in Northern Afghanistan, caused by a Black Lord's team Who has won a great fight against the Air Force. With John Sands (Seagal), a drummer who admires the traitor, John Sands (Seagal) flies into the enemy's territory, his Arab lovers, Jessica (Ciera Payton) and Rojar (Alki David), are on the ground. Jannick, Stone (Vincenzo Nicoli) has been kidnapped by Black Sunday leaders and Eliana (Katie Jones) is her female leader and Sands has kidnapped her as the kidnapped stealth fighter regained, but was rescued. And maybe Sands can betray the treacherous trained under Rather (Steve Toussaint). Sands takes 72 hours for the general's army riders to bomb the whole area. In confidentiality, on Sunday he supplied a biochemical bomb to detonate in the United States. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Films, especially machine gun shooters and dead bodies fall. There is no set up in Afghanistan (no Seagal and colleagues can easily perceive easily about the environment they perceive easily) and there is nothing in the plot. The movie has been released quickly, the camera is a little bit faster. Seagal was not as active as the hero once and his action scenes were well-edited, where it's hard to see his enemies see him, unlike old ones. One of Seagal's greatest efforts, and always as cautious (... not wonderful). Even more, it is disappointing that Seagal has never done a fierce battle with the main films of the film, which is shameful. It does not break a wrist or neck in a spectacular way (... we will see a little resemblance to a tool that is probably considered, but it's not like a clear picture, because filmmakers are editing so fast and dizzy spots.)
