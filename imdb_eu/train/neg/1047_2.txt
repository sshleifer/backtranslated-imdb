Someone told me why every movie that looks like poor people and pseudo-gritty looks somewhat "realistic" to some people. <br /> <br /> I do not see anything as a realistic character (even if the actors strove badly) or situations. Instead, I saw the effort, a self-conscious effort to be "edgy," "gritty," "down and dirty." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, much more need to be done without rhyming the camera manually. or if the reason and the film are not clear, in any way important for achieving one of the aforementioned features. <br /> <br /> A sad commentary on the independent state of film distribution is the only film that shows the interior of a movie. Theater is now a carbon copy, a bad cinematography, a camera that strives to pass the direction and "Art". <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, films like "Bedroom" or "Schmidt". They seemed to meanderers and very average, but compared to the number of independent clones like "Raising victor" Vargas, they are very bright and inspired. <br /> <br /> A few years ago watching an independent film. your originality and energy and care would probably be dealt with, and perhaps a few technical problems caused by low budgets mean that now you get the chance to get other numbers. -Shake-the-camera-for-for-two-time attempt to crush the likes of independent distributors. And, of course, to provide characters and situations that are totally unrealistic and transitory. <br /> <br /> Is it surprising that the independent market has fewer survivors? In any case, there are films like Raising Victor Vargas, who do not copy the worst movies that were before.
