This is definitely the worst thing I've spent. I feel like I've rented this "movie" movie to see if they really paid for money. This does not even value the litter. No. After a very dirty child, it is a juice that is found under industrial dumpstones that are particularly vulnerable to neighborhoods. Moving to trash the trash would be a hindrance. It was so bad that I had to register on the IMDb and I felt my relatives to notice it. This character by Luvahire says that the movie is great. Reality must be questioned. Let's take some of its comments and analyze it. <br /> <br /> "Ricky's actors (I forgot his name) did a great job." <br /> <br /> I see it. Well, if the director wound his audience up against Ricky's statements or alternately uncontrolled laughter, most of the directors wanted a darker reaction to their audiences; Ricky made a great job. <br /> <br /> "I have been a weekend-maker in the theater at my school and I had to cry out, I had to cry and it was not easy to be emotional in a scene. I give emotion to actors that need to make an emotional scene and turn it back. . "<br /> <br /> Wow. I also have to give emotional scenarios from women. Luvahire, maybe you should plunge into another line of work. However, they can cry. Watch the movie ha ha ha <br /> <br /> "USING SEQUEL" <br /> <br /> I was a theater teacher at school, I would only fail based on this comment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm too frightened to continue. Today, Mr. Bangla, my association, will turn to movies. <br /> <br /> Howdy! If you continue reading so far, I have watched the movie you have provided, and now you are looking for two things in this comment: 1) The exceptionally bad film that you accept is the poorly-used movie. 2) The extra exaggeration that you feel is that the good work of cinematography was a good cinematic effort to defend myself against evil. Whether you want to support the desire or the articulation of the ammunition, if I say well, it will be empty, so I am sure that there is little resignation. <br /> <br /> Here are some other negative comments that appear on this IMDb have already listed specific faults (such as playback, soundtrack, management, conversation, editing, etc.), but all of these errors. They will be easily forgiven, by themselves and by themselves. Few people will rent a movie called "Living of the Dead" if they force them to become higher. The final failure of "Hood", however, is to refuse the promise of its name. "Yellow Death of the Living Dead" almost jumped out of the storehouse from the shelves of the video store, with solitary lines and creative effects. Here was the chance to mix the gore cheesy realism of the zombie movie, gangsta-thug zombies bombin 'on routine rockin' innocent lives, while undead pimps drivin 'dying too many fake poets. The mix of both genres could be hilarious. Instead, films are like watching theater queues that send line-ups to middle children, but they do not understand. In order to avoid the betrayal of the video rental, Quiroz's brothers will publish the film with the following title: "Living of the Dead: home-made horror video in our film last weekend with a camera with friends in our summer." Or maybe it would be published as a documentary. "The daytime creativity has died: a low-budget film can still be considered as a clear or original thought even though it does not link to an important film image studio." <br /> <br /> The potential renter who does not have an interest should find the next video on the back of the video case: "Quiroz brothers have again demonstrated that seeing things that you can easily do is not that very interesting ..."
