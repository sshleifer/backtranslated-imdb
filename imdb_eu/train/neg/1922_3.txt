About the child: Why was not his brother supposed to change a bottle or some food or diaper? After spending many hours, he would have cried without much attention. Certainly, the stupid child was not having to take the child out of a safe place. <br /> <br /> And why was it that the road was terribly clear when someone wanted to drive somewhere? Did you not have fallen trees blocked on the roads and blocked? <br /> <br /> I can not imagine that the police were immediately behind the revolt, which would have been suspended, for a young person who would be suspended, especially when they said that. to go danger. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it's been nice to watch a movie so that children can safely watch for a change.
