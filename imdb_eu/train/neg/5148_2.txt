This image is a bit wrong, starting with the script and the redundant script. Courtney Cox makes a comic book of art that escapes to a desert town after being raped in two cities. Soon it appears that one of the locals (Craig Sheffer) appears, and it seems that Mickey Rourke is imitating third-rate imitation. D.B. Sweeny is a local police, supposedly, to protect and serve there. Meanwhile, is the script actually manipulating the viewer? Logic flies in the window for the first ten minutes and never returns, and there are no questions answered. If you think that "Blue Desert" could save Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. Its part is trivial, like the whole movie. - MERK
