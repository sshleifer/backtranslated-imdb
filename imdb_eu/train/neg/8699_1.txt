Carnosaur 3 is bad ... very bad. As pleasurable However, as I try to convince myself, I can not believe that anyone in this world could be entertaining due to serious reasons. I mean, the cover is bad! OK, the special effects are quite hilarious. These "Carnosaurs" are very hilarious. Scientists tell them about the fast moving soldiers, but when they run, they run ... trying to run an actor as quickly as possible in a suit. And the explosions are fun (there is no other word to describe). Initially, a bullet approaches a Jeep when a boy says: "What's that?" ... And other explosions are also handy. The worst thing, however, is the script and so-called. You do not expect a good story (or I do not think it's a good movie that has rented this movie), but the story must be at least a sense. I mean, how difficult a dinosaur story is to dwell on at least a few people. It is very difficult to look at this. Oh, and if you think it's easy to make credible commands as your character, tell them you're a great writer. I mean, what a sick man would make jokes cheaper after his friends died? And they do a lot. And if you think that a movie about dinosaur soldiers may be in few acts, WAKE UP !!! This movie is very sad. Carnosaurs (who have invented the flexible name anyway?) They attack (with a dreadful sequence of actions that are not). Soldiers think how to beat (they try to be serious in very entertaining scenes, but they can not convince a second). Therefore, they attack carnosaurs, but their ideas do not work (another action is an enthusiastic sequence). Go back to planning (with other joker halls) in another hilarious scene. And that continues, and on and on. And let's not forget the actor as credible as the special effects ... and the story ... Oh, this movie is from A to Z. <br /> <br /> <br />
