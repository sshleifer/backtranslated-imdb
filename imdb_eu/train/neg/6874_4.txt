Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, The big blue, Dogville) directed and performed the second part of the film trilogy. It may be wrong, but I do not think the part of the Dogma '95 manifesto in this movie really looks like it. I do not know what I think about this movie. All actors are good. They give good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is somehow interesting. But I do not know, there's something I do not like. The sex scene is too long. Based on an interesting work of art, I do not know exactly where it is. I'm sure there's a bad movie, but I do not suggest it to people, and I do not see it anymore. As you wish. If it's funny and you're open, try it, I'd like it.
