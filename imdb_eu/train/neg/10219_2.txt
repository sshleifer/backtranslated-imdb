Soldier Blue is looking for feature films that want to be a profound expression of man's human being in human beings, anti-indigenous peoples and anti-war trade; Awesome, calm and sardonic commentary on the horrors of Vietnam. Well, sorry, but one of those things is wrong. Soldier Blue is really what is evil, mischievous, mischievous, and faithful waste. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer knocked his hair in the head, saying that he is a hybrid of two completely different films. In essence, the language, the topic, is a romantic misunderstanding, "Strauss and Bergen overcome the lives of others and the prejudices of their love (ah, bless them). a place in the Lucio Fulci splatter film. <br /> <br /> There is no pretext, an unprecedented, early and boring way, where some young children of small American children shoot, sliced, disassemble and fall in love. and approaching graphics and large American women born are annoyed, raped and bind - no excuse, except box office. (In the evil intention of the slaughter itself, it is very poorly staged and shot, while the actors are painted red and bright, with special effects cut off and dissolved). They used real amputated footage. I call it exploitation now.) <br /> <br /> You acknowledge the role you have heard (including the stupidity of the movie's starting and ending comments) about "a protest". "This report does not make Cheyenne a difficult situation, so it was for some Americans to come up with some births to look after and care for the innocent and unfamiliar innocent people, so Bergen and Strauss We find crazy loves of white bread (at least two athlete actors) to attract extravagant blood, bold and headless heads. <br /> <br /> What a shame is, because it's a movie about Sand Creek's slaughter, About the real life of the United States of America (and Britain and all "civilized nations") for centuries (Iraq)? This is not a movie.
