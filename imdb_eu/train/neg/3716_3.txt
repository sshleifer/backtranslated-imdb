The main character, Lance Barton, died and during his time in the sky. When Heaven learns something he learns about the mistake that Wellington gives to a rich and white body. <br /> <br /> A young black man in a young black man is still like a young black man. If you see the old white actors. I recalled this movie several times: "Chris Rock is a pretty white guy." <br /> <br /> <br /> Not all ideas are considered: "excitement" is not well transported and the love story is not compelling. Chris Brown, a young black man, only sees what you see when you see what is seen only in small scenes, the audience has a "challenge of credibility" a great challenge.
