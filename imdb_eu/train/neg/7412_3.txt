I love the horror movies. I do not care whether the performance or not, or whether the monsters are crisp. I liked this movie, I liked the movie from the beginning of the film to the end. Look, I do not need a 10 page thesis or a large font explaining a plot. But Dark Floors "what is this movie?" A completely new level (annoying). What is it about this movie? <br /> <br /> This is not very terrifying or exciting, but if you want to kill and / or frustrate and confuse an hour and a half, rent the winner.
