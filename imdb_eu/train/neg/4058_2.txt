From the beginning, you know how to end the movie. We've got a lot of clichers because your regular NRA members will not like this movie too. I give 10 to 10, for the play of William Benton. I can not believe it for 6+ to vote on this movie. It is so favorable from the point of view (once a thief ...). People are not evil. They are not good. They were born with a light dashboard. Society, parents and education are what they are. And if they take the wrong turn, somewhere on the line, definitely, will not be the American criminal system, because it returns the track! However, avoid this movie like plague. I bet you have better things than your time, than ruin it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
