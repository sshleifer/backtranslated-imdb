When someone restarts a classic movie, the version is always opposite to the original. Similarly, this remake may be very different from the audience's awareness. <br /> <br /> Well, 1973's "TV Indemnity" versions of 1973 have almost the same scenes and they have an original interview in 1944. . The main difference is that the remake does not have any energy. Fred MacMurray was excellent as Walter Neff's insurance agent, calm and pleasing; Richard Crenna seems tired of the world. Edward G. Robinson brought a great manic energy to Barton Keys as MacMurray's boss; Lee J. Cobb, a beautiful actress, is bored by the procedure. Samantha Eggar is back in trouble with Phyllis Dietrichson; While Barbara Stanwyck was admirable about this bad role, Eggar is very polite and polite and just seems to be out of place. <br /> <br /> Robert Webber, Richard Gaines, Robinson's Norton and John Fiedler's role. Playing Porter Hall as a key witness, bring a little life to the movie. In particular, Webber successfully recreates the Norton role in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> However, after the movie is started, there is only one thing, without any life or electricity. This is a movie that never needs to be renewed.
