When the movie started, I was surprised I was shot using a cheap video camera! In fact, the camera shakes and the home movie is worse than the average. DVD direct movies should be better than production values! Hail, a large percentage of home-loaded videos on YouTube has better production costs! Often, it is seriously apparent that the movie camera is stuck on tripods and camera without anybody! The first cameras and camera are missing out on some scenes that may work, and others are too much or too bad. Yecch! <br /> <br /> The movie is about two gay men who want to get married. Like it had been a decade ago, Vermont was the only opportunity to marry: at some times they changed. However, the recent recognition of gay marriage can not be attributed to this movie any way - if anything, gay supporters instead of backing stink the movie and not really trying to really tackle the problem instead. According to the film, they are idiots of religious dimension, the use of Bibles and men who shoot people, as gay husbands when their wives are fake, will learn to lie. Surely I am glad that both sides give me a sincere opportunity. <br /> <br /> The bottom line - nothing about the film shows any professionalism and I also question this film. It's like a homemade movie, and it's not worth the inclusion of the IMDb listing or even the top 500 of the IMDb IMDb ever. The play is awful, the writing is horrible, the direction (even more) is huge, the camera's work is horrible and the plot is horrible. It's a home movie! There's nothing I can say about this in any way, except that Ed Wood's films seem like Oscar's competitors, and I'm sure Mr. Mr. Smiling smiles when someone sees that mess! <br /> <br /> I do not like gay or straightforward - the movie is not worth your time and I do not know how to get the DVDs. I think one of the actors burns in their home computer in their free time! Actually, the word 'bad' is given a new meaning. <br /> <br /> By the way, if a lady from the film was a real lawyer, did reading ability be an important condition? <br /> <br /> In the end, gay marriage is a serious and important issue, can we not get that film BACK TO TOP? This unfortunately only invites laughter.
