I totally agree with the final comment. In fact, it could be the worst film ever made. I had a quick start in this great part of this movie. Michael Madsen has made this film to help somebody. The quality of the images is very grainy. And what a small plot is stupid. I'll give it from 10 of these films, if I have a lower score. Do not waste this time on this movie or you'll regret it.
