The act is horrible. This film has won the Academy Award for Fast and Furious. There are some boobs and butts thrown down to try to get interested and the story is very weak and far away. People on the Internet do not even download the movie. This movie sank as an iron rush. IT DOES NOT WINE RENTING OR DOWNLOADING. This movie will always be PERMA-TURD. Now I'm dancing when I've seen. In fact, this title should be called "PERMA-TURD" from now on. Calling the movie is a longing and anger. abhorrent, abominable, stupid, horrible, horrible, cruel, detrible, unpleasant, boring, horrible, terrible, fairytale, horrifying, horrible, grim, horrible, horrible, shameful, revolting, scandalous, terrifying, embarrassing, shocking, sickly, terrible, terrifying, ungodly, unholy, unkind
