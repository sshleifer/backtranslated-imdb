David Lynch's rough and plump drawing by South Park presents a nightmare over the topic of troubled media families in neighborhoods. The father is a terrific monster with three teeth, and it is a huge circular mouth that gives the most loud noise of the guttural. The son and mother are always terrified and they are living creatures. Some very absurd characters get into the series. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not famous for his comedy (ie, On the Air, the Wild at Heart aspects), and I especially like comedy in comedy in general. . However, a couple of scenes in Dumbland laughed aloud. There are clear aspects of animation cinematography - Lynch gives his characters a wide range of reactions in their characters, faced with facial expressions (they have never really changed Dumbland). <br /> <br /> I think Lynch really giving her audiences a live comedy, she was desperately trying to cheer up the comedy. It is interesting to keep track of recent low-wave wavelengths (that is, most of Will Farrell's films), violent social criticism and violence and humorous cartoons. The mix does not work well here, but it's not anything in Lynchian. <br /> <br /> Lynch's enthusiast is worth it.
