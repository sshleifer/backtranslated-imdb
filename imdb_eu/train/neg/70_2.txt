This movie never came to the theaters around us, so I was one of the first I rented the DVD when available. I would have to listen to critics once and I sent it. <br /> <br /> Despite being a brilliant cast, the movie was very disappointing. Now I see why he went straight to the video. <br /> <br /> I thought with Bloom, Ledger and Rush. Everyone has done a great job in the past. <br /> <br /> The movie was slow and never entered. I did not develop much empathy for the people and I had the courage to move towards the end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film, even if you want to rent it for "sweets" only. It is not too satisfying.
