Simply put: the movie is boring. The clicking top-class is reaffirmed and the stories are never picked up. The director did not know if he had to make a movie or documentary. The main plot is very thin (orders a CIA agent to kill a prince, caught, and then warns the prince (why?)) And so some elements have been added to make the movie more interesting. So a boy dies, saying his father's "natural" response is freely recommended by the person responsible for the death of his son. He has a drunken "friend" of the lawyer, and keeps him around, why nobody knows. Some children become a terrorist suicide and they blow a ship. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's the worst movie I have ever seen. I was not entertained, nor questioned intellectually. I did not laugh or I did not cry, I did not get an understanding, I needed to learn more or take a cause. It means nothing to me, it seems the worst thing I can say about a movie.
