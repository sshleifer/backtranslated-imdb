I bought unhinged because it is soaked with the abrasive face of the lid. If you want to see good parts of the film, check the back of the box. All murders are shown and I can honestly say that they look much better than the frames they make in the film. <br /> <br /> That said, let's look at the plot. For the Rock Concert (a group of college girls who drove through the dark and deep forests in one of the longest sequences in the celluloid) drive on the road. The car was not exposed to the damage, but apparently enough was a character in a comma situation for the rest of the film (or maybe he read the script and started filming the comma already). > <br /> The other two girls wake up at home. The house is also wonderful and the film manages more drama with more actors than any actor. For some reason, this house does not turn toward the road. The only way to get to the main road is to walk five kilometers down the woods. Girls go unhinged the rest, listening to the extravagant dialogues they hear from a wealthy old bitch (who seems like George Washington) and their same daughter and repressed sex. The girls apparently did not rush to get back from that concert, but they wore over Gilligan's Island over three hours of clothing. <br /> <br /> Time for the audience, then we have arrived to kill the scene, we do not care. We would like someone to die to end our suffering. Unhinged was much better at the end of the game. At the end of the day, the good idea of ​​the film was written first and then the writers wanted to start the movie. <br /> <br /> Unhinged in the end, a boring film is a bad performance, a direct one, and a plot of more holes than a leper in a movie (sorry, I'm not sure where it came from). When this film is badly felt in the initial credits, do you think the screen looks like it's black for two minutes, for the reasons explained above? The characters talk about what they are to remember. Do not waste your time. You will feel unhinged and you want to spend your time and money.
