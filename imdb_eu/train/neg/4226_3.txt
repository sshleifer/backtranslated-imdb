Wow ... I can not believe how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (at the same time VIOLENT SH! T 3). I heard rumors, they read my comments, but I had to think myself. Well, let me say ... ONE! Any worst movie ever made, while all the duplicates were wasted, Gore Flex inept and horny, there was no spectacular plot, it was "cinematography" because my grandmother shot a movie with his movie. It's not a joke - it's made with a big cane - it's still on the list ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < They're strange with strings of paper swords. With a rebel rebel on the islands, two captives will be released and they will be released from the head of the day before the rest of the "tribe" ... It's quite ... <br /> <br /> Honestly - this is one of the most prolific films that I have ever had. one. The budget had to be around $ 200 and it was completely spent on FX (maybe it was a bad idea ...). ZOMBIE DOOM does not work in any way with other hilarious images, with a double dialogue. This movie takes out budget quotes, such as PREMUTOS: Lord of the Living House resembles TITANIC. Some may be categorized as "very bad" in the ZD category - and I think it's really drunk or high and if you can see it with some friends in the MST3K style - I think it might look like that. But not me. I hated much about everything. ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is included as "bonus" in the version of Shock-O-Rama (ZD)) shows other works by Andreas Schnaas. Then he must never be banned. A film once again with the death penalty. In the second half of this film there is a fun kung fu and there is a lot of blood. So I'll give it 3/10 a very generous one. Make this difference and jump on it.
