<br /> <br /> The movie comic hero begins as a regular movie. The boy he picks up does not have parents and # 1 is in love with school girls. Nothing surprising in the movie, you can not guess at the movie. Toby Mcguire shows that no actor is present, or any of the actors in the world can keep such a script. Children of ten years old can enjoy the movie, but it's violent for young people. You can not think of movies like X-men, Batman and Spawn. All of these titles are better. I've been in the last 20 minutes! Although it was a good thing to put on your computer, it's not the same for Christmas trees. So, my recommendation: Do not even watch this movie pay!
