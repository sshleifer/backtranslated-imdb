It would be his first screenplay, his story "Turn About", by William Faulkner giving his short story based on loyalty, sacrifice and strange relationships. The story was originally only in the characters of Tone, Young and Cooper, but MGM's Joan Crawford had to put a new image to fulfill his contract, and Faulkner created a role as a female. Crawford has stressed that his lines should be written in the same style as Young-Tone's co-protagonists, which will necessarily lead to unwanted darkness, all of which are communicated in a similar telegraphic sound to the Monty Python sketch ("Wuthering Heights"). traffic lights). Actually, Henry James read Henry James's words that are almost no pronouns. <br /> <br /> The film reflects some of Faulkner's familiar themes, the close relationship between brother and sister almost naturally (as can be seen). His "Sanctuary" and elsewhere. When Young suggests Crawford, in the presence of Tone, instead of an engagement ring, THREE exchanges the rings recorded by babies. Tone and Young's proximity also stand out, especially when they make Fate Thelma and Louise. Actually, they are terrific. <br /> <br /> It's not so scary to the New Yorker, but Wellington, a crawl that catches pleasure (which shows how to play it by his hand) repeats itself. he must be eliminated!) and becomes Young gladiators. Blech. <br /> <br /> That said, there are beautiful plays. Young is a particularly beautiful scene on the Cooper's flying plane, and Roscoe Karns is just as beautiful as Cooper's flying fan. Tone, despite being unable to express himself through realistic dialogue, has a pleasant moment, the fate of her lover's youngsters who take away her tears of love. Crawford, apart from meaningful conversations, finds mostly wood or melodramatic. That's one balance to balance. <br /> <br /> Fight scenes - it's not surprising for Howard Hawks. - the most exciting part of the whole image. But it's not enough. As I worry, I spend 75 minutes of my life.
