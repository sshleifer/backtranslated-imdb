I have participated in Woody Allen's films and are not always excellent, but you can be sure that you will entertain. Most likely, the last ones were Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95): those that I've seen since then have been incorrect, but they may be visible. So when I asked to see a new movie about Woody Allen, Melinda and Melinda, though I did not realize it, I still released them, I'm still happy. I did not hear much about it, I was surprised when I expected it. <br /> <br /> I got what I saw Woody Allen's worst movie. The premise has been explained excessively, the throw is huge, the script is slow and alive. They said too much of the scene and they still stretched, I assume that it would be a 15-minute short film. <br /> <br /> I do not care about the concept of this movie - two directors discuss how a simple situation can be interpreted as comedy or tragedy, and of course, the film shows us playing two scenes. The problem is not one of these "two films" anymore. Comedy is not funny and tragedy is not very tragic. It seems that Allen thought he had a good idea, but then he fled, or time, to actually complete the movie. <br /> <br /> There's also a very bad performance level - Will Ferrell is the only one. who brings something to the table, and basically Woody Allen's impression. Previously good actors like Chloe Sevigny are annoying, and the worst series is Radha Mitchell Melinda (it's a shame because her character is in almost every scene). <br /> <br /> The fact is that the actors are correct, unless the script is working. We definitely know that everything is far from Allen and we love classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.
