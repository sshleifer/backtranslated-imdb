This film has to be the worst thing I ever saw. The title of the movie deceives the audience to think so hopefully. The movie's story line is very useless, you just have to perform acting so poorly. The title of "Zombie Nation" involves a set of zombies, in fact there are six. This can not be categorized as a horror film, when the 80's music music is introduced, the zombies "attack." The area really speaks and they are similar to humans in the movie, which looks like something like La Roux. If you have a chance to buy this movie, do this and then burn it.
