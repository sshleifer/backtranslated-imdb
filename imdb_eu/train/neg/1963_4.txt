This movie is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it's also a much more graphic than both, and not as good as either slow and fairly predictable. It can also get shades of Deliverance and Amityville Horror.plus, created in the mix We get a new flavor of age and some of these scenes come out like a motivational / inspirational sermon. Actually, this movie is almost everything. Even though it is horrible, they do not look realistic. In fact, it looks seemingly cheap. That's why there is a horrible conversation and I do not say when, but the actions of some characters are not real or credible due to circumstances. No one would care what this way would be. If you look at Filma, you know what I mean. In addition, there are also some unlimited blemishes, it is not necessary. It was pretty good to play this movie. So, after weighing the test carefully, you said that this movie was just right, but it's not good. My judgment for The Fairy Tooth: 4/10
