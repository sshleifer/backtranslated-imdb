Do not get bad, I thought that this movie would be stupid, in fact, I gave a very small standard to answer. The only reason I saw that there was a bunch of girls (another story of a different era). When I saw something when I started to watch it, this film was horrible. Now there are two awesome types, Freddy vs. Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit and laugh and joke about how horrible it is, then there's such a movie. The Hat in The Hat could not create a moment of interest for me. When I saw the first stage, I felt stupid, but I felt the horrors of that movie in some way. Mike Myers is brilliant, I love a lot of his work, but something in this movie is not clicked. Since the director / producers / writers / writers changed their original color (red, black, white) to any person who denied them, but not Cat. By coincidence or not, I do not like the use of the original (and I hate it because I like to use the original). The book was like Sunday, colorful and delicious ice cream, and the film was rigid and hard to swallow the saw. <br /> <br /> Avoid prostitutes like leprosy.
