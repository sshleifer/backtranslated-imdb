I really do not add anything new, but I felt I had to comment on this pencil. So here it goes: <br /> <br /> Atrocement. I'm running again through my MST3K DVD collection and Hobgoblins saw it tenth times. It really is really painful, but it was next in the list ... You can see that there is a tiny movie that is under a real movie, "Hobgoblins", but it can not be released. Everything about this movie is 4th grade. The story, the performance, the effects, the women, the "scenes of action," ... they forget ahhhh. I can see some nasty effects like "The Bloodwaters of Dr. Zubat" ("Zaat"), which I like, this month will be in TCM ... October 2009, but the whole "Hobgoblins" "nother ballgame" da. <br /> <br /> The worst part of everything is now 12 hours after the movie was over, I had a good night, some coffee and some dry bread, my medications, and still "New Wave" dance music Amy, Red Shorts , and Laraine Newman was left in the drawing room. He is still drawing on MY HEAD. The wounds will last forever. <br /> <br /> Lucky, right?
