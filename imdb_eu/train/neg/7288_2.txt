ALL DIRECTORS NOTE: Long is not necessarily good. This movie is very long. However, it is not good. The scenes were drawn in a long way, way, path, path. Sex scenes were not necessary, and often too long. The movie edited for 2 hours and 10 minutes or less would be sensible, but it was boring to be less than 10 times that I'm giving too much. It's lower than the average. <br /> <br /> There are also some other problems in this marathon. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fiennes plays the whole family as a tree. The guy who played Grandpa's grandmother does not look like anything, but Father, Father and son (we do not need to constantly give voice). Ralph Fiennes is the same personality as facial hair and basic bullfighting. No one realizes that each of these children has the appearance of the final clone, although their photos are alternately changing. This is small, but if the movie does not work for 3 weeks, it would not be so angry. <br /> <br /> 2) The German news had not whispered for a long time. It is ridiculous that the Jews who are rounded off and are eliminated. Some words would come to them and think about running away. In France, my uncle was sure to send out reminders. <br /> <br /> 3) The love stories in this movie are completely wrong. You are spending this thing forever and the development of the relationships between the main characters is very short. Suddenly ... people are in love and almost immediately ... they are married. Then have children. Next, we forget about developing things and developing relationships in the 6th century. This would not hang again in a 2-hour movie, but it has not been given us any time. <br /> <br /> 4) It was a bad ending. I do not want to ruin anyone, but you will not like it ... if you're not sadistic. <br /> <br /> The director / writer should be tortured to see the landfill. As a weekly basis, I mean an endless loop, it seems the same. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford asks me to do anything about this movie, I mean Istvan Szabo has to model his career path. Which completely destroys any substance in the movie. A short description of "The Horse Whisperer" and Sunshine. <br /> <br /> Sun, title. If you start to see the sun shining brightly, it is most likely when it comes to darkness.
