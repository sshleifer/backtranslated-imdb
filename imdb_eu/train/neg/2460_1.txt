I really liked the movie, but they never gave me a chance. Basically, Espinal Tapa wants to be a hip hop theme, but it fails. The teachers at the University School Project feel written and dramatized, which seems to be a sense of humor. There is no tricks and, indeed, for a mockumentary, it never feels like a documentary. And the lines are not fun, first of all, dead revocation attempts would definitely be better than what would be better if there were better abuses. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to anyone who likes "comedy" "Mom Big Mom's House" or "Norbit". Words like "butt" seem to be hysterically funny people. Others must be away and do not waste time.
