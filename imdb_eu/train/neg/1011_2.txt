LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - Wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And is it a star? I'd better know EDISON FORCE than rent. I knew it better. But for a moment of weakness, I rented this STV. Great names like Freeman and Spacey on a STV, you know that there are two things: an indie or a dog. Like in the shelf. This is. And with good reason. Such a plot involves MAGNUM FORCE's supposed police force, and Timberlake's "journalist" is bold enough to reveal them. He directs his efforts, or maybe I can say it for his awesome performance. I thought it was badly shot during the bush and I thought before the shooter and smile. Wonderful. This movie is a real move for Freeman on the cover and the look of a mixed beard around the movie, that is, nothing like a hobo. You know that the director had no control. Freeman is clearly slumming.
