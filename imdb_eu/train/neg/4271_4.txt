The typical thriller has been done several times before. Simple crust; Liotta's police are obsessed with Russell's wife and tries to attack Kurt. That preview is not guessing it; It is a plot of land and there are no thoughts here outside the box. I think that the only reason to see it is how to develop it, but it does not make anything original or interesting. There is nothing wrong with this movie, it's not particularly bad, but it's not good. Russell plays Russell and knows what you get when you watch him in a movie. Ditto Liotta. Stowe Cher-esque has an annoying voice. I read the earthquake reading and I saw the movie in my head, it was so clear and essential. I looked and dropped it before my eyes as I imagined. I did not feel like it fell. I do not feel the feeling of that film, as I have never seen. Given this, it's quite a nonsensical movie, right? However, I will give you 3/10 for some reason.
