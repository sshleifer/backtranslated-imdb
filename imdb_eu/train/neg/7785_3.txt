I did not know that this narration was a silent film. I do not care about silent films - humor, light and shaking the movie, etc. I'm sure it's assigned to a small score. Chapter 8 was about to find out about this story and if it was popcorn, it could be thrown on the screen. Maybe this attracts the multitude of science fiction? The only thing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. On Friday night I went with two other friends, and there were 6 people in the theater. Isabella Rosselinni has told this movie: the pleasant part of the movie. Nobody left any comments about the unusual approach to telling this story. I can not recommend this film.
