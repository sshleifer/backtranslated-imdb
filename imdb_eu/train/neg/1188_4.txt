Kurosawak really reflected this. Everyone can fail. The concept is OK, but the execution is badly blurred. <br /> <br /> There is a fantasy movie about this movie, like an art movie. It is worth more than a model worthy of Tokyo's poverty attack. Many of them are interesting stories. Very disappointing movies.
