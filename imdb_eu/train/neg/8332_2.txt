Shiner's Christian Calson has three "couples" and their relationships with obsession and violence. The start is pretty good in myself. Interesting. The couple are leaving a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual men and homosexual men as "homosexual". <br /> <br /> The "het" couple does not really have a great job. movie There are some scenes that are considered to be aggressive by some sexes or those who play together, but it seems that their real purpose is not so much less. I think it's a daily image that integrates how life in the gender / violence couple is. The pair is not very aggressive, and is not in any way erotic shooting. As a character, they do not add a theme or plot. <br /> <br /> Two male friends make up the largest part of the plot. They make a lot of gay conflict persuading a homosexual to have sex in their stockings. This goes after violence. And violence is changing. It becomes a sexual gratification path. And the need for freedom of violence increases as the film progresses. I was the main problem because violence is not convincing. There is never any danger that any character will be. It just works. Since all the issues of the film are related to the violence of characters, this is a serious problem. Unfortunately, make-up does not help. Sometimes it's okay, sometimes it's very bad. In one scene, I really asked why a character was wet on her face. Confusing <br /> <br /> The most interesting pair of characters is "stalker couple". Here it seemed that Calson wanted to say more and he could develop a more coherent story. Maybe the more characters are created and the end seems like a resolution. Shiner can be much better with stuck with these two. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that Calson wanted a lot with this film. It's admirable Most low-budget films do not like much. I do not think Calson wants to get it. Neither do I have anything questionable or unbalanced. Shiner did not persuade her. This does not mean that the director can not get his next movie. <br /> <br /> It seems to say something.
