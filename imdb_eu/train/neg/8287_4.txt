This is a complete version of the story television, the film begins as a part of 'Xena ...', with a little meaningful dialogue or character description. It gets a bit meaningful after a while, but all the characters are still cartoons. <br /> <br /> Salma is an exotic beauty. Richard Harris Frollo is a malignant and sexually repressed child who breaks up in Salman's nuts. Other characters, including Quasimodo, are quite unforgettable. <br /> <br /> In addition, the fictional version of the story is passionate. Frollo removes the ideals of enlightenment, such as the name of the abbot, called "Rose of the Name", and Quasimodo is the champion of freedom. Quasen's dark side of nature is ignored, even though people are dumping liquid. It's really a unique outsider, that looks different and plays bells than the average person. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the film is aimed at children, but I doubt that Frollo thinks he wants to make his monkey himself. The interpretation of the story is not interesting and unforgettable, but it's not horrible, and sometimes entertaining.
