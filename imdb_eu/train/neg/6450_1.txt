Well, this movie is terribly terrifying. I felt the actors involved in this project, I'm sure they did not write their lines. Sometimes they were handed over to sarkasmots, that is, they do not think they're taking it seriously and do not overcome anyone who sees this nasty monster. When I was seeing this "Unidentified Beast" I could not help, but I think that there is no crew or author in the crew. But if you're laughing, you'll be happy, because the movie is shameless to laugh at myself, I can not see how anyone can look at it, so that this punch is a thriller / horror action that you want to insert directly into the DVD. The film fights lightly.
