Before seeing this movie, I would say that Kathy Bates loves everything they did. Now it's all a minute. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, his performance. Someone should say "poor" is not dirty, nor ignorant, nor trace. On the other hand, for Randy Quaiden stereotypes. Henry Thomas, that is to say, is enough for the actress to take away a mixed sodod. If you enjoy the country, you will enjoy the landscape. That's best I can give it. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of independent and curious films, but it's awful.
