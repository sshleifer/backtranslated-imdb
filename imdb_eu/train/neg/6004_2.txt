In general, it is best to know what you expect from the camps in the camps. It's like fighting a professional match or a day soap or a Jerry Springer show: you can immediately follow the rough line, identify cardboard characters and be glad when all the clicks are met. However, sometimes the director makes something unexpected. Something stupid, or something strange or perspective, can be something stupid. The machine director is with the best directors of the camp and his best film. <br /> <br /> In Yon Saalistajat, it seems that everything goes together. It's not good, but it's still consistent. Once the movie does not slow down - it flushes out and the punch continues. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that there is no reasonable time: some characters seem to kill something while they only make other characters. One hour in a bar. The sun never settles due to summer, that is to say, the night of the day is not converted. <br /> <br /> In the end: there is a plot there, somewhere. However, maybe you should watch the movie three times before realizing it.
