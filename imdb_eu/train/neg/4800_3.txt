If you made a genre film at the end of the 80's, you would have 50/50 options underwater or in a jail (unfortunately, we never got an underwater prison movie). Moretti (Anthony Franciosa) is assassinated by the underworld, Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole) ends in the death row next to his brother Frankie brother (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). But this is the smallest problem of Derek's malignant government agent (and mafia stoolie). Burgess Col. (John Saxon, who also directs it) is currently using a jail imprisonment to make a new oversight. He is the only Saxon-directed film on his famous career. With regard to a man who has worked with a ton of management, it seems that some of the tips they received were the only inexpensive Italians. Surely, the budget is low, but this can not pardon on stage, shooting gaffes, or awkward exposure in the first 15 minutes. In his opinion, Saxon was a bit of a rumor and he works in a hilarious scene of nude (one of our leaders in a jail rebels only to make a fantasy about a scientist). Cole, Jan-Michael Vincent seems to be the toughest, it's decent, because in the head and Franciosa - because it's a very bad carpet, its origin is like the head of the underworld. The ending is the favorite location of Marty McKee Bronson Canyon. Retromedia published it on DVD at the ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE home.
