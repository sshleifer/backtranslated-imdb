I only read a review that supports this movie because I have a low budget, now I'm taking my stuff. <br /> <br /> The CGI monsters were a reasonable animation but the worst way possible. Fighting scenes were not just fights, because it was just one shot of the actor, and he had a very monster of interaction. When he interacted with the monster, he seemed to be working on paintshop pro. If you have a low budget, you need to use models and puppets. They may not look very elegant, but they interact at least, just look at Peter Jacksons's first films. <br /> <br /> In the case of Beowulf, he made a fall, but the rest did not try or forgot. they do not have where. <br /> <br /> The script was mixed up. For a minute, they would talk about Shakespeare's talk the next day you get the drama club. I do not say that "you" and "must have this," but you need to find a balanced cohesion so that the lines come from the same person to the sound. <br /> <br /> I found out at the beginning when Beowulf did not mention the old texts found when he had not spent the rest of the gods and relatives. <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is very pretty. turd, but not a turn.
