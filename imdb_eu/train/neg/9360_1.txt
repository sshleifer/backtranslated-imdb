My score for this shot: 1/10 only 1 technician. Everything is very bad. <br /> <br /> An unpretentious movie. It's obvious that the mission of creating a good movie or movie script seems to be almost impossible. <br /> <br /> Although it is very easy to understand that politicians are never saying the truth, they are among the greatest lies in the planet, it's hard to understand how skilful films are. <br /> <br /> We need to think of putting stupid people. Perhaps it was believed that the reason was that 99% of the films were empty. Because the situation is stupid and ridiculous and very bad. <br /> <br /> If you look at the price of Oscar awards, we can better understand why we continue to make films more hilarious than others. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, it was always money for that nonsense. But it was not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to listen, press the Super Fast Forward button (at least 20X).
