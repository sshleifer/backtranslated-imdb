We've all seen some constant epics of the time, but all this really! The movie is so long and so slow that I just watched things, I felt much older as I left the movie theater, just as I entered. It could be almost four hours long, it would turn into a TV set. <br /> <br /> The comedy begins as a hopeful gradual rhythm. Nikhil Advani has hunted on the 6 story of love story and can not direct justice to them ... First of all, there is no connection between them, and it seems that they link the links in the last 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Silly conversation (for most Hindi repeaters in many years) and stupid cinematography increases the situation. <br /> <br /> Priyanka does not have to play herself. Only looking at the role on the screen ... rather than the relative residual beauty without active skills. <br /> <br /> And then there's not Govinda aloud and my face. -carrey Akshay Khanna is still rooted at the top of the lungs, because she is tired of already tired audiences. <br /> <br /> The only part of the film is John & Vidya's love story and Sohail & Isha's beautiful play. But they are so good in their roles, because the couple only justified the movie without linking the movie to other characters. Their splendor is lost in the midst of other sub-valued lines. <br /> <br /> My invention - the director was doing two different films (maybe more!) And a beginner assistant mixed all the records, beyond a point. Thus, the director did not leave the show as a single movie ... <br /> <br /> Look at it if you want to try your patience alone !!!
