The KOC could have been a very good movie about the Kargil War. locations, quotes, and Indian "soldier Ryan" or "black black bottom" skills. Instead, a four-hour agitation is bored with a combination of war with Masala. The scene of the war was dramatically executed, because they used the same hill in every battle scene, and they spent unnecessary time in different conferences. Instead of attempting to attract Indian public, the movie would be an account of Kargil's ("Black Hawk Down") book, or even a milestone of time (for example, "Tora"). , Tora, Tora "). Even better, I'd like to write, edit, and edit the movie that you could use as the headmaster Ram Gopal Verma, and I would like to re-edit this movie, including only the appropriate parts, until the movie would be visible.
