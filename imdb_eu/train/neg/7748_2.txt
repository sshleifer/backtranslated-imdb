This movie was pretty bad. Science fiction is my favorite channel to see all the original movies that are played there. I do not know if this movie could be an original. The departure of the zoo / theme park on the remote island is quite popular. What was it, Jurassic Park? But this has Sabertooth tigers. <br /> <br /> The film begins with some stereotyped university in search of the treasure of the island. One of them will end with some of the worst special effects I've seen on death. Blood was like ketchup. Initially, it also has a scientist to make as many people as possible to enjoy the tiger swallows. Three of them have fled and eaten tourists, or invited guests to the island to see the guests invited by the tigers. Once again, it's like Jurassic Park. Probably, the most beautiful thing was a sperm whiling 1000lb that was crawled in front of his leg, which was somewhat diminished, and with a dental statue that passed through the neck of the boys. The funniest death I have seen on television. <br /> <br /> The play is very pleasing, the special effects are horrible. The CG tigers almost passed with clay patterns, and even some sounds. For example, when one of the universities is trying to escape, he uses an ax to break the door, the ax door enters, and within 2 seconds you will hear the sound. This movie was pretty bad. Juvenile deaths were quite fun.
