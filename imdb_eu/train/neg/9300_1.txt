Spoiler Alert Well, I think this movie is the worst film ever made. Most likely, Ed Wood style (without heart). Lightning is awesome Music is very bad (piano and organ ... come!). It's play ... well, there's no play! <br /> <br /> A man who really enters a wood is missing a wife to look for and a sex with an unknown woman. <br /> <br /> The murder is not a raw clown that can not pass a turtle! <br /> <br /> All the members that can be drowned are stupid and made the director shoot in short films without effort. <br /> <br /> It's a fool that has never been done. Think: The guy with an active competence is similar to the writing (this flop is behind the brain) a colleague and two friends invite him to kill himself for a weekend and kill him. .. Monday morning returns as happened in the office. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> he is missing his friend ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
