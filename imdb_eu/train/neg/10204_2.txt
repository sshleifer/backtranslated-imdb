At first the movies seemed very good, they set the character profiles ... the plot seemed to fit in the right direction ... but, as the film progressed, the director seemed to focus on the wrong things. ... and it's just a lot of the movie was released. The identity of the characters changed in a worse way within the movie. It also seems that there were many implicit meanings - that is, the movie was not suited to the movie. And the title ... where the title of the film would fit into the movie ... The title works for previews ... If the cast was well-done ... if they had a better director. and the writer, maybe it would be better. But no. So now, there's a new movie on Friday ... My opinion! .... do not waste your time or money.
