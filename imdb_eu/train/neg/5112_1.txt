Awwww ... well, they are rich in heart and ABC / Sears takes some fatal families and the house has "renovated". Here is a humanistic recovery. I really liked it at the beginning, but now this show has come too much. <br /> <br /> With the help of a large family of ten families that could afford a fairly luxurious home, each one of them turns their shows. . People of Habitat For Humanity should shake their heads credibly. For example, a healthy sixteen year old boy is required to have a jacuzzi in his bedroom or be deceived with a "conventional hydraulic" bed? Does the mother really need some of Kalifornian's best qualities to restore and "restore" her restored old truck? A new job would be quite good, and probably a third of the price. Do people really need a sixty-five-inch screen in every home room? And then, who is the property that pays higher taxes and services bills. After Zaniacs left behind the "makeover", someone still lives. Social Services friends will have doubts about the mood they see. <br /> <br /> This show is just an ABC rating manager and a silent advertisement for its sponsors.
