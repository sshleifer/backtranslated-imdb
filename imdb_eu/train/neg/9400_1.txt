It is very unfortunate to make a movie like this. Much work and money have been given in an amateur film. <br /> <br /> Editing is dragged, there are mistakes that can easily appear in the second, and a soundtrack. It's imaginative. There could be so much more with this arcade game. I think they have appeared for a long time or no video. <br /> <br /> Handmade plans have similar amateurs.
