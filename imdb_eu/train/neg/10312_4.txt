It's a 10-year-old, and I like everything that is convinced by the "love of philosophy" of the 70's "Bridget Loves Bernie". I understood the debate, about the romantic complications of Jewish Jewish cabinets (David Birney) and a Irish Catholic teacher (Meredith Baxter) and parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald Bernie, parents of Audra Lindley). and David Doyle, as a parent of Bridget) who deal with marriage issues between young couples. <br /> <br /> Seeing the show now with personal experiences of life, I'm surprised that the show has also been a success for success. despite a high season. Created by a veteran television broadcaster, Bernard Slade, after a few years of canceling the show, the "Same Time, Next Year", "Bridget Loves Bernie" would have to be a good play, the comedy that fell under the weight was pretty clear and clear. <br /> <br /> The real chemistry between Birney and Baxter was not denied. But, in recent years, both actors have demonstrated that they are better actors of other projects (in Birney in "St. Elsewhere" and Baxter's "Family" and "Family Ties", they wanted to breathe all their lives which needed a bit of comic edge, the complication could give more depth to a controversial issue. <br /> <br /> Shows took place on Saturdays during the CBS Power Two: "All in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore." Both shows were intelligent, fun and sufficient (the latter, the latter, the latter), they kept my interest in my situation and characters. "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very intelligent and she was trying every time. <br /> < > This was just another example of a show that was not as good as I remembered.
