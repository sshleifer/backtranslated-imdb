The first opinions of this film were, of course, bad. Awesome practice, bad, entertainment, special effects I waited for a movie. What I got really bad is not it. The special effects were horrible, but I found the same movie. It's quite interesting, and the script was really good and decent. The performance was not so bad, and overall, I was fun watching this movie. It's still a pretty bad movie, but it's not as worthwhile as I thought. , and I am delighted that he managed to film wow, although that was not good. In general, a movie should be avoided, but for me it was not as bad as I expected.
