"Demons III: The Ogre" is not the previous episode "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 are cool hip horror in the classic 1980s." Demons III: The Ogre "is a very stupid, bored, monster-monster, confused about the writer" Demons III: Ogre "(Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are a quality writer and stupid, who are bored by the ghost of William Shakespeare or the egg of the devil, or what Huhuhuhuhu's girl is dreaming about ) a very boring movie is a special DVD box called "Demons" called "Demons": "The Demons III: The Ogre", "The Other Hell" and "Black Demons", and they do not close titles and subtitles from the Downey Best Buy store It will cost $ 14.99. Why do Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti make a monster with Michael Myer monster who does not make stupid movies like "Halloween III", but I love Halloween. I love "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 Better Stupid" D Emons III: Ogre "is not" The Demons "and" The Demons 2 "demons. <br /> <br /> Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre
