Gwyneth Paltrow! This is a good movie ... very bad paper. Jane Austen does not read the book, but I can not believe the surface and the characters are not much caricatured. Without a doubt, it's not easy to reduce 2 hours of 2-page book shows in 2 hours, but I expect more to see old furniture and glasses. I was reliving a relief when I saw an actor who had not passed the actor (twice).
