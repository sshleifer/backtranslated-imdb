It's a strange casino in Las Vegas, an almost impossible horror movie that is something that is impossible to see and participate in. You need to do something. The two good things in this movie are both gifted by Stella Stevens, and she puts the whole program in one of those lightning-headed shirts. The great shots of Las Vegas's mid-70s (when it was a beautiful place to visit) and daytime fashion can be awesome. Otherwise, a great tour. Rhino dvd has a very good panoramic screen, but it's still less than $ 10. It's still not worth it.
