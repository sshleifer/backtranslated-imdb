This is the only Uwe Boll movie I ever saw. I know, surely, that the worst director of video games based on the "House of the Dead" is about 100 at the bottom of the IMDb. I wanted to see it yet, because I'm a fan of the game and I saw the movie so bad. After seeing it, I agree that the movie has no story. For the first 15-20 minutes, there was no teenager with no head (for a moment I was wondering if there were no headsets or girls?) And tonight zombies went out of nowhere. and then people began to attack people when a woman started firing, I mean that one place and the other one will take you every 5 minutes. Is it a comedy? or both? I know before, I slept in the second half and I woke up in the final credits, so I did not see everything, that is, it's a good thing! The movie is an insult against the classic game, Uwe Boll, please do not film anymore. Thank you!
