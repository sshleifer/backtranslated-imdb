It is not surprising, that is, it was released directly to the DVD here, in Australia, there was never any free feature. The conversation was hokey, theater, horrible and scripts sucked! Wugames thought it was a good idea to keep track of or follow up on the Wargames movie in the 80s, but something bad was something wrong! Amanda Walsh had good eye candy / love, while Matt Lanter was good. I would not recommend Wargames: Dead Code, anyone, look at Hackers or original Wargames movies - they're both better than this crap piece !!
