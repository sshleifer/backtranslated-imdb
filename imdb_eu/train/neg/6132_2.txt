As a child, my friends and I think that Gymkata is the bloodiest movie ever made. I do not know who started this murmur. Certainly, it was created by the frustration of 10-year-old children because they did not see one or the other. A few years after Gymkata was released, she became a permanent night-time film and, as a result, I could not waste time. I had to see the scene of a great excuse for making a movie in more than twelve times and I can always see it for 1-2 seconds on the screen. However, instead of joining gymnastics and martial arts, bad dubbing, harsh dialogue and a rather tough, gritty story, the movie does some things. With all that's wrong with the movie, the sound is pretty fun. It has never been drilled or landed with so many volumes of power! The canned kung fu sounds embarrassing, but the music slowed down and went down, and a 5-minute slow motion scene is really strange. In a city of thirsty and bloody blood, it is not bored, as the rhythm is as tense as it is, and the camera and the wave are looking for wigs and shades that are bad, so it's fun to sink. . Could it not be the status of classical worship? Where do we need MST3K?
