I have read some comments published on the IMDb and I thought I would look like a movie. Disappointed In a positive sense, the male rows are good and some interesting photos, but this film has not convinced. It seems to be aware of its importance to say that something is significant, but a short fall and an image that is completely confusing. <br /> <br /> It is one of those films classified as films. Noir can be defined as: <br /> <br /> "A black movie marks the mood of the pessimistic, fatal, threatening and cynical characters." <br /> <br /> Well, here is the story here: 3 losers encounter mental illnesses, alcoholism, laziness, debts, etc. And they conspire together to kidnap the child and crush each other. <br /> <br /> The movie would be better if this story was only kidnapped instead of the bad nature of baiting. I thought the women's director was more than profound, and I found him as an amateur actress. <br /> <br /> With some good moments, I felt the time I lost. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10.
