One of the lipsticks is another dark film. I try to think about something good about the movie, and I have trouble getting it out. I think Margaux Hemingway was the red dress he was in the movies, and the script and script was never the worst I've ever encountered, but it could be a lot better. The lipstick was nice. The set was very bright and nice to look like. The kids were welcome. Anne Bancroft's character seemed to me to be a unique character in the whole movie. It was sad that Chris Sarandonn sank this time.
