Whoever writes the script for this movie is definitely never looking at Lucille Ball, especially autobiographical books. I have never seen so much mistake in a biopic, in its first years, with Celoron and Jamestown, with Desi. I have made a complete list of factual errors, but for pages. In all, I think that Lucille Ball is no longer able to portray herself. Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr. I was sorry to see how many mistakes I made in this movie. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems to me very noisy.
