I do not usually like revenge movies ... PERIOD. Double Impact, however, has a little more than a typical revenge's premise. You will see, It has action, accuracy, exotic locations (that is, Hong Kong), huge battles of guns and fight art to meet your incredible fight for the unbelievable armamentment of your desire. As with all retaliation lines, they would like to throw away the last floor of a 40-story building on the last floor window. However, Double Impact has no socialist aggression on the plot and elitist, racist and nasty social stereotypes that invaded "Eye for an" and "Death Wish 2". <br /> <br /> But the land department is as transparent as Double Impact. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a family friend who was at least remembering a family friend. The boys explain why they spoke French accents. There was no blue plot of the movie, but the use of lines and movements from other movies (Lethal Weaper The Princess Bride) was impaired. However, the double impact is still visible. But why would you like to hate the fibrousness of your being like this bad movie (for example, the British fan and murdered lesbian redhead chick, Chad and Alex's parents)?
