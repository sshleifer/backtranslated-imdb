Nell Shipman tried a plot of land that had been "back home to God" last year and unfortunately failed. This time it does better, though it does not seem. 'Something new' is almost out of the plot. It is a short premise, a hero (the author and Shipman's boyfriend) that creates the girl (which is interpreted by Shipman). From there it is not an exciting and not thoughtful persecution. Of course, Maxwell Sedan is played as an advert for the time, but the movie is completely ridiculous. He did not seem to have learned much from the last-minute rescue film of D.W. It imitates parody of Griffith or Mack Sennett and other comedians. <br /> <br /> It's a great interest Shipman writes and directs as the star who writes the movie story. a writer (Shipman again), although it does not make it much clearer or more fun, even though he is trying. Once again, others began writing jokes of writers, like Anita Loos, 'Wild and Woolly' or Frances Marion with 'A Girl's Folly' (1917). At least, Shipman does not think that he or she does not think seriously, and I do not. 'Something new', despite its claim, is lost.
