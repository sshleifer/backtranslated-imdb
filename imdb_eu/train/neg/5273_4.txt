*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw the preview of this movie, I thought it would be a wonderful story. But most of the superstation I left as the original movies was disapointed. This horrible family drives through this "empty" town to find out about a brake and discover this video camera that disappears and make people disappear. heck is stalking them. The gaps that they can change are more and they do not explain anything and what happens. The family enters into a car accident and does not carry a head cleanup or something (never explained). The next thing you expect is the hope that you know somehow, but it leaves you completely confused.
