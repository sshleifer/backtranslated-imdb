On the islands of Fiji, Valalola Resort, a wealthy owner of the Primal Park, invites investors and guests to inaugurate the hotel and zoo's compound party to find partners. A series of small bandits from the University puts a virus on the security system in search of viruses to participate in the biggest attraction of the zoo? Sabretoothes of prehistoric age, through a DNA found in fossils? Run away, take care of the makers and guards. <br /> <br /> Sabretooth is one of the worst films I have ever seen recently, "cheap and cheap attack". The character is horrible and not fun or enjoyable and the story is a huge part of Jurassic Park, with a bad collection of topicals. Basically, all lines and situations are poor and stupid, but the winner says the guards are like bubbles that are bulimical and like to die for pleasure. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Attack of the Tooth of Saber" ("Sabretooth's Attack")
