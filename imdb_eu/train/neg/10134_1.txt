Steven Seagal has never had any material for the Oscars, but the release is worse and worse each time. <br /> <br /> This begins with what Seagal receives from the FBI, because he was killed by some people because he defended himself "because he defends himself". The active military has been taken from prison, a Hollywood statue that is so obsessed with keeping Hollywood pirates stolen from the stolen robbers. <br /> <br /> The movie may be horrible. Dialogue, almost always accompanied by an undisputed tale of cheese and acting. The story is not interesting, and there are not the safest pieces, and they do not realize the story, since all the characters in the movie are, for example, the "lesbian" interaction between the two major women. The mere qualification of audiences, and is still not commensurate with the qualification, does not explain why it did not happen. <br /> <br /> In short, a fabulous handwriting with poor conversation, dramatic and sometimes poorly choreographed and impossible episodes of acted sub-actor actors make it almost impossible and make the movie worse. <br /> <br /> Save a life of 98 minutes and give it this miss, even if it's more enthusiastic for Seagal.
