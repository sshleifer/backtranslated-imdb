Adi Lovelace, Charles Babbage, computer history, and so on, a combination of the scifi and the period was expected, and this film was disappointed by misunderstood pseudosciences and a real and wonderful story. Imagine that his writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) does not understand the real understanding of mathematics, technology or history as the subject of the film, but rather as a blurred artistic impression. This is very difficult with me, because the tendencies of the arts are so angry that they confuse the misunderstanding of scientific terms and ideas, for example: Emmy Coer: "information waves have a half life." Ada: "I do not know that life is not better than half life life ". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This film is worse than what he does not entertain: he misinforms himself. The only respectable value that I imagine is that the viewer is able to learn from the subject that gives so much distortion to the subject. It is possible that I believe that the ability of science and technology superstition to promote any degree of progress that may coincide with magic.
