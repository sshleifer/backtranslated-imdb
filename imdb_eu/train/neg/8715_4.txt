Primal species B Movie legend comes to Roger Corman and everyone who sees it must know that he is a low-budget B movie and knows that. <br /> <br /> A bunch of trucks and high-terrorists. The whole army of killing is believed to have uranium, but not ... Dinoa has two wheels with Salt Meat ... Then the Crack team is also called the Delta Force. . <br /> <br /> Okay, this is not Jurassic Park, yes. Dino is never seen anymore, but a man in the Jacket with a star like Barney the Dinosaur. The boys had about 1% of the Jurassic Park Budget and, therefore, what they could do. <br /> <br /> Is this worth to be in the bottom of 100? ... HELL NO !!! I think almost half of the voters who give this one - WAY WAY, I think it's too hard, it's much closer 4 ... It's better than just one of 100 other non-feature films, and it does have a production value similar to Sci-Fi Channel. (again, these critics have a very hard time with the critics) <br /> <br /> The operation B is as expected, although one of the actors does not take it seriously, nor even a screenplay <br /> <br /> Everything is a nice movie B - It's not for film Snobs <br /> <br /> ** outside ****
