Ok, first of all, this movie is awesome. But examine why. It is interesting that the machine capable of converting, storing and transporting the material is at least interesting. But as far as this premise is concerned. Instead of looking at this type of machine, instead of studying what will happen, they break the cursed thing. It could be a good premise. Living with the responsibility of this kind of power and constant temptation, that is, an invisible man. But do not ... they break the cursed thing. And Lembach wants it. Then the doctor collects and transports the same thing. Only the beautiful secretary wrote, (duh). This would not happen if Lembach did not decide to leave. So, nowadays, the people of the country are dying, because the small experiment has failed, and they will not give any money. Wah. Then, to make the film worse, they have given a relatively dry relationship between the British among the two semi-competent teachers who make it. Among their love sessions, they try to listen to two half in London to kill half of them until they die. All this could have been thought to not break the evil machine, which never happened if Lembach did not happen. I tried this movie to be a good 2 star, but it would be better if you did not break the bad machine, Lembach would stop trying again. Damn you Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
