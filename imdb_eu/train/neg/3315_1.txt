Bah. There is never a tired virtual work of another copyrighted designer designed. <br /> <br /> Positively, Toni Collette is always excellent (real actors, you see), and there are some. Manuscript scene with well-managed cuts. There are also some really entertaining lines, and the competence of filmwork, scores and editing, the ability to voice a strange voice over the voice and speak of the camera. <br /> <br /> But, but, but. It seems that most of the riders are in the automatic pilot and almost all are very old (and in some cases they are young) for their declared age. What's worse, they're talking about "Austerity", a strange song that is considered a mistake that sings the song singing from the day of Austin (think Yosemite Sam, I do not love you). This is particularly sad, as the appearance of the same "Fakespearan" eventually seems to have disappeared, Olivier and her bodybuilders were so much liked to go to the lungs. <br /> <br /> And the worst is Gwyneth Paltrow. In his films, he plays the only character and remains in his place, who walks all over his range (without smiling) in the first ten minutes, and then repeats himself for the entire length of the film. There are no chemicals between himself and his admirers, and they have no apparent reason for any interest. <br /> <br /> In the end, Emma has little reason to see Emma. It's nice enough to fit, but if you want to get a movie full of anachronisms (that is, a thin lead that can not make a bit of a horn or accentuate it), you can do it right, and it's a terrific "Clueless."
