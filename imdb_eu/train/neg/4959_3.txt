Remember a good animation show in the 90s? What was the people praised? Did all people of all ages appreciate it? Did Batman show me a real detective instead of a Hulk? Who can be your colleagues? Who was evil with real causes? <br /> <br /> Well, Warner Bros does not. That's why this dreck. <br /> <br /> Honestly, do you know people have something to do with it? Did they look at comic books earlier? Did Batman know about "detectives"? Putting together 2 marks does not turn you into a detective! That's it! The monkey makes you a little smart! <br /> <br /> This is a basic layout of a passage: <br /> <br /> It stole some penguin. 'Open credits'. Batman finds where he is. Batman goes through and causes trouble. Trade Batman finds it lightly and stupidly. Penguin escapes. Penguin once again makes something obvious. Batman continues. They make Kung-fu (in all ways, and I mean everyone knows Kung-fu for some reason). Batman punch the penguin. he expelled he goes to arkham. (Note: each event is usually a criminal) <br /> <br /> Regardless, Batman is not an excellent detective. "Joker has left cotton candy on the ground, maybe he's in the old amusement park." Yes maybe, there were six times there. <br /> <br /> And I have already mentioned this, but ALL KUNG-FU KNOWS IT! PENGUIN! what do they think? (probably because Jackie Chan is a fan of the animated series) <br /> <br /> He is really amazed that the show is just action. There is no intelligence. None. If Batman thinks it will use technology, and then do some kung fu. <br /> <br /> But let's not forget the criminals. Then what would Batman do without his gallery gallery? <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say, because of its originality. I do not think any other media player joker and an immensely blocked monkey, like an anemone, and imagined that they would be small poison leaves (think this when it's confusing, does not their sexuality be their main strength?) <br /> <br /> Still It is also a template, but each character is now a two-dimensional stereotype. <br /> <br /> EG <br /> <br /> Killer Croc wants to flood Gotham without any reason whatsoever. <br /> <br /> Man-Bat is a powerful scientist crazy, which is reasonably obsessed with bats. <br /> <br /> Penguins just want to steal everything. Without any reason. <br /> <br /> Do you notice a model here? <br /> <br /> But the most insulting thing must be Mr. Freeze. <br /> <br /> Remember Emmy Award Winner of "Heart of Ice" Batman: The Animated Series? Mr. Freeze caused one of his crimes? Did the episode used in comic books made so well (mad scientist) so well? Did he go to the victims for a purpose? Hell, although Batman & Robin acknowledged that, using Mr Freezes originated from P.O.S. movie <br /> <br /> Well, the series says "F # ck that" and Mr. It's a weird freezing thief before the accident, only with riches, and then freezes it and makes it cool. . He then steals jewelry for no reason, as he says lines like "Ice Day". <br /> <br /> Maybe they had finally seen Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> But hey, look bright on the side. This series makes you feel nothing for criminals, so you're a good person. Good for you
