Bo Derek's first debut for eight years? and that was how it was to stop! John Derek was the competent actor, but as director he was almost erotic film Ed Wood? Not particularly explicit, Bo (dark hair as a sport) at the age of 16 when this film was made! He also wrote and wrote photographs; The second, that is, a good description of the Greek island setting with the narration setting? But the graphics are childish and the cruel conversations! <br /> <br /> Peter Hooten's character has grown up with the Bo family: brothers and sisters grew up but now they are aware that couples are attracted to one another (but, as I said, do not expect fireworks!) . However, this is a shorter part of the fact that each of the protagonists keeps an obsession with the film, because they are not stupid, but they do not insult. Hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized seaside resort and continue to see a cruise ship (ending at last); Does Derek even make sense? he asked the owner of a great old bathtub! To get the album, the couple is married at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Likewise, there are also non-incidents involving the mayor of the city and Bo (that is, the photographer's lottery). This is, of course, the anger of Hoot's jealousy. Sometimes, in the absence of good reason, we also face the projection of the ancient Hollywood classics, the open-air film festival that collects the whole town (the titles described THE PUBLIC ENEMY [1931])! In the end, while Bo's naivety is so tidy, it's not enough to compensate for the ridiculous and superb compensation of the movie.
