I'm a filmmaker. I like all kinds of movies. Undoubtedly, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I get what follows with the book, that is, everything should not be included in a movie. Above all, the veracity of the book's experiences has been questioned more than once. <br /> <br /> These characters are not jewelry, they are mentally ill. The things that are happening are not fun, they are disturbing; above all, that they are true. <br /> <br /> This film was felt at the Royal Tenenbaums, I hated another movie, Running With Scissors was even more dysfunctional and less fun. <br /> <br /> I never had time to pull those hours back. After looking after I wanted to clean the brain.
