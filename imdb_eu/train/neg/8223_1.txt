Without a doubt, the worst movie ever I've ever seen! The opposite of this opinion would be argued that the title should not be judged by the same criteria as other people, but rather a low-budget movie, but already? Amateurism and small innovation are awful. <br /> <br /> Conceive everything that has been said about this film, for example, the play that weakened the mind (if you're shooting another scene, it's a damned god). it), in the things that I found most annoying, it lacked the full ownership of the script, assuming that this thing existed in production. There was no respectful conversation with the audience, the girls changed their characters several times, and there seemed to be no rationality or brain to anybody, against a slight psychopathy of the girl? On the gang, why not? <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be the meaning of a conquest for this title is to leave the camcorder in no way so that the viewer sees everything. Inside - This is a great idea exponentially overwhelmed by the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, this movie is not Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other. title shot with a hand-made camera? This is an effect and not a feature! Light usage is surprising, but in this case the excuse is cinematography.
