... The only way to describe this movie is to describe it: scandal, sex, reputation, power. Kirsten Dunst sharpened passionately as Marion Davies as a silent movie filmmaker, as he believed in "Legally Blonde". William Randolph Hearst's guy arrives to the point where he wants to get to the screen. Eddie Izzard is pretty good, except for Charlie Chaplin, it's roughly 125 kg for that part? It was difficult for Peter Bogdanovich to sink and diffuse dirt, but he has never made a spectacular film anymore, what? 30 years old? Sometimes there is no refund.
