1 is pretty generous here. I really enjoyed BOOGEYMAN, although it's not really driven on the cover of BOOGEYMAN DVD and we all know! I got there. But this movie is something else. For a long time, he has been shooting a 10-year-old camera for a guy who has directed a lot of targeted films. The story and the performance are similar! David Hess, you left me too much. After playing one of the most dangerous evil in the history of the Festival, did you use it? However, they were able to apologize for the story and the performance, if someone could take the time to look like a professional video. It seems like a lot of movies that have not filmed on videos, or at least they are not so obvious that I'm paying attention to the movie. I can not say that the movie is worse, because it could not get the whole movie, but it's too close.
