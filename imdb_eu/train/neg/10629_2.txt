This was not the only reason that Sibrele knows the technical aspects of making a movie. It is a technically adapted film. <br /> <br /> That said, it is a movie based on very lies and distortions, easily disproven. Most of the documentary we use propaganda techniques to overcome the space program, in truth. The "indispensable proof" symbolizing Sibling's "fake landings" is easily erased if you know anything about the orbital mechanics. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend seeing this, but if so, see Google's free video. Do not Bart Sibrel win your curiosity.
