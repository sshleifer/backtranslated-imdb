The comparison may be unfair, but it is essential. Intimacy and depth. Those who are attracted by Umbrellas will be a little appalled to discover the musical style that has been cut and styled in American style: an alarming conversation and unexplored song and dance. Gene Kelly's accent of French was apparently so poor that he replaced the tremendous work of dubbing (remember, the shadows almost perfectly dubbed). French translation (for subtitled versions) leaves something he wants, although this can not be attributed to Demy. The film also has some moments of self-awareness, which are very inconvenient, such as the references of LeGrand himself. And the costumes - well, the combination of narrow pants / white boots, and frightishly unnatural colors, reminiscent of a Austin Powers film. . . <br /> <br /> But Demy refers to shadows to the shadows; Note, for example, that Maxence is carrying a bag from Rochefire case; That is, the guy wearing Cherbourg wearing his head. Bear in mind the "Crazy Cold Resolution" - Shelters in Madeleine and Josette in the Young Girls. <br /> <br /> Generally, those who expect natural relief from cribs (save the mobile scene on a bicycle) or look for more in-depth and ambiguous questions like ambiguous Umbrella scripts, probably should overcome this. Those looking for a French version of an American music in the 60's will be delighted.
