In a non-fiction book, DANSE MACABRE, it's a secret to writing a story that Stephen King suggests that showcase what your readers have to do. If the door opens and if it opens a ten-meter high defect, the reader may be a little afraid, but he will think "Well, I can face it. It was not at least one hundred meters tall." There's nothing terrifying, hidden, and unknown, the door closed to the other side, to be waiting for you. <br /> <br /> The director Jan De Bont, who works so hard, looks more or less. His movie begins metaphorically opening the door and shouting: "Look, everyone looks like it's a mistake of ten feet high, is not it?" The law of small profits begins immediately. At the end of the movie, the director jumps up and down, as CGI drops madly and cries: "Look, everybody, look, ten bugs! HONEY BALLS! And now, here's a hundred thousand footsteps. ! <br /> <br /> Apparently, filmmakers felt that only special effects would be to compensate for the other shortcomings of this effort (and there are many). They can not and do not. In fact, they are so incredible, special effects are so enthusiastic and shameful that they are looking at the viewer with joy or anger, instead of being immersed in a story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And they do not know exactly what they should do with this idea, and Neeson, therefore, crosses the water a bit, shakes his arms and jokes. The next scene, the good doctor dries himself and, wrongly, forgot about the incident. <br /> <br /> Shirley Jackson's novel seems to be ridiculous as a curator. The small stoners of the small IQ have had a great impact on how people were afraid and each effect was bigger and louder: "Well, next, let's make the ceiling, you know, It looks like a horrible one, and it's down on it ... and those dark things, such as being caught in bed. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br That's funny. Owen Wilson (Luke Sanderson ) After falling on the floor, he continued his magical carpet. Almost on earth I fell, laughing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
