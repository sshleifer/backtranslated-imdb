Power Rangers, a trendy TV commercial for children in the 90s, has to be the cheapest and most ridiculous show ever created. <br /> <br /> However, the point at this show is, however, that if the latter fail to sell the plastic nonsense to children? Nothing is exchanged or interesting about this show remotely. <br /> <br /> Look at the costumes, which look like bad spandex. <br /> <br /> Peas, earrings, and browns In the early 1990s, I think that fashion is really ridiculous these days. <br /> <br /> Avoid this show in every way!
