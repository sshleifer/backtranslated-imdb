A Palestinian "cause" propaganda film. If you expect a forbidden documentary about Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you should look elsewhere. If you are anti-Semitic (or only anti-Zionist, for the sake of a country's destruction) or if it is a documentary that you do not criticize for Palestinian purposes (for example, mass murder, destruction of Israel). You should make a fun evening in the UK and US surroundings. However, any person who is informed and honestly would be an attack full of lying in this video clip. I hope that those who do not know the situation will not break the anti-Semitic due to this dirt.
