When a movie like "The Dukes of Hazzard" brings more than $ 75 million, it makes incredibly sad calls to our society's situation. Or we are collectively very stupid to stay away from such trash bins or just do not realize how much it is in these unforgettable trash types. <br /> <br /> Hollywood does not have any incentive to do if the good films throw bins, people will see it, because there is nothing else on the screen. This is. I walked out freely. The conversation could not be sharper. Stunts could not be over-the-top and outrageous. Perhaps this "bigger" image seems to be Texas, but it does not seem to me in the theater for me or anyone else. The "big names" were not always on permanent routes, except Burt Reynolds, which says everything to be heard. Jessica Simpson - do not laugh. <br /> <br /> I would not even recommend movies to this video, although it was disappointed. All this was to mislead the public enough to get a better cost at the time of opening up at the opening day. They made it to the public. There is a lot of stupidity.
