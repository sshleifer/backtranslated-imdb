### Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What does the movie offer? Control editing and cinematography fits in with a terrific plot. It is sad to see that the talents of Denzel Washington are wasting such debris. Certainly, the Mexicans can not keep themselves, those who need outside forces, perhaps the military and the Americans. And we know that the father is a horrible character, in short, he is a Mexican, unlike Creasey, his wife, who is American. He killed all of them because he believed he had died. And he? It does not mean, of course, that it's a young child and you're not supposed to harm the sensitivity of Hollywood fans. The out-of-scene scenario has been the only thing left behind by "unsuccessful success" (such as some critics). The upsurge of these movies will take time. In the assessment of these films we must question IMDben credulity.7.7 for such a movie and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Go to the image! The mine will be 3.5-4.0
