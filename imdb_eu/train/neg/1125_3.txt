I went to school with Jeremy Earl, so I heard this movie, I do not know everything that was in the theater. I do not remember the name. I've seen it, it's like one of the descendants of the following schools. The play is fine, it's not great. The earth was so weak and the lines were pretty crisp. So I just borrowed a movie from "Eh" Jeremy's movie, if I were in a movie rental spot, I would have been in the past and I would not recommend anyone to the past. middle school age I also realized that when urban children are portrayed, the slang is too much used or simply obsolete. Many times I think the characters are their disbelief.
