I really expected to see Nana after seeing the brilliant first work of Renoir. I read that Nana, in general, was playing the best silent film, I had a lot of hope. Unfortunately, a big step back. <br /> <br /> Catherine Hessling is the main problem for this movie. His performance is at the top, even for silent films. His performance is similar to what one might expect from early adolescents and not in the 20s. It's the same face, it reminds me of someone with dizziness. Also, it was hard to believe that any other woman would fall into a fallen woman. There was nothing beautiful there was. <br /> <br /> A long movie was also drawn, the camera's work was not very interesting (aside from a horse race) and editing was shameful. The story reminded me of Pabst's Pandora box. It is interesting to compare two because these films are only 3 years old. Pandora Box, Nana scores in every level that fails. <br /> <br /> This movie is only for Renoir's suppository or silent movie.
