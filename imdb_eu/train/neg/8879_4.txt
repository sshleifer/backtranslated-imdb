I think Cliff Robertson is one of our best actors. He has half a dozen classics. He works well here, but the direction is so bad and the route is so arduous, it is never achieved. The story begins well, although he asks me how his wife could hang herself. He still takes well and takes things away. The blame of death is double. First of all, if we spend a certain amount of space from one room to another, or part of the house, we eat a third of the movie. Add to that, Robertson's character sitting on the bed, in blue light, can add another part. I agree that the movie would be quite decent, but it would be quite tense. The greatest weakness is just a plot, when everything is done and leaves wonderful questions. I'm not spoiling, but when it's over, do not think too much. I can ask ten of them without sweating. It would be better to continue to be a ghost story.
