Monsters like movies in general. There is no doubt that they are stupid. But it's hard to imagine that this movie is a bit like that, and at the same time it is trying hard. Actually as it happens in a pleasant way. <br /> <br /> Although the idea is quite a factor, known as Great White Sharks like Orcas, it's really hard to find scary I can not help but I can not see things that destroy an angry Shamoo. Especially the building exploded a scene that was being made by the Orcish ... and while it was exploding, it jumbled from the water and with Sea World I was watching a show with fireworks. In addition, they kill a lot of horror moments, even if they happen to indicate it. It also includes JAWS jabs. His "appearance is good, we are truthful and we can create better reasons for attacking Orca." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, of course, we've overcome your awkward logic. . But JAWS does not have one of your movies. His fear Yes it is impossible. Yes, it's somehow bad. Actually, whether it's true or not, the Killer Shark is not terribly terrifying as a White Great. And the character development and writing attempt is just a bit more painful. Although JAWS Revenge is less than this.
