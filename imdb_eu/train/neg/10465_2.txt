I really do not want to write this review. I'm a Christian, so I'm worried I'm waiting for this movie. It seemed very fascinating to me: it was a fascinated and intriguing star with a Christian movie (it's not the same as the Bible Code, what I want you to say), but I think it's all inside the Bible. So, on the edge of the seat, I enjoy sitting face down, when the movie is coming out and strives to destroy my humor for a few minutes. I had to leave a great comment on the writing and detection that I had in theater (I would cut the people that seemed to be the most bad at theater, but above all, the scenes that were uprooted and were bored before being completely clear and predictable). Static voltage, I'm sure). When the last credits started, I thought. I really liked the many parts of the movie - especially unexpected plots, some special effects (I do not count on Visions. Misleading) and some interesting technical works - it's disappearing, that is, that's it. kind of thing Unfortunately, I had a clear impression that if I read a book of Apocalypse to a monkey and put a monkey that writes a machine for an hour, I get a better script. And music was cheerful (even for the likes of music and action-intrigue scenes). So it might be like all others in the theater - like someone who was crying as incredible as it might be - but I'm not someone someone who can throw away some words. He attacks the Bible and the Christian stamp. I need a good ground and a compelling interview to make the most of the movies, and that's just it. I'm sorry, but I would not recommend the movie to anyone. And that's a tragedy. When will we see intelligent Christian fiction? It must be somewhere ...
