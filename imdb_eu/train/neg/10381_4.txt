The unfortunate house thriller has found an American family to move to a 200-year-old Japan house where the triumph of love of suicide by brutal murder took place. <br /> <br /> This horror film, directed by Motel Hell, is the only element that is very interesting. The film generates zero marks and is composed of some buzzing scenes rarely seen. <br /> <br /> The clear example is that at first it is quite an ancient scene, the lead man visits a temple, seeing that his house warned monks earlier. The Friar explains the history of the house (who knows the beginning of the audience's sequence) and then the film cuts something else. Earlier, he offered monk support. Well, where is the help? The family stops constantly in the wrong house, because things are getting worse and the monks mention it until it's almost over again when they had to do it again once a year (try to steer the spirit). Outside of the house, although at this moment it is difficult for the public to take care of. <br /> <br /> There are (probably) unwanted campy laughter, eventually the American actress suddenly grasp and see Japanese spirits. I started fighting martial arts, I am sure the director of the scene reminds himself of the Motel Hell helmet, of course, to make it fun, but it's generally unforgettable.
