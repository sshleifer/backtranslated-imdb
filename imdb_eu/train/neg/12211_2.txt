George P. Cosmatos' "Rambo: First Blood II Part" is the fulfillment of the desire. The United States clearly did not win the Vietnam war. Beyond the imagination, this country was damaged by this country, and this film continues with the story of innocent soldiers. It was a bad thing for the leaders of the nation, who happened this war. Rambo's character is perfect for noticing this. It is a patriotism that Americans and Americans did not celebrate and celebrate a single soldier, but it does not have mistrust for officers and politicians. Like all the films that advocate war (for example, "We are Soldiers"), it also avoids the need to understand the reasons behind the commitment of South Asia. And that's why there was also the reason for each American-American soldier. Instead, Rambo will take revenge on the nation's wounded wounds. It would be better to practice how to prepare memories, than to eliminate them. "Did we win this time?" Yes Yes.
