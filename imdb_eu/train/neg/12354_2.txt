Of course, I did not see the 'GI Jane' option. When I see this movie about the girlfriend's house, I'm just about to be forced. <br /> <br /> GI Jane loses its credibility immediately because the viewer is a real scenario, which, of course, is trying to convince her. there is not. The result is that the story is automatically linked to the limitations, limiting the mood (that is to say, there) or the fun scene, and they soon become serious. The film makes it so boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> 'GI Jane' fails to get other action movies to succeed; Especially since James Bond, Dirty Harry and many other movies are bigger than life, but never claimed otherwise. They are fleeting and therefore entertaining. 'GI Jane' tries to be authentic and fails. <br /> <br /> Ridley Scott's film is very disappointing, with a very compelling story, with dramatic play and giving it 2/10. They are some of the technical works instead of 1/10.
