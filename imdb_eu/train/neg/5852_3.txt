Bradford Dillman wakes up early in the middle of a scene of bloody punishment. Partial amnesia (or "global amnesia"), which defines a character's loss of optical memory, the scientist finds a private detective in the telephone book to return the books together. Rare misunderstandings were scarce on the basis of Walter Ericson's "Fallen Angel" (in 1965, he shot "Mirage" with Gregory Peck). Probably, it was excessive television, NBC was added to the combination of drugs and hymns, at first, it did not refuse air, so the small budget was finished at theaters. Director James Goldstone is fond of hyper-cartoon imagery and camera scams, while Edward A. Biery's editor is cramming with zigzag cuts. Unfortunately, their colorful capabilities do not cover the weaknesses of this updated plot, and acting is shy. Dillman, forced to remember night events, goes through an actress seminar with tic, stammers, nose-wipes and half laughs, as a conversation: "Dream ... a dream ... drugs ... well, drugs ... SOUND. ... bells ... help! "As another great scientist who smiles with Cheshire Cat, Pat Hingle is almost released by Dillman in the department of Grand Thespian, focusing on all those who continue to talk to his baby, remembering a middle-aged peacock and shaking his mouth. Hope Lange is given little interest in the scientist / love, but not the indifferent to Dillman's lover before shouting: "What should I do, talk Ape Man? I want it!" This is a "Jigsaw" sharp one! * 1/2 ****
