Let's go ahead: this movie is called softcore pornography targeted at molecular masses, every one of the latest centimeters in the studio is titled by American Pie. Deadline <br /> <br /> The whole plot (which does not mean that there is not much going) is a vehicle for showers to show boobs and sex scenes. <br /> <br /> If you are a Tween boy and you are very strict in buying pornographic reality, then this is a movie for you. Otherwise, the film has not offered any offer. <br /> <br /> The play is a sub-part, the development of the character almost does not exist, and the story is nonsense nudity, drinking binge. and Pranks (none of them is particularly memorable). <br /> <br /> Go if you want to buy real porn, or else, see the beautiful movie. Animal House, Kids or even the original American Pie are excellent films, all of which have great alcohol and nudity. <br /> <br /> "It's not how much you're using".
