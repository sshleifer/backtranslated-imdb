To summarize this movie: Without a real plot, the movie is 80 minutes that are terribly wrong, drinking or making bad jokes. Music is horrible, humor is not funny and all female characters slutty idiots or total geeks. It seems that the film has been written by a 14-year-old boy, who believes that drinking is cool, designed by women as males, and opposed to all of them. Also, the movie has nothing to do with the original American Pie movies, only a few names and Mr. Levenstein is a little character. The good things about that movie are beautiful girls. Do not miss this movie and do not deceive yourself with 5.4 grades, of course, because it is overdue and does not work well for 2.
