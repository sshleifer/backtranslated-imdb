I have seen 10:00 pm and I must say that this film is nothing special. Although I stopped leaving the theater (I did not pay for films), I did not find abuse. <br /> <br /> There were a few lines and they did so. I'm a rumor, but most of all, it seemed to me that movies were a lot of fun for young people (age is more than age). The fans' services were outsourced and, moreover, he was very much in danger. I know Samuel L. wants to hear his evil line, but, in truth, we're doing very little. The really big part of the movie was CG, very digitalized and did not work on the screen directly. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm a sensible man and I went to the theater. I did not see "Casablanka" and that this movie is an original idea (albiet inane) and not a renewal or a franchise spin off at least. Although honest, if you are not a part of worship, you may be able to spend your money somewhere else and watch your movie in a secondary theater or rent it for a few months.
