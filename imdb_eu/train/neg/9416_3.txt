Steve McQueen has many loyal fans. Certainly, he was a charismatic fellow, he never saw one of the most charismatic screens. Although McQueen could not save a movie from a turkey, St. This turkey shot like a brownie camera in real locations in Louis. <br /> <br /> McQueen is a new boyfriend who has not been planning. The attention of a bank provided by another gang. It is more than a suggestion that there is a homogeneous relationship between young Steve and David Clarke. He is not fond of all the members of the other heist, especially if he does not resign. <br /> <br /> Steve also has a friend in Molly McCarthy and suspects something on foot, especially with Crahan Denton and James Dukas, as well as Clarke, all the rough characters. This is what my suspicions would arouse. <br /> <br /> The Great Robbery of St. Louis Bank, Charles Guggenheim and John Stix, had two directors. Guggenheim made mostly documentaries and Stix did not do much. One of these two jokers decided Steve's play Marlon Brando's bad imitation. <br /> <br /> This movie is the worst thing that Steve McQueen has done. With Dick Powell and Four Star Productions, I've already signed up for the "Wanted Dead or Alive". I can not believe that if they could see that. <br /> <br /> Or they saw something that people would not have fear of except the dress of this turkey.
