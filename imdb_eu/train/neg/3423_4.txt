This is Russ Meyer's 70s genre, a typical soft-haired, although less influential than Meyer's work. This film has a "seasonal production value" for many of the time, suggesting a larger budget. However, the plot, the writing and the acting B field are directly. Later, this film has been the base of the film B ("Drive In Classics") in 500 channels. It's a gentle difficulty when you're remembering, that's "good" like a bunch of B's. Do not expect Polanski, Sarno Sarno is just that. Nothing more, nothing less. As a performance of "mother" by Jennifer Welles, maybe cast is the best. The movie star has no reputation, it's not surprising. The recognition of an old American housewife is not the worst example. It is impressive if you are your type of film. 30 years ago, it would be avant-garde and rich film. You can see the same or less in Showtime / HBO series these days and in the past.
