The trash bin is the original character of the "Blind Dead". So many people have created this movie, I can not believe what they say. Ever since I was a child, I've heard of these terrifying and wonderful movies, and I've all seen them and I've been totally disappointed, do all the 70's drugs do not know how boring it is?
