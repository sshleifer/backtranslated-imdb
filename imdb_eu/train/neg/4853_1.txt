I am a fan of war movies and I have experience with technical details with the Vietnamese vet. I worked more than once with the bombs, and I respected it. Other vets, especially Iraq, have filmed the erratic mistakes. Poetic license is a thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy, and that's why it's wrong. This operator for more than 5 minutes could not receive any bulb units or any type of unit. The military units accept a consensus and discipline for one reason; saves life The first scene was annoyed me. His handset with the device would immediately shoot. Hate, "Mark stop" is not an effective drawback. That's worse. Sniper scenes were particularly awful. As others have pointed out, your average EOD does not know how to be a sniper, and whatever the Russian sniper sees is that it extends to good imagination. The seizure of an Arab company would only happen in a way that personal revenge would be. Someone can shoot, but it does take risks of this kind in the cinema. I could keep up, but, as I said, others have indicated in detail. This is not a good movie, and if he has won all the prizes, he explains why he is named "La rural".
