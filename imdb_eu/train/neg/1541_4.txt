This movie was about to be played by the British scene of a loyalist group. The film blames the people of NI to the cause of their problems. It suggests that the problem of 25-year-old war nonsense with Britain's Irish partition and its dependence on history, that is, the NI was created by Great Britain in 1921, without taking into account the other Irish wishes. <br /> <br /> The characters are depicted as nicknamed stupid, even though paramilitary loyalities are fighting for some reason - maintaining artificial privileges over the Catholic community. British intelligence seems to be loyalists in warfare in the course of the war, which undoubtedly can be confiscated by Catholics and Republicanism. <br /> <br /> In the 'nineteenth-century' nineteenth-century, the values ​​of masculinity were crossed in the 1970s. Belfast and the violence were named Irish psyche. The club's stupid woman, in ancient Ireland ... blah..blah .. - is given a symbolic height, that is, stupid young people fighting for an impossible reason. Litter bins heavy, historic, cheap and evil. O'Sullivan has made a personal statement about a political dispute.
