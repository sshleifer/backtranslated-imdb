A movie about Vixen (Erica Gavin), who loves a Mountie husband ... but he loves sex too! During the movie, the man gets several beds - including his husband and brother! There is also a lesbian sequence. <br /> <br /> This film is on the map of Russ Meyer and (I think) it has been critically X-rated X-movie. When it came out it was a great success. Unfortunately, it does not work well. <br /> <br /> It is well executed and Erica Gavin is excellent (what happened to her), and it was very colorful ... but it is very bad for today's rules. . I'm surprised I'm having an NC-17 score today, there's no hardcore sex and a topless woman alone and has no nudity. Likewise (unfortunately) it is quite sad and eventually the policy was too confusing (and pretty stupid). It is worthy to think that it was very amazing in the 196 year. However, I saw the cut version (R score) but I only heard a few here and there are missing. <br /> <br /> Meyer's next film, "Beyond the Valley of Dolls," is much better and comes in handy. Take it instead.
