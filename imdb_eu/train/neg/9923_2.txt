Since we are writing this review in 2008, we're part of a remake culture. Film studios can be decided without the need of updating all the classic movies, such as 'King Kong,' The Wicker Man, and almost every Michael Caine who has starred in every movie. Remake, this relaxed mentality is not a new phenomenon; however, it shows the 'Do Do Do' 'pasta. A completely changing colorless surrealist masterpiece of '' Porky in Wackyland '' by Bob Clampett, "Do for the Do-Do", sucks the original that overwrites the color of Clampett's original footage, and waits for footage supervised by Friz Freleng . Freleng's manager was totally inadequate to manipulate Clampett's material source, though it was not really a hope for a director to bring Clampett's inspirational insanity. Certainly, then, "Do Do Do's" pasta is not added to the rape of a classic with a new title. For cartoon lovers like me, it's equivalent to the color of "Casablanca" color.
