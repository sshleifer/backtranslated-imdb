Here someone has compared a feature film with High Noon. Now that's a real spacing! I am a great fan of Sinatra, some of his plays, but maybe the only person that Kukuxumusu can participate is Don Knotts. First, as someone has said, Sinatra only has the construction of a man of a bad western man. At this time of his life he is "very small". Maybe it was the same height, according to Audie Murphy, but Murphy was pretty strong. Sinatra is not to be considered as a small child that he should take seriously. <br /> <br /> The story is inspired and really compelling. I do not want to ruin it, but I have no sense in the end and how the citizen reacts in this story. Another thing is that people constantly allow themselves to own a "bad" person. It's just a small town, so I do not get any attraction, nor do I understand why people are being overtaken by this way. <br /> <br /> Is there a love-interest in the story? I continued well, the overwhelmed main character denied that he was not such a bad guy. Now there is a real love for you. "Stand up for yourself!" Tell me your name and kill you! LOL. Stop, kill me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic premise of the film is not enough and knowing how to try the story was not a rigorous way to keep track of the other dumps. . Do you want to know why the videos are never and never appear on TV? Apparently, the critics were immersed in 1956 and were right: this movie is pretty bad. I'd rather like Sinatra to give someone who paid for it in as much as I could. <br /> <br /> Would you like to see a good West where a country wants to appear against a bad guy? Try the Tension in Table Rock, or At Gunpoint, with two really, really good topics. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you were the best singer you ever had - but it was not in such a movie.
