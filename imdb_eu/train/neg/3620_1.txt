I tried to see that film's condemnation when I was five years old; I never had the same. Drug-induced images, the average revelation of medium-sized asylum believes that this "movie", although colorful, is not for men, by itself or for children. <br /> <br /> To begin with, it's enough to be ignorant of a poor boy who has stolen his drums of classmates (waited to wait) and put him in his head; Yes, putting his HEAD through him. But do not be afraid, my friends! His crunchy flute is fast comforted, that is, it's pretty strange, I'll give it to you, but it's still acceptable. <br /> THEN: The movie Oz Wizard and Where Wild Things are a combination but loses all "hot and blurred" aspects of one of these two books. <br /> <br /> So Barney's seven-foot-yellow foot, that is, a bad boy and pain in desperation. br /> <br /> And in addition to adding a nice set of evil subjects, a friend of a boat, grandfather watches, and dumb-clanged "dragons" is added to the Mayhem mix. <br /> A cozy image in the middle of that chaos, known as "Witchiepoo" (?). Of course, he has problems: he had to face the stairs to lean facial expressions with a clear plastic mask, which at times seemed to be the lowest gas level. As a result, one of his favorite hobbies dived the Pufnstuf territory when he went diving into the water floor (I do not know if I would like to live it). <Br /> <br /> In short, the movie is terrifying ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the movie with similar effects to Exorcist, this is for you. Enjoy.
