Everyone seems to be able to make a movie today. All you need is a camera, you have a team of people to make your cast and teammate, a script, and a bit of money and a movie. The problem is that talent is not always a part of this equation and often it is the one that fails in these low-budget film types. Video shelves are called shelves. These are not just guilty pleasures, they are just a waste of forgotten cellulose. Troma Entertainment is known for making the film cycle, but most of the films are gold in films. However, some of the films that have been released have nothing to do with it, and some, such as "Nightmare Weekend", did not do any harm. <br /> <br /> Pros: cast members make the best of evil material. Unwanted sorrow It moves in a good pace (about 81 minutes). <br /> <br /> Controls: rough writing, that is, wrong conversations and lots of puzzles. Ill-ignored, especially night scenes and endings, you can not understand. It makes no sense. Misplaced Cheap and very dated effects. There is no character to develop and you do not care. This is a horror movie, but it's missing in that area and it's not so scary. Nothing interesting or exciting happens. Load with necessary padding. <br /> <br /> Last thoughts: I never expected to be curiously forgotten, but I never imagined it to be bad. I do not know the worst film ever, but it's definitely a contestant. Troma had to leave this movie to rot. Do not make the same mistakes and let your curiosity be your best. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
