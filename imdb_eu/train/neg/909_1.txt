You never think of seeing a sensitive excuse for a movie. The way in which they are filmed, blown, acted, does not make sense. We all see each other so badly. clips charge repeat beyond boredom. It seems that there is no normal person in the "film" and "external world" existence does not exist. and why does this bald bald become suddenly? This movie is out of stupidity. zero
