I think this movie was made with great stars. This is a horrible topic, one of the actors with the worst performance ever. It's really amazing for me A list of so many stars in this movie movie would not be OK. What is even worse is the authors who have made almost 100 million states. However, the big star can earn money, even if it's a horrible movie. I felt sorry for this rumor of the party. Billy Crystal tried his best with the one he gave, and the rest seemed to be moving through the stars. Whatever the case, do not split an excellent cast, because nobody can save it.
