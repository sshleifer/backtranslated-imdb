Well, I hate Hollywood, but I love to watch those movie movies. And, I was happy with Vanilla Sky. I expected that the original "eyes" should remain the same, or they would do it on their own. Well, it was two small things, and it sucked. <br /> <br /> It started just fine. I love Radiohead. I want to be there anymore. In the end, We're listening to The Beach Boys Good Vibrations. Talk about a wide range of discussions. They had one or two good songs on the club and maybe some others, but why they got to beat GV. It was more annoying than confusing or insolent. MAINLY, WITH NO LINE. At least some meanings behind the songs. Kid A = first. In any case. <br /> <br /> He also worked with the club scene. That was it. Otherwise, the movie was a great proud ball. As the public would get the movie. The subtitles were read and the rest did not. It's as simple as that. Motivation failed. Did I not understand Diaz's motivations (did Chicken Soup do tonight before?) And others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Keep on board Tom Cruise can not act (especially in these types of films [that is, Eyes Wide Shut]). And the elevator. I understand However, they tried to play original music with a stunning soundtrack, with an excellent angle and good print on the film and glossy treatment. This would help Crowe if he did not. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
