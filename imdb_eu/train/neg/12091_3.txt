Well artyfartyrath in Cannes could have liked this movie but I am not afraid of it. If you like the type of film that lasts for a long time, ask yourself whether the actor has slept or has a camera that suits him for lunch. A great part of this happens in the field that makes short stays unpleasant. I have not found that other reviewers are shocking and disturbing, because we are not very fond of it and they are not quite. The only reason I have not given this star, acting is highly recommended, the film is pretty shot. The land, however, is highly recommended. A large part of the film shows a woman who is reading or listening to a grumpy woman, which might attract some people. But just think what you think is quite dangerous, think of pornography and some part of sexual violence, you just have to bring a bad taste in your mouth. It is not recommended.
