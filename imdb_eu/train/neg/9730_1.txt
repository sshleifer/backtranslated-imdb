Now I hired this movie because it was Brad Dourif. It's an excellent actress, BRILLIANT everything ... except this movie. And I think this was a stupid movie, and not only did it worry about a good performance. This movie is an involuntary comedy. Some threats threaten. They do not have any reasonable lines, and Tobe Hooper seems to have dropped lines without thinking about the plot. Oh! BTW plot is BAD! But TAHT BAD is one of those films that is really PAINFUL. I only recommend for lovers of Brad Dourif or any other actors, because it's a pathetic plot.
