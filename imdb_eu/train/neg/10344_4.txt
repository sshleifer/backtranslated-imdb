This film was seen on a daily basis at TCM. I had problems with the movie since I saw it. First of all, adults did not age when they were 10 years old. Several parts of the film had continuity problems and, therefore, the youngest son played as the actor appeared to be the oldest 10 years old. <br /> <br /> The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes, at least one black screen with a large gap. It's a very bad thing, though scriptwriters leave something that they want, Bergman and Russell have done very well in their role. It's a shame that most of it is missing, but here's the clock. <br /> <br /> I have everything to be in full. The script does not make sense when the characters of Bergman are sent to small children, but when they are ripe when they are grown again? Some timeline also make sense. There is a similar stock market accident in 1929, but children grow up to fight World War. All the help from this film is ok. I did not ask for the 20 missing voids in the movie as I was missing.
