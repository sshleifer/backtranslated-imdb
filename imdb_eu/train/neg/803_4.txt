I read Ben Mezrich Reaper a few years ago and accidentally went to see this event for the past 10 years. <br /> <br /> Although I read the story for the first time, the difference between the novel and the movie is very rough. Very important elements, which can be credible, are written or modified. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in land: go and get a novel. Much much better. <br /> <br /> Although it was 10 to 4 years old, it was difficult to stop watching, from Ben Mezrich's basic plot.
