Brief version: Seed is not valid. The effect is just smaller and smaller. And encouragement. <br /> <br /> Long version: If you have not seen a movie with "genius of horror scandal" without ever seeing it, it will break the face of the movie. Maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. The opening of real animal abuse can be enough to open the eyes to open video clips, and then the gore scene in the film will be a memorable one, perhaps more than just managing it. Klimaxia will play with your emotions, perhaps, just like no other movie. <br /> <br /> But if you do not have a great experience with the genre, that's it. If you saw real things ... "Penitence on August 21", for example, you will be as difficult as staying asleep until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers compared to the old, bad videos. I understand this comparison. As bad as the videos, "Seed" is less violent than a major horror movie and subtle less. But the reason we know about evil videos is not just for the aforementioned reasons: those who still know something special. To be ambiguous, I think you can understand: those who are stuck around it have the "soul". <br /> <br /> In an interview with Gabriele Crisanti, the new director of "Burial Ground", who has just been presented. -ish DVD: "... we will never be such a film anymore, because technology is now overcoming imagination, it's cold technology, there are a few things that will disappear because such small movies will no longer be created, but they are very expensive, but they're cool. Today is a terrible fear, such a horror movie is worth more than $ 1 million, these films are not so expensive ... they are the effects of our hands. " . <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's wrong to take such a serious comparison of ancient school horror. But Chrysantin knocked on his head. Although apparently in most exploitation, the best malady of video games were looking for a primitive "truth". And this is where Boll is missing. It's not like watching and understanding movies. Everything in the verification ... is a "declaration of humanity", a dark scene of torture, etc. But, as Crisanti says, it's "cold". Gore is all CGI. The whole thing feels like scenes from other genres. And the pause is very slow. Men, so slow. <br /> <br /> Another interesting note: the gore scene really reminded me of a video game. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough BS. Poor movie
