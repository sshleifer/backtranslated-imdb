Ok, I watched the movie for the first time at 9:00 a.m. like Cinemax, a few weeks ago, and I thought I had won the prize. This movie is great. I mean, the monster mom shows a real form only at the end of the movie. I'll go "Is that it? Why does it not short-film a little earlier?" The mother and son of the earth live in the blood of young women. It would not be better if you continue, you know, a murder that would kill a couple of young women, then find out about a sheriff or a policeman and get old people to find a way to kill monsters. Do you keep young women and kill 1 or 2 more people in the process? I think that would be so much better. The dirty son also is the main character and dies first. Why not remove the mother first? Also, how is that force at the end of the movie when people die? He said he was weak. What the hell was this time with Stephen? I can never act any actor in any movie, eventually trying their best. If it were not a good performance, I would give this movie 1/10. 3/10.
