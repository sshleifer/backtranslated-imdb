"Are Us Us Among Us" is a science fiction that is weak. Middle-earth performance is dropped in this movie. The holes in the soil are abundant. Aliens, so to speak, landed on a meteor and have been hiding in more than 100 years, but they need plastic surgeons to be human. They have exotic skeletons in their alien shape (which is why they need plastic surgery), but when you see them, they have teeth and nails. Heroin's father "disappeared" after completing the Project Blue Book, but was considered a F-16 pilot. And more and more. If you want to see the alien invasion movie, choose "Invasive body invasion" and see how it is done.
