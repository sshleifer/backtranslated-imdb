After reading through many reviews, I do not know what movies they see, but I did not see it clearly. <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. The play, mainly in Moore, is horrible. The woman can not play. Beautiful tits, but she can not act. In any case, it has not come true. Instead, the Hollywood actor who spoiled is going to the beach, with boys who play with the belief. The training sequences are at the top. Politics - top Political legitimacy: above. Fight scenes - you guessed it up. Your mission is to get in and out without detection. So what do you do? Why can you shoot at different shifts and make the noise possible, of course. Oh G.I. Jane, you can be a man of my man any time. It's a good premise, but when Hollywood keeps it right, we end up with the final tracks. <br /> <br /> What can be expected from US commercial films? I think so much.
