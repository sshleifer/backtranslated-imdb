Go straight away and rent this movie. It will be on the bottom shelf of your video store and will cover the dust. Never touch anyone. It may even be $ .50 special! It's worth ten dollars, I swear! Buy it! There are not many films that can be compared with that film - The celluloid version of the goat that makes up the bottom of the trash in a few years. Yes, I gave him "1", but really worth it. 1-10 scales were not designed like that.
