Krudel Entidades 2 bloody is horrible, uber-bad. Words can not explain what is bad, but I'll go anyway. <br /> <br /> The plot of Krudel Entidad 2 is similar to the first film. Sebastian (Robin Dunne) is deported to a private school and goes to New York. He decided to start a new home and be a normal life. Unfortunately, he had to face Kathryn's sister-in-law (Amy Adams). Sebastain begins to fall in love with Danielle (Sarah Thompson), the daughter of the school's school's innocent daughter. Kathryn wants to bind Sebastain to all the schools he describes as a "whorehouse". Kathryn wants to revenge Cherie (Keri Lynn Pratt), who has been humiliated at a nursery school. Kathryn wanted to become the greatest slut graduate in the school, in a similar plot of the first movie. <br /> <br /> 2 Cruel Intersections 2 is a TV show that essentially abandons. There are several problems with the movie. Badly written, no one is wrong and bad. Fortunately, Amy Adams has not started the show, because he is currently a great actor. While Krudel's intentions have been realistically meaningful and have been seen in the real world, Cruel Intentions 2 is located in the sitcom area and is described in amazon.co.uk as "Saved by the Bell" version. In the first film, there were a number of issues about sexual abuse and drug use, but we tried to make Cruel Intentions 2 fun and we should not have any ideas in the film, such as the relationship with Kathryn's teacher. Other ideas are also not working, for example, a secret society, in which all popular children are debated by other students. The film also had a serious sex problem between 15 and 16 years old. I know that adolescents have sex, sometimes many, but when they are done on film or television, they are treated very seriously. A famous sense that Daneill encourages Cherie (about 14/15 years of the film) encourages sex to be simulated in the back of the horse with orgasm. The idea of ​​turning a girl into a slut 14/15 is very bad with me, and she would not become a subject of comedy. The movie jokes are flat, if you see a verbal gag, as soon as you see "wet everything," if it leads to a visual clip that Sebastian Kathryn looks to mud. <br /> <br /> I am very wrong in this film, but I do not want time to enter, but I said that this should be avoided. See Cruel Intentions, though not classical, still a decent movie and the subject is treated well. <br /> <br /> This movie just makes the dream of a pervert, the school kids have a lot of sex together. .
