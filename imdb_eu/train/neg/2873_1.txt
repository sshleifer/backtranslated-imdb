This movie has a beautiful brunette named Danielle Petty. It has spectacular green eyes and there are first scenes and the latest scenes. The only thing about this movie is not bad. It may not be a future as an actor, because this kind of film is a catastrophe that kills murders. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is not recommended at all. It's not a good horror movie, or a good journalistic report, or a remake well done. There is no capacity for production. It's like bad student's movie. The great elements of the story are not ill, so it's so bad that it makes you sick. I would give this film out of Zero, if possible.
