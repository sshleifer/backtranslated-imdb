I do not know how a Concorde-New Horizons film directed by Jim Wynorski and Andrew Stevens's interactive talents and puppets can be bad. The mind fails, is not it? <br /> <br /> Well, let's not go wrong. "Munchie Strikes Back" is a bad movie. Munchie is a puppet for many centuries. Unless completely explained to the end of the film, it is sent to the Earth to support a single mother and her son. Her mother's problem (at least, her main problem), paid in two weeks as a result of the mortgage payment ... to a low tone of $ 20,000. Ouch. He can not make any money, leaving himself alone. OK ... JUST is the key word for this phrase. What ...? Was it paid for with a single payment? Maybe you'd like to have a good idea in recent years ... do you think? <br /> <br /> Munchie has similar powers with magical genie ... but there is no limit on the number of desires you can do. Munchie is wearing a night outfit for the boy, but he asks Mennie to "take a loan" to the shopping mall. Furball is also annoying with other world-wide abilities to make the boys win a baseball game. A baseball plays so hard on Earth's Earth many times. Unfortunately, the game parents who see the boy seem strange to them. Hmm. <br /> <br /> In any case, I would like all of this in terms of life force that is already necessarily extinct. Leslie-Anne Down will impress the scene she loves. Your heart is melting its charm when you notice the dollar bills that go down in front of its dollar and asks how it can be generated in the summer. The title of "Munchie Strikes Back" is titled "Munchie Hangs Ten", according to the title that featured another movie. Up to now, the public viewer of the current public film has been stolen. Heh 1/10
