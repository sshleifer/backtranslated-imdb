Vargas won just a bad movie. There is no denial or ad-dollar amount allowed advertising this sad event of this change. <br /> <br /> Maybe Peter Sollett did not see the movie he wanted to make money and decided to take it easily. It is created by a bad movie, which cynically engages the principles of today's "strict films". It may just be better known. It's hard to tell. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to say what the result is. Unless some of the audience who intellectualize an attempt to make realistic realism a bad filmmaker, they will enjoy it very little. <br /> <br /> I did not know him. <br /> <br /> Make yourself one favor and send this movie.
