I recently saw with my wife and I found that Cain is better than you think, even though there are not many police officers. The main screenplay ever in Britain has not been seen as a very interesting role, which is to say that, as it may have been, blame it as it raises its belief in a greater extent. Rex Harrison seems worried, maybe it's not surprising, because his character is very badly written. William Holden is better, but his screen is elusive and, once again, his character is not well written. <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson is just as beautiful as I have ever seen, but very little is given. He won a lot of films concentrating on his story. Ustinov will steal the show, but essentially a comic character maintains the serious tone of the film. Music is wrong and Omar Sharif makes one of his supposed venue (his career is based on decades). <br /> <br /> Richard Fleischer has to be guilty of not guessing it more efficiently. The impossible director of cinema, which is one of his most vulnerable films.
