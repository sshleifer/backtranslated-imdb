Dan Duryea denounces the death of a young singer who died in the 1940s, a great actor in the B-movie. When he dies, the wife decides the same case with the help of the deceased's wife. After a fascinating outing, the film sets it in a fast B-movie formula. Certainly, it looks good, but the rotation finish is colorless and cast (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) is a bit tough. Cornell Woolrich's novel, and suitable for single auditions. <br /> <br /> ** ****
