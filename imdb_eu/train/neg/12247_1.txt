This movie is very awesome. It's horrible, it's about losing 84 minutes of your life. Special effects are very serious. The play was not for sure. <br /> <br /> There is a crocodile who is attacking a tourist who is watching, they are shooting a documentary about "blood surfing". Blood surfing is practiced in sharks around the sharks, but it is a terrible mistake when the 31 foot crocodile is interrupted. Sharks do not look real. The crocodile is even worse and, due to the enormous nature, it becomes pathetic, but the crocodile is locked and 2 women blink. Deaths are fake and pirates are just over time. <br /> <br /> A great and horrible movie is not seen!
