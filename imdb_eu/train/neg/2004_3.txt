I read the book for a long time and I do not remember the plot, but I remember that I enjoyed it. I'm sick at home on the couch, it seemed to me a good idea and Hey! Life is a movie. <br /> <br /> Filled with actresses and actors of the B movie. <br /> <br /> Female distribution is in Desperate Housewives. I have never seen the show but there are a lot of shows, and I get the main idea. Is not it anything original? Sure, but not Lifetime. <br /> <br /> Men's cast are a bit of a look and performance, but I suppose the girls have their husbands, I suppose. <br /> <br /> A woman in a scene is struggling. With a man, in his life, and what does he do ??? Plays on tricycles. What else? They love women, but girls tell me something ... It's not as easy as it always looks. <br /> <br /> It was not bad. I have received some time or two freezers, for which I need someone to be credited.
