I'm a fan of old horror movies and I'm a middle-aged man, when I was 70, I'm a movie that makes most of the 1920s and 60s. I'm not the fan of modern horror movies, except Creepshow 1, I thought it was very good. I could remember about these stories, but I liked Hal Holbrook's monsters in the kutxa story, and he also ended the man who was really clever. All the stories were very good. So why did I like so much? The characters were in a decent development, the lines were very good and the one who was bad, the horror bits frightened by their faces and their funny faces were very entertaining! This sequence is missing these items, or they are completely missing! I am writing this because I have seen it partially, because the movie was completely lost and I turned off on IMDb.com, to write other movies for lol. The old George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamoure are telling you something early ..... 4-10. Also, Romero's expertise is difficult to find here, they must say that they must hold on to a standard PG. I do not know what this was, but it seems to me PG), which is not a movie that is happening well. Encore is shown on the cable channel to see your killing (yuck yuck).
