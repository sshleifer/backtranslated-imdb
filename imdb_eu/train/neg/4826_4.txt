I see what the director is trying to do but he has lost his mark. The main actor was very good, but we're editing its moments. The operation of the camera, that is, the lighting and exhibition is like a pretty girl, if she knew the direction, but it was not there. The sound was a bit broken and it gets out of the film. I can see that the director looks a bit better in the future, so it's not completely out of date, but do not expect DVDs 28 days later or as good as anything else, waiting to keep it waiting and get more. It was at least an hour and a half. Yes, except for the lead, he asked me bad. But I'm a movie snob, so take it for what's worth it.
