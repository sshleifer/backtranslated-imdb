This movie was probably as nonsensical as The Naked Gun (as it came). Case case: <br /> <br /> 1. Lying on his own feet Roberts takes swimming lessons at YWCA. After his "death," YWCA calls her husband to give her condolences. SELLING: how did they get the job? <br /> <br /> 2. Before leaving the village, he places his wedding ring in common. A few days or even weeks later he finds his boyfriend John. This means that the toilets are never cleaned. <br /> <br /> 3. There is no explanation in the way of paying for motherhood in the retirement home (behind the wife given by husbands). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4. At the end of this heavyweight Roberts movie, he thinks his husband is home. Instead of running out of life, he walks in the kitchen to see how cans fit together.
