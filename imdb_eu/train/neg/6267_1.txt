This movie is played out. The plot is very sensible, but since I've been collecting this scientist is the ability to transform personal personal objects into tiny steel bolts and then turn them into their mouths and turn them into zombies (or head to head). And the effects are also bad. Most of the movie has bad music, the actors dance badly like bad music, along with a lot of boring sex scenes. It should be one of the worst things to do, but one thing. "The nightmare weekend" is shimmering above all else. And this special quality is George's presence. <br /> <br /> George is the beloved interface of the scientist's daughter, Jessica and the home computer security system. Her green hair and nose, balanced scalp and heart-shaped mouth, George's angel guardian / confidence is Jessica, who asks him how to meet the boys interviewing an ever-dramatic celluloid interview. With George's synthesized voice, Jessica tells Jessica why men prefer white dresses and they're the third best way to go out and make nightclubs and bars. Of course, it seems that little Jessica does not have any problems, George may cause the "Emergency Program Code: Babes Jessica" to result in the abusive death of Jessica's attacker through one of those steel balls. <br /> Kubrick was a folly that could give a computer with a red light cover. The HAL would represent our friend George, Hess, who would have mercy on his last greeting. The light and light sound of the "Close Meetings" show? It's not a bad thing, but how much better this movie was with the first foreigners was George Hand Hand Puppet. Bishop, Data, R2? Kitchen tools next to Almighty George! It is possible that there are only 8 movies in 90 frames per 8 minutes, but do not be fooled. This exhibition is George. With a limited amount of Screentime, George plays Montrose, Majai and Pappy "New Moon Rising" as Hollywood movie symbols. "George to Apache" ?? you are my hero
