Sands of Oblivion's first 30 minutes gave me great hope. Mum seems to be cheaper. It was a promising configuration, in the 1920s Cecil B. Demille works on ten orders. It seems that the use of true Egyptians on objects is an ancient and terrible evil (do they not always?). Considering that the decommissioned, DeMille ordered a whole set of burials instead of a buried set. Fortunately, we will always bury the evil ones with him. Then the current team changes where the area is to be excavated (the first mistake in the movie, but the costumes of the time are expensive and this is a Sci-Fi channel movie). The first observations that make Anubis monster are well done and an outfit is an effort to make efforts and not an ordinary CG effect. Then the body counts begins. That is, the movie was going to the south for me. The reactions that people die in rough and curious ways make a surprising reaction. Once they realize that the old evil has been resurrected and is dying, what is human and women doing? They often stop calling the "guy" who knows the truth, but never let anyone know the truth. When you get this basic information, do they share it with the exchanges on the dig? No, they make a refreshing shower at a hotel and have a nice little talk at the hotel. Actually, I am not the most motivated person, but I knew that I had an old Egyptian demon who could kill me freely and freely and would come to me. I would take a little step to solve the problem. After this long half-length episode, Anubis monsters are routinely destroyed and shot during a buggy race and shoot with a rocket launcher, near a fossil-pile grenade. For a science fiction film, it was common to pass the mark, which is not to say anything. What damn me, this could be much more if someone wrote a decent script.
