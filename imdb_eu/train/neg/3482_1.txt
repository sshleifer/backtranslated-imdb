So I know I voted for 10 out of 10 worth of more than half of the star. I hate. They were so stupid and realistic, I can not believe one of the stars that do not believe in this project. James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were superb in their characters, as Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were just as good, but they succumbed to the story and I encourage anyone who watches this video store, even though they do not worry, and also lets you read back cover , but I do not want ... to enter into the movie, because it is stupid because it is pontificated. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this one! It's horrible! Amazing!
