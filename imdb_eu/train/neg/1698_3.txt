Lynch. Man has some great things! He knows how to bother him and then he has rewarded us to think in different ways. This, however, is completely different. Dumbland's award is a% 1 absurd comedy, achieving a 99% stupid stunt. Maybe I laughed once, but I started to look somewhat forward in part 4. It's not a thing to miss. I ended up finalizing, and part of it with this series. An annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations, creating annoying animations, voices and sounds. However, recognition and other absurdity features are not worth Dumbland.
