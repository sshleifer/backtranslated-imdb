I have seen most of my "Bollywood Bride" today at the IAAC New York Film Festival and I had to leave the theater as a result of my feelings. I've watched Bollywood movies, and I've watched Bollywood's satirical films. This movie could not decide which one he wanted to be, so the same joke ended. <br /> <br /> It seems that copies have been dramatically copied from the movie like Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling, and that's why work is inadequate and lazy. How can Bollywood ever turn off the overwhelming event and the desire to decide to do it right? Is not it anyone to bring any screen on millions of stories to bring in millions of real and fascinating lands? Auto driver on street, in foreign places, with scenes with empty scenes on the streets of Mumbai for free. All the indices on india are entered directly. So badly predictable ugh !!! Theatrical conference is weak, but talented and beautiful Neha Dubey. He asks why he would choose such a project.
