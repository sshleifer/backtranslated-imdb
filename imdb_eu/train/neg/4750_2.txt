I would give 2/10. <br /> <br /> Really, I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Storyline was poorly developed, for example, events were short and short. Therefore, the moral was not clear. I thought that Brenda Song did a great job, but Shin Koyamada was hard to handle. I saw the need to place Western items on the show. However, there are certain elements, where Chinese elements were also needed! For example, the disease. Its physical appearance resembles a robot rather than a Chinese culture. The last mistake and the worst part were the wrong and distorted spectacle. <br /> <br /> Others say that it's 'Kid's show,' so there's no such thing as standard. However, there are other Disney shows, such as Mu Lan, the development of the story and the presentation, much better. <br /> <br /> In the end, I believe that Disney films should be better studied and better planned. The good show is not enough with a series of martial arts.
