Okay, I've been a fan of the black man for a long time and after watching this movie, it was DEVOTED. These problems ... This first film is made up of two first team members. In addition, PRECELL is called Black Stallion. Why can not Shetan's prey get the name or its color? The Black Stalion Returns, Sagr Black Black, we learned the mother of CHESTNUT, and in this movie, the black mare is Jenny????!?!? WTF? It was established in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I would have been mistaken, but when the first one was established in the 1940s, when the ships were destroyed. The timeline is not very suitable for me. In the same vein, there is a frisian in the movie of Shetan's father, in the beginning ... He seems to have warned beforehand. Ben Ishaak is the only character that maintains this movie, which is related to the previous two. The family movie might be nice for some, but my movie is a yearly yearly disappointment.
