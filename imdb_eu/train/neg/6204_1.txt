Violence is always true or not. This movie is as rough as it could be called for. In the Great Weather director the success of the violence extremities has been proven. But what happened? Violence is NoÃ«en 'Irreversible and' Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange' mix ... two films are outstanding. I'm not misunderstood. I do not oppose any violence and have seen short films in my years, but in general this movie is the youngest. This story never develops to provide a cause of extreme violence, because of the threats to which Robert's disappearance is due to the introduction of drugs. Danny Dyer plays a character who plays Robert's drug addiction. However, the screen is in less than 5 minutes. Lesley Manville. Robert can not cope with his mother, I do not know what one of these actors is doing in a short film. The play is wood, is it a kitchen scene with TV chefs and his wife, is it that it's painful to see the final touches that made this last interview? Some of the boys make some comments ... it seems to be enjoying it, it's so nice to laugh, if Clay's genie's genie's boyfriend wants to bomb their imagery. Why do we need to show this detail to this director because of the pornographic images of the sad teenagers ... this young man is only surprised by this young psychology. we brought our attention to the number of scenes; bar, television outside the kitchen, told the war in Iraq, maybe it was in my opinion that it was obvious. Yes, the war is violent, social determinism causes frustration, all of us violent violence is going on in politics or on the street. What we place all of these things on the subject below is the same problem. It is the meaning of human violence. We still have to understand this issue that we still do not know yet. <br /> <br /> My opinion: derivative, misunderstood and insignificant.
