A scientist from the island hates the kidneys killed by kidney cancer. So he thinks: why did not my son die to become a shark shark? Well, who would not? It is a bit difficult to call the shark sharks that everyone dying "Paul" constantly. Also, William Forsythe's work as a MacGyver-kick-ass-saving hero has no credibility. On the other hand, there are some little hot spots that you really watch on the screen while the sharks kill another. Actually, the b-movie is a bit fun. In my opinion, the movie would be much better if they say $ 10,000 less. Then it can be fun.
