***** Probably small spoilers ****** <br /> <br /> I did not like to say I liked it, but I can not say I did not ... very strange. He has bad things in it; For example, a shark, the bad CGI out of nowhere, as I can imagine, I would like to make sure I was the director, I stopped watching the rest of the movie. .. It will be boring for some people due to lack of action, sometimes it's done at home ... Say, for example, what scene a friend has killed and what they do next? nop, not crying ... horror stories tell each other ... * sigh * (after weeping) <br /> <br /> Another stupid thing when they talked in the boat when they talked "hundreds" of candles in front of them. ... the boat with curtains (like clothes covered with windows) and couches / chairs ... I thought it was dumb, but did not think about the environment, just as it was on the sea floor ... <br /> <br /> Some well-dressed scenes I liked the terrifying ones. At times, horror works when it's better hidden when something is behind, so this movie is fine, maybe I do not know how to budget, but it works well for me! You will feel tensions, just like we have just said. <br /> <br /> Do not expect much! But if you like any of the movies to watch this, be patient, try to enjoy it ... lol <br /> <br /> (Excuse me to lose my English) =) <br /> <br /> Encourage
