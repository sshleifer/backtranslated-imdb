I think all of this for everything. Batman can be the worst thing to do with cartoon-based cartoon TAS books. The next one will compare with everything and nothing has yet been measured. It's too damn Is Batman Beyond Good? "Yes, but it was not a TAS." Is the Justice League good? "It's not bad, but it's not a TAS." <br /> <br /> Batman is definitely not a TAS, but I do not resist it. It would be unfair and it has many other problems. <br /> <br /> The concept of anti-crime against Batman is fine, and sometimes art is very nice. At all times, art is not American, which shows many mistakes of the show. It is designed as a rhythm, writing, and ancient American. If I want to see Jackie Chan Adventures, I saw Jackie Chan Adventures. Or you may just get into the wall and get the same effect on the wall. Joker is a deadly clown and unstable intelligence, a man who likes to fight against Batman in a suit that is unpredictable and lightheaded. When it is forced to fight one hand, it will have to overcome something cheap or completely. It's not about kung fu to be a dreadlocks monkey, and he can jump twenty feet in the air, accompanied by speed lines. If they wanted to do this with a criminal, no other characters could even use or "fully" create much importance. And it is not imagine again that it is a bad thing, do not trouble me. TAS (I go there again) took Mr. Freeze from the ordinary criminals of the nasty B ice standard and became a memorable and morally complex character. Obviously, the frost did not make a nasty classic at the time and made an innovative version, but there is a point. What Batman does is that he takes everything Batman likes and tricks on comics and flowers and flippers on them. Did not guess? They ate the corn. <br /> <br /> It can be seen that this show can not be against the TAS, but its legs peeled and it still does not work for me. Plots are not good and they do not develop better. They are written for demographic children under the age of twelve. Can children be able to enjoy the show? Of course they needed it. This would not be a show for adults, swearing, nudity and violence. It's really a good show, it can be enjoyed at different levels of all ages. This show is missing this brand. <br /> <br /> Is this a TAS displayed? No, of course, no. The problem is not a JLU too.
