At least I was surprised the movie, when I was surprised when I was surprised. Honestly, my invention is more than just a movie cover of the DVD case. And when he says that Boogeyman is the same director, when a new version of it was released ... a touch of pleasure, it was quite misleading to roam me. The only thing that frustrated me only copied the cut off her hair. Usually you see a ten-year-old boy, that type of hair, and he played that character as well. The film seems to have shot a technique from all the films used in a dirty study by a student of D + grade. Sometimes less friends are. I would lose some random turns with external or unexplained bends. All this makes a bad movie, but if the end is not approaching each other, well, that's why film is a bad exception. Certainly, the worst movie I have ever seen, which includes my friends in the second year of the second year of secondary school, but maybe I'm a bit of a favor. I mean, they've got to play more. PD I do not think it's worth a star ... not even half. WITH YOU!
