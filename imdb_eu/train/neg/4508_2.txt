Andrewjlau, I could not agree more. My girlfriend is watching this moment and I find this movie incredibly. My Chinese girlfriend quote, laughing: "They do all this for a man!" <br /> <br /> These women do not have any intensity, nor the sense of struggle between tragedy and personality, and these men are hardly worth fighting. Zhang Zi Yi wins during the dance scene, men admire more than stupid looks. <br /> <br /> Japanese is much more intense than the Chinese and geisha is Japanese culture. I'm sure the Chinese have something similar, but the faces are not over. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the conversation is so mysterious, so American. If Europeans had done it with Eastern European orientations, they would have had a much better job. <br /> <br /> I need to add: people like the movie seem to be American. Sorry, but it's not surprising. All written for you, not instinctive, not passionate. I think they are beautiful Chinese actors, but I can not say that they were good actors in this movie. Yes, cinematography is great, but I do not really know how these characters are seen to be deep and complex human beings. <br /> <br /> I will go to Japan to see the real thing. I think it would be spectacular.
