The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect and nothing more. Of course, it will be an Oscar nominated movie, it's just a mere 90 minutes for entertainment. <br /> <br /> The plot is fundamentally about a group that is struggling. in the desert against extreme hills mutated on the last training day. They are fighting throughout the film, which is a great violence (that is, essentially the whole movie) that goes through blood and guts, as well as other rape scenes. the audience shock you. <br /> <br /> I would give the Hills the Eyes II from 4th to 10th for entertainment, and that alone. Then, I saw more and more seeing that I was seeing more and more films, when it began to drag, the viewers had to use graphic graphics and occasional outlet scenes to make the audience look to the audience. it's awake. The Hills Have Eyes II is a decent entertainment, it's time to spend it if it's something boring and just. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
