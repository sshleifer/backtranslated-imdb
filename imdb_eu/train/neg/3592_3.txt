For a fan series, I have to admit that Hidden Frontier was not bad. But this series can not be revised if it is a fan series. The initiative is, in itself, recommended. Creativity as well. I think people with ordinary jobs and Star Trek are very enthusiastic. But doing all that work. Extract all of these resources. All the time, and still all these errors. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the performance and the lines are horrible. Most. The dialogues are in the 70's military show and not in the Star Trek. The captain (Mr Squinty) seems to laughed at all times. And most of the characters are reading their lines. The director must be aware that "recovering" is not just the vocabulary word. But I think that the series also includes "Two Takes Frakes", which also directed several episodes of TNG and film. I could not help, but I think most of the actors are Trekkies. Without going into that supposition. <br /> <br /> The main concern of the whole project is the quality of the comments. When they decided to spend so much time, and the resources in this series - why did not they offer good quality? Using fast-track time, with low resolution, is a loss of talent. The "Higres" episodes, compared to the quality quality series, are also considered to be bad quality. Using xvid codecs, enhanced resolution and massive file size would improve. If the problem group is a problem, it would decide to set up a torrent tracker. <br /> <br /> Let's hope the crew decides to clean up the series, and perhaps publish it on DVD, giving the project quality. it's worth it.
