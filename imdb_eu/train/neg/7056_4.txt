This movie is a great example of very bad fun that can be very wrong. I really expected the movie to add something that was fun, as well as watching the movie was not as good as half. <br /> <br /> It's funny that jokes are fun. The smoking ban, Jo Bole ... and so on are real jokes, but I do not know who you owe to the movie. <br /> <br /> Candidates may include: - 1) mailmakers (actors) and hammeresses (actress) and not even fun. 2) Director 3) The guy who directs the actor and / or director, in any case, really gets bored and if you really want to see this movie or get a copy. Every ad or ad on this movie and laugh at it because this film is more fun than the feature film. <br /> <br /> The only saving of this film's movie is Mahesh Manjrekar and Chappu Bhai.
