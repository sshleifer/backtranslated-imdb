When I realized that John Wayne was in this movie, I would not see it. She is shy about Japan, shame about Hollywood's misfortune and thinking. But then John Wayne's films are like that. Hollywood in the 1950s still believed that everyone in the world loved the Americans, the truth was different (and yet). 19th Japanese film It's about century insulation. Maybe it's Hollywood to be isolated. To put a deeper explanation as possible, this movie is a huge joke of ginger jokes (Madama Butterfly like bad music).
