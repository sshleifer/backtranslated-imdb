Hanna-Barbera sucks a huge star of life. Violence goes down, stories are formulaic, animation is bad, music is hard and repetitive, and the truth is, the show is not fun. <br /> <br /> At that time, all the HBs were placed. in the same situations as in the series, even if it is adapted to the world of cartoons. Thus, Popeye and Bluto segments are repeated ("Hey! Popeye is popular and popular Flinstones. Put them together and you can not miss it!"). Likewise, in an apparently revocative "private Benjamin", Olive Oyl and Goon have a regular segment that appears as hiring new armies. Seriously! Why? <br /> <br /> Increasing the glutathion factor in all sections public service announcements (usually normal but still annoying to make cartoons). Popeye reads her nephew through the street safely, and recycled - and are you ready for that? - the dangers of smoking! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <Br /> <br /> Once again, Fleischer's oldest socks are worthy of appreciation. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
