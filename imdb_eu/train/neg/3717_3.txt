Chris Rock, apparently an enemy vehicle, was disappointed to get a comfortable vehicle to tighten its white and main audiences, updates the "1978 Heaven Can Wait" comedy with a city agenda. His soul is fighting for a comedy that carries out a car accident that soon removed his body. Consequently, his angel needs to find another body to enter it and only meet his white business. Re-writing a film as dirty and sensitive as the "Heaven Can Wait" shows that it was at the Rock's eye box (that is, the corporate movement organized by most of the Hollywood-owned merchants). Why do not we try to get a higher or more memorable reincarnation comedy in an afternoon apollo? They give everything to the support show (Regina King's most trusted, including Mark Addy, including Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy, and Frankie Faison), but Rock makes himself very uncertain and uncertain. * 1/2 ****
