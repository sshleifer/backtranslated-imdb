The only reason "Norliss Tapes" is worth the ANY stars is Angie Dickinson's presence in Cast. Before seeing Angie Baby "with Women in Police" performance, here she has not seen anywhere else. <br /> <br /> SYNOPSIS: <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS IN TIME ** * <br /> <br /> David Norliss is considered to be a supernatural book. One day he lost sight of something mysterious by calling his editor to find something that was in danger. All the series that wrote this wonderful pilot, apparently invented flashbacks through the "Norliss tape", while the writer investigates a series of audio-tape tapes in the form of supernatural cases. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < We will soon see that the ring itself is not an immortality. Instead, he only makes the body of the sculptor again, he allows him to escape in his crypt, so he can taste the beautiful girls of all bloodshed in the whole country. <br /> <br /> Blue faces, yellow eyes and needles ARRRGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHs blue. Since I've heard about cartoon "Scooby Doo", the sculptor attacks his dark night (Dickinson). He fled and, next to each other, he would contact Norliss to help her husband settle the mystery mystery that appeared later. <br /> <br /> So, that boy is a vampire? It is not in this story that the vampire is not read or heard. The sculptor does not drink the blood of the victim. It includes How I do not know. We can only attack and never catch up. Why? To fill the second part of his bid for immortality. From a blend of heart and human blood, only a sculpted sculptor will be shown to build a statue of Sargoth called a demon. When it's over, Sargothe plans to live in the state, using the gateway to our world. <br /> <br /> LAST ANALYSIS: "Norliss ribbons" was not received. As a good cause series ... it was rubbish. As you can see in my synopsis, the story is misunderstood and misunderstood. The performance and the interview are no better. This is not the contestant for "So Bad It's Good". Sometimes the bad thing is just bad. <br /> <br /> Listening to the dizziness near the "Norliss Tapes", I was very excited to be in the Fox Movie Channel, 03/10/15. I wanted to make myself fall. <br /> <br /> After seeing this groaner for the first time two days ago, I can only accept one of the only applause you have heard from other IMDB reviewers. The dark memories and the nostalgia of young people are being studied. Or perhaps Dan Curtis's loyal fans. In any case, they offered you a deceptive fraud about "Norliss ribbons". <br /> <br /> Pauly Orchid - October 17, 2003
