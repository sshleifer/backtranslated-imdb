This is undoubtedly one of the most interesting films of the 70s, and it is remarkable for launching a decade of Bigfoot hysteria. The whole film is also highlighted by the slight touch of insanity, especially during the dark and changing season of the first season when all is replaced by an INTERLUDE MUSIC (as it is by another user, Travis Crabtree is a song dedicated to a character). who takes a while in a canoe, then ... let's see it again.) As it seems now, it's still fun to show the terrifying movie to the children; and everyone who enjoys the culture of Bigfoot Flower or 70s will kick off. My favorite part: the guy is so scared that he is leaving the door (!?) And the narrator explains that "shock" has been left unconscious. Uh, I would say that accessing the door by breaking it is probably unconscious, but whatever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like American stars bad 10/10/10 or 7/10.
