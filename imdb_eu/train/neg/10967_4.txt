Believe me, I like horror films. I like science fiction movies. I like independent films. And I like low budget B movies. <br /> <br /> At times, I also like bad performances, dashes, wood lines, bad situations and the like. However, I do not like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> Simply it does not work on so many levels. For the aforementioned reasons, and much more. This includes the use of feminine genital suppositories and slim. And the most frequent quotes for male genitals, very freudly. <br /> <br /> I am sure this from non-infectious. Unlike trying essentially something different. I mean any movie that has a movie, a movie that I can hold on to the degree of congruence and focus of the modern spectators. . However, unfortunately, it happened, as we saw things on the screen. <br /> <br /> On the kindness that you can indicate, in the end, the image is horrible. If it had been used in the beginning, instead of the end, the film could leave it when it was released in 2001 ... <br /> <br /> They did not try to replace it badly. I just did not understand what the film was about so important, even though that was what had to be done. Was it on the plot? Surely, it can not be. Are the characters? I'm not sure; I mean, I could not live without an interview with Ed 15? Sharp, no. Music Perhaps, but it is likely that the ego-free ego of the principles to be drawn. <br /> <br /> It's a much better effort on the cutting room floor.
