A friend of my sisters gave me this game, and it's very hard! It looks like a children's game, but you have to learn a lot of intricate movements that you crush and make your hands move, and you can find 100 notes apparently ending. Improve your 'score'! In addition, you need to find hidden puzzles necessary for almost impossible tasks. AND I LOVED THROUGH THREE BEGINNING !!!!! If you do not have life, you'll stay home all the time you enjoy it, but otherwise do not stay! AND NEWS DOES NOT RECOMMEND THE RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN'S RECOMMENDATION - I HAVE CARRY OURSELVES THAT!
