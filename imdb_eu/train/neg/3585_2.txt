In general, I would be glad to be a fan of gorilla movies - and in regards to the effects of the gorilla, they were quite good, though - this is the only thing to write about this flop. He says that the movie is based on a real story, but it's not exactly what's happening to "Buddy", the Gargantua was famous, Ringling Bros. "The hero" sold us. Gertrude Lintz, many animal enthusiasts who knew the well-being of their animals without interest. Being an aggressive aided portrayal of Buddy, fiction was the total and never got a gorilla, in real life, to such behavior. A friend ran away from the wooden box (not a room with a cage in the film) to find shelter and convenience at home, and he was afraid to sell Gertrude Lintz. No, Buddy was not released as a gorilla surrounded by tree pains, in a zoo paradise - he abandoned himself in a wooden bowl, when he was in the deep garage, only with a single comfort bulb, and then sells him. circus - where he lived a better life, peanuts killed him until his death (historically he is the oldest gorilla of live records, by the way) ahead of a Miami show. Not surprisingly, in the film, how Buddy is growing, but chimpanzees are never as old. (Scientists, by the way, did not go along with other animals, including Buddy, depicted in the film).
