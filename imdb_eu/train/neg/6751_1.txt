My boyfriend and I rented this, we thought it would be a good "Halloween" shot. A murderer with a young man, a white mask ... I'm scared. We were badly dead! It's no coincidence. No one is found among the worst of these films, but it's a classic worship! The soil is full and it does not make sense. Actress Maddy is a pretty actress, but this is about it. I have a credit that I shot in a very low budget - I accept such films as always. Not yet the same. <br /> <br /> This movie can be good to be drunk or tall; otherwise do not worry. If you do not want to lose your movie privileges!
