This is the worst thing. H. Rider Haggard is a very entertaining and dramatic novel. The makers of this unfiltered film have not followed closely. Well, old novels are not sacred and their free versions will be right when you have ideas with me. Everything we can do is to change things and have little interest and replace them with the original. They made this movie, at least with the worst actor, and it would have been at least twice that movie shot with a cardboard cabin. NO, there is no imagination any fatigue. Only Victorian collectors of novels will be able to buy or watch. <br /> <br /> So it's a hint, and not a spoiler, I think the ones who read the novel have understood what happened. And what do you expect if you decide to watch TV or - do not give up - to waste money in buying this. In Gagool, the evil old witch and the pioneer of Gollum have become a wonderful gal!
