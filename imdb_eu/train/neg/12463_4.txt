OK Hollywood is not free. <br /> <br /> Of course I am a liar. I'm a conservative, but I'm going to leave the movie's opinion. This movie was anti-bush, anti-middle east, a great oil propaganda, but that's not why it was not bad. <br /> <br /> First I will give credit for credit. I watched this film open night, I like these types of films and I am one of the main political science in Collagea. Cinematography was excellent and the performance was very good. <br /> <br /> Soil was impossible to decode for me. I tested it and I have an IQ in the 138, but I did not try hard to find something to do with the movie story and what they did. <br /> <br /> The story and the scene The sequence was completely inconsistent and badly organized. <br /> <br /> Unless this is possible, this story can be seen in depth so that it can be seen many times to be seen except in one of these films. The idea was exactly what was happening. <br /> <br /> What a sensible way if you want to make a political argument and do not receive any criticism, make your argument an impossible criticism! If you can not shine brightly, with Bull Shell, these baffles.
