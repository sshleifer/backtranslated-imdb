When I saw the show, the first episode seemed promising. Bill Compton presented him as a stereotyped "mysterious" vampire and Sookie himself was presented as an independent woman. However, the show has dropped from here and it is interesting characters that are as interesting as the character boxes. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, the main characters lose their original characters, as well as their dramatic abilities. In the fourth stage Billen's sneezing eyebrows are so low, the face is just the eyebrow. Sookie, or, rather, the actress, has even died more than her vampire lover. These tragic events surround him and only react only when he lost his virginity. Personally, I think the main characters have slept with each other in the show. There was something hanging on the way they were touching each other, and I was able to dress a little more. As soon as Sookie loses, he walks as a whole, thinking Bill's libido and the size of his attachment alone. Bill loses his debonair attitude and well, he just did not stupid. His actions are not really about, except what he does with Sookie. Why? The love for one another never loves, if there be any love. So far this sex seems to be the core of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, vampires are usually the same sex, but they go ahead. I see a certain rumor every five seconds. Not surprisingly, HBO always tries to pass on a soft core porn as well as a decent television program. Bill, who has only gotten out of dirt and only won with Sookier, ever? I laughed so much when I almost frightened myself. <br /> <br /> The land is just a stream of consciousness. Characters are never taken into account. All events remain unexplained. Sex is constantly constant. <br /> <br /> Like the one I only say are small characters. Tara and her drunken mothers are so much more interesting than the main characters. The only reason I see the show is the development of small characters. <br /> <br /> Less sex and the main character of the show would be much more worthwhile.
