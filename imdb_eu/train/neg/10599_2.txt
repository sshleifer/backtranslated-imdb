** THERE IS KNOWLEDGE ** <br /> <br /> The Government has monitored the UniversalSoldier program, which is currently called UniSol. The soldiers are now stronger and can take more damage than before. However, the government goes down, the project is endangered and the supercomputant in the center is threatened, so steps are taken to ensure its security. UniSols activates and controls and directs mayhem. The only thing that can not stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie is about one thing. Choreography fight. The story is bad, and soon it's drowned in every fight. They fight where they are and where they go. Unfortunately for this movie, it's not fun to see if you do not know a part of that fight. I'm usually sure that the hero will win, but you still want to feel the fights between the same equals fighters. It is not an indestructible where and can not be lost. Then fights become tools for extending the time. You have to wait until the last fight to find Deverux miraculously finding his way to overcoming enemies. To reduce my opinion, a desperate sign of a bad movie and a certain amount of women's clothing is inadequate. Well, there are not really many of them because the characters are the majority of men (although at least one woman is UniSol), but almost every woman has at least one BRA at least once. The wives are together with your wife, but we also go through a bands club (for a lesser use of a computer), women are far from them. These moments do not give anything to the story, and agree to try for teens to take care of minors. <br /> <br /> So, the fight is boring. No more, no less. Well maybe less ... <br /> <br /> <br /> 2/10
