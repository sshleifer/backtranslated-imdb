Let Paul "the sex brain" Verhoeven with the nonsensical and youngest version of the story MAN INVISIBLE. If he directed a Pok√©mon film, I was sure it would become a sort of massive orgy. I do not like sex or even sleaze (check my other reviews) in the movie, but the truth is that the director has a track that looks into the invisible invisible man and comes with some interesting aspects about Kinky's involvement in the storyline. It could be a good idea, the film did not spend so much time an invisible among the women of Kevin Bacon. <br /> <br /> The playmaker's game is written in white, but I felt bad among some of them, such as William Devane, which is totally corrupt. <br /> <br /> So what I expected was the director of SHOWGIRLS, that is, much more entertaining than this old and melancholic cinema.
