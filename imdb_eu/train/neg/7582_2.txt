High heels are tricksy things. Women (or men's suits) can take them to new heights, present a sharp style expression and touch brittle elegance. Otherwise, pedestrian pain can be dangerous, because it will cause trips, falls and last tragedy. The distance of the Tacones is more than one elegant high riser. <br /> <br /> Almodóvar's mother-in-law drama is surely stylish, but with regard to the land-bound language-bound and confusing tedious affair, the complex is the never-ending characters or characters that make sense. Apart from some comedy moments, Tacones distant is not interesting. The best child is a wonderful case of murdering a child at the beginning. From the curiosity of black comedy, things are rising, but then the movies take their heels. <br /> <br /> We have several interpretations with strong interpretations and Almodóvar, which has an elegant and artistic direction. Otherwise, Tacones lejanos is not a big part of Spanish cinema. A character that turns morale on murder, spectacle, femininity, pregnancy-related relationships, and alternately, travesty and police informant can be a melodramatic power. It's poor High heels are sure to be.
