Crazy holy! What a thriller Spanish horrible and horrible! I've been there for four years and I started tonight. I saw one or more hours before going to bed. I was absolutely fascinated. I finished Bart and I could not believe it. I stopped in the front. Literally, I stopped the second before dropping the movie completely. <br /> <br /> As I said, it was quite mysterious and curious that this mystery was somewhere, but he stopped Simon when he received the pack bar. When I opened the package, I started opening a laser gun and then played a "threat" game with the laser tag. Whew! He then reveals that the whole thing is that it is a terrorist plot that plays the nerds of the game. Whew! The Spanish industrialist, definitely, could have been behind the director of Mateo Gil (the two great successes of Amenabar before). Excellent scoring and excellent photography. But this scenario requires dizziness. In the last 40 minutes I'm away from someone else's face directly.
