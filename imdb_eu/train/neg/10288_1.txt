First of all, I show this show !!! This episode ... this episode undermines the whole show. <br /> <br /> I do not know what they were trying to do with this episode, but the whole series worst episode was set up correctly. <br /> There's no story, everything is hot and jokes ... they're empty. <br /> <br /> The game was asked how to answer the other questions. ... For example, creating "stupid antics" by creating "preset ..." is just shame. <br /> <br /> It's clear that writers are running. from ideas and that is very bad.
