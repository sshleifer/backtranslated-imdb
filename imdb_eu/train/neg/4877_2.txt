Frank Capra's creativity has been spent in the time he made this movie. There are few charming moments and we have a lot of wonderful actors, but also, by Capra, the first version of Broadway Bill (1934) was not a direct recycling. It is understandable to reuse the rugged race of horse racing, exciting. However, he uses full-length interviews with the younger actors, and then returns these actors back and hopefully he does not realize, for example, Ward Bond is 14 years old! If you do not want to see a recent episode of Oliver Hardy, jump out and watch it instead of Broadway Bill.
