I love stories by Jane Austen. I have read two of them (P & P and S & S), but after seeing this adaptation, I have come from a library called "Persuasion" to get a sense of the story as well as because they do not believe Jane. Austen could write that nonsense. In my opinion, if a movie is based on a Jane Austen novel, you can not really go wrong. Especially great, especially. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, where do you look after and the characters you like? You should at least have a nice character to invest in the emotions of the audience, which is not given. Of course, I wanted to meet Anne and Wentworth together, but you know what the story is about, they meet together. Instead, I had to deal with the teacup on my TV so I had to deal with it and continue to see it at the end. <br /> <br /> Anne was very wrong, and in the end, I do not know why Wentworth was surprised, there was nothing to be attracted to. Meek, soft, dull, socially inadequate, and the sheep seemed to follow the instructions of others, rather than having the mind. That may still be a head character, if you do it right. This was not well done. <br /> <br /> The other characters showed a different level of narcissism, Mary was the worst of all the narcissistic personality disorder. Mrs. Bennet of P & P had a similar mistake, but it was still very enjoyable, because Mary was a great show. More fun than disgusting. <br /> <br /> Wentworth was so beautiful and kind of guy. The biggest part of the story, I just asked him what he was and why he fell in love with Anne, surely, what kind of character he was most interested in ... he was alive? The performance, not to say much, I reacted to the more portrayed figures, than how people acted well and badly. Anthony Head was excellent, but as soon as he was there, I expected less. <br /> <br /> In addition, the story seemed very embarrassing to me. It was not when the movie was over that Elizabeth was not Anne's mother, but a sister (I still do not have 100%). Anne / Wentworth's back story was also very modest. They were together, but then they broke up and that's why they're bitter? How are you? For a while I was asking this and was convinced that someone could have done so. But as it was somehow lost, as if it were not so important. How could the story be so important? They dropped their names, but they did not feel like they were for the characters. How Louisa was this person, for example? A friend Family What It was not clear what character and personal relationship are. Lady Russell was there, but why? Mrs. Croft and Wentworth were brothers and sisters, who were very realistic and felt like Mrs. Croft was just as old as her mother. <br /> <br /> The last kiss, yes, was funny when he kissed the street. But I did not really think about it, because I was busy shouting "BEFORE TIME!" On television, Anne's lips were trembling and trembling, as they had been known before they met at Wentworth's. There you can have some queries, but approximately in a few seconds, not half a minute. <br /> <br /> Next, there is a problem with camera work. As a regular instructor of the movie, you do not pay attention to the angles, so you decide to look at it. I did not decide here, but I still noticed. For me, the filmmakers do not do a good job. There were many interviewing face faces, something that should only be used when doing something. In this adaptation, it was excessive use and therefore did not have any meaning. Sometimes a man-made feeling was not even in a drama scene. It also feels the latest in the running of the camera race. (Not to mention the same run). This was the only adaptation of Austen in the ITV season of Austen. I'm just being asked to see "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" or read books and leave them. I'm sad, I did not like the adaptation of Jane Austen. Maybe I'll see the 1995 version. The BBC are well-known before Austen, after all, with beautiful adaptations.
