Final Score: 1.8 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> After seeing 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back', I made a great shot at Church when I rented this movie. "Soul Survivors" junk "slasher wearing a trashy movie as a" psychological thriller "even with pet killer stalk Dushku, Wes Bentley (American Beauty), being a Cast of a young Casey cast Affleck (Drowning Mona) and a nice star Melissa Sagemiller. Wilson is also there, a bad ridiculous priest. The creation of the writer and director of Stephen Carpenter seems to be a boy of 'Open Your Eyes' or 'Vanilla Sky', and captures a character (and viewers) in an illusion world of an accident. The movie continues to shuffle images and leaves us confused, in real time, until the alternative reality is over. I do not think these movies are fun at the beginning but "SS" is a cheap rock-bottom trash. All essays are considered as films like these, and it is also PG-13, so it has not even delivered gore or T & A pleasures guilty. To keep it (even if it regains the mastery of the version). I heard the movie as a "hot" scene from Dushku and Sagemiller. The movie fell into my presence a bit, and I found myself waiting for patience for the showers that seemed to have lost all other entertainment. Then it comes: they paint two girls in the tee shirts; They jump in a fully-dressed shower and take away. That's it. Did people think that this was hot? 'Soul Survivors' is so weak and inept to be hard-fought among non-feelings. He does not write anything and he deserves almost writing. It finally leaves us empty. Carpenter's end is a blinking light and sound, and it's probably the best part. No doubt, it will be included tonight in the US or Sci-Fi Channel, due to low cost and grade PG-13 - and this is probably the best.
