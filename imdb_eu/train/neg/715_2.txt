This is a very interesting short film. Nazis, shields, government conspiracies. The Nazi version of the low budget was also expected by the DaVinci code or Brazilian boys or Shockwaves. Instead, quite different, psychological, you get something like David Lynch. That was really a plus. But the way it tells the story is horrible. <br /> <br /> Casting is part of the problem. The movement of Andrienne Barbeau began to be shy and fearful. It just does not do well, even though he was at his age, he definitely tried it. The young actress thought her son was a comedy. Most other actors seem to think that this was an external movie, or at least something similar, rather than being extravaganza. It really seemed to me that I was the only Siri Baruc daughter. <br /> <br /> Another great part is to walk. It starts very slowly. So you will be tempted to shut it off slowly. But then it is compelling when he makes a little suicide. Shortly afterwards, everything becomes confused. A part of this was deliberate, but it was a bit more confusing, monotonous, and poorly centered. <br /> <br /> The real problem is simply not to watch a nice movie. Slow, dull, a character is not pleasant either. Excessive use of images and sets. Some of the characters you see are tortured movies. This is done by the viewer. It's awful moments, the most prominent are Nazi's awesome paintings and credits, but the rest of the films are just boring.
