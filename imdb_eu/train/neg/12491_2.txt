Hm. A nice live movie, in the performance of performing performing plays, primitive (at best) special effects (I have seen all the films three times in the last six years), I've never seen Severed's worst classifications. I do not know who the protagonists are, but I do not know if the murderer is using a portable guillotine, given the scene of the dancing floor. In the end, I do not like the movie, because the first 30 minutes is only pleasant, the rest is nothing more than a confusing dialogue and imagination that does not logically carry the story (though I can not remember everything I remember). ).
