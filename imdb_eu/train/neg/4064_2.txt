This movie is very boring, the owner of a petrol station and his life tells the story. Nothing exciting happens. The director really "kept it" and feels like a camera around a woman while living her life. This director had to watch other films in a class, others were not boring. This film was also looking for a task ... it would get better off with a good rating! In general, if it is not necessary, do not watch the movie. But do not discount other films of this director, because they are not so bad ... and do not describe Africa's other films, they are good, especially when a western director does.
