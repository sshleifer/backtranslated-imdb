He is still in school and Akai works for a crusade. One day, Sawa knew how to kill his parents ... <br /> <br /> ------- <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . gory party disappointment It's a "comet" style, but it's still a trash. A strange plot about a teenager who kills as a murderer was terrifying and at the same time moving, only the story fell into his face. It is noteworthy that Sawa's real / bad heroine is a sequence of actions that protects herself from a building. However, the dramatic structure is hardly orchestrated and Yasoumi Umetsu's director is a curious and grotesque character. it's horrible Not only this, the conversation sequences are just awful. <br /> <br /> Grade: 3/10
