This movie is empty. Directors claim that they are still part of the oi culture, but it is still very direct. The subject is very interesting and I admit that I am very pleased because they are all fans and they have never played, but the worst things in this film are interviews and inexperienced and unreasonable. There's no time in the movie. I felt that the directors were doing so to make this movie (it's a very long feature), they really do not really ask themselves, what they want to tell the story. I found several times Ben (a director) and a boy is pleasant and thoughtful, but that is not a director. I think that "American History X" is full of topicals, but somehow it transports a story. "Hello! Warning" is full of news, nothing new or teller (and that's the sad thing about that movie) is far away. Oh! -Reality. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the strange but magnificent German movies, watch Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel. <br /> <br /> Benny's Video Funny Games Die Unberührbare Mein Letzter Film Das Experiment Das Weisse Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Beyond ten, subject and photography
