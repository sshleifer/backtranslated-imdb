SPOILERS. Generous likes are a strange person to review this movie. Let me add a balance by pointing to the following: <br /> <br /> Script: horrible. Tom and Dan are familiar with each other, "because of the fact that the debate is clear, and I suspect that he was the director, that is, to listen to smart intelligent intelligent words. Suddenly, Dan asks: "Did you hear about the HIV virus?" and it's just as natural as saying: "Have you been communicating with nine foreign races?" <br /> <br /> Obstruction: It is made by white teeth and the face sick does not feel sensitive. Speedmank did quite well with what he did, I suppose, but Marsden was horrible: similar, incredible, and very shameful and shameful in his captivity. One show is empty (see Interstate 60). <br /> <br /> Instructions: leave me! The moments of migration were not exciting, but hard and weak. Remember Marsden trying to close the door and then throw away: "They do not work, man!" Tee-hee. And be careful with black and white black, CSI and other schlocky sounds with some other delinquency. <br /> <br /> The main thing, the most dangerous, the most dangerous, the offensive is homophobia (external or internal, you decide) in a movie that is considered HIV. Tom tells Dan he's got rid of a condom or does not use it - sorry, where was Tom's sex? There is a fascinability about the partner that comes out of being gay men as a whole. <br /> <br /> Summarizing: Be careful!
