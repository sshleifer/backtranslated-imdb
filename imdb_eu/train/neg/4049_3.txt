When it came to the 80's, Bill Murray did not like the vehicle. So I saw again the unpleasant movie of my 80's favorite movie or "Stripes" and it's just a bad movie. Well, the verdict comes in and the movie "Stripes" is bad. <br /> <br /> Now, "Stripes" can be an innovative comedy in the early 80's and it seems to be a person who has done basic training. or who is a fan of Bill Murray, but it's still a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it bad? Mostly because it's a comedy "Stripes", but it's not so funny. There are laughter, but there are few. Most of the movies consume a dramatic plot that is very fun and not very interesting. This lack of comedy clearly stands out because "Anchorman" is accustomed to some contemporary comedies when they try to laugh at every part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Murray and Harold will receive more "Stripes". Ramis has no active ability. Bill Murray is a great comedian, but he was not a very dramatic actor in his career at this time, and Harold Ramis is playing Harold Ramis. These two are not enough to make the dramatic arc of the movie as an actor. <br /> <br /> Finally, most of the comedies in "Stripes" are based on smart-alec, Bill Murray himself. The character of the child, so if you do not find that character funny (I did not) you will not find a little comic strip "Stripes". <br /> <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is a very old movie, it does not live well and it is not worth seeing. If you want to see the "friend" at the beginning of the 80's, I would recommend "Stir Crazy". In "Stripes", the humor of "Stir Crazy" is not as fast as in today's comedy, but unlike "Stripes", it is much better and, as a result, it is still visible.
