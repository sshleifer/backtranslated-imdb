There are three films in this animation style, which I remember in youth. This movie, "Last Unicorn", "Dragons of Flight" and "The Hobbit." I have copies of "Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (both excellent), and I've never seen "The Last Unicorn" in more than a decade. It was until today and I would not like it now. The most worrying thing about me was the script. She was very fast and often unlucky. Things would happen without reason and other things would happen without explanation. We are not here talking about a little thing; Are we talking about the key points of the plot? At the beginning of the story, it was not a very good start, but if the script worked out, it could work. It's not close On top of that, music was awesome! I know that the music of these films were called classic pieces rarely, but I am not aware of the music in this movie with a little ball. One day I was trying to show my kids this movie, but it's just cut. I do not think I can meet again with a festive party. He loves it nice.
