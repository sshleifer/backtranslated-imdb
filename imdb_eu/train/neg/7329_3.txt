After seeing this movie, I felt the need to get a little bit of my frustration. Selma Blair, today's supercontracted actress and Max Beesley, has been very pleased with "Kill Me Later". The story, though not the original, surely showed. This does not matter at all ... however, I do not know what it is, but the director Dana Lustig has almost no talent as a director. The footage dropped, poured footage, reversed the footage, used incorrect cameras, used annoying color filters, made faster cuts, jumped back and forth on the timeline and a malicious "modern" soundtrack with junk. I can not recall that the work of directing the film has not been seen so badly. His play has to be giant to cast the play and story, and the director and center to warn the audience members. Its throat is decorated. <br /> <br /> The scenes of "Kill Me Later" are good and they show and show what they might be. Unfortunately, when things began to emerge, Mrs. Lustig would come in her purse-up bags and put things together again. Because Pena da Blair and Beesley had good chemistry and could say that the film was a good heart. 3/10
