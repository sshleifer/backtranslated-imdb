Thankfully, in the final gratitude, they decided to make their whole family together, they decided to watch a movie, and since the majority of the Fred clauses voted, this is what we said. <br /> <br /> The start of the movie were pathetic holes. The simple explanations of why a specific event was empty were empty. For example: who is heck trying to cloak Santa Clause? Is it a kind of corporation? A little explanation would be beautiful. <br /> <br /> The second: the film carried out extravagant characters that did not have any sympathy about your feelings or actions. For example: the elf little Willie and the only tall girl in the elf town. they see each other twice, then they are a couple and I did not care if this film was less taken care of. <br /> <br /> Third: I think it's a family movie? Score only low in PG. For a family movie, there were some suggestive interview articles. It did not make me worry, but I was seeing a problem with my parents. <br /> <br /> Paul Giamatti was very much bored with the whole movie, but he was the only one to honestly watch the movie. Vaughn had some fun moments but he played the same character in the last two films. mouth girl (Nothing has been good against Vaughn in other films) <br /> <br /> So this movie has made me 10 stars with me, because someone has tried to shoot, shoot and release this movie. . <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I'm going through this movie, or you should watch it for rainy days.
