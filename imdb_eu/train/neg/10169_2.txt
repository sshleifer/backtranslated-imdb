It's been in 1978 and, of course, there are too many black players in the teams! The fans will be disappointed and there will definitely be 75,000 seats full of happiness if there are so many black players in the field! This is a TV interview for Super Bowl. It's not much more, but it's amazing that it's amazing casting talent cast (at that time), surely Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, the benefit of Selleck to the screen, "actors" like Dick Butkus go quickly. <br /> <br /> Super Bowl is a story about bets. PJ Jackson charges "New York" for the end of the game. That's why 10,000,000 dollars will be bet. PJ is innocent enough, and it seems to have gotten a feel for some people who have bought and here. But things seem to be far from it. Lainie is in charge of another person who is unexpected. Again, the mystery of murders is unknown, but Lainie is revealed in the last death of the new antagonist. <br /> <br /> The movie is bad, but it's invisible. The play is decent and shooting is fine. At least there was no stupid car habits in the 1970s (their place is not here). Keep up with the stereotypic past and the cocaine during your time you will be open and alive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe 2.5)
