Blood Legacy begins with Dean's real estate with the lawyer Tom Drake (Norman Bartold), with Dean's estate, owned by the late Dean (John Carradine), who will be greeted by Dean's four children, Gregory (Jeff Morrow). His wife Laura (Merry Anders), Victoria (Faith Domergue), Johnny (Richard Davalos) plus Leslie (Brooke Mills) and his star Carl Isenberg (John Smith). Due to the final wishes of his father, Drake makes a recording after his death. The $ 136 million property must be divided equally between four children, if any, the money would be distributed among others, and if it were all to kill huge servants Elga (Ivy Bethune), Igor (Buck Kartalian) and Frank (John Russell) would be much pocked it would be. Well, I'm not happy with a quota of $ 136 million in the quarter (that's still almost $ 35 million in 1971 it's not a bad thing), someone decides to do it for them and it's not too late for them. The refrigerator ... Written, produced and directed by Roy Monson Blood Legacy has been disappointed with two issues. For starters, the title of this film is more typical of Legacy of Blood; Andy Milliagn's title is a dark horror movie directed by '78 in the '80s. I watched some similar stories and a cable-TV guide on the screen in Blood Legacy. It was exciting to say that it was in the movie Milligan, and although I was nominated as the director, I saw him sit down and I heard John Carradine's voice. Then I knew that it was not Milligan to see the movie, my heart sank. Then, of course, Blood Legacy is a murmur, which is sometimes painful to watch. Monson and Eric Norden's script is slow, boring, and very predictable. The character is oddly curious to her sister (?), A freak of an officer who asks you, a mysterious or mysterious creature of Brother's & Sisters, who is really unlikely to know and is far from reality. It could be a simplistic whodunit short story, and then it's a great tour that you've guessed in the first 10 minutes. It's boring to watch it, it's a bad rhythm and it's just about to think about it. Please someone save me, it's really a bad thing. San Legacy I felt bad all day. I was really. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Director, Monson, did not have a budget budget or did not have to deal with traffic. The whole movie is ugly, it's a very bad picture and it's not the atmosphere or the fear. Blood and dirty is shaken, the ax in the head, the head cut, the scene, someone killed and the best murder of wasps when the face of someone pissed. However, there are question marks on the scene, so the victims do not. There is no Piraha tanga. The head of the victim is Piranan tank, to the right. The victim Pirahna eats his face, right. Crystalline water is clear, even if the victim feels his face, although blood is in <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Technically, the blood's heritage is horrible, it seems that it looks awful. The terrible conversation can be a blessing to disguise. The performance will not win any surely any award, the least he said has been better. <br /> <br /> Blood Legacy is a horrible movie, there's really no single positive aspect or I did not think about it. Please do not worry, movies are much better.
