The original Boogeyman supernatural slasher was stupid but entertaining. It was not a great movie, but it was fun in the field of mind. The third part of this series of Return of the Boogeyman, on the other hand, is just atrocious. He has two things. First of all, cheap and alive footage. Secondly, the first LOADS of recycled bits from the first film. The new material is wonderful, but it is not a fun and inept, very boring. The footage was clearly linked quickly and effortlessly. It is used as a drawing device for endless clips of the first (and second) movies. And guys will wake up from these old-fashioned films; Sometimes repeated sequences are reused. The only new complement of these parts is oral, which describes exactly what we can see with our eyes. The experience that is seen is very stubborn. a type of viewer who exploits a very cynical way. I want to keep the summary and the point of this review because this movie is no longer worth it. There is no value at all. This is not valid.
