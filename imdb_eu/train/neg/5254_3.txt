(Except as stated by the spoiler). <br /> <br /> I recently enjoyed a lot of Spanish films; Almodovar's Spanish cinema, and Latin American film director, like Del Toro, the "Devil's Backbone", which was set in Spain by the Spanish Civil War, was the best horror movie in the last decade. It is not surprising, therefore, that this film is well-done, and that the Spanish atmosphere is still different. But it was not a movie or a useless one as it was not. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of all of them? We do not have a real idea about what the central character has caused to tackle his murderous attack, although the large numbers of narratives come straight from his narcotic magazines. In an unpleasant initial sequence, set a decade earlier, we see the character who dies his girlfriend in jealousy and freakery control ("if no one can not?"). Oddly enough, maybe this is one of the best sequences in the movie, but it does not have a relationship with its next killings, that is, it will be completely different from motivation and execution. What happened to the jail to trigger this change? We do not know, as we know later, as an absurd reflection, he was legally entitled to be imprisoned in prison. <br /> <br /> In Great Britain, our "series killer" or "sex" in many. killers, "a terrible question arises, what happens to the wife? Did you know what happened? This is a question that could be asked by the film, and in fact, the wife starts as one of the most interesting characters, but the answer to the question is pretty clear : "No, he did not." Even when a dramatic similarity is presented on a plate, the film still hardens. All of what we really get is, at the end perfunctorily described the draft, after the event is a bit of amoral cashing in profits.There is a comparison of Ten Rillington Place- with the incredible revelation, where Christie's wife says "do you know what you mean?", thus stamping her fate's stamp and giving us an incredible view of unforeseen knowledge and horizontally impeccable caves. <br /> <br /> (Section This is the main spoiler.) In the meantime, we believe that the murderer surpasses the police in front of the police, and thus a small summary of mental hospitals I think we should die before we release it to the mental hospital. How did he get that? The land is very exciting at this time; something related to deliberately leaving some traces of the police; But the way it works or why, or the case of the subsequent court, it is still a mystery. <br /> <br /> I really do not think serial killers are like that. The silence of the lambs can be comic books, but? Lecter aside ?? he gets his series killers. People are deeply disturbed, deeply dysfunctional and profound; not the charming charming master presented here (The Last Horror Movie, or even the Man Bites Dog, even though it's a smooth and murderer), even though he has not even noticed a satire. <br /> <br /> This movie does not create a small suspense and creates small intriguing creations. It is useless to say about the motivations of the series killer, in general, or in the Spanish culture. This is not a bad excuse to show the misogynist violence against women. And, oddly, violence is even more repulsive that it is a certain nerve failure, even how it is presented. The basic nature of what is really shown is even more damaging. An explicit video, with the appropriate season, could be more surprising, and since the rest was not absolutely necessary, releasing more time in the movie would free the holes in the plot and characterization. Instead, we just get a picture of some young women with unlocked clothing covered on the table, but they reveal their pretty clothes. Very awesome I'm sorry to be rude; I love horror films and even the most extreme ones, even though I have to worry about my partner. But I think this movie is good or interesting if I'm moving away from anyone. The purpose of a horror movie is to be scared; That's the lascivious. <br /> <br /> He leaves a very bad taste in his mouth. I want to give this movie more than one star, because it has been done by the authority, but it does not morally make any merit and it should never be done.
