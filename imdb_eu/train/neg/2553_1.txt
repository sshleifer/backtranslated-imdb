Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad What else can I say? Kate Jackson must be disappointed to correct it. He had to go back to activity ... he thought he was a bad actor. Who would make money for something bad. I like films from the opposite of Christ and I usually have good laughs and extravagant illusions, but this Bad Bad Bad. Star play is worse than what one found in a TV show. Special effects, if you can call them where you want. I would not be surprised if you have a slow scene and see the tubes that leave the blood. We had to turn off the disk for only 30 minutes. The original engraving of these films must be destroyed, all records and tapes should be destroyed and all people involved in the movie must return money to people who rent the movie. Then people would not be able to do anything, direct or shoot their home movies.
