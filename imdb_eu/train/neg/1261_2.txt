I'm a fan of Jean Harlow because he had a star quality. I do not think the movies are good and I do not think it's a good actress, but it certainly has some beautiful comedies. The Girl from Missouri comedy bit is very good. But this movie is like a love story. Jean Harlow is wonderful, and you can forget about the rest of the pieces - their performances know nothing. Harlow's beautiful body is always thinking of being a poor woman. Well, this movie looks great.
