I was registered on the IMDb to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> I was sitting by this movie, and the only thing I was surprised at was that I did not want to stop the power. <br /> <br /> I've seen the action movie is quite a lot and what's wrong, but Princess Blade has some worst fight I've ever seen in a movie. Most of the sword fighting does not shake the sword and it has the fourth and the opponent does not do the same. Many students' films have seen better performances and larger plots. <br /> <br /> So now we have a "futuristic" action action, the poor and almost a sign of the future. <br /> <br /> Most of the movies also have no action and shows the relationship between the princess and the farmer / terrorist and her sister. The film has many plot lines and no one is of any value. <br /> <br /> A part of the problem may have seen this dub was pretty bad. The entire castle smashed all its lines, so it was difficult to follow what was going on. But I got a general idea. (Knowing what I said was not going to keep the movie in my eyes) <br /> <br /> If you've heard of being a futuristic action / ninja movie, you've heard it wrong. I thought that's what I had reported, and now I've lost 90 minutes of my life. Let's not make that happen. Correct it well.
