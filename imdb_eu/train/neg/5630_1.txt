I saw the last movie, the only reason was "hope" to see something interesting. The movie is very bad and the performance of the girl is really bad, honestly, I'm not a film critic, nor an expert, but it is sensible to note that this work is very bad. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>> ... I was surprised, surprised, when I watched the movie the next day I found his wife, Giada Colagrande. Awesome story and awesome performance.
