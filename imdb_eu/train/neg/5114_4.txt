This movie was bad. Bad operation, bad management, bad writing. But it was not bad in a fun way. Bad was boring I saw "Surface to Air," because I thought I could laugh. It was not. Do not make the mistake I made. There are many fun ways to spend an hour and a half, such as dry paint or vocabulary. Serious
