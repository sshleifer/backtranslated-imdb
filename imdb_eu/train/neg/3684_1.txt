They sell it as a horror movie, a thriller, but I was very funny (comedy, I do not think), I laughed at the whole movie, I think it's a hilarious and plain drawing. I do not blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but O.K. I think Cillian "bad" is very good at "Batman Beggins" and I loved Rachel McAdams's performance ... Whoa! It's a beauty, and a good actress, but we've tried a little bit here, mm mm story ... mm mm direction ... there's a lot of good suspense, it's a really boring movie. But it's a good thing, it's a short film, it's only an hour and 30 minutes (YOUR 10 YEARS OF YEARS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!) <br /> <br /> I do not know why the movie This is so high, and the rotting of tomatoes, even greater, what happens with good, rational and objective criticisms?
