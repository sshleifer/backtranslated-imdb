This movie is one of my favorites. It's not really good, but it's good to laugh. The conversation is very playful and can not be played correctly (for example, "Manji, can you make some questions?" "Surely." "We think you can help us with the answers." Surrealist combat is sure to check Brock, the black man who attacked the main character. It just has one, but it's one of the best films!
