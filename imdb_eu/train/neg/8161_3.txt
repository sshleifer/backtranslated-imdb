Mary Lou is looking for the spirit in search of dependency in 1955 that allowed people to join their self-sufficiency. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie is mainly done in 1986. 80's movie is strange. / Special effects stupid, demented, including some strange rocking horses. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the spirit of Mary Lou makes things bad and tries to take on a person's body. To find out whether or not to succeed, you need to check to find out. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is largely boring and based on a group of pure characters. This is not a sequel, with the first one, the only thing that is secondary school name. Average Horror movie falls back, gore, nonsensical nudity, strikes against the Catholic Church. Basic things, boring film. <br /> <br /> The operation is decent enough to give 10 to 10. You can waste time doing something else.
