After his death by John Belushi, his first film, Aykroyd shows a great deal of trouble in trying to get a character attached to Belushi. <br /> <br /> "Doctor Detroit" teaches Aykroyd's teacher's book. Pimp, strange and violent, to meet opponents that only know a mother. This is quite a bad thing, but it also has teaching schools, a school-hospitality dinner, four-evening-care women and a Pimp's Dinner (or something like that). It's not surprising that Aykroyd's time seems to be terribly frightening. Why should the audience only be? <br /> <br /> Aykroyd was the wife of Donna Dixon. It was at least well out of this chaotic mess. <br /> <br /> One and a half. Good Aykroyd, see "Blues Brothers". You like bad, see "Doctor Detroit".
