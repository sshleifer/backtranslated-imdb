I do not know kung fu movies for a plot. I've bought scenes for combat. A bad land will be overwhelmed with great fighting scenes, but not vice versa. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, but it moved slowly to my liking. 3 or 4 medium-sized combat scenes were around a couple of minutes. The last fight was longer, but then I was bored, even though I did not pay attention.
