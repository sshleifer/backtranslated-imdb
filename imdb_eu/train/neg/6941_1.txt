This movie is not only boring, but it's really bad. Graphics are so bad, there is a secondary rate too big. The characters do not show facial expressions, the voices are empty and soulless, and the plot does not ... well ... anything and everything. It's my 5 year old favorite, but it's a bit boring. I agree with him.
