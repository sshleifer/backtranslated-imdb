This movie was the worst I've ever seen. Correct battery For me, I am someone like someone who can develop a connection with the hero or have an empathy. I saw the history of individual imbalances that were confused with the exclusive character. Just terrible <br /> <br /> His most generous light is to be seen as an essay for producing and "art": I could not find it for any given life, any art. . <br /> <br /> If the woman had been living in the present world, she could take her to a mental institution and she would treat it with her during two days with an anti-psychotic treatment. That, or just, will walk the streets and transform the bag into a woman. The rest of the people in this movie find out why they are looking for an actor, speaks to their pathology rather than all the features they deserve.
