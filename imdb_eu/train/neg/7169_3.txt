This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. However, the little slave, by imitating Alice and Jared Harris, Christopher Walken, is an entertaining story. It's strange and interesting when Alic calls her name when she's smoking, drinking, and terrifying. Jared praised Christopher Walken's imitation and Christopher Walken's film.
