There's no way to avoid the comparison between The Hat in the Hat and The Grinch Who's Christmas Stole, so let's take that part of it. First of all, let me say that Grinch was considered underrated and accepted by cinema. Cat was ... well, it's just horrible. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey was a great physics comedian because he casts himself afraid of over demanding top characters. Mike Myers fell into his old scams bag. <br /> <br /> Why, why, Mike Myers why? Children were less cared for, and demographic Austin Powers will not be screened for this movie. So what was the studio thinking about? <br /> <br /> Cat was apparently linked to Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why is an accent in New York? It is not entirely consistent Dr. Seuss never wrote. Myers allowed it on his Scottish cover. I wonder if you've tried to change the different director and studio voices, "while you're not saying fahklempt" you can store accents. Meyers never found any comfort, clothing, make-up or conversation. <br /> <br /> In the joke, the few people were raw and were of good age. When Myers chooses a garden hoe and drives it to the camera, everything is "dirty crazy", but it's not helped. That would not even help. <br /> <br /> The same people who created 'Whoville'. ', clearly, he created a hand and houses' Cat'. The sets and props were very attractive, giving the viewer a great deal of writing, direction and Myers. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston were fun. Dakota Fanning was Dr. He was the only actor who realized he was in a movie based on a classic Seuss and was still a true genre. <br /> <br /> Call SPCA. This cat needs to be tightened and never allowed to reproduce. Please, please do not follow.
