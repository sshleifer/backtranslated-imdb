I love science fiction, I am fascinated with Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation. I thought it would be a nice movie that combines these three. I could not go wrong: the story (or really not) was inspired and lacked imagination; While the imagination was the main component of the science fiction story. Interview and play porn video is worse than the average. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives a new meaning to 'bad performance'. The bad operation would not be such a serious problem if only the "manager" of Bilal were not so serious; All lines are considered poetic, Bilal believes that he thinks he has made an artwork here. Well, there is no art or poetry found in this bin, only sorrow! This man should force himself into comics, because he fails in all possible accounts as a director. The worst thing is that the awesome digital animation, which is so ugly, really makes the film immersed in physical experience. Graphics look so fake, but men "Van Helsing" look like direct actors. And since the half-character is CGI-animated, the CGI effect is so fake. If God of Egypt really is, Bilal is definitely a dead man who will take an incredible revenge as a wonderful portrait of a wonderful movie.
