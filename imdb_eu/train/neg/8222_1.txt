Um ... Okay, I think of an unexpected camera, a gorilla-style shooting technique, but I think the gorillas could make a better movie ... Unfortunately, this was a whole mess. Poor performance, bad management, bad story and incredible cinema. I do not know how to unleash this piece of garbage, but I'm sorry to see it. Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd), a group that stars in Tennessee, "Five Across The Eyes", looks like a "Blair Witch" movie, but it's short ... Well, the nose comes out of the abyss. I was really ashamed of these young women, I'm sure I was promised to be a famous Hollywood star, but they ended up with this donkey. The conversation is ridiculous and it really aggravates while you hear it. Being a horror movie like this is another mystery, because there is no distant fear about it, except what I saw ... Try this for size: 5 of you and one of them. , do mathematics and play in his ass ... "End". Unfortunately (in a row), more than 95 minutes of mischievous stupidity occurred ... <br /> <br /> I saw it free and I wanted to get my money back.
