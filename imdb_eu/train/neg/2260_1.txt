Oh dear, Jerry can be an undisputed undisputed king, but the movies are a different ball game and he leaves his league. The screenplay of this movie is so bad and it must be seen that the dull and sad Michael Dudikoff (80's action ?? B'movie king), Michael Jai White (known for the last time seen by Sci Fi flop). "Spawn") as well as the Gamesi Survival "William MacNamara (who participates in a fun half-full state of the movie!). Get rid of this work. If you're a Jerry fan, you have to keep your television program as it's half an hour wasted. When I finished I caught the last half hour of Rocky 5 on television, that is, it seemed to be like a movie masterpiece. I think it's more than enough! <br /> <br /> <br />
