Although Serbia and its nationalist policy are the main cause of Yugoslavia's disaster, it does not refer to this "documentary" made by Bogdanovich, whose name tells us that the Serbian and its movie was not intended. It is a fake driven by the Milosevic regime. While others are only guilty of the Serbs being the right and the victims, most of the Hague War criminals are Serbs, even though the Serbs are committed to the Bosnian Genocide and are independent nations that are attacked by Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. Yugoslavia The UN pickup was not avoided, because the Serbs wanted to liberate nationalism from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to protect their interests from independent Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia. The documentary and objective documentary about the disappearance of Yugoslavia is not that. "Yugoslavia: Death Death", Discovery Channel and BBC Author.
