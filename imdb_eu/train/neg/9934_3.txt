As Rolling Stones is a regular listener, it seemed interesting to me. It's not so much that this movie is very old in the 1960's. For me (born in the 1980s), I think it's a purple hippia for me, but I'm sure this film did not work for me, but those who were active in the 60's. The drug I expected with Drones with Stones, I was disappointed, showed me a real life, I worked hard on the studio, I felt so much about working with them to reach the conclusion of that divine film. I have not seen the director in other films, but I suspect that leadership will continue to be a similar style, "amatuerish", feeling like Eurotrash show, wrongly directed, correct and real values ​​born together. The good opinions about it I have not squandered any money, free of charge with a Sunday paper.
