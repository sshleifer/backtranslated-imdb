Anthony Shaff's classic play did not last long in theaters. When I was recently borne by the cable, I was happy because I did not lose any money yet. Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter, and producer of Jude Law, deceived that his prestige was only impossible in 93 minutes, without any lengthy and entertaining origin. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine improved his reputation for playing the second leading role in 1972. Now it seems to be destroying it, directed by Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for Best Actor Oscars, but THE GODFATHER was lost with Marlon Brando). Caine, untidy and unclean, is going to come in into Cain more deeply than appear as Batman's sleeve. He has already dropped the appearance of a guest, in GET CARTER's hard version. What's next - ALFIE II, or HOW DOES THE NEW SOCIAL WORD HELP? <br /> <br /> But then, nobody puts Pinter on this adaptation that he directs, to compensate for the mismatch between Shaffer's horrible nature with frequent frequencies and sexual orientation. The direction of Branagh is on the blue screen and can not take any design without a secondary nightclub. Neither shadows nor close proximity to excesses can also overcome Law to the sad screen. The result is a mere drama, as well as a thriller of theater, almost forgetting the purpose of the title. <br /> <br /> The fans of the original production (with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / Caine would do well that this company is a bad dream. When Shaffer wrote his 1972 screenplay, and some adaptations by Hitchcock's FRENZY and Agatha Christie, he had to return to the grave, he could have planned a real murder!
