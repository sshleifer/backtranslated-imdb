I feel like all the fans, but it's not an unforgettable movie. The play is bad, though it's wood, it causes initial fear and it does not work. I think they end up making a twist, but it just ended up being completely confusing. What about hell Everyone who was dying was hunted? Please try again. <br /> <br /> It's not nearly original, and it's not particularly suitable as a straight slasher. And that's something he's saying. <br /> <br /> Those who thought about the idea of ​​anyone who wrote to those who cast them should blame and deport. <br /> <br /> Do not observe. this movie If a party puts it on a party, throw it out of the window and put on a good horror movie like Silence of the Lambs or The Shining.
