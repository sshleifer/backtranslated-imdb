This movie has a smell of a bad movie, it is definitely amazing at many different levels. First of all, for fans of ancient fans, it's interesting to see Dean Jagger's role as the main role for Mick. When Jagger later became a very active actor (12,000 won on this page, he won an Academy Award), his work is very unique because he has a full head of hair (I have never seen it). Before that, it was the worst actor in the film before and so far. This film shows that the actor can not play in the first films shows that the actor can not learn the best actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first movie (THE SILVER CHALICE) is one of the worst films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The second reason for watching the movie is its dirt. all. Writing is bad, playback is bad and bad effects are bad. For example, while Jagger and the unnamed Cambodian people are walking around the water, it is obvious that they are actually walking in places and the back is not projected behind them. Also, when they leave the water, their clothes are 100% dry! The whole movie is overwhelmed and overwhelming with mischievous interviews - it's so hard to imagine why they did not ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to be the protagonists, both starred in horror movies. . In many ways, it would be an excellent example of a movie class that is not a way to make a movie. <br /> <br /> So, in the end of the 3, it's much more generous, it's fun to laugh and short, so bad movie is looking for fans.
