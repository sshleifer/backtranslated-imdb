This movie was very torture. First, it's a four-hour horror! In fact, the Kargil war had to capture and fight some points, but each one of these battles was not needed. So maybe this documentary is not a commercial movie that advertises it. Surely, there was insufficient background information and there were some errors. The fighting sequences were so badly executed. I was very disappointed with Border's well-executed sequences. Every fight was the same as the previous one. It was so planned. (This may be a spoiler). The whole army is uplifted, five soldiers cheat five times each (they use the same word at the same time), one of the main actors is filmed, someone is looking for a pile, the actor. He says, "No, do not get a table, which will take about 6 men to the battalion," then the actor dies. The same thing happens repeatedly. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. The cast of the movie is too much for his sake. Despite such a feature film, none of the characters were well developed. The actors were lesser-used roles. All dressed and portrayed to be the same. Two of them were crying synchronized. It was so comical. He moved his hands and heads simultaneously and then threw them together with his partner. <br /> <br /> The list goes on. I know I still forgot something. In any case, I think they have enough movies to get the picture.
