Welcome movie 17 classic 50 cold classic. Where we see it, that's it. Any other movie that does not make sense. Actually, this movie was so confusing at the end, I thought I'd watch "Dawn on Sleep". The plot looks pretty easy ... well 3 seconds into a movie where a girl dies after a cat ... until she explodes ... I do not know what happened. AND THAT WAS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. That's really sad when I was not able to hit the first three minutes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he has a photographer with a great mustache, he finds that girl after losing her way of taking photographs of her other girlfriend. something somewhere So we will arrive, but it is not someone who steals their jeepa from driving 200 meters from the road to the village. suspicious? nah That's why they decide to stay in a quiet country with an old lady. and then blah blah stuff happens and speak blah blah. Men with heads go out in the clouds for some reason, though they will not say old women. He loses himself and then returns. <br /> <br /> Oh, all I had to forget about these amazing 20 minutes afterwards, they seemed to be in the house of a man who looked like this guy. casablanca They leave it later. It's really not for this scene. It's really padding. If you cut it, nobody would notice or take care of it. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, that was really the best part of the movie. wait Let me write again. Unfortunately, it was the best part of the unfortunate movie. The rest is so confusing to look at the IMDb to find out what happened. But, of course, nobody knows SOL, I am. <br /> <br /> Really, it was the hardest moment I saw in the last 30-minute movie. He dressed in a dress, when he was kidnapped and then released, he returns home and, finally, witches are home and end up? serious I have never been confused in a movie. I mean, they feel at least as bad as movies of "Robot's War". This film does not consist of the WORLD. At the end of the day, "confused at dawn" it was as stupid as the end and it was more boring in the plot. This movie just got 1 "I have no idea what happened in this movie". "The Witches Mountains" 10 is a confusing observer.
