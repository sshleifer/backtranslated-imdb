This movie was seen in a group of traditions of the Fast Forward Film Festival. We would like to rent a bunch of B movies and vote for the worst. <br /> <br /> We saw this one night, they voted for the best, because they are fun because of the plot's look and feel. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a stupid movie, kitsch, so you can understand how to look for a low-cost budget. Personally, however, I would not recommend additional substances ... the movie will leave your brand. <br /> <br /> He gave me my opinion, I was really trying. A copy in your hands for a few years. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch bad movies. This is fun, and I remember bouncy music ...
