Scifi medium movie. The earthquake was obvious at first glance. Even though the play was quite good, I found it very ordinary writing, using ideas from different films. <br /> <br /> Basic plot: Scientists working in a deep space research platform rescue a fighter in orbiting a red dwarf. In the ship, at this moment there are malfunctions. After 2 or 3 minutes of an awakening man, you realize that it is completely crazy. More than 3 people from the research boat flee completely ... <br /> <br /> Then all other films will be innocent by all other movies that terrorize innocent victims. I thought I did not have a good thing about the subject. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, the aliens get out and watch it again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
