CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it is clear that the series has reached the natural end, CLEO, UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING are one of the best entries from the mid-60s to the end of the year <br /> <br /> MATRON is bad at all before all is seen a spiv series that tries to steal all sorts of thin plots (just to procure contraceptives intended to sell to third world countries). a bit funny but non-formatted. I think the problem lies there. GAGs are not very entertaining as they show their age on the nature of nature. Would a man dressed as a woman use another movie to drive the plot? Perhaps the worst criticism I could make CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon, I saw twelve hours less, and I have a problem trying to remember a very funny line. It's a serious comedy problem
