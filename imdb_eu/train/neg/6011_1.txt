I did not expect much from this movie, but oh my brother, what a stinker. <br /> <br /> I found this weird in Walmart (where else) $ 5 in a dashboard DVD box. It was as cheap as this album, I feel like I'm ripped off. The special effects were carried out on secondary education, and along with the camera's work as a result of the tripod and illumination and correctness, the "Christian School" was an excellent example. After seeing the production company in the newspaper, "prayer encounters" can be long and laborious - this is why people who have bankrolled have had a serious anti-biblical feeling about what homemade productions did. Think of their anxiety when investing $ 914.86 during smoke. <br /> <br /> Someone asked them that they are so bad for Christian films and maybe Xian filmmakers should look at GOOD and copy some. Things that do so good. Stories and believable characters, armor and histories are less fanaticism, oh, and a story that everyone calls them, not just true believers. For example, Stop the Sermon, Save it to Spark. Take the Omen or Prophesy series, for example. Excellent movies, compelling stories, great cinematography and intense music. There is no shaking arm style. It is not preaching. <br /> <br /> If this movie is laughing, it would be much better.
