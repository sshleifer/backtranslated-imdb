The summary of my cable television guide is much more interesting. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is far from the worst horror movie I've ever seen, the title of "Urban Legends: Final Cut". I could say that it would be very bad starting from the start, but I was bored. I did not care less. This film has an abusive performance, especially in the drowsy dream, in an unbelievable twist like, and the most beautiful music I've ever heard, and I live in Britney Spears. Nsync waves of air dominate. The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is not fun. A movie would be dull and boring, so it would NOT be scary, that is, gradually, weird things would come here, even here, but not. He is a fun friend who paints his head, but that's why he's annoyed. (spoiler) And please tell me, who mad in this world is mad at madness and self-sufficient to visit a creepy prison in the middle of the night? No one! If you want to make a horror movie, it will be at least compelling. This is just that.
