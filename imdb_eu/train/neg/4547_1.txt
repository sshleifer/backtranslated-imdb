The movie was !!! The worst movie I've ever seen in recent years. One of these films will be able to tell people in the next three years that the movie may be the worst. Thank you for answering the question "What have you seen the worst movie?" Answer: Celestine Prophecy. Confuse me ... I read the book, enjoyed the message and I was excited to see the movie, but then treated as the viewers treated. There is no story and the story there is full of magic and casuality. It's a bad idea to write nine prophecies and they can not only be in a fun story to follow. They did not spend time in the development of the characters, and it was easy for him not to care if a character had killed him. It was very shameful to have a few people who have been around for a very boring movie. The book is boring, but I enjoyed the parallelism that could be seen in everyday life when you read the book. The movie does not offer the same option and I would recommend the word of the book if you do not want to be close to your heart. DO NOT SEE ON THIS FILM. Believe it.
