It's a great story and it's just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We're still working). However, it's true, it's still a movie and this is a movie. I know that getting independent filmmakers is hard to get but wow. Even though it's the hottest Ossie Davis is. However, he could not make a real recognition of the actor (including what he considered to be a young man). The script provided was a great topic, but even then you have to get decent actors! I would not recommend this to anyone, so much is done in all categories. Read some books about the real story of the US Mason, because they give them a respect for their worth.
