The first role of Barbara Shelley (who worked for Britain for the first time in Britain) was celebrated at the age of 24, and it's definitely worth mentioning that she made her debut "Cat Girl" in 1957. Even though Blondes and brunettes get the most attention (I'm always comfortable with Yutte Stensgaard), the beautiful actress Auburn has always revealed intelligence and weakness (in the 1960's, "Damned of Village"). His screen time was much smaller than his character's husband George Sanders. "Cat People" is the only reason to see this curious update, and it's a great deal of great benefit (it's hard to find its beauty even if it's better to show it.) Its appearance is apparently naked and it sleeps its bizarre nude when it wakes up (8 Another year later he appeared in 1965 "Rasputin-Mad Mad"). The movie is stunning for a stunning strapless (I did not see what that outfit was, but surely I'd like it.) All in all, the proof that Barbara Shelley, the actress would most defeat role It is a poorly written increase in evidence, it is a constant overview of its material and film, a true test of star power, soon to be found at Hammer Studios in Bray, in the 1960s.
