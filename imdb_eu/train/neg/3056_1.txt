Before I saw this, I've seen bad Christmas movies. But when I saw this, "Jingle All the Way" looked better than "The Godfather". "Santa Claus" is a fun movie about Santa, helping some children, but almost feels dull. Santa is a young ho-ho, it's an evil laugh and a devotion that I am sure I'm going to turn off many kids off Christmas. The plague of this massacre is very rare, which coincides with all the performances and interviews. He lives in Santa Pola on the North Pole where children around the world prepare Christmas. Santa, however, has an enemy called Pitch or Satan. Pitch Santa wants to ruin the three boys by twisting them and turning them off, moving the fireplace and making the door warm. When Pitch causes a dog to attack St. Santa, Santa's assistant Pedro and Merlin's servant will get Santa to collect that component. <br /> <br /> It's so strange that it's totally bad about that movie. He danced a lot of Satan and seems much happier than Santa. Santa is talking about giving gifts to all the young Santa, but it only seems to give them 5 kids in Mexico. The reindeer throws toys and when the snow laughed, I'm surprised I do not bring tears to the eyes of the children ... it's terrifying. Everything is horrible. The first 10 minutes are just played by Santa's body while the children sing. Probably one of the most curious scenes is shooting a Santa Santa Pitch ass with a mini-barrel, and laughs at Pitch while dancing around. I think parents are better off telling their babies about who they come from. It's really positive if you'd like to laugh hysterically if you appreciate bad movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 85 minutes.
