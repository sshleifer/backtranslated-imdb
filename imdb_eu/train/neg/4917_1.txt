**** SPOILER NOTE **** <br /> <br /> It is undoubtedly one of the funniest comics created on the screen. It is absolutely impossible to do all this. An important novel would be needed to list the comedy routines in it. In the days of its program celebrations, Carol Burnett and the company, when they often started making movies, were hard on them to imagine. Carol played by Jenny and suddenly a mild cough became ill and immediately there was malicious music, and they all looked at where he was coming from. Harvey Korman Oliver played the locks and almost liked Ryan O'Neal. This bit is more fun than the real movie. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the scene of death. Jenny looks really dying ... she makes her make-up artist a little bit of color. And of course, we all know how many hospital-sponsored patients tend to get into bedtime. Ryan O'Neal, sitting on the bench that looks at the future of the movie business, is an instant classic. It was disturbing. He had never recovered.
