This movie does not make any sense, the holes that are sufficient enough to penetrate NYPD vehicles. The characters do not act in any way. I will put my comments on the chatset, but I will save your time and money, stupid. I can not stand Hollywood spending millions of dollars on flash bang equipment, and uses fancy edition and cool music, and it does not even hang using a hanging hook at the base level. But it is nice to see that Denzel W. is home to 3 men, Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg, and Von Trapp. Even a sweet little boy is also a video game.
