Everything I've said about people is about this, but I must add that this soundtrack is probably my whole life! There are voices at the moment you're listening to the cast of the actors! And the voice is like a broad version of Danzig: "The darkness of the forest! The darkness of the dark and dark forest!" or something else without interruption. The singer has a tremendous vibe and has recorded songs and microphones with some sections of the synthesized string and false drums. It's horrible !! <br /> <br /> Yes, the male carriers are awesome. They are also women. This is a case of stereotyped gender! Everything he says is that he is a male or a female, who plays a maximum of stereotypes. I'm sick. Soooo boring !!! <br /> <br /> The kids were so dark in their lines, you can not understand them. And why do children with ghostly children always have small hair arches, a pretty blue dress and long hair? And the ghost boys always cut their cleansers clean and shiny? It's not scary - STUPID. <br /> <br /> The face of a father is free and free and it is gentle to be a man who lives in a cave. Beard and beard You should not cut it completely with the knife, or did you go to the village and go to the salon? <br /> <br /> Stupid movie.
