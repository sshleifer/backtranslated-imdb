Why did I get this movie? Honestly, Jim Carrey was there and the movie ridiculed in the past laughed me, so again do you guess what I expect again? In addition, the premise, the fun trailer, Jennifer Aniston encouraged me to be his co-protagonist involvement, and the hit hit Stateside. <br /> <br /> However, I was like my "line summary". disappointed For several reasons: <br /> <br /> Reason 1: It was not fun. In a two and a half hour movie, I laughed about 5-10 minutes ... all together, the rest of the time was sitting "I would really have to get ice cream." I admit it might be wrong to judge Jim Carrey in his previous films, but what he really expects to be when he makes the Gem, such as "The Truman Show," "Liar Liar," "Me, Myself and Irene", "Dumb and". Dumber ',' The Mask 'and' Ace Ventura ', then produces Bruce Nolan's lyrics for a half of this movie? <br /> <br /> Reason 2: The role of Jennifer Aniston was criminally inscribed. Hello! He has been in the public eye for ten years, and says in this movie about four lines. Wrong <br /> <br /> Reason 3: a single word - Klixe <br /> <br /> Reason 4: The spread of specific American references, Jimmy Hoffa, is the "shooting weeks" of Walter Cronkite. particularly appealing to the film. "A teenager says to drugs and to an education - that's a miracle! Do you want to see the miracle soon? Be a miracle!" According to God, Bruce says he seems to have suffered a bad feeling in the United States, but he can endure more rigorous resistance to rigidity in markets. Besides, I go to school, and this statement tells me and all my friends wonders ... or we may mean we have brains. <br /> <br /> Carrey in this movie is a fun moment. Remind yourself and prevent Bruce Almighty from completely failing, but it is advisable to start your hopes downward.
