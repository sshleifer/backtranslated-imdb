What a wonderful movie! Worst! This movie is entertaining as slug dead. There is no talents, what is always an actress, stupid. Who wrote the script? Was it a screenplay for this film movie, or did the director decide to make the movie recording mistakenly and then move forward? A movie or comedy for children or what? My younger friends are on level 6 and he and his classmates did an amateur movie for this school project that passed this geeky movie. This is the worst film of my life. There's no excuse for this book!
