I paid for a DVD for this DVD and I felt it was ripped off, but then I thought and I should be grateful. I found a holy grail, the true stone of evil filmmaking. Do you think the initial stages of an empty stadium should focus successfully on the wrong Evelen camera address with the monologue, and wait until the initial credits appear in the reducer. Scripts are blended together with press clippings and ESL textbooks. But ... I can not believe it was George Hamilton. It seems that there is no connection whatsoever, what I think is that the only inner monologue that can be perceived as "I believe I am curious, I think I am nice." This is an epiphany! Now I know how bad I can.
