For beginners, I'd like to say I'm a fan of the American Pie series. Even though 'naked mile' and both of them are the worst, it's the whole series. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the American Pie film was the best part of the film, which is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> However, there are tons of bad things about this movie. First of all, the story is very old as the "arc" structure. First of all, the entry of the characters, then the beta announcement of the house, and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each one has a 25 minute duration. In addition to the plot's general rumors, there is little development of character, which makes two things in front of a bad plot. <br /> <br /> I also like stereotypes in this movie. That is, show jocks are very cool, just as they think of sex as boys, and explicitly show that geeks are as below. In addition, female objects only show themselves as sexual and only when men want to treat them as a sexual object. <br /> <br /> In addition, the play was inadequate. Maybe Steve Talley with the exception. <br /> <br /> So finally, the movie is terrifying, from a critical point of view. If it's seen from the audience viewpoint, it's better, but this movie is 18+ in most countries, so it should not be seen by minors.
