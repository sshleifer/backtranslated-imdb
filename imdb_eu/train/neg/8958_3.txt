I did not like the first movie "Cube". It was a good idea, but the annoying characters and characters never liked me. He did not feel seated, but when I heard that I was making the third movie that would play as a previous movie of the original. I was passionate about thinking they could solve some of the original problems and think about a memorable cast character. I really thought it wrong. <br /> <br /> "Cube Zero" begins with the two characters that are in charge of keeping the traps trapped by the cube in the maze. The filmmakers make sense of mystery by establishing the daily routine of two men. There are several questions that arise from the reason for sending people, as well as the true nature of those who manage the entire operation. Everyone is completely up to the viewer. The play is a little bit weak, but the first part of the film was very well. <br /> <br /> If the story continues, the "observer" goes hand in hand with serious doubts that begin to develop. And later decides to help the trapped people. Here is everything to get rid of the dull cheese that begins quickly. <br /> <br /> The people running the Cube program will send it to the character "Jax". Along with the two bases, the main reason that explains why this movie is based on failure. He looks like "Jax" and speaks like a third-party live criminal of James Bond, who has never seen a glass of "eternal". The atmosphere that creates a rather pleasant mid-rhythm fails. Moreover, it begins to feel more than a comedy rather than a serious movie. With curious lines, maybe the scriptwriter was bored and did not like it. The same actor reduces another drop when the group "beholder" finds himself in the cube. Interaction is very hard to see while continuing everything else. <br /> <br /> If they are not affected again by weak characters, the "Cube Zero" dialogue and good day's session is a loss of time. horror movie
