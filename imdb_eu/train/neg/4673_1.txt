I love books by Henry James and Washington Square is no exception. I was very pleased to get a new movie based on the book of that title. Jennifer Jason Lee is a great actor and Ben Chaplin is enough to play the main roles. Albert Finney is wrong and does not play that role correctly. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith ... or, rather, her stupid and stupid role. The real problem and the latest version is the script, the music and the good management. <br /> <br /> I slept in the theater, this long film debuted and very boring. There are more than just conversations with Pinter Play. I felt the books Catherine Sloper and his deep care of life. The movie was the opposite. I also do not like her sexual aunt with Morris. Eeeeeeeek YUK <br /> <br /> Look at it if you can not sleep, snoozer is defined. Do not see if you are depressed. You need Zoloft after. <br /> <br /> Surely, the extraordinary "The Heiress" Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift have been in the title role. Father played the actress as his cold and strict father ... his wife was dead, and Catherine hated him. The movie was not faithful to the book, but this is not it. <br /> <br /> This movie was a box office flop. Why do not I question it?
