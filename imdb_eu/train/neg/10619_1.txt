... but a bad movie. According to the Maltese, Christopher Lee tried to make a horror movie. Well, very serious ... WARNING! Plots are senseless and slow (something about the elderly that live in the bodies of children for immortality) ... movie talk debate talk talk debate talk debate discusses the same things. I was jumping several times! Film sooooo dull! This led to Peter Cushing and Lee's only exceptions, but it was probably the work of two lovers (horror films were raped too ... well, this does not violent). Avoid at all costs ... Unless insomnia ... it will sleep!
