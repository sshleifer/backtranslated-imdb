The movie is a collection of any type of outdoors. It does not pay any attention, purpose, no message. Symbolism is promoted to the top and stereotypes are numerous and shameful. This movie can not be used to face the temptation to do no drama. Each small word exchange immediately becomes a regular conversation of an interpreter-class rehearsal. Where there is no substance for this exchange, actors (although they are usually good) can not help compensating for excessive emotion, "increasing participation." Just put more than act. The management here is not a support. There is nothing you can save the story. In tears, it is faked and boring. Poor rock presentation of The Who, piercings and 90s costumes. Characters perform without role, detail and reason. The locations are arbitrary. This is Boogie Nights with The Good Fellas with Saturday Night Fever, the meaning and the art rip. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I'll give it that. <br /> <br /> Some movies have bugs. This movie is a bug in Lee. He exhausted, like all the rest. It's important. He has no interest in saying anymore. <br /> <br /> I do not want to see something like this again (I would now appoint it).
