Saints keep us, because this film will not help. <br /> <br /> Anyone with an access email must send Mel Gibson email and tell us we need a loyal production of Beowulf. There is something like that of an epic poem based on all modern Western literature. <br /> <br /> The latest versions of Beowulfen 2000 (from the age of two) ask ourselves two things. First of all, why is it so much an interesting story. Secondly, why all filmmakers take money out of the mountains in this crap. <br /> <br /> One of two reasons is that Lambert's version (Beowulf 2000) was worse and that Version 1 was required <<. <br /> <br /> Even worse, they can see some people and get the wrong idea of ​​the poem. How can Peter Jackson get an industry that has the right to obtain a movie conversion? I really want to say, Roman Forum is too much like Heorot's model. <br /> <br /> And please, horn helmets? Rescue This is being insulted. <br /> <br /> / hjm
