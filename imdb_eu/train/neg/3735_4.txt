He wrote his funny, funny book on the career of actress Patty Duke as his actor, as well as his love-depression episodes and suicide attempts. Here is a wealth of drawing stuff (and Patty plays in the final game), it might be thought that a cracked television director like Gilbert Cates would bring the movie together, but it's a clear shadow of the autobiography of "Call Me Anna". . For those who have not read the book, the noisy narrative (over time) is not absorbed, we never accept what is happening, and production seems to be the result of low budgets. The actors are confusing and the Duke's ending value is not allowed. The film's reality is so bold that Patty can not bring stability to the scenario. It seems that the producers considered (and were consciously responsible) enough to film that would direct Duke's latest diagnosis and mental freedom, but this process left no dramatic chance.
