I will start this by saying that it is impossible. I received a rainy day from Walmart, just like other reviewers in this site. I thought I'd buy my purchase. Was it wrong or what? Really, who accepted the project? They need to watch this movie repeatedly until the end of eternity. That is the only punishment they can think of, to get something wrong. Films I remind you of movies for class VHS classics. The performance is not much better. I think there is only one difference between two cool comics. Yay, who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz is inadequate, and the ship is a losing comedy. This is a great part of the plot I understand. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie I ever saw is the worst. I know about the DVD and I've seen a lot of colleagues. Each one comes back and laughs and says "Wow I do not think I would ever say that Adam Sandler will shut a movie within 15 minutes ..." <br /> <br /> My answer is always "Well now" <br /> <br />
