When I was born in 1970 I saw "Myra Breckinridge". I was 20 years old healthy in that period, I loved movies and I liked Raquel Gal√©s. In addition, I read that Gore Vidal was the basis of the novel and I thought it was very funny. I watched the movie on the local record and I was tempted to turn my car into the middle of a way that I might die of monoxide poisoning and I did not see the rest of the movie's disaster. . There was no "smart" or "fashionable"; All the actors were deaf and the director did not know what he was doing. Mae West's film was the worst in the history of the film. As a reviewer said, his role was not related to the movie or book. The character of the book is sexually assaulted by young sexes, who never had the western legend. O, no, the plot has changed with the HIM with a rhythm of sex, which is very credible that you look at every day of your ages every age of 77. I could keep it, but why? The movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> Bluto
