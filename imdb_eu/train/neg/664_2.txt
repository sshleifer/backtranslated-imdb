I do not like remakes, or stealing "modern" jargon, but the movie really threw me. The original Prom Night, although not a masterpiece on my modest estimation, still realized what it was ... fear. There are a few things to remember when doing a horror movie. Suspension is essential to keep the audience's interests. Sorry people, but the white backing was not that! Fears were cheap and incredible. (A good example of horror over today's clise will come out of the closet, soon after the unexpected appearance of the bad movie) This movie can not succeed, so I expected to comply with other horror movie conventions. Hero or heroine must be nice. This movie does not have one. It was the detective person who most identified me. His calm attitude, but the level of escape from a murderer was that of what the film had to do. Successful approach to events. (If you run from the odor of the psycho-habit, turn it around and start it. Do not run, look back in three seconds, as the killer progresses and overcome all the inanimate branches and objects.) If your friends disappear, you're not looking for them alone. And if you think someone wrong with the alleged abuse, do not investigate. These clings are tired and overloaded. In the horror genre in general and in this film especially.
