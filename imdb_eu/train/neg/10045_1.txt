The whole world said that Tashan would be a great movie of great pleasure, but that's not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake as actor Kareena Kapoor. The movie was all overwhelming. Tom-boy looks not really well. The story of the movie is also meaningless. Everyone has said that the Indian Taritino Quetin is Vijay, but it is not Quetin any way. Anil Kapoor talent filmed this stupid movie. Anil is a quality actress and is not this film. Akshay Kumar has also been a victim of this film, all Saif are. Style and Phoormola are not very good in this movie, I was disappointed
