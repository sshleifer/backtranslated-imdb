Extreme boy Cameras work, especially overwrought - documentary camera operators should not rotate around all the time. <br /> <br /> The script is really inane, and acting is even worse. In addition, the story is imbalanced and meandric - with some great holes in the logic. At one point, he wants to throw his heads in jail. Al-Quada may suspect his staff and, therefore, he will get a conversation with Osama. The story was completely incredible because of so many mistakes. The "filmmaker" / main role depicts a stupid, stupid fool. The only really interesting feature is that filmmakers made it according to the film. It is shameful to have missed out on something interesting. <br /> <br /> Who financed this garbage?
