I rented this I loved the first movie. However, they are called John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos has only one commitment to rent. Indeed, it is an executive producer, and it clearly has nothing to do with this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi Vampire Hunter is the least convincing all the time. It's not comically bad. <br /> <br /> In the end, the horrible and invisible movie is a horrible script and indefensibly bad and dramatic. It just loves little budgets. <br /> <br /> Avoid Buboniar plague.
