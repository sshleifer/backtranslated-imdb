This film was very bad at all. The script was very bad. I am very pleased that Gregory Peck later took on the adaptation of the B film of one of his most important generalists in history. The film was politically incorrect and it was not perceived by the rest of the Japanese people of the second war around the world. There was a scene I had thrown out there, and Macarthur showed that he was talking to soldiers in a bunker on the island as a good politician. wounded, one leg with a Philippine soldier. Soldiers die and die when they see him sitting directly on the general: "no father, no mother, no uncle," and Macarthure gives his little lecture that the Americans will never abandon it. The scene Macarthur ends with reinforced soldiers and greetings. I mean, if the US world is a scene that looks like a savior of the world in the world, it's more sensible, tell them why it's a cake. He showed the Filipinos that the torments were not capable of being honored and that they should rely solely on the trustworthiness of the great Americans. The contributions of the Far East members of the United States of the Far East have been significantly and incorrectly overwhelmed by US military volunteers, who joined the World War 2 in the United States, who had been killed by the Americans. The Japanese, Americans marched on a march in the Battle of Bataan and defended Corregidor Island as a guerrilla offensive after Macarthur left Australia when he left the famous speech "I will return." My late grandfather, the Philippine World War 2 veteran and USAFFE soldier, was one of the Japanese who fought for honor and love. I think this movie does not pay tribute to thousands of renowned Macarthurists who are renowned for the famous Return of Law.
