Now, I sparked this curiosity and I had to continue watching - the same way you see the car crash ... <br /> <br /> I know what is happening, but that should not stop. It plays my direction, acting and enormous conversation. Actually, I've come to be one of the poorest films I've seen - it looked like a section of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, and its poor ... <br /> <br /> - some criticisms (1) when the doctor was in a mood against the monster ( We never saw the monster attacked, so we assume his heart), the army assembles shells, rockets, bullets - the doctor's feet. However, the doctor does not touch any of the missiles and is still alive (2) an attack by 100 meters from the remote, and we will see that using a squeak is a series of more than 30 meters! (3) When the master monster tries to take the lead, the soldiers enter the room and enter the fire; Does the monster fall into the boy and the soldiers do not shoot the monster ??? come! (4) monsters resemble Power Rangers! (5) there is a scene where five "good" (priests, girls, doctors, reporters and children) have been shocked and reacts (in the mouth) one after another. - so natural! (6) is just a general escape; then, in general (7), he refuses to try to override electricity and did not listen to him (8) his performance is horrible (9) I mention a rubber monster suit? (10) a horrible, divine music, without stopping!
