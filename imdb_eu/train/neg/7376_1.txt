You have to hit Steven what you did with a new low. It's strange that Steven had his latest film as the director of the shadows since he directed the same director. Shadow was a good man, that is, diabolically bad was so bad, though it's not funny. Steven is hardly a movie and it feels like a cameo look and in the movie when it's doubled in half time anyway. As for the action, let's say that the wizard has had more action than the bins, there is hardly any action in the movie, and when it's finally arrived, it's boring to call scenes of action that are badly shot. Seagal hardly dwells anybody in his army's male films, that is to say, 1 to 2 beleaguered sieges and wounds. The plot is so confusing that it is not sometimes on the scenes. I had a better flight of anger than what good I lost in shame 5 pounds in this garbage 0 ten better luck next
