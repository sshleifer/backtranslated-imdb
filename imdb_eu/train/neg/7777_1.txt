It can be a pretty movie for children. My grandson once saw it. I was watching for a second while I was looking at her. <br /> <br /> The little finger is lost in ice legs and it is water that wants to get an ice piece. He says "Get the fool fool fool." <br /> <br /> I do not see such words as my three-year-old grandson. <br /> <br /> Therefore, its rating for children. Children must be friendly. That's what I expect. Warning Brothers and G had written that I did not have these words. Words do not even seem to fit in the movie, as will be added later. And the movie is dragged in many sections.
