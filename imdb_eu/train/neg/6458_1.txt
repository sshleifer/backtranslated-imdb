During every year of the Festival, I took a movie once, and that was the awesome "Stay Tuned". Fortunately, I went back to the movie card and went to see "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (a small improvement). This movie "Gone with the Wind" is compared to "Dick", a comedy that was so unknown, the second movie I almost never came out. Dick was such an imbalance, although it was impossible to laugh, he could only laugh. <br /> <br /> Surely, paying a penny for a movie called "Dick" suggests that jokes full of jokes will emerge and a drastic fall, and I still have a lot of hope (Daniel Hedaya, Bruce McCullough, Dave Foley, Kristen Dunst, etc.) and at least something that has been promised. fresh The films provided, as predicted, were the four planned jokes, comic times with jetlag, and the first five minutes after it was a premise. In short, Watergate was the scene of the "Forrest Gump", frozen and mangled with more than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> As soon as you understand both main characters. - The melancholic, dumb, breathing buds that are constantly breathing every year will participate in all major events. You start to get on the plot that advances in mind: 18 minutes and a half will be suspended by Nixon hanging; Deep Throat with Meetings with Woodward and Bernstein, CHECK; John Dean got heart-change and testimonial, CHECK. The process is as friendly as Watergate is more vulnerable and more dangerous. And despite the fun reconciliation of the resignation of Nixon's president, that is, it becomes a drawing of numbers, choose your adventure, comics full of comic books. It's very small and it's even less fun. <br /> <br /> Even though the strength of the film - the aforementioned performance - is amazingly fertile here. The disappointment of all is Harry Shearer G. Gordon Liddy. Liddy thick bundle trapped behind him, hanging on a beautiful screenplay, Shearer cheats a few lines, strives continuously behind his nose and eyebrows. Dave Foley, one of the Kids in the Hall comic book (two others, Bruce McCullough and Mark McKinney, will also appear - ah, nepotism blessings) are also being mislead. Haldeman's H.R. occasionally plays a much needed role in the funerary arena, but it's a lot more fun about this buzz than this sport, maybe it's the funniest movie of all the movies. And then Daniel Hedaya is Richard Nixon, I mean "Dick". (It's funny how funny it is.) He has managed to get a strong Nixon, avoiding risks (for example, excess makeup, nose rubber and fake teeth in Anthony Hopkins) but it is essential (agitation between human tenderness and severity). Someone seems to have forgotten. . . yes, the two stars of the movie, the young over-youth. I can not remember their names, maybe I suppressed their performances. There's nothing more fun; It could be more than the "hyperactive listening" and "hyperactive" bundle, instead of sporadic "casual" occasions. <br /> <br /> This film seemed to be an excuse. The 1970s soundtrack and parade to unite the great clothes of the time, seems to be a normal TV and television show in "Me Decade" today. But clothes and music come to be a true characterization and a plot, an offshoot of an extranet of extracts from the plot of the producers expected. <br /> <br /> The only use possible for this film has been on the road for years when its talented band appeared in David Letterman or Conan O'Brien. This immense overwhelming film will be dragged into a guest starving and dizzy. It's sad that all the bad guys, writers and producers will be far away from the look of the camera, that is, like another disaster. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
