This movie is horrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is an excellent movie. Goodgfellas is not one of the best crime movies. This movie should be closer to STING Part 2 or maybe Zone. Remember these gems! The only reason for this film was the capitalization of original worship guidelines. This movie was not in De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked so hard. There was no pleasant nature, and this is the person in charge of this challenge. I hope that all the RAZZIE that can win RISE TO POWER (RISE TO POWER) may well and maybe even invent some new categories for the record holder. When I saw the movie S @ * T FEST, I sat down and saw Carlitos's original path to get a bad taste. After seeing this, I would like to come back to Pachanga and get out of my misfortune.
