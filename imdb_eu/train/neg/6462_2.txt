This mischievous movie shows the best deposit for landfill that can not even be the best Gollywood. <br /> <br /> I described everything that was bad about this effort, but I would need more time. I'm wasting 91 minutes ... IT. <br /> <br /> <br /> Now if you look at it, after Brando's death, it shows us the tragic life of one of our main actors. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland? Why? <br /> <br /> I have to fill in more lines to accept it. I have to fill out the line to accept it. I must agree to fill more lines. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. I've been doing something interesting for some time now. Bye.
