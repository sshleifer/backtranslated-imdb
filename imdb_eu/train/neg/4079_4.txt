I bought a DVD for this movie for the girlfriend girl named Ghost, and I enjoy movies with paranormal. The video was completely shot, so it looks like a special PBS. The special effects are fake, but there are some terrifying moments in the movie that has leapt to our seat. Only a statue of the Virgin Mary scare. <br /> <br /> However, the performance is bad, the "plot" scene is long and very boring, and I will tell you what happened to me what happened. If you get a movie, rent it, buy it, make sure you pay less than $ 5.
