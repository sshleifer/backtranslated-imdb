This film has negative comments and I must agree that it is the worst film ever made. Actually, most of King's movie-based films are very bad, but this goes a bit beyond the horizons. There is no single horrible moment to think of stupidity as stupidity. King is a typical garbage: first, it's strikingly "amazing" as the "peeewee playhouse" is at least as entertaining. It's packed with hilarious moments, the character of Alice Krige. When Batman begins as a criminals of an old TV show, it's so absurd to be evil. All people who came to this cameo (including John Landis) are still lucky enough to continue their careers. But the most absurd part must be k-clothing, which in the end seems to be a rubber outfit bought by K-mart. The best part of the movie is the appearance of some of the true cats that actually work on the film.
