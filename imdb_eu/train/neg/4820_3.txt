As a teenager, I went into the great thing of Bigfoot - I've read books and have been watching. As a young adult, I have largely left the current great guy, but I do not care to see the extravagant films I make. This was a solid point - above all, two revival of the most famous Bigfoot gatherings - Ape Canyon incident in 1924 and Bauman incident in 1850 and Teddy Roosevelt. I know so much young reading that I know. According to the events given by the films, both events involved with sasquatch, but two events had more credible explanations, but the tastes were fine. At the beginning of the film he also paid tribute to Patterson video, giving him his authenticity again. The end of the film sasquatch encounter was very well done and it was a very sassy sensation, especially when it was reflected in the shadows or as a hairy man after frightened men. Unfortunately, the total of these four things could be completed around 20 minutes, with the whole film being a little over an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Fictional story (documentary style) Expedition to a remote northern British Columbia area to get the sasquatch home. Based on the observations of a computer focusing on this field and - one of the funniest scenes in the movie - a "loop eye viewer" also used to draw a picture of a sasquatch that had a computer like Patterson. In addition to those 20 minutes mentioned above, we are basically looking at this expedition trip. This means we will see boys in a long camping trip. I have made camping with friends. Tell me, I have never been worth a movie. There are beautiful wildlife shots included in the long stretches (although they are supposed to be used by footage or are captive animals like wild animals) and some spectacular landscapes, the landscape is not just the northern British. Columbia comes from the Oregon National Parks. <br /> <br /> I thank you for not giving us a real picture of sasquatch, so we did not have to deal with the bad makeup. in this. 3/10
