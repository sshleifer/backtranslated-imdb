OK ... I have only 3 words - cheesy, cheesy and CHEESY! The only purchase of this movie is Dean Cain. In addition, CHEESEBALL SUPREME! <br /> <br /> The movie offers a number of concepts: an underground lab creates a direct firearm dragon - basically gives us more meetings at "Jurassic Park". "Fire Reign" ... There are some great options, but they do not continue ... The special effects are decent - though you know the dragon CGI, it does not look horrible. CGI .... <br /> <br /> I would not blame Dean Cain (even if he was one of the producers), Phillip Roth's director and the writer would put a lot more guilt. His work is to make this film ... and, unfortunately, failed.
