When Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder found my two favorite actors, I crossed the roof! But I had a difficult fall when I saw this movie and I wrinkled it. Jeremy Irons (the actor who still admires) was a very bad theater. Glenn Close considered her sister, as her relatives, as her sister. I could not approach or sympathize with the character, and I'm not pretty, but sex scenes were not really necessary or could fit them. Wynona and Antonio's characters could be much more developed and their love could be much more enthusiastic. And what was Meryl's character and "mystical powers"? Why not get into it? This movie had a lot of dead ends and, finally, that the movie was really bad and the talent was wasting.
