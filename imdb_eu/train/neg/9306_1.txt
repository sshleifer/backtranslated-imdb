This movie is the worst excuse for cinema ever seen. To begin, I would like to say that the front of this movie is misleading, if you think you'll see a terrifying horror film with a monster clown, you're wrong. In fact, the assassin's face does not look like the front cover, it's just an image that Google has to find and thought it was a good idea. When he found out about the things he found out and thought it was a good thing, some of these movies are a scene in this movie looking for old friends in the woods, and suddenly it's a young screen. In a glittering sunlight ... I mean seriously WTF ??? How about the dark forest that goes by? I bought this movie a man from a market, when he expected it to be entertaining, it would be fun if it was not horrible? WRONG! The next day, I could rescue my work colleagues from the plague of S.I.C.K <br /> <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: Do not watch this movie !!!
