This is a horrible movie. The three stories are aligned with the hypnotist psychiatrist. All stories are bad. The first is about wild wolves and women, there are some things that are unwise, but hypnosis works for that. The second, bad Bill Paxton, as a roommate, should not be seen by anyone. The last one, unfortunately the best, is almost incomprehensible and is better than any other garbage.
