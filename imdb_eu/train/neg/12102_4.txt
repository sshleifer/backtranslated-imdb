Bill Maher's film is truly the only interpretation of religion. There are several fun moments and some interesting points, but do not enter into a generous debate about religion. This is the worst type of documentary I think. It's been organized and edited beforehand to give the director's opinion rather than taking your decision. <br /> <br /> EDITION - It's very chipped, pop-culture and media clips, to strengthen the point. The interviewer almost does not have a phrase before the editing is suspended. The only reasonable option to speak to themselves is what they say about what Bill Maher means. After being diverted by Maher, they edit it. <br /> <br /> INTERVIEWS - They intend to represent absolute extreme religions. Evangelical television, the latest Jewish stereotype, the TRUCK STOP chapel (seriously. TRUCK STOP CHAPEL). It has detected the worst of raising money, extreme heavyweight and no budget. When a good person gets a conversation, he has edited many of them. <br /> <br /> STEREOTYPATION - All religions are represented as stereotypes. Especially hard Muslims. During the Muslim segment, there is hardly any chance to talk to anyone before he or she is suspended or with suicide bombing. All Muslims are portraying extreme extremist tracks through editing, and the interviewed people do not post any corrects. <br /> <br /> Finish - Finally the message is generous and interesting. The idea is not fairly presented with many people of extreme religion. While Bill Maher explains himself, by the foreground, clashes of destruction are considered. It literally gives a message that religion is stupid and dangerous and destroys the world. Everyone who participates in the religion is stupid. <br /> <br /> With mistakes in the movie, it has good points and humor, although it is very unfair, is fun. But I know from abroad, Bill Maher's vision, that the view of religion is very favorable. Found nothing He tells you what you think. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10 - Good moments, but with a generous documentary style.
