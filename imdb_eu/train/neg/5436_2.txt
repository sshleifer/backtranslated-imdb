A friend gave me the movie. My friend is in a hospital; A group of doctors are trying to remove the DVD cover from the curve. <br /> <br /> I was excited by the prospects of another movie by Michael Chabon. After the great novels brought great entertainment and the adaptations of the previous script were very good, but the boy was wrong. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, people were asked to stay while they had to do it. I think castings like this. "Tell me, do you like the fish?" "Yes, I really like the fish." "You have been hired, have money." <br /> <br /> It's a script. I read Chabon, that is, this blind thought, I hope I see this piece of dong before, and it has nothing to do with his novel. I am not sure why I was annoyed, but perhaps it might be that listening to goat duck hunting for 90 years of drowsiness in the liver's liver dysfunction was enjoyable. secondary models get 2 degrees of massacre. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real line; "If you tell me something before you say no loud, this moment becomes one!" The only one Is it that? Is it really? Of course, there are no tables. Please pass Imodium. I will be full. <br /> <br /> The director ... well. I did not get anything Rawson Marshall Thurber might have said the grandmother's explosion or something. Continue comedy. There is no ad sticker to advertise. <br /> <br /> This movie is so huge, and it hit me so hard against the wall in my head, I went back to stone. I give two stars, I do not want to see a star movie.
