The original "Vanishing Point" was a great movie. Subtle, genuine and spontaneous motifs. Remake was awesome. Preachy, overtly evident; He wondered why he was a classic original. The cool charger was cool, but this could not be rescued. Why take it with the White Challenger? I do not think it was the best choice in the year 71. Some parts of the film were mistakenly ridiculous. Vigo was facing the abyss, after the "Dream Quest". His American home was next to him. Vigo was alone wearing white sheets. Sorry, it just made a stupid look - Viewed view, the fruits of its texture. At the end it was another scene: Bulldoser after the explosive blow - announced that the impact was 180 mph. Then, as the police said, it was not found that they found their remains, but people believed that the crowds were hiding and hiding. Then it shows how it flared 180 kilometers from the car! First, you can not open the car's door 180 mph. Secondly, the car would not travel directly in 100 meters. no one to drive. He would return immediately about 30 times. Thirdly, if you enter through a 180mph pavement, you would end up frustrating some pieces. No matter, we'll finally see her standing with her daughter. In the end, the movie that would offend anyone's minds.
