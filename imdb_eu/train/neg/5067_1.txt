It's very easy. Friends is a humorous humor that is humorous, it is a very basic humor. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is remembered that they were trying to get upset at last at age 10. they surely won the Seinfeld 9-season race. The problem is that Seinfeld has written 9 seasons, Friends (and I'm very generous here) with up to 5 or 6 good seasons and then 4 deep seasons. <br /> <br /> It turned out that the humor was recycled and the characteristics of the recycled character were not so good, so you can start, and then it was worse when you saw it 100 times. It's so difficult to understand why people who value it so great. It's really awesome.
