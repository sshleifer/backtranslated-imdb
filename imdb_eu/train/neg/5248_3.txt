"Die Sieger" is highly recommended for a short film of great German action in Germany. I saw Bart and I must admit that I am very disappointed. In Germany, the "best of the best hope" is an entertaining and challenging film action, then there is nothing left. <br /> <br /> "Die Sieger" is sexy, courageous and furious, but it's not something like that. Characters are wood and stereotypes and they always do something that acts against their nature (this is not too much). This makes it difficult for me to be almost impossible to follow or identify with. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I think the movie is very bad. There is no person who thinks of me. Maybe it's an official Superior SWAT unit, but about it. I do not believe those who look like special units or like those who like elite police. It's not the second one. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad at the end. But I think what is wrong. You do not know the bad guy, for example. And seeing "Simon very dark", Karl Simon (the guy) asks his opponent is already dead "why? ... what is it?" I asked the same question, knowing that Dominik Graf would not have answered. <br /> <br /> I really hope - no, Germany can do better, even with action movies.
