GENERAL PERFORMANCE: - Long waiting AAG screens in the end. Unfortunately, it was not possible to put a progressive view of the audience. The best thing to do to talk about the movie is the idea to recover the great SHOLAY. And he made a nice opportunity to change the entire background of Varma. If Ramghad repeats the same background, then people will say that there is nothing new. It supports different backgrounds, but the way it was presented is not worth it. At SIVA Telugu, from the beginning of his career, he used the same lighting and backgrounds. I do not know whether Varma thinks he or she does not or can not store any other lighting technique that does not store JODFATHER. DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH da. Why some limbs would be used for several Dutch angle and extreme plane shots !!!!!!! The kick division is lame. The characters could not make an emotion, the performances are not in their name, the storytelling is worse, the background is really huge. VARMA produced malicious people like Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das and Mallik Bhai, but this time he worked on the best characters of Hindi Cinema. There is no comparison between Gabbarrek and Baboba. More than one psycho-psychological protection, he still has a good brother (this is a movie). Amitabhz performance is not its mark. Its a pathetic look. It symbolizes black-and-white criminals with nose-stained black films. Those who worked at Babban did not succeed. Babban is not part of Gabbar. <br /> <br /> Narsimha: - The best thing about this character is not to let the listeners leave their hands. If done, ABCD would be a bachelor's degree. Good morning, it opened the secret early. But the retrospective is pathetic. Varma could not use the best actress brand like mohanlal. <br /> <br /> Durga: - The only character with improvement. This character has been improved with the correct modifications and has been used according to the story. <br /> <br /> Hero, Raj, Ghunguroo: - The body does not suffer from any objection or character. The complete failure of the film, the director could not work in the friendship between our hero. These characters have not been taken to this film. <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: - Its quality is disgusting and diminishes. AAG can be treated as a movie from the C series. Sholay is a fire of revenge, a problem of a people, a true friendship and a very appreciated and enjoyable fun for Dharmendra. AAG never had any emotions with its characters. The storyteller is very weak, so that people can not feel their personality. Do not compare to AAG with sholay, you will not like it yet. <br /> <br /> If you dare to watch this movie. RAMGOPAL VARMA KI You are alive in AAG
