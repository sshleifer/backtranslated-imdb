Is not it bad, what is paid for (Hooper makes it much worse)? so depressing to me. Such an imaginary concept, which is never really Hooper's economically geared sector and even less smoky (excuse pun) in writing never tapped in. He is very wicked and moving in a serious dead man, ridiculous and misguided, allowing him to easily telegraph the secret mysterious hidden / narrative conspiracy. That's why the track continues to be sluggish and Brad Dourif (cool to see it) seems to struggle with a low performance, despite the intensity of its fast-paced color. Although affordable, there is a good technical attitude. However, it does not seem that it does not go out of the way with its idea and the gypsum of gypsum plaster (works by some people) and great special effects on steam (flames, flames everywhere). Hooper shows elegant and frenetic images (finally, for the last time), and the camera's work is quickly maneuvered and a tremendous scoring is impressive. There are a lot of performances throughout the store with the appearances of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Similarly, Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis are small but fun cars. especially Landis. Nothing surprising, but quite enjoyable.
