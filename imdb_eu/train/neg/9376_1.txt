While I was watching this movie I was sick. I grew up with a puppy and every time it was a real pleasure. When my wife arrived to Sweden, she was looking for the ancients and she really laughed. But this American version must be renamed and will never be shown again. It's horrible from beginning to end. how can you get it bad? Well, someone responds to the translation, ha ha ha ... but they never approach Pippi. You may never see and never watch the movie again. Burn and save children. If you want to look Pippi, look at the original movie and laugh at it. We love PIPPI INGER NILSSON, sorry, Tami Erin, you will never be Pippi. Oh yes ... when reading "Spoilers", "shock" surprise and enjoy the movie steal the viewer. "I think this is a good director ... you're watching this movie under your own responsibility ... it's really a waste of time ...
