I just got to watch this DVD at home. We love the West, so my husband has rented it. He excused me internally. Armchairs, costumes, accents - everything came. It made me mad the part where the guy did not shoot the "gatherer" when he ate his bow and the arrow when he was taking the soul of the man. His only excuse "left two arrows". We saw it all over the road and, as someone else said ... the bad things sucked too much for the reason. I mean, that the boy was found to be caught by an evil stone and found the same day on the day he died, which is it? And why were there a whole month where everyone was killed on April 25, but collectors were catching the people still walking? If you want to make fun after some beers, this may be your movie. However, if you want real western, you will hate this movie.
