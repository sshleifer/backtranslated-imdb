The best shorts of Laurel and Hardy are unhappy with accidents and destructions, especially those caused by Stan, but with Ollie (!) Penalties - see "The Music Box" (1933) or some of the classic "Killed (1932)". <br /> <br /> Here, however, for some reason (because it was based on Stan's father's sketch), boys play right. 'comedy' based on jokes and supposedly fun situations. It is not coming out The comedy of the Sixties is boring, with people of Stan and Ollie who only show their trademark (Ollie's finger wiggling, stanley stares, etc.) or comic ability. <br /> <br /> The movies start from the police. I've never seen and I do not know why it's hard to accept believer or acceptance of fear, so that the Colonel Buckshot is hidden in the house. With the "humor" premise, Ollie passes herself as Colonel and Stan passes herself as both hose and maid as they are never very engaging. They are not considered "Stan and Ollie" in this movie. Their parts could be one of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be poor. <br /> <br /> Stan tells what he can do and do everything fun, but he does not make it. Any of them here. He says too much about "moving" the territory, but he's not risking it any more than stupid. The tertiary comedy chestnuts are endless, for example Lord Plumtree's name "Pray me a taxi! You're a taxi!" The joke, the police are losing their clothes and they are watching Johnny, and unlike the end of Stan and Ollie, the two parts make the horse look like a painful costume twice as obvious as James Finlayson is still taking full silence, and Keystone Kop jumping kukak <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie do much better in the comedies 'Sons of the Desert' (1933). love about them - be themselves. In fact, it seems to be one of the best years of 1932-34. <br /> <br /> This film does not play its part, why worry about it? I need to give it 3
