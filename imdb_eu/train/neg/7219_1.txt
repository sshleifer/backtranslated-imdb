It is still difficult to understand how this film could be as bad as Hollywood. The play and story is pathetic and it is a great director. I do not know the logic behind that litter, because the director did not have to do it well. For ten minutes, I realized that my thirty rupees were lost. He gave me an unpleasant one, that I would lose more time in my life in this dizziness. I bet made the movie that was in less than a day. I do not know what category it falls into. Please avoid this movie for all costs, just do anything, even knock your head against the walls, but do not go in this movie.
