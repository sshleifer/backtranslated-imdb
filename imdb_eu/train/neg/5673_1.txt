I mention Oedpius Rex because this film has been tragic because ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm not a Uwe Boll anymore like a non-humorous IMDb movie! <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll films like postcard and tunnel rats are wonderful and therefore entertaining. Honestly, this film was horrible. I hated so much, I would not give him a star rating. The story is pure! He builds the four-fifth passage on the plot and then has scenes of immensely murderous grizzly. In the end, it will end the "villan wins" and this is totally acceptable, but it may well be better than this! <br /> <br /> I'm not against Uwe Bollen (as I said before), nor against film violets! I love real violent movies! Saw Movies, Hostel Movies, Tokyo Gore Police, New York Ripper, 28 Movies, Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, Last House on the Left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, Tarantino, I Love Sam Peckinpah. Holocaust Holocaust! But that! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> This was just a cruel, sane and pervert! And I just looked at the movies listed! I liked the Holocaust of the Canary Islands, and this is not a bad thing! Uwe, do not go all dark again! You are fun when you are full of heart, like Ed Wood. The experience was awesome! I've felt terribly to see all this! <br /> <br /> DO NOT KNOW! Avoid every cost !!!!!
