The movie is very bony. It's a low-budget movie (I hope!), That is, a bit of pardon, but it lacks good results and plots. Phillips is very credible when his son is destroying the son of a wealthy family (although his family is ... well ... a bit too white ...), but the rest is cast arrested by straws. Every potential momentum prevents excessive melodrama and there are too many sub-plots (ie, lack of plot, filling in ...) I would not recommend the movie. It's not a hard-core Phillips fan, or it absolutely * does not do anything. 4/10.
