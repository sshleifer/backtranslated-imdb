I can not tell the story of children's television shows for life, about all the power rangers. <br /> <br /> I never understood why the suspicion that they did not like children is the first thing that seems like this. stupid and not worth it. <br /> <br /> The costume looks quite serious, as is the multi-colored spandex used by people to go to the gym. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this? show, however, that children are struggling to solve their problems? What is horrible hair cuts, and in this show of clothes anyway? This show is still playing on cable television to win money while children are fighting against each other with a particular problem. <br /> <br /> Better entertainment for today's kids, fortunately not as sweet as the kids of the 90s saw this show. <br /> <br /> Oh, what about erotic erotic tension between humans?
