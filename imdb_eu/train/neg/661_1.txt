Okay So I got back. Before I begin my review, I'll tell you one thing: I liked the movie. I know I was a bit negative in the past, but I was surprised and I'd really like the movie. I did not. <br /> <br /> It's not just what can be imagined in every horror topic. And it's not every little thing that makes you jump in the jump (did you get into a baseball bat on the floor? Do you go on joking?). It was not terrifying. I was surprised by the fact that there was more blood than I thought ... what I did not say much. <br /> <br /> The movie begins when Donna finishes with Lisa's mother. House. He's coming ... he's up. Camera father died on the couch. Spooky He goes up to the scene of the mentioned baseball rider. He finds his brother in bed, seemingly dead (how would he tell him? He had no blood space). The killer comes in, Donna hiding under the bed, her mother died. He is running away asking for help. Behind the murderer: "For our sake". Closed in therapy session. This confused a lot of people. They all wondered whether or not the family really killed or not, and how the nightmares came about. Fulfillment dialog is created. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty good escape. In the salon there are few scenes in the hotel. Of course, the killer is already there (for some reason, he escaped 3 days ago but the police / family was not informed until there was any). More fixtures are created. <br /> <br /> I do not keep up with what happens in the film, I do not want to break too much. If you want to know who's dying, Horror_Fan has already made a message. About Death Matters: They were not exciting. In the theater people really laughed aloud (I never had an experience in a horror movie, even When A Stranger Calls). Especially one: what gives the horny face I ever saw. The only death without blood was Lisa, and that was very little. His throat is crumpled, and the curtain breaks the blood (although it is called, it's almost black). When we see only one body, Claire's only other blood. Apparently, Fenton repeatedly squeezed it after the flood. Yes, well The movie was a topic I've ever seen. Let's see ... mandatory shutter-curtain-BOOM! Scene Check In both, really (it could be said that he was struggling). The necessary killer Check Also, the lamp scene is in the field, but you have seen all this. Oh, to scare birds? It's okay! (Yes, one of them was introduced). And, of course, all the scenes-but-we still escaped safety. Do i continue I could not. <br /> <br /> Whoever said that the characters were not stupid, you're joking? "O, even if it is a massive alarm, it's literally called THE USE OF BUILDING, and I'm missing 3 of my friends, I'm at the top to get my translation." These characters were some of the most stupid and worst people ever. Lisa's only character - Lisa - made one of the most stupid movements in the movie. "Oh, I just noticed that the psycho teacher is here! I must leave my strong boy to warn myself to run away! Or, shoot, the elevator is slowing down? Hit the stairs and escape the construction site!" Ugh. At the end of the film, everyone deserved to die. The only death that sentenced anyone to die was the beloved Donna (I can not remember his name?), And at that time, the viewer was completely obliterated by this awesome movie. <br /> <br /> There were some positive results; In most cases, the performance was correct and shot well. However, that is it. <br /> <br /> I'd give it 1/5 and that's generous. Only laughter (and believe, people had little), and Brittany Snow. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the reaction was bad. Very bad. People turned around after the movie was over negative. Expect bad legs for this.
