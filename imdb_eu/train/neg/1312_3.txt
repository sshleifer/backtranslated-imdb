Tom is listening to some of the old radio broadcasts, since the 50s are watching on TV today. However, there was no television that people who made this drawing had entertainment - a comedy from music and horror stories - on the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom is literally shaking a listening story about his "phantom" of his boots. He literally makes the narrator doing everything he's saying, for example, "At the end of the hair, frozen frost runs on his back, he tosses his heart down". - Cat theater. <br /> <br /> Then we will see what we will draw from 194 onwards, except for Tom's sadistic pleasure. If cats cause trouble, it's one thing, but when it comes to doing business and Jerry is physically (and in this case mentally) abuse, it's hard to promote a "guy". br /> T & M first-rate efforts were more than a minute later. Sometimes a minute is different. He did here, that is, he really crawled a bit. It could have been cut in just five minutes because the sketches were long. That's what Tom and Jerry really do. Usually, they are much faster.
