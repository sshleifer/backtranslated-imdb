The movie was amazing. She is very surprised. I often meet a group of friends and I will go to the movie store waiting for comic value to find commercials. My friend proposed this one, but when we saw people they left. I really wanted to finish, so I could not say it. It's bad Strong spells of luck, lame joking. The main characters are the annoying dinosaurs klutz and Whoopi Goldberg. I'd rather have seen Costener's Mailers than I have seen in a part of this movie more than once. I think they try to deal with dinosaurs discrimination issues, but the part of the film that really stands out is that the dinosaurs constantly fall into their tail and then they are talking about it. It hurts. Look if you are a masochist, otherwise, leave this alone.
