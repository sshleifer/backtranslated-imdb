Yes, I know that I'm just a few people who want to steal this movie into oblivion. Tell us why I feel like that. Actually, it seemed like zombie movies or similar, I might like it. Right now, I'm completely in my mouth. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ... Even though I am not sure what we have to ruin * Let's start with the first serious mistake. I did not know the film called "Darkness - VAMPIRE Version" and if they did not see some sequences that individuals absorb blood, I would not see Vampires. Do I mean, FANGLESS? Leave me a little! <br /> <br /> The second bad point: what is Metal? It seems that all young people, but especially those called "vampires", are of different types of metals, especially judges! I have not written incorrectly, for almost 15 years I've been entering into extreme music, but no one frightens me with Iron Maiden (a band of all!) T-shirts featuring some hilarious teens. T-shirts around, vamping out! "Pathetic" is the only one that can be used here. <br /> <br /> The third weakness: the actors. Wait for a minute. WHAT IS THE ACTORS?! You mean the director's wooden friends! The words here would be a waste. <br /> <br /> Yes, well, the movie is very gory, but what's the difference? It would be a great deal of trouble and the director "briliant" did not create an ARTIFICIAL VAMPIRE in this movie. I wanted to see vampires, but I'd like to see some stupid children. The filmmakers would have to make a movie that says "B-grade unfocused plot, but a lot of gore"! And it makes me sick.
