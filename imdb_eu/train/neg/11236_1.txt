As a former resident of Kalamazoo, I wanted to see the movie that was popular with the people. But what a despair! Even though the production and performance are not the same, the script is horrible, the argument is not realistic, and the issue is disturbing. <br /> <br /> The main message of this film is that the woman is not a husband or a husband. kids. I can not believe how feminine is a revelatory. Does the writer live under a rock? <br /> <br /> Although I liked seeing my beloved city on the big screen, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's horrible This is the shame of the city designated.
