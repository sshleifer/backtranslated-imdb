This movie completes the usual rate of Bollywood. The performances were horrible. Boman Iran, who always shines brightly, is altogether OTT as a criminal. The soundtrack is also not memorable. Though hard, women's heads are not "sexy". Vivek Oberoi is a much better project, and Fardeen Khan seems to be stuck in similar rates at the same time. But this monster is under the limitations of its ability as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are great in the template role models. It's a great time to hang Indra Kumar's hat. He expects no other look like that. The future of the Hindi film is now better. In sum, celluloid waste remains far away.
