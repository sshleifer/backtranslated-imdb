Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely brilliant in this movie, but the story is, unfortunately, half-baked, and David Schwimmer is like a kind of energy-like cold. When he closes the mouth and turns a moment or two into a serious one, he may be in a hurry. Who thought the 25-year-old would be entertaining?
