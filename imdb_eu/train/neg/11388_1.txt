This story is about a triangular triangular triangle. African prostitute woman, a French prostitute transsexual (Stephanie) and a waiter who does not speak French, and never seems shaved. <br /> <br /> As a movie, it is sad, dull and disappointing. winter days or evil inner lights, where everyone drank in a strange blue curiosity. Yes, I know, because white balance is out. Everyone is pale and rugged and looks like dirty, dirty and dirty. The bodies are bones and shoot at the giants, they seem very ugly and unpleasant. Moles, greasy hair. Yuk. Bad news movies spend a lot of time on nude or sex. <br /> <br /> And the story? Stephanie's mother is dying. All three characters have returned to the home of Stephanie's home, with some flashbacks that have scattered landscapes and face-to-face depictions, we see little Stephanie's childhood as a boy named Pierre. Mother dies Well ... and there it is, really. The development of the characters is maintained at least, as well as the imbalance of the story. <br /> <br /> I suppose that the story is not linear (there would be a lot of non-sequential ones), but, actually, after paying my seven euros, I do not want to build this film: that's the director. it takes money. It is expected that you enter the story telling process and dirty hands, so to speak. <br /> <br /> This movie, above all, is a desire to be a desire to be. epater les bourgeois (that is, shake the currents). I have seen how it was for the Berlin Film Festival, and I see why it has not been achieved anywhere.
