The worst film by David Lean. Although "what we serve" was not as bad as this. Usually, a film with a good reputation like this has, at least, some quality changes, which one understands why one can be considered a classic. But after seeing this, I could not explain why he liked so much in 1945! I performed the play, the hard lips of British manners, the story, the script (sometimes quite extravagant, but completely unknown) and the soundtrack. Elvira wants to be an attractive and attractive character, but, in fact, she was ugly and she had a strange and weird voice. It's just another movie that I do not want to trust in a celebrity movie. Another "British classic" was overcome.
