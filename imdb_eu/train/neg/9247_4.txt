"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" Charlie was one of the 1915s Essanay films. These groups of films are seen as opposed to the 1914 counterparts, it seems to be below the average. The double-bomber of the competition, and the fortunate endearing dreaming that Charlie dream of waking his dreams, stuck to one head as an indentation. The two heads are moments of Chaplin. Both are ironically beginning and ending. He will collaborate with the center and get caught a bank robbery to win the girl. Mop is probably the greatest physical attachment of this movie, and uses Charlie with the comedy's expert effects or his intention of the character. Mop seems to be doing what Charlie wants to be an alter ego, but he would not have both his hands. Things are interesting but better.
