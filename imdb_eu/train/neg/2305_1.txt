I felt like I missed some important scenes from the start. There were constant flaws and plots that were beginning to stop. I was very disappointed, I also love Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover, who is also trusted and respected by Danny Glovers, choosing the role of "Grand Canyon". I could not finish the movie, after eternity seemed like it, but it was probably roughly one hour; we had to shut down. There was no comedy, there was nothing in the characters that did not empathize or dressed in them, there was no emotion reminding us of that movie and its past clips were poorly edited, confusing and unnecessary. It could be a great idea for a movie, even as a drama and not a comedy (although it might be a better comedy in that situation, I would like the people to scare me and I'll play it as a complete foolishness). he laughed at me) the video store became my $ 1 credit waste.
