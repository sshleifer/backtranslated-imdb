The origin of the 1965 Japanese "Gamera" film was a bit darker and shorter than Goji (Godzilla) for the 1960's sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a flying turtle that literally consumes energy, not as great as some of Godzilla's versions, but most often it's similar. <br /> <br /> This version of the original movie has been edited and restored by the famous Sandy Frank. And as Godzilla's ("Godzilla King of the Monsters") bertsolarized version, it gets more than a spelling "Gammera the Invincible". The American scene is not nearly playful and annoying as it has been added to Goio, but they do not add much more to the story, as they have little control. <br /> <br /> The film is hopeful, the scene of the development of the character is low and there are many characters to create the voltage of the main voltage. After appearing in Gamera, the film begins to drop kaiju film pretty soon. <br /> <br /> The operation is sufficient, although American additives are good. Management time and genre are very good, and special effects are not bad by time (miniatures). Some sets and backgrounds are really good. <br /> <br /> The main problem here is, of course, that there is hardly anything that is original about that movie. Gamera, however, develops a lot of unique personality in her future films - most of which is worth seeing if you are a fan of kaii.
