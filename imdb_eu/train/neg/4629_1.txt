Clearly, in the 1950s, stripper Misty Ayers "actors" showcase talent. Nice to play <br /> <br /> Sally Down (Ayers) is a short story about sweet and innocent, and is forced into the drug slaughter and slavery (prostitution). Then he meets Tommy Cole in a hurry. Do you want to help escape, but? You really do not mind. <br /> <br /> There is no real skin here - Ayers SLOWLY takes off his underwear (twice). The rest is just a bad performance, and made by "comedies" (we never thought about prostitution really fun but what I know about?) And the post-duplicate conversation is horrible. I confess that at last I was not given a tour, but that was not enough for that. Ayers' attempts to act are also hysterical! A real bomb. Avoid.
