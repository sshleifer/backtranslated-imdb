It seems to be one of those films that we think, but I did not. Apparently, trying to be "art" was very difficult. All flash, without content. It has some beautiful scenery, and any of them is nice to see, but it's all connected and it's a tough task to sit through. I rented this because of the brilliant reviews made in the video game and I am a great fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. Slowly I found it a bit and sometimes boring.
