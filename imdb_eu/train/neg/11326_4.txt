In 1993, the fantasy movie by Albert Pyun is one of the mailpolicylics, and it's bad. Apparently, all his energy was called "Nemesis", as the action was an entertaining film that was much more expensive. "Knights" are bad and cursing, often Cuban science fictional like a video game (new opponents will appear all the time and destroy them as soon as possible). The only thing that comes out of the trash to save this movie is Kathy Long; It's not an attractive woman, but it's definitely the most effective fighting machine. With Kris Kristofferson, considering his age (58), I hope his double progress is well paid. (* 1/2)
