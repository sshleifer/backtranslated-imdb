Words can not describe this movie. I thought it was a bad song, but at least there were beautiful shots and occasionally I touched my chin to stop here and there. That's just horny! A great script, a bad direction, a horrible thing, and what do you know? I do not even know how to recommend a single thing, except for a long time. If you want 100 minutes of recreation, book some dentist and root canal jobs - much better and much better money (assuming what you need). Incidentally, I have to write 10 lines of text to complete the review - DO NOT USE THE SUGGESTION FOR USE. It's wonderful!
