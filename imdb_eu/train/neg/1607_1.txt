This "documentary" is a talent test used for specific purposes. The Venezuelan government finances legitimacy in Venezuela to look for the truth of what happened in April 2002, April 2002, although we do not know for sure Venezuela. /> <br /> There are false ways, and such directors are false and ignorant of knowledge. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan political process is very complicated to easily understand and take advantage of external audiences. For example * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * Chavez demonstrates demonstrators in an empty street (what hell they did?) They did not say anything but they did not worry about the images they had not seen. Here, opposition demonstrators (and journalist) dead or wounded on the other side of "empty" street. They can not explain why the helmet of the political police was the only one to make that flight in Caracas and did nothing against anti-counterfeiters on all the roofs of the presidential palace buildings. The President will be security measures. After a few days of "coup d'état", the head of the military guard in the United Nations (our Congress) was asked why they did not oppose the snipers and said "they were not acting against them." President, "is not it a confession? <br /> <br /> There is so much more that the highest military officer, Chávez, has resigned and said he has said two days later," because that is a policy. "" And now he is Chávez's internal administration minister . <br /> <br /> I will take thousands of words to explain the lies expressed in this "documentary", which is intended to sell the world. The image of old Hugo Chávez, who governs the poor, and everything that he wants to afford to spend all his expenses at all costs. In fact, 60-70% of people refuse to go to government, and this percentage includes the poor. > <br /> I hope that you can see that there is another version between those who bought and bought, and a group of Venezuelan people who put an end to 30 people. <br /> <br /> Nazi propaganda is back!
