Yes, unfortunately I found that DVD and I found it very horrible. <br /> <br /> First, the characters suck. I mean, you're going to come up with an orange shower called 'Orange Sherbert', if it's the best creative idea of ​​that character that could be the best creator, then they would definitely not be in the movie scene. Bad "costumes", "bad" conversations, and basically there is a "wrestler" with a "full" charismatic record. <br /> <br /> Splatter Rampage is just one of those "fighting" wrestling. idiots gently and rotate in a play trampoline. Similarly, they all seem incredible all the time, because the experience seems like a child's game. "Fighting the death." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Basically, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is not very easy. Only blood, weapons, cause and WRESTLING instead of trampoline, giggling kids, we got an audio Terrier, and a guy named Orange Sherbert. <br /> <br /> Wrestling fan or not, avoid this DVD. It's wonderful.
