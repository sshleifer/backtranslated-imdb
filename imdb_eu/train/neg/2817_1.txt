Tobe Hooper is probably the greatest hit on horror genres. Like any other horror fan, I loved the Texas Chainsaw, but I think that if you put your title to a movie title, you should at least have a successful movie. I do not think Hooper's other films (only, not Poltergeist) have had a great impact on the horror genre or the film world. And this Night Terrors movie protects my point. <br /> <br /> <br /> Robert Englund's shelf, I think working with just a few jobs was very good material. He did his power. Like the same movie? Sharp net Necessary nude scenes in five minutes, a story written in a beautiful landscape, music and cinematography. No interchangeable in this movie. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> Generally, I feel over 10. I feel Hooper before it seems to have started before its completion. I hope to be able to pump at least one short film, so that he can do justice through his worship. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
