Nobody ever tried to adapt a book by Tom Robbins on the screen. The movie is fine and the performances are good, but the conversation, well-read, fails to talk. Or, in the same way, to say someone else, nobody would suggest listening to someone else's name as it was written in a pearl in the radius. <br /> <br /> Generally, it feels like cliffs adapted to the movie. Notes on the book - most of the sections have changed to the fifth in size of the book in terms of history and current stories. The end of the book is different (and unpleasant). Most of the book plots have been lost, at the end it makes sense and there is more than a point of reference in the book that says the audience, "Huh?" It's not worth the effort, unfortunately - the script had to be read, burnt on the book and make something better for all actors sent. I admire Gus Van Santena terribly, but it is not true that one of them can do a decent movie of that complex book without making a miniseries.
