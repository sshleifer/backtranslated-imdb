Personally, I think this show is pretty cheap. Some actors are awesome. They do more and they seem fake. I can always say how it is seen that the first 10 minutes or less will last for observation, so they clearly show up. Not very well written. I like to laugh at it. You know how to say "Is it really good?" Well, this phrase applies to this show. On the other hand, I only want to see how it ends when I guess when I guess. I have been correct until now. It's like a little game that I play. When you are pleasant and you like something to laugh at.
