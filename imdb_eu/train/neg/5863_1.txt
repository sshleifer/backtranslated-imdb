I really can not believe that this movie is not on 250 IMDBs, it's totally horrible. When I first saw it, I remember talking about college, and they also saw two other people. We all told that the other class members did not see that it was so horrible. When we did it, others wanted to see that it was not something we said was wrong. Do not be like them, just pass it on. I am sure that all those involved in this film prefer to never watch the movie.
