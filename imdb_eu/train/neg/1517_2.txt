I write in the title that the story is playful. I will work below and say why, in my low opinion, this movie is ruining it. <br /> <br /> Gerek and Danes are doing their job, and although they're not the best, it's very good. The other cast, however, is doing very bad work. Please note, this is not a mistake for the actor. The problem is that Gerek and Danes are the only ones that have little depth in depths with minimal rooms. All other characters have the space of the movie too small to create a depth, or that character is a topic that is hardly taken into account when the actor tries hard. <br /> <br /> The Director has a bit Complex, but only looking in the direction, I think he works well. <br /> <br /> But the story. This is a bad script in two ways. First of all, it's a bad movie. The characters are superficial (except Gere and Danes 'stars), criminals are topical and the characters' actions are completely incredible. In addition, writers need to have an agenda where they want to bring our views and ethics a hundred times. It is a movie that says criminals are still criminals, regardless of the price paid by society. Similarly, the type of film that only says between lines, each type of sexual deviation must be punished without trial, trial or jury. And, of course, according to the film, all sexually-married offspring of missionaries is a sexual deviation. <br /> <br /> So, if you're going to school and need an example, a bad script, or if you're writing scripts and encouraging yourself. See. I recommend the other movie, the others.
