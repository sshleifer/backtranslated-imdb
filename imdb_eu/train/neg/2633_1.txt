I saw the movie trailer in theater and I was excited. It was similar to the classic thriller made in the 1990s. He also reminded me of the fugitive movies, cat and mouse between Douglas and Sutherland. However, The Sentinel is an action-packed act of all time. As I can see, many people say it's like a TV movie. It's not exactly. First, there are much better TV series in this genre. Secondly, TV shows can be very entertaining at times, but this movie is good enough. He is not the most visually stylish and most important. The movie tone is not very attractive. This is not an action movie, there are two scenes of action, persecution and collision. Also, they are not scenes of great action, but it is worse that this scene of action is like a very movie. The love between Douglas and Bassinger was not fulfilled. In addition, the president's murder is a topic in that genre, but that's why they emphasize. And this is not the case as a cat and a mouse movie. Although Douglas is very old, he still has the chance to act in a thriller of potential action. In the movie, Michael Douglas can not be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is a mistake, if you go to see Jack Bauer and if you feel that way, his character is one of the reasons that is a movie movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a curious choice, of course, very passive or straight in this movie because the soap operas are an actor. The movie was not funny to me the second, so I could not pass a bit of time.
