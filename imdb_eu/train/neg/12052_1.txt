What happens when you give enough money to catch a man in the rat race? Homeless people no one responds. They have no mortgages, no money for rent, or idiot bosses. Homeless people are not concerned about the IRS or payments on credit card payments. But give yourself enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and suddenly have to worry about entering the rat race, for transporting gas, paying car insurance and working for someone else. They have the opportunity to be "Citizen Producers". This movie was as exploitative as a movie. A richle and middle class sheeple is a way to "see what happens when you try to help the poor?" and proclaims the capitalist armory. <br /> <br /> Why does not the movie asks: "What happens when a rich man removes everything?"
