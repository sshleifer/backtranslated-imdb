Like summer movies on neighbors' summer camps, it encourages "Indian Summer" sleep. Twenty former alumni camps are hardly entering, so it's boring for people we do not know at any time. The beautiful actors Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton are totally wasted in this movie. A camera says, "everything seems to be much smaller than what I remember," it is repeated at least ten times, you just have to. The planned faucets are not funny, they are not originals, unless the short pages are a real "Howler". This film was a great despair, considering the wide-ranging talent involved. "Indian Summer" did not feel bad. - MERK
