The latest creatures have to endure a lot of horrible movies for fans of feature films. Blood Surf reluctantly binds the list of innocent and terrifying giant animals that want to turn the food chain around the other side. Crocodiles have been particularly successful, we have already faced the 'Abyssmal Crocodile' (directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'. Blood Surfing on any other movie and ?? on top of that ?? he likes it very much. The salmon crocodile is supposedly 90 years old, more than 30 meters long (!) And it kills fun! During the movie, he played fun surfers and looking for new surf quests looking for new sharks when they swallowed stupid dudes. The beautiful aspects of this film are tropical locations. Even if it's not suitable for such a movie, the lake and nature are wonderful. Any other aspect is just catastrophic. Gore is a bit, but it looks fake and ridiculous. It's really painful to listen to conversations! You do not believe some of the lines put forward by the actors! I know surfers need to be mentally subordinate, but I hope they are not stupid! At the beginning of the film, a character refers to the "mechanical toy" of Jaws, but the least 10 times less here is Spielbergen's white line. The visual effects of "Blood Surf" are amateur, and the massacre fails. I do not say too much acting, such second level in secondary films. Girls tease sexy shirts and their boobs gladly flee with the beast. You have just guessed it: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. It's so bad it's fun again. But "funny" for a reason other than James Hickox.
