Where to start, this movie is a bit too bad and horrible. I do not know where to start. Well, two dogs that wrote this dog. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, first of all, could not name their names by name. My intention is to distinguish the difference, which is why the main title BRAIN THA wouldn DIE would not die, but on the bottom screen HEAD THI DRODU should not. Nobody knows about the medical issue. After swearing by all doctors, "they did not hurt". It would be "harm" to kill a woman with a transplant. In addition, it is called a small thing that matches blood and tissues. Reply Jane would say death. Also, it saves the patchwork monster. What medical school did the UNIVERSITY OF FRANK FRANKSSTEIN get? Old FU or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? There was no name for the monster, so I got rid of it. Also, a great doctor, Bill Cortner, does not know how to keep a patient? The whole disaster of a movie is very stupid and not understandable, except MST3K. THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER OF TURKEY.
