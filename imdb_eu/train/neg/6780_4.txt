This movie was a critique and box office filas in 1957. At that time, Broadway's flopped that was flopped that was flopped in a new workflow based on a novel. The story is about a story about some of the Navy officers in San Francisco. The Mark Hopkins Hotel has a 4-day break. Many movies are a series and a character is not very real. Cary Grant is a great comedy and theater in general, but here she plays like a distributor of a wheel and does not really come out. Tony Curtis or James Garner would be a better option. Audrey Hepburn played before Grant, but had other commitments - Suzy Parker had never played before, but at that time he was the main American model of photography. I think he did a good job, considering all the pressure underneath. Grant in some short scenes to join Jayne Mansfield - did not really work. Studio gave a class to Grant, but the character was not any substance.
