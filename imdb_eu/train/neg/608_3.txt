Creep Kate (Power) is a story that lasts somewhat of the underground noise of the underground train and is lit to stop at the metro station. Somehow, after a guy in a mysterious train running after shutdown, Guy Guy and a colleague after a guy, things go wrong and there is still something under the streets of the city. His story is George (Blackwood), related to the similar work in the sewer system; They gather in the final third of the film, which tries to escape the monster against them. <br /> <br /> The couples are getting more and more difficult. From the Metro station, they end up in sanitation, before finding an underground underground surgery. Most cloud rooms do not have toilets, so the surgery is beyond me. Of course, the movie does not remove any water from the surgeon. But does it have electricity? It's just about a lot of work on everyday credibility that tries to create movies. <br /> <br /> The same monster is the problem. There is a lack of reasoning for actions, people do not give clear reasons. And then, of course, it keeps you alive for some reasons, or maybe it's time to run away and stay in the movie for 15 minutes or longer. I understand that natural evil is supposed to be terrifying, but then the film must explain itself by a doctor and a photograph of his son, and some shots of some babies are both as laborious and pathetic. it seems. He also does not explain how the soil has been talked about enough to be underground underground, only communicating with the raptor's shouts, but it's not long enough to break down his shorts. Hmm. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Although it is often and uncomfortable to see it, it is not enough. The last third of the film is under an emotional relationship that has never been so, and there is little or no reason for the break or recovery of the characters. George is broken, despite not being able to resist anything, he says he wants to see his daughter again, and Kate becomes emotionally harsh after a few seconds after passing someone else's card. Yes <br /> <br /> Once the movie "Anyone Can Coming", it immediately goes down and presents ideas that make them more realistic. The interest of the characters is avoided by lack of emotion and lack of suspicion.
