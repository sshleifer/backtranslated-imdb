The short film of this woman I really loved was the main topic, especially "Living with happiness". This movie is enjoyable from the beginning - a strange place and the potential of a strange cinematic, but it fails to showcase melancholic conversations, short mistakes and television. <br /> <br /> Again, television is charming and very ordinary cinema. Ideas resemble television commercials. But the feeling is good, so we can not complain too much. <br /> <br /> I would really like the director to do a lot of animation and work with a producer that is not so boring. Clarity.
