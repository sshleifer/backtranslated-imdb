First of all, I would like to add that it is somewhat historian, so that what is sought in a historical event based on historical facts is based on historical facts. But that does not happen here. Surely because the movie is entertaining, but if it is not based on real events, it's more than annoying. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, although he worked for Jews before World War II. However, in World War II, he made his opinions before the Jews. In this film his education is indeterminate. Hitler's little boy was not disturbed. He had more or less education. No mention is made of other important pieces that are added to his lost brothers and to the Hitler puzzle. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle is an excellent actor, but he does not really play Hitler's role. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as he portrayed. The younger person was charismatic, "manipulated" the characters through their charm. His conduct began to be unstable and angry at the point of war. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see the movie about Hitler's life, based on real historical facts and accusations. I really hate people guilty when pointing a finger to Hitler and others, and tells the wrong stories to draw a picture of them as wrong. It's much better to tell the story, as it may be, to know what it's like. Those who are behind this film should do some research before doing so. They do not even know what happened. Hitler did not shoot the revolutionary march of Munch, his shoulder socket was ripped off. <br /> <br /> It allows you to see more than just watching a good documentary.
