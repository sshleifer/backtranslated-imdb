Even though I watched the movie that I saw, I laughed much more than the last comedy I saw. <br /> <br /> The budget had to be an actor's pocket change. The production values ​​are so low that it really looks so fun. A Robot Monster, a Gorilla-clad man, reminds me of a cartoon diving helmet. <br /> <br /> In a scene, a victim of the victim cuts his arm and leg. Well, it's hard to believe, but the Knight Black Holy Grail was a realistic scene. I was glad to follow why the victims did not "Cry out" and "it was just a wound of flesh, I was worse." It was one of the fun scenes I saw last year. <br /> <br /> "Gladiator / devil" was also a point. It was a terrific costume and geeky look between the hysterical. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's enough to see a bad movie. Slowly see a short accident on a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
