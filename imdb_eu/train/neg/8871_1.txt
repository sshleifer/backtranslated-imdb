I watch 200 movies every year in theaters and at home, and I'm sure the movie is much worse than what I saw this year (I've never even seen "looking for the Delta of the Knights" yet). This movie is a joke that is a bad joke targeting young people 13 years old and I was not happy to see it on a bus trip, I could not walk. <br /> <br /> Please do it from this side. a rent. Four dollars could be better spent on any movie given by Jerry Bruckheimer.
