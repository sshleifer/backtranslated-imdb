Feh. This movie started in an interesting way, but soon it was worse and less dull. The most disturbing things happened especially at the beginning. The scene cut is so numerous and it's hard to say what happens in the first twenty minutes. The body appears later, love between two living creatures (both together). The venerable spirit of the deceased is actually the worst, most sad person in the movie. If the rest cast had its role, it could be a better movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the story is very interesting, it seems that the mother of the dead sixteen-year-old priest is trying to revive his daughter's dead, all the rest of the dead would come back again. Likewise, they will take a firm human shape and, surely, everyone will die. A kind of mystical Japanese night of dead night. But that does not happen. Although this priest who has not been cleared of a little cloth covered with priestly heads, he tells the young priests that if the priest finishes with the rite, that is the only dead man who appears and that his daughter will appear. Do not raise the mass of the dead, the corpses are not a pedestrian, nothing. The priest makes nothing but the spirit of the little girl to return to the land of the dead, wiping him with a clever wuss of a boyfriend, as he crushed his spine like a brittle peanut (at this moment I was loudly encouraged, that is, the idiot went to kiss and fell in love with the little girl, ewwww !!!). Robituss's charming friend, pale, has a long introspective shot at the town as he is last seen, and that's it. There is no real fear that the Japanese film makers are much less afraid of Japanese fantasy than the Japanese, with the highest facial face makeup, without screaming. I was very disappointed.
