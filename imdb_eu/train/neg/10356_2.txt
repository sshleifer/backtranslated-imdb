(This may be a bit reversed). I would say I did not see the whole movie, and I was not disappointed because I was very obvious at the time of the first hour. Of course, many people who think that it is an amazing book is a problem and they make it a Disney TV movie. <br /> <br /> It was time to wrinkle up becoming stunning. a movie for a long time. It has got a story that can have a great thread for children and adults. It is also made in quality monitoring. But Disney's pace did not go away. The problem of the movie is that all things that have changed to become a visual story have so much to do with the book. It's a complicated and emotional story for children. There was no reason why Charles Wallace was "psychic", it was the easiest way to explain it. There was no reason to write more reason as a strain between the three Wen, in the story, there is enough tension without it. There was no reason to get rid of Meg eggs ... Calvin and Meg might be the scene of what happens in this book. <br /> <br /> In the days of small things I could think of it. , but I also think of bigger things, such as the direction of art was diverted. For example, like Camazoto's appearance, with horrible dark sky. The credibility that appears in the book is that it can be Camazotz Lurra. It seems the earth. People look like humans. The sky is blue, the grass is green and the children are playing. But there is something a bit wrong. Directors decided to take Camazoto's lesson in another book and instead apply it to the general direction of the film. According to the course, Camazotz wants the Earth to be quite well, that is, if we forget how we love it. It would be much strange to have a nice afternoon walking down the street, with kids who beat the same rhythm. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I did not look at the end. Maybe someone can tell you how Disney has finished. <br /> <br /> In general, an artist's despair. <br /> <br /> <br />
