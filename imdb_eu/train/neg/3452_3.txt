I watched a short film at the last Festival of Dubai, as it was selected at the Cannes International Film Festival. I was surprised that Cannes could have such a great quality. <br /> <br /> Movies, some reviewers, say, have no excessive shots - but it is an intrinsic violence. Imagine killing your enemies / competitors in front of your young son ... or forcing someone to prove a loyalty to a porcelain spoon. There are traces of contrasting sons of Corleone, who appear in this Chinese / Hong Kong film, in "Coppello" "Padrino", but the quality of both is very much like chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> This movie is only recommended for violence junkies ... There's no great movie here. In most cases, Run Run Shaw may be better than normal production production values.
