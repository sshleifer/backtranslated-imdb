Watching the pretty women around, the police and thieves play one of the most beautiful pleasures of guilty guys who enjoy me. So Carroll Street House did not miss out on time, though it was a script that guessed the story and was not scripted and even more annoying. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock's multiple photo citations, not Kelly's selection. McGillis starred in. Grace Kelly is dressed in fashion and is not far away. In no way. But his character is not convincing. As it enters the audiences, it must be someone who has a political and life-related purpose. After all the movies, clearly defined time, real events and a specific topic are addressed. But the story degrades in the first few minutes, an unexpected bad story with incredible varieties, great prediction and a set of two-dimensional characters. It's more wonderful because the performances of the actors are good, as well as the design of photography and theater. <br /> <br /> At the Central Station, there is an end to New York. It begins in the underground section and the roof climbs. The film can be praised for the good use of architecture.
