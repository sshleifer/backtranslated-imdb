The movie I ever saw was the worst movie ever. Here are the things that come up immediately: 1. Forests with two trees and a brush that were like the hills of Los Angeles. There's no fear. The news is repeated, if you're shooting in the southern California area, large bears are just one hour. Actually there are trees. <br /> <br /> 2. Writing I was completely doubtful the worst conversation I ever had. All possible lines of the movie do not origin, topic or completely stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "campaign blood" (bad), the name of the clown is "killer pile" (bad). What makes clowns in the woods anyway? Did he find the only mask? 3. Last but definitely a minimal activity. The worst actor and actress. Cracked lines and poor performances. The worst of all, then, he made a random turn of this foreign girl to a naked photo. It's a very long scene and I think it was sexy, but it's NOT. Likewise, and the most pleasant part of the movie for me, this was an instrument that was "athletic". For example, when the movie gets bored, it takes a couple of rocks and begins to make curls with them. Later, he later goes on to look for clowns, and immediately "running like a little girl" is running, far away from the sport. Oh, and Kat, a girl, let the good Lord sing. I want to kill myself for this song for this credit. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, at least I would recommend watching special features. They talk about the game group they made, because this story is very original. Actually, a girl says that some of her friends allow her to read the script and nobody can announce the end. Apparently it has special children.
