If you like "Blair", you'd like this. The camera has a simple work and soundtrack, and there are no floors and suspicious moments. Tarantino and Rodr√≠guez are making a "Evening Evening Evening" meal. It's also a good icon and actress. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This movie has been the most strange movie I've ever seen, and I have watched some movies - it's bad too. I can tell that most of the horror movies find somehow entertaining, but this time was pure. <br /> <br /> This movie was for 1 instead of 1, the only reason I gave it to the hot act with all the hot flashes and the hot plastic teeth ... No, I'm joking. I needed to lose before voting to press "send". <br /> <br /> Leave away, even with sexy girls on the cover!
