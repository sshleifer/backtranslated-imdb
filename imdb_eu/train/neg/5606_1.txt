I think Shakespeare's just read what I read. I think (Mrs.) is protesting too much. He told me the whole thing as if trying to convince the author himself! Sometimes it is regularly offered by profane literature (which is not written in the same epic but does not refer to the biblical), but I believe that at least three references are of my own opinion, which give the historical precision of the end of the Bible. Everyone has sharp data and proven what you want, but it does not become true. Customs change, we have to change the definitions of words throughout time (we look in English and German, because it is a very common error) there is nothing left, it is always growing and changing. The Bible has several translations but King James version is best I found the best of all types of research. In the King James version, you can note several words written in italics. These words have been added by translators and can be left and the verse's average may vary. Writings about the times of Christ were written without space, without punctuation, without paragraphs and without numerical verses. These writings look like a long word and added all the translators. For example, how would you read: THAT ORIGIN, God has not read or read God right now? The letter chain itself has two completely different meanings. For this reason, many Bible researchers use "Lexical" to translate, speaking Arabic, Hebrew or Hebrew, according to the language originally written. It is also interesting to note that it is translated into symbolic logic that God is present, but you can not prove that it does not exist! In the end, I love that they are just as intelligent as listening to so intelligent. Talk about the situation! By putting soapbox on, God bless Maegi
