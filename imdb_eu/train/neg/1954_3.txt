First of all, leave it. . . yes, this film insulates many "Darkness Falls" (2003). The plot of Darkness Falls looks like something like The Tooth Fairy, a murderous woman who conceals her face, kills people who look after dependency. In 'The Tooth Fairy' (2006), the disfigured Tooth Fairy (who, on the other hand, conceals her face) frees herself in more than one person. Approximately similar to being a coincidence. <br /> <br /> But, you should ask: if you steal the exact plot of a movie, why choose "Darkness Falls" so wrong. ? Surely he has made a few bucks in the boxes, but he was delighted by the film's wonderful movie experience. A low-budget live video movie will not have the same effect. And that was not. <br /> <br /> The expectations that I saw when I opened the film 15-20 minutes really rose. It seems at least some production values. The story was not horrible, it was simply clear. After the first scene, we get good cast characters, a former doctor with a secret (this type of Busey and the hot veterinary student (master of Argentin's "Jenifer from Horror: Jenifer: Jenifer"). In a few minutes, however, he goes to film dirt. It uses all the awesome basic topicals, but not limited to: a crazy old person hanging in an unnoticed age, stripper with a jolly, psychic and golden heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems with this film was not sticking with a viewer. The film director wanted to change the character of the screen at that time. When adults were on the screen, it was more mature. Star (stripper), which came on the (jock) screen, stupid conversations, rooted down one level. When the baby was on the screen, "Are Dark For The Dark?" It felt like a section. . . more terrifying. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is in the whole place. Visions are quite boring. It's a great handwriting, mostly in the way it works. On the positive side, the piece is excessive (quite hard (as is foreseen)) a dense wood scene and naughty nailing. In addition, if you are looking for something sexy, the topless scene is short (but if you do not want to see this piece of footage, there are the best movies to do it). In addition, there is not much worry in this film. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of "Darkness Falls" (are you?), you may be able to verify it. to see the story differently. . . But this is the only reason to see this. <br /> <br /> Last ruling: 3/10 -AP3-
