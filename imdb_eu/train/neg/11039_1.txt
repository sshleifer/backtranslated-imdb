All of the fun things that happen in this sitcom are the protagonist of being a bad father of God, a bad husband, or generally selfish. How can that be fun? Of course, a character from a sitcom must fail, but Jim's character is in a very wrong way. <br /> <br /> And why is that? I think he should "get better". Jim is not stupid, he looks after things and has the chance to do so. But he does not choose. She makes conscious choices when she chooses not to play with her children, or because she does not want to buy, because she does not want to buy "lady products" and she does this when her relatives put her. <br /> <br /> It seems the other characters can only be in the series and Jim can hit someone. If Cheryl was a real person, he would leave him a few years ago and not be killed for 8 years. But, alas, Jim is just a catalyst for the extreme selfishness of the middle class.
