Cedric Kahn's films were based on characters, rather than taking them as an action base (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux-rouges), so it's a matter of focusing on the characters that Sucar really knows. . I do not have an interesting actress Stefano Cassetti; She reminds me of pro athlete immersed in movies like Bret Favre. Empty looms, the deer that is trapped in cloth looks really bad. The real actor would have forced him to reflect on the personality of Succo, instead of reflecting his carjacking skills on admirers. Isild le Besco, who works mostly with stormy sucros. An interview with the police station, besides Le Besco, for fear of the future, is a wonderful conversation.
