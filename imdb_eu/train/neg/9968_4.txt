As a former teacher (!) I have to admit it through many scenes - "Although I continued to look at the end, why?! (Boredom perhaps?) :-) <br /> <br /> The opening scenes were very mash-mash and unfocussed incredibly I felt that in the plot, even though there were good ideas - a problem with a teacher of relief, for example - they were not enough to concentrate in the direction of 3D development. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Nolte is not a moment ... As for Macchio, * In each film * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Plot and play-offs aside, the style haired was a nostalgic one (although confusing) <br /> < br />
