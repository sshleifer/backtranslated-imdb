I had a great hope for this movie (the title, "Translated," is how we remove others). In the end, the concept is very good: in the near future, the elite government freeloaders and, in general, the right-wing authorities of the left take the continuous right conclusion and, in general, everyone has decided to die. Who can not prove that they are giving something to the establishment (saying "good common", but that speaks of the interests of capitalist ideology). <br /> <br /> Great idea! Ideal satira! , this film offers a complete chance: satire is only on a few scenes and shows, but this satire is not permanent, it is not sharp or sharp, and for a supposed comedy, the movie is hardly an entertaining scene, I suppose it is a nonsense about the comedy situation But the situations are largely uncomfortable and serious, instead of reminding me of laughter or thought. <br /> <br /> A serious script is the provision mistakes The action was about political parties and something would be wrong to do such things, but it goes on to spend a lot of time with a young woman who is funny new times and is trying to save someone. , Organizing the resistance that people transport in Africa. Not all of this! Such a movie would not be so serious! It's a satire! Political expression. But it is not really about the issue that is being debated. Maybe he was afraid to go too far? Cowardice That's not art. There is no true satire too. <br /> <br /> SÃ¸ren Pilmark, Denmark's very senior actor, is very good. It widened the value of the movie's little entertainment. All others: nothing special (well, except Lene Poulsen, who offered a convincing performance). <br /> <br /> In fact, the problem with most Danish films is that language is never natural. There is no formulation or delivery. Why is it so difficult? Why should it be so stilted and artificial? I hope that now, over the past fifty years, when you look at people in these films, they do not think that this was how people in general talked about in Danish society. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 3.
