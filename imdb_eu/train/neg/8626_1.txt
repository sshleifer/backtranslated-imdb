Looking at other reviews, I am surprised to hear that they do not have to wait for those who wait for rent. First of all, I rented this thing when I decided that Indiana Jones was the guilty party. As I try to remember when I was one of the toughest movies I remember, it's even more amazing because of the great relative value of the movie's production. <br /> <br /> I do not think this is a spoiler, but if so, notice ... <br /> <br /> If you see the idea of ​​your entertainment coming back to the Fearsome Tribal Chief, its significant head is the dead eye dead While looking, all the resources, rent this movie. Otherwise, I'd recommend you look elsewhere for entertainment. <br /> <br /> Come and think, the movie that briefly summarizes this scene, I really did not say what they did not have.
