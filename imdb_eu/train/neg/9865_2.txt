With Dead Gentlemen Productions I received a movie that would be similar to "The Gamers". Boy, what a despair! Films are filmed in this fake documentary that is celebrated but not achieved. The reason is partly a tough act, but especially writing and direction. To be honest, it can be fun because of the roles they play, but it can be fun doing it as it can be here. At the beginning of each scene you will know what a "joke" will be. But the biggest problem is that everything is depicted above. There's no trick in this movie, tracking "LAUGH NOW" or "laughter of the 80s" would not have much difference. With some scenes you can not think "Yes, I know why I think it would be fun", but the way it runs is out of the joke.
