The movie's premise has been explained and if I do not have a film critic, I would like to say. That said, the opinion of the film is quite small. I am a fan of Takashi Miike, but this is not so good with DOA 2 and 3, and in others (many). <br /> <br /> It seems that taking a movie is a Takashi movie, and Takashi can not do anything wrong. It is an approach to upper-class escorts. For the rest, for an hour and a half, a child with a totally annoying scream (and yes, this removes the movie), we will find and the rhythm of the movie has reached the rhythms of the rhythm and act ... well ... hmmm. <br /> <br /> If you are a Takashi fan, you will send your interests. There is no lack of originality (see Neverending Story) or the development of any character that is the main character in the face of the conflict, which is quite superficial. <br /> <br /> As it is mentioned, Miike is the first movie that goes into the co-writing, but that does not mean that we would not expect the Miike's identity to exceed the expectations. on screen All we get is a few phone calls about the director of the Miike photographer. <br /> <br /> The movie could be a bit big. The premise is hard to do. But this seemed to fit into the ground. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is just to join Miikan, with some standards like Gozu, Ichi and Audition. He later shot Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, as a Chinese Bird People.
