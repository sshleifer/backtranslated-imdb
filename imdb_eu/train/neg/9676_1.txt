The movies have slept before me, but I never did this movie twice, so I took three seats to finish really. The conversation was bad. The women talked fiercely and the men were caricatured. And supposedly two female Japanese women were Chinese, Chinese names and accented with Chinese accents. I try to understand why Emmenthal men were still in sex with me. 10 minus 8 1/2 is a tough option: is this movie a rating? or two? <br /> <br /> The movies have fallen asleep before me, but the films have never doubled, so I took three seats to finish really.
