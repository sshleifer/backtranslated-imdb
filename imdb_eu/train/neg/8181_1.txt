I went to see this movie (I saw the Portraits Family, Cutting Moments + Douglas Buck with 2 other shorts) in Mar del Plata (Argentina) ... I can not see it! After Cutting Moments, I had to cover my eyes and take a look again. When I finished, my stomach was upside down and I felt light. I had to leave the cinema after a few minutes after 2 minutes (BTW, of course, I did not leave the room). WAAAAY was very violent and disgusting to me! I was really surprised by the brave people who really loved. I do not love such movies! I watched the images that I saw were terrible and bloody and horrible in two days! I also try to study the story (my boy saw everything and told me about it) and I do not think any sense. I mean, this rape and things, it just makes sense to try to impress people. And that's not enough reason, I think. In this movie I can say nothing. "Well, at least" x "was a good thing." Well, I think I never understood this type of film.
