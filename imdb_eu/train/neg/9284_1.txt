Men, even Plan 9 Outer Space From is better than this film. This Flick does not have enough land in the middle of an hour, but it has extended over eternity for an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, especially in the great battle scenes, but things like Fong Sai Yuk are much better than the legend, which means that it would not be better than this.
