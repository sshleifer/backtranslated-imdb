As the mother of 2 children of a mother to speak of, they are growing with Scooby's reincarnations, I feel like I can comment on the historical and current version of Scooby. <br /> <br /> Before we saw Shaggy and Scooby as a family, we did not see episodes as we would like lightweights and Saturday morning cartoon. But basically this is a problem in today's format so light weight that it will not last for "Scooby" and the "gang". I am sure that I can make the money back, but I am sure that the elderly and youngsters are at risk of losing their long-term purchases. When I saw the new version of my 6-year-old son, he was really embarrassed and without any request he said he was really badly animated and why it was not the same as the last series (Where are you). <br /> <br /> Scrappy Doo was an anomaly but it's still much better than that. Let's hope it will make reference to the producers.
