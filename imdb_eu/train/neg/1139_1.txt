Note that since I found it in 2007, I have not seen the movie, and my country is smaller and it does not. However, I mean something about it. I'm doing research at the University with the character named Richard Maurice Bucke, and I want to emphasize that the person who has taken on a very different personality! Hollywood people's ideas and artistic licensing were given to them, a true doctor, Bucke absolutely accepted women's madness to heal hysterectomies, and would never practice as shown in the film. I believe that I can see some critics who write critical movies with legitimate newspapers. The only thing I truly can see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Dr. Walt Whitman. Please do not waste your time in a movie, just like the real women who have been glorified by filmmaking.
