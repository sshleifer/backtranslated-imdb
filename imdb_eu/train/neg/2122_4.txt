In some seven-pounds, though, it's interesting in some of his narrative styles, although Gabriele Muccinus's project is half-time. The film is becoming more and more sappy and manipulative at the end of the day: human and emotional hearts, physical and metaphorical eyes. Seven Pounds is Alejandro González Iñarrrit's Amores Perrosen and 21 Grams is the best imitation, flashbacks a lot. The problem is that it's pretty easy to predict the story over the film. It's really bad, if seven-pound real could be "good", Ben and Emily were put in the right hand.
