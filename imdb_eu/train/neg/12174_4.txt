This is a great step to get a surprisingly enjoyable original. This sequence is not as enjoyable as the first part, and it takes too much time for land development. Tim Thomerson is still the best thing about this series, but this entry does not diminish its weakness. The performances are good, but this time it stops scripts. The action is only a routine, and there is little interest in the plot, so I need a lot of hilarious laughs to be entertained in the "Trancers" movie. Unfortunately, they laugh at roughly, so this film is very much appreciated.
