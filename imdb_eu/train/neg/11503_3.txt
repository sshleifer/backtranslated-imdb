Quentin Crisp once said that things are beautiful, romantic. When things get incredible, they are realistic. And when something ironic treatment is achieved, they stop. Unfortunately for Leon Aranona, he joined the second category. This director has, of course, tried hard to make a Spanish movie by Ken Loach, so that comedy and warmth can be captured amongst characters, Loach only raises "depressed" movies. Los Lunes al Sol, this is just that, depressing. Realistic things are grim. The last moments of the misery of the characters reached the highest point, and if the story is not enough, Aranoa will clear the story with a visual and gray color. The films were very popular in Goyas. A movie that shows empathy for the most vulnerable of society, in this case employees' port workers, does not automatically accept movies, even if they are the first to join their fate. I only grow a film that I grow up in my destiny. XXI. In sub-Saharan Africa, unemployed people do not live in scales, and public transport ships have decent bathrooms, and it is difficult to find forgiveness so many fans and so happy for them. Leon Aranan, of course, does not have any idea about what works in Spain, and does not make any favors. It is the only effect that can be drawn by the pretentiot. Men play a scene that shows a football match in football directly from a movie that is much more realistic about the "poverty" issue of "Really Belter". and still sad.
