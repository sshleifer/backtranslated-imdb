Really, I do not know what this movie is. It's like the Student's art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it is always the darkness except in seconds of a day. There are no lengths of insect lengths and interruptions for all kinds of reasons. The movie's little conversations are as cramped and absurd as the images. A black woman enters the main character's apartment. Somehow, he is pregnant tonight, and then fights at his head. The main character is responsible for the body, until she becomes a nude female chair. I never have such a horror movie. To be honest, I would like someone to say what they think of. But I would not like this level of hell to anybody else.
