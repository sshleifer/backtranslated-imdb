... and how have you carried them in your head. The Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD films of the 70's, there is no mention of actors, scriptwriters, brilliant director, and a horror-like "horror" horror with comedy. This movie finds a paleontologist's drawing of a water-dyed dinosaur under the Crater Lake ... a meteor that falls from the sky and a clay potter dinosaur begins to scare and dwell on the Crater Lake. The whole question is that Steve takes care of our local sheriff. A large part of the film - when it shows no blood pools that appear to be what we need to be an edible beast - it goes through two men named Arnie and Mitch, who rent a ship. They try so badly to make them fun, like lines, looking at a business signal, Mitch told Arnie "You have written incorrectly, written by B-A-T-E." There were only a lot of laughter here. Then we see them drunk and we can imagine a tree trunk to be a dinosaur. Be careful with Laurel and Hardy! The dinosaur is a fake look, but the movie is fun in a fun way. And, at least, the lake is beautiful.
