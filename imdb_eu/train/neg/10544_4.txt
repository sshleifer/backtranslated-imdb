When the memory of childhood tells you the terrifying movie; touch it and go see it again. In any case, I remember a cool nasty guy who would play a homeless person and Jeff Kober. <br /> <br /> "The first power" is not a very good movie, sad to say. It is full of topical poets and a very poor hole with a truck (along with many "rounds" that accompany the story). Lou Diamond Phillips's evil assassin Kober gas chamber chamber is over confident that the donkey policeman is knowing that only Satan was an authority and now he has the power of resurrection and weak intelligence with the power of each person's owner. will find it A psychic who helps with the case by mistake very misunderstood. <br /> <br /> Ah, this is the trash. But, such a pleasure, especially, you had a good memory. A child scares me and a homeless person is still quite a scene. As far as any logic is concerned; Forget it, put it in the right place at all times and end up with the Steven Segal action movie and a cross between a 70s movie. And who thought that the Earth was thinking that Phillips Phillips was a good idea? He does not have to convince me, but he tries his best and I have never had trouble with many reviewers here. Tracy Griffith as a psychic, the less will he say better. But Kobe is pretty good as a killer; This actor has always liked it. <br /> <br /> "The first power" can be prescribed after a hard day by the doctor and requires "brain deactivation". Beer will improve the visual experience, and I think this movie will give you the next time. Considering everything; It's not a good movie, but a bit of pleasure from the nostalgic enthusiasts who frightened children. "Look around, my friend!"
