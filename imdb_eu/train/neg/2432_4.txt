Not much to say about this. In the first 10 minutes you can make more than one plot. With this movie nothing is wrong, action little action for a movie. Occasionally he was able to explore the emotions of the characters. To make this an action movie a good genre, I have not decided yet. The Snake was the easiest among ordinary movies without paying any attention, because it was a bad luck and a direct plot. Probably I was guilty of it, so with a second watch or with great care, it will be better. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but my 10th best of 10)
