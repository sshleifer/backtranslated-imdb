Eytan Fox, following the general apologist for Israeli politics, has made several interesting films in the past, such as the wonderful "Walk on Water" and "Yossi & Jagger" film. In the case of "The Bubble", however, he has taken a fierce and unfair approach to extreme. <br /> <br /> This movie was given a joke, and the people attending took it easy and left. I also hid before the rage that had to be sworn before I was angry, as a racist persecution and a ruthless persecution of racist (and terrorism) persecution. This means that the Arabs are reacting so badly to the wicked Israeli people that they react with the constant current of a single attack against the Israelis and would not be responsible for their actions. <br /> <br /> I paid for this movie card, I deserved the money (I was really asked for my money, I was worth the money), and was essentially Israel's apeing "Paradise Now" of the Israeli Palestinian film. If you want to be an anti-Israeli player, watch this video game really justifying this belief system. This Israeli director, and even worse, a talented Israeli director, weeps crying. When Israeli Israelites are shocked by the propaganda of anti-Israeli propaganda, they will be amazed at how they would be amazed at Israeli beliefs. <br /> <br /> What a shameful and horrible film!
