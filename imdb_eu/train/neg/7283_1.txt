The facts about National Lampoon will go to the movies, a.k. National Lampoon's Movie Madness: <br /> <br /> 1. It's a bad movie, as well as the usual Lampoon standard. 2. It's not fun. 3. No one can watch the movie. <br /> <br /> So, after finishing the show, I asked why on earth it was called "National Lampoon Movies", and why it never came to light. much less made. It would be like naming Austin Powers 'An American Guy Goes to Movies.' How to fall He is not American and does not work in film. Lampoon's 'satire' is not a funny character, and there is no movie, and it's a problem. I expected that it would be like Mystery Science Theater 3000, but that's not it. <br /> <br /> This was the first National Lampoon film after Animal House, although it could not say the quality. film Badly developed, rough and amateur for any standard, does it cause headaches? It's not a good sign, for a 89-minute movie that looks like a double length. <br /> <br /> I saw a model. Really bad movies vary? This small catastrophe is included in this category. It has two separate titles; surely, the stupid ones will try to promote too much to remember that home video criticism was bad. 'Hmm, Movie Madness ?? I have never heard this movie! Let's rent it! "And then the conclusion:" Hey, wait a minute, that is, only the National Lampoon goes to the movies! "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > It was sponsored by MGM / UA, never released on theaters or DVD, from time to time it appears on TV for several decades, that is, it is the only place where you can find it. <br /> <br /> Divide it into three stories It's a parody of self-enhancing videos, the innocence of butter and corporation, and police brutality / cop-buddy movies. I think that the first segment is Peter Riegert (Animal House), who divorced his wife and made things worse I do not know what it was so boring to me when the mind began to swear in the head. Until the sex scene appeared. <br /> <br /> Part II talks about an exotic dancer who is stealing a stick (do not ask) to decide to become Margarine Queen to cut supplies. Dairy products. Ouch! This He has a unique line of fun: "I can love my son!" If you think that's so funny, you're not right ... And just imagine it's the protagonist of this movie! <br /> <br /> Section III is about a police officer punished after the assassin of the series (Christopher Lloyd), nerve loss and that guy's only to shoot.He has a fun scene but it's really damned? Lloyd only really shows any mood, he plays his character, a dry and compassionate, but surprisingly surrealistic thing. He sees the part that drowns the victim and spreads all the minimal police on his toe at the very least, the reflection of the head has struck. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see the spirit of semi-famous names, low standards, and the writers of each segment think they are clearly spoiling the so-called stereotypes? It's a standard T & A instead of a plot, instead of a spirit of conversation instead of inspired by desperate screenings. It's easy for one of the actors not capturing it with the material, murmuring the lines, often so ashamed that they rarely bring an eye contact with the camera. <br /> <br /> The movie is not fun, as I said before. I laughed once, in a single line, and then it was also a heart. Two chuckles, a smile, and a very weak laugh. With regard to Movie Madness, other decent comedies are ordinary laughs. <br /> <br /> I love the National Lampoon Holidays (or at least three three periods), and their classic Animal House. With Golf Punks, the latest killings made directly by the live video bombs (along with Tom Arnold's great-great-grandmother) has shown a good example of how many more than a decade's printout was printed. It is very old, very fast. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a new movie called Gold Diggers is being released, the "stamp of approval" is being published. Is it like to condemn a movie before the plays? Perhaps his name does not have to put publicity in all places? <br /> <br /> Distributor: 'This movie is bad. Has earned the National Lampoon Certificate. That is the next thing that will teach you something horrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Paste a series of criminals in a room and watch a month every day. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, I can not explain the initial malice. I give my love.
