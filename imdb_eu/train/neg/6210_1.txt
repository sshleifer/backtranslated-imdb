Lindsey Lohan is the worst movie I've ever met with "I Know Who Killed Me". <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I can assure you that you're just waiting for frustration and disappointment. Hey, Tim Burton, I was your great hobby ... did you show this movie as well? I mean seriously, what f% # k? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < ... and the movie ends. Oh wait ... here comes the spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert! At the end of the movie ... it rains. I think it's been part of my soul while watching the movie.
