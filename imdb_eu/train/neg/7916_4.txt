Where do i start What's wrong with the word: <br /> <br /> "X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's ephemeral and romantic story, a complex relationship with Victor Creed and a worrying Weapon X X." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Their relationship with Creed is so bright, it's hard to understand any connection. The scene we hear as a child emerges from an opening to assemble war scenes that have fought for a long life and are part of a hard-working group today. killers <br /> <br /> There's nothing to show off as your brother's relationship. The complex is nothing to believe in, true or even love. <br /> <br /> The romantic element of Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and violent. We end the love romanticism as fast as we can before you can make an eye on it. Since he had entered the character, fifteen minutes later Silverfox died. We wonder why we should be concerned about it. Who is he anyway? <br /> <br /> Because of the vital element of this weak revenge story, love is surprisingly unexplored. It was necessary, as he was running. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, when Wolverine sees that his love has died, he leaves the forest to go to Sabertooth. The fact that this romance was not necessary was the fact that it was still a very surprising surprise to serve on the plot. <br /> <br /> In the case of the weapon X software, we can say that after a distasteful mix. procedure Wolverine is running. In the end, the couple arrives home to those who love the old and often loved ones. Surprisingly, Ma and Pa Kent are not afraid of finding a man who has sweat in his hooks. Is not it surprising how much is it waiting for? <br /> <br /> In earlier films and comic books, Wolverine's amnesia was frustrated for no reason whatsoever. Coldblooded. <br /> <br /> Knowing that happened ... Do you want to remember the horror fears or keep it hidden and keep up with your teammates with more corrupt life with the world's criminals? <br /> <br /> As mentioned in X2: While X-men United gives Stryker some of his secrets, Wolverine would disturb him if he knew the bad things about the compromised work. This film does the band quite well, but they do not do anything. No disturbing violence, without wicked action, some of the foreign lands have only eaten their young men on the screen for ten or fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Wolverine seems not to be a bad man under Stryker. Instead, he was trying hard to try to put his brother Sabertooth to sleep, and as a result, Wolverine was a violent agent. In the end, everything is left together. <br /> <br /> There is no conflict here anymore. <br /> <br /> It eliminates the idea that conflict between good and evil is enormous. It is possible to also give rubber caulking. <br /> <br /> There was another mistake in the contradiction of the X-Men trilogy in this movie, and one of the Deus Ex Machining ever came out. a script <br /> <br /> Bullets that eliminate empty memory. <br /> <br /> Really? <br /> <br /> Wolverine seems to be the only thing to bring. However, he was apparently forgotten that when an agent came down he would probably not bring bullets and bombs. <br /> <br /> Wolverine wants to focus on this movie with another problem. While there were nothing short of tons of other mutants. Interesting figures were just window decoration and they did not make any stories. Most of them were in the film for a period of 5-10 minutes, but we did want some of them and less Wolverine. <br /> <br /> <br /> Fred Dukes (Blob but not the comic version) can be launched. The tank missile did not suffer any physical damage, but a mere headbutt from Wolverines' metal noggin is enough to fascinate him? <br /> <br /> The optical beams of Cyclops (that is, the rumors are much more similar than those in force). lasers) can be burned through buildings, but when it goes to Sabertooth it falls directly into the ground without damaging the earthquake. Does the Adamantian Trench Cover Cover? <br /> <br /> The gravitational Challenger Gambit, instead of using its signature cards, will become a crazy adventure. Wolverine unconsciously attacks the scene in a badly-edited ... then it's pretty astounding a few minutes later. On the rooftops towards Wolverine. He regained consciousness, escaped some blocks, went up to a building, returned to Wolverine and Sabertooth, in the middle of a final game, a mystery still to be described. <br /> <br /> Some have forgiven the fact that the films say weakness is made from comic, which is why it must be a weak and humble character. This film is a must-have comic and it is not superfluous that this idea is not. <br /> <br /> Comic book material, Wolverine's origins ... is a story worthy of display. . It does not cover sugar over its past, and does not treat the reader as CGI stinking junkies. It's a well-developed story, and over time it has been re-produced and adapted, with Barry Windsor-Smith starting with WEAPON X. The story is much more intense and exciting. <br /> <br /> This FOX movie is forgotten. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have that magic gun? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
