This movie is a huge distortion of lies and abuses created by shameless illusions to work on the television movie. The story is wrong and it's a lie. There is nothing in the film about the portrait of the Senator McCarthy accurately. It's just a horrible scam, and I'm surprised that anyone associated with this production has got another job in the sector. The Marxist-Leninists who write this trash did so dare not to dread the fear of dinting men and communists throughout history. Unfortunately, for these communist work, Ronald Reagan took the place he left McCarthy and could not stop him after the Soviet Union and their "coords". Never ever watch this movie you are looking for the truth about Mr. McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's book, "Traition," to see the truth of McCarthy's senator. <br /> <br /> McCarthy also helps you read what happened to reader http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
