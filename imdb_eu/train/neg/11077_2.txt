The only reason I chose was to cast a shot on behalf of Ernest Borgnine, winner of the Oscar. Everything I have said is the biggest waste of the best actress that plays the film. I think Borgnine was the only actor. Other performances were so uniform, as a studio appeared to be really "interpreters". You will play the talented level of the couple with a silly and bizarre tale, my eyes believe that bleeding would begin when the credits were demolished, and the perfect disaster for cinema. Of course, the movie was intended for children to watch and, therefore, Disney Channel's most original programming and similar networks for children. But to tell the truth, this is not a lot to say.
