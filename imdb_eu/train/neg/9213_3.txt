I caught the movie in a small movie made by members of my university gaming club. We had previously warned that the "insanity madness" of the games would be more than just handing over this movie. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie, after starting his university career after "resting" in the semester. As audiences, knowing that the movie progresses, Robbins confirmed that it was under a game called "Mazes and Monsters": it's a game that a group of gaming hires after a campaign. . <br /> <br /> There is a wide variety of movies. A scene has a team called "games light of light", probably the best way to describe it. I am sure that this is something to be "crazy", but most know it, it is very wrong. Most role playing sessions are performed in illuminated rooms, usually in chee-tohs and soda bottles. <br /> <br /> The performance, though it's not an Oscar's score, is not creepy. . This is one of the first roles of Tom Hanks, and Bosom Buddies and the Bachelor Party are still one or two horizons. The work of support is not very memorable, but it still has good performances. <br /> <br /> Above all, wickedness has been a television movie that shows "the dangers of the game". See if you and your friends think of a bad night movie.
