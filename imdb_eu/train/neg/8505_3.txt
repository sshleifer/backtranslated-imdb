The movie "Semana Santa" or "Angel Of Death" is very weak. Mira Sorvino tries to find a killer who shoots an arrow. Look from time to time with the Italian accent. Could he not speak English? All other characters have an involuntary Mexican accent. The conversation is very bad and it's a woodcut. Cinematography seems nice, but it's not enough to store this gut. The following part of this review does not contain theft! <br /> <br /> It seems that the evil ending is going to run away, but then it stays down the stairs and makes a great effort down the rail. This is just that script has no originality. Avoid!
