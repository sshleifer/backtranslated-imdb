Although 20 years later, it's the worst movie I have ever ever ever ever ever ever played with Ninja Mission. Scandanavian nets enter silent, shake their subassy by shaking them and then silence them. Wow, how can we find invisible hidden squires? Keep on the skin and keep smoking! Is the bad conversation bad (or excellent and badly translated?), It's not visible in Asian cast, and a huge team of three full stunt tripods. The plot is ridiculous, the play is quite unknown and again the ninja can not act! Save yourself - avoid watching at all costs!
