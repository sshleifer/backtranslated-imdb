Although there is only a small person with this comment about these other 80s, I feel that I have to say something about it. I am not paying attention to the value of production, dialogue with thought, great performance or management. However, I suck this movie. I do not know why I do not like it ... I mean I want to get out of horror film: blood, anguish, humor unintentionally, etc. Accordingly, it should be my favorite. However, Zombi 3 baaad is a movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many things to cite on the screen. When the girl leaves the army when she leaves it (such as nothing to worry about). I see what I see as an abandoned hotel or something. Did not he see the center of the lake in the center of the building? Yes, he looks for water and passes through the lake. Why? People (there is no place where they do not leave the place) why they want to know why he answers: "Someone there?" Oh, this is just a small part of the big picture I am painting. <br /> <br /> There is a reason, however, why I gave this film more than one star. It's one of those movies, if you forget that you really know it, as I've done several times, you can see it again, in every aspect, because they are so much the same. In the first paragraph I called blood, but the film has no blood, it has a gore sea. He also has some rather bizarre creatures: a zombie baby (with adult hands) and a magical head called two magic. <br /> <br /> Do you know when you try to make the worst film ever made and lie down and you're dating science-fiction movies in the 50s? I think Zombi 3 and such films must be overcome. It has all the elements: arguing the government of the scientists, warning the apocalypse on the radio, the army fighting monsters, etc. This is the 80s Plan! I will not say if you want to buy money, but expect the worst. And when the worst is underestimated by Zombis 3, it will not be so bad. Maybe you would really like it, I do not say that's impossible. <br /> <br /> Do not think I hate this movie, not ... really. Oh, P.S. Rules for Killing Birds (aka Zombie 5)! (I just hit my credibility?)
