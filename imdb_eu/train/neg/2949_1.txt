Wow ... what would you do with $ 33 million? I want to pick you up; you can either) to chop or flush in the toilet or b) make a movie Whoopi Goldberg's premise, as a futuristic nutshell, combined with a rubber dinosaur "I did not throw it as a trumpet" and it's a fun joke. That's right, you would choose the option with more merits: toilet sinks. <br /> <br /> This is supposed to be seen. I can not find a word to describe this movie as bad. It is not included in the category "so bad - good". When I'm writing on TV, and I was watching, I felt the need to go to the IMDb and I'm scared. <br /> <br /> Considering the Jurassic Park a few years ago, how did the land. Do they think that the viewer would get a man dressed in a liver suit? WG has just walked and damn consequences. All worried people will look for money without money. <br /> <br /> I have to write to write - I want to reinstall it.
