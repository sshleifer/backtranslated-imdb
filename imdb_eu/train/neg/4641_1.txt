Sometimes I enjoy real movie piles ... people who occasionally create (albeit talented ones) come together with good intentions to create a movie and be disaster for any reason. "Killer Tomatoes Attack", "9 Space from Outer Space", "Manos-Fate of" and "Heavens Gate" movies, etc. <br /> <br /> So when I heard this movie, "Rachel's Attic" was that many people thought it was the worst film of the decade, of course I had to see it. <br /> <br /> Boy, I regret the decision. The movie is bad ... it's so bad that it's as nice as a bad movie. Action, shoot, script, etc. It is worse than a budget porn movie: the sound is totally horrible, "the plot" is completely incomprehensible, "acting" is drowning ... it's a total waste of everyone. time and money The movie porn has at least one porn to break monotony, this hilarious nightmare has a guy who has a rotten apple and a "champion" tea party. <br /> <br /> The lighting does not exist ... It probably happens that the "scene" of the world is half or full of darkness. "Writing Director" (forbidden terms used), David Tybor, tries to get kinky of bondage scenes ... but the results would be tremendous, if not so pathetic. Although I know there are a few, but it is so cheerful that it actually gets rid of sex. I would continue constantly and I did not correct all the defects and omissions of this film's waste. <br /> <br /> Avoid train rupture due to God's love. Although I know (maybe) my negative comments, maybe I'm still tempted to say that this trash is actually saying it or not, but trust me ... that's it. Much worse than I said, and totally, you will be glad to experience (and spending if you lose your money in a purchase or lease).
