Although I've recently listed my 10 worst films, I have to say that Burt Reynolds is no worse than "Anything in the Maddening" or any of the "Look Who's Talking" movies. However, it's quite confusing, as well as Drew Barrymore sexy, performing Holly Golightly's horror movies, not to return to New York to Los Angeles, but knowing that he has captured the killer's appearance. Sally Kellerman inadequate, a superb actress in the 70s, is a contributor, and Barrymore is the star of George Newbern, the worst actor in the sitcom, laughing at each line. The photo is dirt, but the show is Drew's bloody shower, though the psyche identity (although it's "Scooby Doo") is interesting. But in terms of the end ... real! Who should cleanse the mess? * ****
