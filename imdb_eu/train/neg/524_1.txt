"The 40 Year Old Virgin" I do not understand in a world. An electronics retailer can tell his boss "f off off" and he will send videos to his nude during his store and he will not be bothered. A world where it's really fun to drive drinking and to break the cars of other peoples. A world where there seems to be a world of sexual harassment of its leaders. A world full of horrible and abusive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without a joke! I really was totally shocked by the choir of the audience who liked the movie. I thought every scene was like a bad sunday live sketch - at first it was not very fun and it spread beyond all rational thoughts. The scene with wax on the chest LIVES AWAY. <br /> <br /> With the Carell, the characters were very unconscious. And the romantic elements were completely invented, especially Keener finds in the book of porn in Carell's apartment. That was just there. <br /> <br /> And I found the "Aquarius" sequence completely annoying and overwhelming. I hate my hatred of this movie!
