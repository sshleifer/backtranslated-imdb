We all know that some of the greatest movies of all time are based on books. Although they were not particularly precise, these films were excellent films. Excellent examples are the Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and, to a lesser extent, almost every Disney movie. However, I regret that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those films. She does not only meet the basic expectations of Madeleine L'Engle, but she manages scripting, acting, special effects, and ultimately respecting audiences. Note that I did not mean to be; on the contrary, I took this relationship with open mind. I did that, T-T.5. The film would be in his script without a trace. In the end, the Ewoks of Star Wars was an honest spin-off, if it's a bit stupid. Come to think, the original Star Wars "lunch money budget" was made and look where George Lucas took it! However, from the first scene, the desperation surrounds me, as I was getting close to the Black Thing. <br /> <br /> Greedo also became a symbol of the special edition of Star Wars in 1997 (that is, the catastrophe of disasters that has made some dramatic changes to a shameless director), Ms Whatsit has officially. Become a personal mixer for confusion over time. The reason for this is that it has changed its credibility. Alfre Woodard (Star Trek: First Contact and Radio), aside from the controversial decision about being our favorite star guardian, filmmakers decided to present themselves as a crazy actress. It's true, a crow. Moreover, the heavenly figure of the dearly beloved nature has been shaped like being a boy of eight. An elegant midfielder, riding on half wings, turned his head into a horrible human, with a dreadful smile, and mounted a black horse's arm that twists it in his middle leg. If they were five years old, he would be psychologically traumatized for the rest of his life. When the worst portion was spoken, the backboard was shown to prevent lip sync, to look at the back of his head and see the single and mobile cheek, thus rendering it. special effects piece less than incredible ET <br /> <br /> After getting the most painful part on the road, I have to go tearful: characters, actors and story. Personally, Meg had a similar look to my Harry Potter movie, Myringle: a hairstyle, glasses, and most of the supermodels would like the image. It was always a bit anxious, humorous hidden genius of math, just could not care less about Nicaragua's imports and exports. The knowledge of the film is unpleasant for all those who do not have any sympathy. Actually, Jenkins, the director of his school, feels the misfortune to face his husband's wife. Calvin, a young intelligent young boy, has become a jock! Irony is horrible In regards to Happy Medium, he was glad to look at it and liked being an elderly woman who liked being "over the genus" and liked to see things "fun", like rocking girls. Only three people who can think of a good job are Charles Wallace, Whatsit ands and the Man With Red Eyes (known as "Dude With Red Eyes", because it is a complete re-character as a character). <br /> </ p> The story is wrong. A good part of the film is compared to Harry Potter and Azkaban prisoners; That does not restore the book's story, but maintains the only original work. Here, the only book is to have a nice chat at the bottom of Hades, apparently not knowing how to destroy his body. The Dark Lord is complementary as a complement to what he feels and does not see the truth, the Ixchele flat nose-wookie (Aunt Beast replaces the superb creatures that hold their height) have torn their spine. As the God of the dead realizes that it is as subtle as the horror of the earth like Camaro, the broken pages are scattered in sandstorms and they are lost in the darkness of the evil earth. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that this movie exists. I do not think the actors were really bad. It's a way of writing characters. Lawrence Kasdan, from George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, deserved to adapt to Wreckle in Time, led by John Williams, Industrial Light and Magic, released on Skywalker Sound, THX and Twentieth Century Fox. In the current state of affairs, the film is not honored to be self-respecting. Even Madeleine L'Engle was bad. The book is good, it was a bad movie, and Ms. Whatsit was Ugly. <br /> <br /> Score: 0.1 / 10 (If possible) <br /> <br /> <br /> <: br /> Names are correct. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oh, and the main cover / poster has a picture of three main characters riding on a horse on a castle. We can say that it symbolizes high-flying adventures. What I did not care about Photoshop Meg's arm was symbolically responsible for a superficial artist.
