A fictional movie (based on a story, even though it has a "documented" credit) to try to find a Bigfoot team of scientists who have entered Canadian savages (they want to catch one and then follow it). device). Its huge science jumbo mumbo mixes in a strange movie of a series of people who walk through the desert. There are some attempts to create tensions and fears, but to be absolutely honest there is nothing beyond the great looks of savage waltz here. This is a perfect definition of an exploitation film, much more promising you, a look at Bigfoot, but it's very little in reality. It is recommended only for insomnia
