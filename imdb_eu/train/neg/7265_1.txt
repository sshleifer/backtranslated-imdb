At the Chicago Film Festival, watch this: Avoid at all costs, unless you are sleeping. It's a movie full of hope. "Hiroshima mon amour's" opens with a small budget and is down there. Camera Work - Imagine your child trying to imitate Wim Kar Wai. Story line - Smokey Robinson and Miracles' "The Mirage in You Mirage in You was Just a Mirage", spread over 3 minutes over 2 hours but full of repetitions. This film, for the film's pain grief, when my parents dragged me, my parents drag me to the Methodist University Banks. I can return 2+ hours of my life. The promoter of Julian Hernandez has faced the opposite of the movie "controversial" only for the narcotic effects of the film.
