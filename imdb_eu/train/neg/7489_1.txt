The American war and Nazi film can not be good. They can not become idiots and keep up the agenda. All the Nazis are bad, crazy, very proud and Americans are so humble and so capable and sensitive. Go ahead, stop this lie. The main character "tells us something similar to this trial, we must commit an aggressive war." America is a peaceful nation with a $ 1 billion dollar "defense" budget (# 2 China just $ 51b)? Is this just spent ... without ROI? Why figure out when America is not a peaceful nation? I do not want to persuade the films of the agenda, to cast art into hell and to believe something. Hollywood should put a label in cinemas, as the record label "parental advice". We should have "Bullshit advice", "propaganda advice" or "politically correct advice" in some films. This is one of them.
