I am so funny and miserable to say that this movie is so specific about Vietnam, and I'm not in any way. This movie is true about the whole Vietnam War, when Rodney King is beating about all police officers. Yes, they have been doing (and done) bad things, but generally people are like you and me. They have no morals, they do not kill machines, they do not do medication. Atrocities Vietnam were the exception, not rule. They did less than they believed in "hype". Oliver Stone makes films in Vietnam that are considered as odious blood, but based on Star Wars. If you sincerely believe in the Vietnam stereotypes, do yourself a side and learn the truth. Reality: Viet Cong and NVA made worse things for US forces than ever for South Vietnamese soldiers. Event: Soldiers of the Second World War were treated much worse by Vietnamese soldiers, and they welcomed themselves when they came home. The Americans who have served in this country of Vietnam deserve our respect; Although the war was fiercely opposed to a political point of view, no one could ask our soldiers more, and it is very sad to say that this fiction is "mostly true" that things were really up to date.
