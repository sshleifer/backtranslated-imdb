A horror look different. The aesthetic difference between American and Russian films is interesting. However, from my point of view, the American movie was not so good. An inspirational character by Marie Anastasia Hille, and I was hard to identify with her. It was mostly unpleasant and confused that there was little time. It was too much time to move it to the main location of the movie. Then a long time passed before a real suspense. When that happened, the volume seemed to be the main effect of being a bit more annoying. The concept was more original than most live-video movies and did not use sex to get a thin plot. I would recommend renting it all but not for playwrights.
