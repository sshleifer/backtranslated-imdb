This movie is a huge load. Paul Schrader is totally lost in his own script. And correcting is very comatose, as it does not have to go through the process during the night. <br /> <br /> Woody Harrelson is also the worst, just like I like. "The walker" plays a homosexual man of the D.C. who acts as an assiduous boredom supporter of Washington's elite wife. He could not have had one more dimension cut from a magazine and he rebounds against the camera in a suit. Its "southern accent" is the "recovery" of the end of each start and end line, with southern heat and humidity continuing to absorb all of the energy ounces. It's monotonous. But it's not the worst accent of the movie. Moritz Bleibtreau tells a "boyfriend" that strikes a mid-eastern accent, very clumsy, with scarcely written bad lines. It is impossible to throw his own rolls, even if he is a real German man and speaks in several languages ​​- one of them is Italian! Is that good reason to think that someone does not think it? <br /> <br /> Story, script, direction, camera work, challenge plays, this movie is wrong at the end of the film. The only sustainable moments in this film were three collaborators: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only three of them achieved this film through the dignity of their will. In fact, they are three great, although they are very trapped in a bad movie. Unfortunately, nobody can ever have enough errors to get out of trouble. If you like these three actors, watch something else. This movie is not worth your time.
