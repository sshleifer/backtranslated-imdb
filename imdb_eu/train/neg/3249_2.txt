Today, Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most entertaining films. His hypothetical spontaneity and his rubbery face can be crazy and we love it for that. He is capable of doing malicious comedies (or Ace Ventura) and he will turn them into decent comedy. Or, in the case of "False Lie", they will turn into some of the most ridiculous comedies. Carrey has also shown that he is capable of dealing with the drama. It's been excellent at "Man on the Moon" and "The Truman Show". The guy is obvious. <br /> <br /> Then, the 'Bruce Almighty,' Carrey's ideal vehicle comes with the premise to work; Carrey, after complaining about God and delivering his life, is enabled by God's powers. However, the script is a recycled junk. Now, despite a bad script, Carrey's improvisation sometimes only makes a brilliant scene. The problem is that Carrey has a lot of opportunities to go out with a large part of that comedy, which is just some fun. Carrey can rarely be improvised because it works on special effects. The writers apparently thought that the special effects and all the superpowers' sequences were fun, because they only had to fill the rest of the movies with Carrey, besides strangers with no humor. It seems like our annual attention is like a 5-year-old who wants to try to make the audience look fun when it's really annoying. <br /> <br /> I always liked the 'Friends' of Jennifer Aniston and the great Good Girl was last year. It also has a gift for comedy, but as the script is just as straightforward, it is only part of the bitter girlfriend. Agudo, grumpy, and there is no chemistry between the two stars. <br /> <br /> 'Bruce Almighty' would be a comedy. But he is not daring to deal with the subject that is having fun; religion Some small jokes (his internet is Yehweh), but superpower has become a comedy comedy. Occasionally, the unbalanced and generous shades and black comedy vary. The movie almost fails at all levels. That's not all that laughing, but it's close. Laughter is a problem with any movie that feels the need to enter the scene of a dog. But if you find pee jokes fun, go there. <br /> <br />
