It's just a matter of violence. <br /> <br /> The movie goes from scene to scene, and almost everywhere is violence. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not surprised by violence. And there's something missing for me without having a movie. But, please, not one after another. My reaction was not a blow or a fear: "Here we will go again." The story is like the scene of violence, but it was completely turned off by two-thirds of the movie, and I could not wait for the end. <br /> <br /> If this is what the filmmakers can do best, they should find another life like miserable life, making shoes or sending mail.
