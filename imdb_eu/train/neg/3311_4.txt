Saving Grace is surely one of the main competitors for 'How to Ruin A Adjustable Film for a Minutes' last minute' award. Of course, if you mix the curious little corners - largely those who live by the good people retired - with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of dizziness will be created. However, the last seven minutes of the film will be played out completely and it is not, in itself, fun. It's really shameful that this comedy can be as good as Waking Ned Devine 1998, trying to portray a weird little town and its weird realities in a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace's middle-class protagonist, Grace Trevethyn is the widest widow, and her husband's bad debt has driven him into a nonconventional way of earning money. With the help of the gardener Matthew, the expertise of the orchard has gained marijuana crops. Unfortunately, as a result, he is fighting a local police, a husband's creditor and a baroque French drug. . . . . . . . . . All of them heat the greenhouse effect at the same time. The relationship between Grace and Matthew is well depicted, and Brenda Blethyn is emotionally involved with her pleasant character - what you really feel is what you feel. <br /> <br /> Throw the little roles. It is excellent, although some of them are incredibly jewels. However, transforming the interest in the romantic interest of Mr. Jacques de Grace is very unlikely and does not fit the tone of the movie. And, surely, hydroponics is not so revolutionary in the world of cannabis? Unfortunately, the movie shatters humor with slapstick and ends up as fake as marijuana plants.
