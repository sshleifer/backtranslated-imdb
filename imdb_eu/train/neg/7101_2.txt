I would give this film out of ten, but I'll give you two. Reason One appears in Shah Rukh Khan, which is not really a reason. The last point is Rani, who plays with Kamal. I Love Rani is a great and respectful actress. That's why I did not enjoy kissing Kamal in this movie, but it's not so much. In any case, this film has been dramatically made in the room, so the scene is enough to talk about this film. Is it good or bad, I think its a completely dirty movie. As well as being a fantasy critique, you can see my other 250+ reviews by clicking on my name, I'm very pleased. The movie is not a funny thing and if deep films are hard pressed, why is not there a moral in this movie. The tendency of his films is not a real story and a whore. When I see these actors of Kamal, I get sick. However, Man can not kiss.
