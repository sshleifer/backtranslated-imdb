You've probably heard this phrase in this movie? "Herbie: Shit totally loaded" and yes it's true. This movie is very scary and completely mud. <br /> <br /> This has been the worst movie ever since Lindsey has ever been the Queen of the Teenager Expressions' Confession. The good thing about this movie seems to be one million times better than the movie, that talented cast and the movie is the only point of sale. I do not know how a respected actress like Matt Dillon could be part of this movie, is not it read before that great screenplay he signed? <br /> <br /> I did not like it about this movie, Herbie is surreal and fantastic, as well as wall-climbing skills and faster cars than Beatle. I know it's a kids movie, but they've been on board with them and it's fun to be more entertaining than them. There is little realism and the story is predictable. <br /> <br /> Last words: Unless 5 to 12 years old have children, I definitely can not enjoy any nonsense. Losing my money I'm scammed. Rating: 3/10 (Rating: F)
