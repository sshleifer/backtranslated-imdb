An undergraduate student who is cleaning a disabled room is backed up by an ill-fated killer. <br /> <br /> The bag of blood poured (Pranks) is a confusing bag for slasher enthusiasts. Film production values ​​are relatively low and the story is quite a routine, even a terrifying even in the red sardine. In fact, the construction of the story will be forgotten much, except for one or two exceptions. But the movie is better by stimulating its highest point (in the atmosphere) and a rather courageous and unconventional conclusion. <br /> <br /> Throw is the most missing. Stephen Sachs is the best best time to do with a pretty little character. Also, look at a young man as Daphne Zuniga misunderstood. <br /> <br /> That's all standard B slasher is quite a bit of an effort, but it's worth the effort to taste the end and keep this viewer from being a movie from a full ho-hum. <br /> <br /> ** outside ****
