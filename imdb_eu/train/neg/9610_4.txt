In Hollywood, 1930s and 1940s, I believe that it can be done in westerns, except Warner bros. For several times, it's always ridiculous (perhaps because they did not kill their boots, that is, it's a mountain range). I read Humphrey Bogart, seeing James Cagney in the head with this hat-hat cowboy hat. It looks like a mushroom. True Cagney and Bogart are very popular in the 20th century. Century is also credible in Western films. Here the story was not surprising, and he did not help. Every 10 minutes, I think that Bogart and Cagney can see small guns and put them in their hands in a gun in their 1930s black car.
