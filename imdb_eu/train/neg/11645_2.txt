This is a review of 'Freddy Mercury The Untold Story', a playbook, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 The most trusted, inspirational and most boring biographical document I have ever seen. If I watched the film in the movie theater originally broadcast on television, I would ask his producers and distributors that paying audience did not mislead the false promise that is worthy of a movie document. As a documentary for television, talkative pianists interviewed in front of the hotel rooms and a rich and literary narrative say more Infomercial for tasting experiments. "The Untold Story of Freddy Mercury" - or, uhm, "The Princess of Untold Princess Diana" are excluded from the concert, video and original television images. An eye witness interview, for example: "It was a free spirit" (actually .. I thought it was a man from Freddy Mercury). Brian witnessed the testimonies of Brian and Montserrat Caballe. and a clear love in the life and complex nature of Mercury. And ... what about Harry Potter barnet's segments? How did she get the interview with her first girlfriend ("who currently works in a travel agency") and Freddy's first team of school members are helping with what I want to know about Mercury? The main landmarks of his life, his sexuality, his artistic style and growth, Queen, are still unexplored. These filmmakers do not offer a single provocative question, nor do they work independently or visually with their subject, offering clear and unequivocally negative comments about an enigmatic and fascinating story about the rock. This biography of History Channel reminds you that your grandparents can try a Sunday night.
