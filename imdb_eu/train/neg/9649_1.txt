Who did they play with? It was too difficult to digest directly into this movie. Arjun (Ajay Devgan), when his father arrives to London with his uncle (who plays Om Puri) wants to leave only a minute later. The only problem of this theory is that knowing anyone who has gone through London Heathrow would be impossible for such a party and, above all, not an Indian. But the problems of the film do not end there. There are two major issues (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan), passing as a rock star to make their dreams come true. Yes, we found out that we had come to the conclusion that Susan Boyle (a UK woman who has dreamed about 50 years ago) was a rare occurrence. It was very difficult for me to suspend my credibility, because I felt that the question of Salman and Ajay was misguided. They never played the role of Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi in ​​their roles, so why should we force them to see Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men, men of the 40s), when they try to hang over for 20 years? Talk about the current self-conscious actress on screen, Asin. This is his second movie (which I have seen) and is as empty as the actor, so he is conscious that his gaze only worries that he looks good and that the voguing camera has a good performance. It is hard to believe that the other movie has been silenced by all of these roles, so it could be as penetrating as the actress, not writing at home. And to overcome all this, movies are bored by the movie. There is nothing special about it, believe me to announce every topic that will happen there.
