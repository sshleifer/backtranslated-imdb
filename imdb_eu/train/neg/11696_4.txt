I started to see this movie with little hope, I realized that it was the adaptation of S.K. novel (I never read the novel). <br /> <br /> I'm glad that my expectations were small because the movie was not very close to each other, but it is interesting to you. This story really drags the work done by the director and actors. It's a long movie, it does not have "nice" shots and it's not scary; Mute conversations and special effects are empty. <br /> <br /> The only thing good, as I said, keeps you up. I'm interested (I think the book should be good) without using a lot of horror news. <br /> <br /> My Vote 4/10.
