Considering the limits of this movie (a whole movie in a setting - a music study - about 5 or 6 total actors) would be much better. If you have these limitations for a movie, how could the lighting be so bad? The actors were terrifying, the secretary who talked about the hair under the writers, except for a nice movie, this did not have any substance. Well tried, but it really fails. <br /> <br /> He tries to be a self-referent in two parts, but the actor has so badly delivered the actors, it was a bad thing. And the main character Neal is calm, what a pathological looser. It's clear that 10 people have made this film and they all knew, and surely they were a real rock band, but sadly, people really do not know what's going on in the horror. It was made in 2005, but all have not looked bad, but the time of the pre-grunge era. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I did not see it (Starz on Demand again), but it was under. The title "The Possessed" is not Studio 666, no matter what you do the title, it can not help that. Much better could this film be done. There is no excuse for the bad film, when the film director made the film makers, they can work, monitor and do so within these limits. You can work the best you can. Instead, mere thoughts would be enough. And music video, that was a bad thing, I was quickened by that. <br /> <br /> So 2/10 is correct, if you enter the b-movie basket, you will see this and you will see it.
