I do not know about yours, but I like Tom and Jerry cartoons, it's interaction between the two characters (often violent). The mouse in Manhattan sees Tom leaving behind Jerry as an adventure in New York, and, in my opinion, it's definitely damaging! <br /> <br /> That's just as magical as Jerry's research could be for other fans of T & J's' Big Apple's comments on the IMDb. I could not wait to wait until the end of this illumination to see the next drawing on my DVD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> on top
