The superhero films are quite sucked and there is no exception. His only rewarding value was the path to the Road movie. On this movie I would put 'Batman & Robin' and 'Steel', so it's bad ... <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a black superhero, check out 'Blankman' not a "serious" superhero but at least entertaining movie da.
