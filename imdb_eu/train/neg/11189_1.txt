Always enjoy great films and great films that explore the deep thoughts of the spiritual world. However, this film has turned me off with regard to its production and direction. There is no deep debate about what this story is about; I can tell you all the time and effort to put on the big screen. Mark Addy, the actors Thomas Garrett gave a great performance in England, and we watched it in "Still Standing". Heath Ledger played a real wicked and we recently saw "Brokeback Mountain", 05, a great contributor. Shannyn Sossaman, (Mara Sinclair), worked hard to make a priest seductive to a church that does not have any belief. Do not waste your time, you will forgive!
