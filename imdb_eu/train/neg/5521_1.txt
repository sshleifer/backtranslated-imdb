I came to see this movie and I wanted to see what other people thought. No doubt, I ask everyone who asks me to see the same film! This is potentially very good, but the trademark fails. The script is very weak: the plot has so many holes, it will get a great grid of fishing areas. The characters were not well developed and I asked so many stories to jump "How do we get there?" At least half a dozen films. <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry among chemical members. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's plays. It was clear that everyone showed up and did the job, but they did not commit to their duties. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie ... go for a walk, play a table, take a warm bath and save money, something worthwhile!
