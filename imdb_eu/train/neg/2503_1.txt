What a bad excuse to do with the New Zealnd Movie. I am afraid of being called the New Zelandrian when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite television (August 2006). The throw consists of a large number of local soap stars. The ship is an island island that travels between the two islands, as well as the company's logo (a dolphin), including the ship's embassy. The boat will be a cruise / ferry cruise between the US and Mexico. The rust and aging signs throughout the place are evident, but it is first considered a luxury boat trip. A scene depicts a snow-covered snow in the South of New Zealand on the back for God's sake! It's been very cold in the US / Mexico area! The story is weak, the performance is weaker, and New Zealand / American accents do not work. Specifically, New Zealand taxpayers helped me with the cost of production of that film and lost money, spent on actual production. I know the children of New Zealand's secondary school, who can make better movies through mobile movies. Goof: holding a truck holding onto it, and they put a Taco Company signal at the door of the truck, which was supposedly American to look like. However, some signs are at the top of the label; Do you think this would have been realized before adding it to the props section. I'd like to continue, but I'm not worth any trouble.
