I love this movie, I accept it. The video I watched (live) has to be the best movie. Well ... I and my friend decided that we could only rent out this movie. We found out what we expected and we achieved, and we were expecting more, and more. When the red collar hits Sasquatch with the tree, we've seen that part of it three or four times literally, it was amazing (historically, of course). And why? Oh, why should the main character get out? As honestly, we know that you are in danger, much harder will not help. But really, this movie is in the local video store RENT IT. It's worth the money and not bad, it's bad, but not very bad. Overall, it will be amazing if you rent this movie for yourself.
