Have you ever watched a feature film? No Not even me Well, I finally saw "Spring in my Hometown", and I must admit, now I know why people do not do this. The technique is "art", to be sure, but definitely not suitable public consumption. The technique is very faulty because the spectator does not have emotional connection with the character, and perhaps it may be the director's whole intention. I do not know, I do not read the minds, and I definitely do not know that the director is enough to make a trial. <br /> <br /> But this movie is incredibly obvious as its ridiculous. American feelings As an American, I know a lot about the participation of the Korean War in my country, and I know very well that we were not always angels, but I am damned if I take this thing. it happened According to this stupid blind, the Americans were not just the roots of the war, we were war, and almost the only one we destroyed the country. Whatever, Mister Director. And I still think that we were still doing this movie if we had not interfered in the COMPISTING IN KOREA, right? Talk to your story to forget it. That is, it's almost like the Nazis "become good men", making the allies "bad". This movie is historically naive and is so inaccurate, it's almost awful. The interference of America to a country corresponding to a country that comes from a country owed, will surely appear.
