I was always keen on the dramas of the past, the art of the BBC in the past. "Byron" was an unbelievable presentation. Incredibly bad! The script was horrible, dramatic, and all the characters were terribly bad. Byron seems to have said he was "a bad and dangerous," and the female's heart was shocking. Not in this production. He appeared instead of the fierce female hero who appeared as small squid and the Greek fight for independence. He was saying by Byron. This portrait of man was completely limited. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something to see for two and a half hours. It's not a splutter, nor a splint. From the beginning to the end, from the beginning to the end, it was not so boring. <br /> <br /> Nobody has the opinion of Avon Bardea ever better, I think that Byron's poetry is overloaded and my head should be thrown into the back tray, and this performance of his life should be given with the same treatment. <br /> <br /> I think this BBC has lost our loser
