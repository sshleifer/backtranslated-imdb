A scientist and his friends are driving while driving a vehicle crash. She fled freely but cuts herself. It saves itself, it takes it to its home and keeps it alive (!!!). He then transforms his heads into the perfect body and strippers. He starts talking to his assistant wizard and ties up telepathic (or telepathic) with a deformed monster that stays in the wardrobe. but I had some kind of love. When I grew up at the end of the 1970s, local TV shows I watched 20 times a year (without excess). Saturday afternoon, they always showed on TV. Watching on TV was good! Explicit blood and gore, along with a huge monster and strong sex - who knew? Now when I see you, I realize what this is so honest. <br /> <br /> Efficiency is wonderful, production values ​​do not exist, the script is quite muted and (still as boring as it's boring) this is a sad thing. . In addition, there is a gentle conflict between two women and the end of the monster. Add the end of the loose tone. On the one hand, an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation movie. On the other hand, the trash. In any case, it's not a good movie, but it's essential for fans and fans (<br/> <br /> <br /> Also, they're a huge laugh on the head. Note that the final credits that get the wrong TITLE (" You would not die! ")!
