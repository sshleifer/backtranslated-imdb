Zombie rebellion is BAD. There's not something distant about the movie. Boring, alive, misunderstood and not the script. I have often complained that the original Drakula is a bit slow to taste and this movie is like the Dracula roller coaster ride. The 65 minute duration seemed 165 minutes. <br /> <br /> Story: A Cambodia expedition will be sent to find secrets to control the "zoning" account. A man finds a secret and uses a woman who loves to marry him. In this case, the zombies release their tremendous effects under control. That's it. That's the whole story. <br /> <br /> Most of the films I was trying to find out I saw the male lead. He knew so well. I had to think a lot of time. There was nothing wrong with the movie. Before the rebellion "zombies" he knocked at me. Dean was Jagger. I recently had Christmas. So, in most of the movies I am "entertained" myself. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that this DVD did not buy this DVD. King of the Zombies is on the other side and is the movie masterpiece of the movie. What I deserve, I'll give it 2/10. (I can not go to 1/10, because I believe or not, I've seen worse).
