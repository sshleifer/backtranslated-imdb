Actually, I saw this piece with the expectations with very low NUMBER. Dieter Bohlen is a non-talented composer, whose talent is only surpassing his talent. <br /> <br /> This was the first time the cartoon movie, 100 percent humor was free. The woman is rude, injurious, innocent and incredibly anti-woman. So it's a creation that matches Bohlen, but the average audience does not allow it. It is not surprising that he had ever appeared in the theater of cinema: he would have blasted a great time! <br /> <br /> It did not even save 6.5 MegaEuros costs. Save your time ... and money!
