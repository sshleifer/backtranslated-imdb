Film is horrible, and a single scene does not have a real emotional ounce. The character is not silent, clearly drawn, predictable, and the story line is obvious and fulfilling Hollywood's desire. <br /> <br /> William Holden (to see him so sad in this role) at the age of 55 did this movie, but at the beginning of the 40s he seems to be someone who seems to be in the 60s. Kay Lenz was 20 years old and recorded it, she thought it was attractive. In my opinion, I found dogs more courageous and more life-like than erotic life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The character of Holden - Clint Eastwood- When he was the same age he directed this film (not) by chance - in the 60s, hippie cool trappings are clear: bachelor, swing, hi-fi, Yamashiro lunches. But the movie is ridiculously uncool, with a sharp despair of old smilies, desperately, free spirits that have seen Sunset and Laurel Canyon, and they would find 'sexy cars' with them. <br /> <br /> Beautifully. The culture of youth was never desperate. And I was afraid that Bill Holden was so disappointed that he was taking this shame for the youth.
