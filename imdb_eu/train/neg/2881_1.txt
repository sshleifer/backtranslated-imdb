The movie was so ridiculous, even though I never saw it, I actually thought someone had made their own version and had DVD duplicator in the store. I felt this movie bad, but I lost 50 per cent !!!! My brother and I went into the house, we made the look and film ourselves and edited the snipe's photos! I'm so ticked off, even though the BTK Killer is worth more credit, though it was not accurate to come up with the beef head I'd say, of course, play play or BUBBLE GUM OMG, even though I did not get all the words out to explain DO DO NOT HIDE ON THIS VIDEO !!!!!!!
