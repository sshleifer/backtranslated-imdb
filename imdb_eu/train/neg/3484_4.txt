I remember what happened in the theaters, saying it was a terrific review. Well, I did not think it was bad. It was fun and it was a humorous holiday for families. <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck is a wealthy family who loves Christmas, to please the girlfriend. He grew up to visit the house and rent a local Christmas family. I liked the scene of attorney who signed a contract. It was fun <br /> <br /> So he makes the family's absurd requests and even writes the scripts to read. He has a hot daughter with family, love of interest. And the end of the holiday is not so bad. <br /> <br /> In addition, the whole doo-dah action was very fun, especially when they represented a black first and the girlfriend's parents did not do it. even more to say anything. And parts of what Doo Dah gives to his "alleged daughter" blows. FINAL EQUALITY: I thought it worth to put the cord in it.
