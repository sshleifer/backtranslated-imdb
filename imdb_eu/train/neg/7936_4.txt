Still, it's just another video clip for a group of individual intelligents, on the travel route that begins with its original journey, or, in this case, a show that falls on its side. The results, as expected, are not good, because this particular party was arrested by investigated prisoners who were fleeing from the previous years. Father, who seems to be professionally a photographer, only has to take the place and take photographs, to find a way to live. Several members of the family allow you to enjoy a lot of entertainment, just to get out of fear. Thinking about how they made their way safely, the van tires burst (impressed!). When you are looking for a refuge and a lodging in a small town, that is, the highlight (surprise!) Is living. br /> This movie is played as expected, which is fought and killed by the family. They are fighting for families, but they are probably among the worst scenes in the movie, because they are badly executed. Here there is nothing remote from the original, if you do not count the soundtrack that is totally inadequate in a scene that totally ruins the atmosphere and atmosphere of the film. The play has seen all the time worse, all the people involved (it's pretty bad in your cast as Camp de San Martingo cast says). The special effects are evil and the end wants to punch my TV. <br /> <br /> Still, despite all the negatives, I liked the movies a bit. Without a doubt, "it's so bad, it's good," I made the whole movie and it was even fun. I was entertained, surprising plot, awesome performance, and special effects, even though I was disappointed and annoyed by the end, especially no movies It's a wonderful beginning and the whole movie is nonsense. <br /> <br /> The bottom line you can list many movies that you can see, you have seen this. However, most of these films are better, but not all waste, this movie is quite bad and not distant. <br /> <br /> My grade: D
