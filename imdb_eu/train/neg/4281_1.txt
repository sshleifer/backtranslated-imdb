This movie can be labeled as a case study. It's not just a cigarette-like lens that is called "caco-imagery". The author lives with sensation that social illnesses against genetic opinions and infants ("Moldavia is the poorest region in Europe", "I do not think it's a goofy bird flu," "robbed the people of Romania. They are poor, because European robbers are stolen") They get closer to a more arrogant moral and artistic attitude - but it is very receptive! <br /> <br /> Daneliuk does not know what it is, it's not enough to be a righteous person - you need a bit of professionalism, talent, and ingenuity to put this position into an artistic product. Fatefully, the "Foreign Legion" shows as intelligent a family video as the uncle Gogu confused himself in front of guests. The script is chaotic and incoherent, loudly absenting middle-school subjects, in an illiterate attempt to suggest a story. The director is pathetically amateur: the "director" can not create at least one stage on stage, his plans are misunderstood and storytelling shines completely absent. (Of course, any comment should be made to stop at that level, it would be absurd to mention "cinematographic", "expression path" or "style".) The positive effect is the "Cântarea României" level ..., exceptionally, paradoxically, Necula Raducanu, footballer naturally, and Nicodim Ungureanu, Oana Piecnita seems to be a real freshness, but the amateur instructions given by Daneliuk have compromised. <br /> <br /> The seriousness of this crime crime is that production has received a lot of funding. State budget, through CNC (Cinematography National Council.) The old dinosaurs who die for a long time like Danelius are still a thirsty governor of the market, in a market-based economy, would be eliminated immediately by natural selection, and believes in the criminal field that "generously generates money from the country, not for film or culture" jury's corruption corruption
