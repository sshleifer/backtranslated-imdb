The pokemon movie was a horrible movie. Unlike the first one, this is not a good movie. The graphics were decent, but the story was flat and there was no real drama about it. In the first case, the interaction between characters was decent. Brock's subtraction and stroke was a bad thing. Tracey really does not say or need, and unlike Brock, it's not a comic relief. The good point is to look at the fog, to make it more jealous than just ash, and to think at the beginning of its girlfriend it was very fun. In general, this movie is not worth the rental, and the short film my wife or my wife did not do anything. And we see pokemon fans.oh well, well, maybe the next would be better
