Sometimes the movie is so terribly terrifying that it has a devastating influence on morality. You really ask yourself, what does our society mean is that the standard is so low? Can we honestly expect that they may suffer from this topic and still be entertained? <br /> <br /> Of course, still the Hollywood axis is the main character GUN, the plot and the source of all. Conflicts and resolutions in movies. The character needs a gun. Gets the gun This can not be done because it has a gun. He takes the first gun down. OH MY GOD What will we do! It has a gun! It goes away, making real men more evil than ever. He encouraged someone on his face for 90 minutes, shouting for questions. The hallmark of any conception will be a comfortable sound. <br /> <br /> A real challenge is to work again so weakened and weakened by formulas; The movie must be very light and well-designed. This is not. It does not have any life or personality, and those components will be sucked. You feel about the time and space you make. Really, who needs that! So yes, I will say: maybe I think the worst movie I've ever seen. The soul murder should be publicly condemned to everyone who is responsible for making this dirty trash dirty.
