Ok, I know most people probably send this review to a classic "Watership Down" and a standard part of the majority of childhood, but to watch this movie for the first time at age 18, I must admit: I really hate it. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie because my sister read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people screamed about "Watership Down". children and their emotions shook the seams. Honestly, I had no problem. I gave him the benefit of doubt; In general, I do not like watching a movie. This was an exception. Actually, really, it was fast, it was wickedly sad. This movie was probably the slowest thing I ever saw (imagine it in dovectable caracol in space), and it's really not "done" for me. Art is fine; Except for good and bad origin, however, the rabbits did not look very cute and the animation was pretty salty and poorly produced. <br /> <br /> I will not give much detail. story; Basically, it's a story of a group of kidneys that leave kidneys because of the infiltration around humans. In general, the moralist of the perils related to human interactions uses the rabbits of the universe to penetrate the message. For me, I'd like to get a gas, not because I'm a terribly sad person, but because the characters were purely inspirational, annoying, sad, and generally quite rough (I'm so in English). I noticed that I was watching the clock constantly, and I needed about 20 minutes before it happened, and this was also a huge antigimax. <br /> <br /> If I have to admit that, in any case, I should admit that the risks to be addressed to children and human beings may be, in general, the sanemonium and the preacher, but the message trying to give it is a good thing. Music score is not bad either. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, this movie is pretty bad. I could not see it all the way, or I would surely have to eat my legs in boredom. The reason given is not a bad "momentum", but it still does not work for my eyes, so I gave it a 2/10 one.
