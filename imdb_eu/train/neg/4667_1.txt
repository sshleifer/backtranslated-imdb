Invisible cluttered, less plot, very mind-numbing junk. Also close to Greenaway's work. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> They are confusing the 'Overlay' effects, the film is very dark and the "artistic" composition of the images is extreme. . <br /> <br /> Nothing is recommended about this movie. Even more, nudity is very unerotic, seeing a large part of the film soon boring. <br /> <br /> In addition, someone can say that Ewen MacGregor's work is excellent, above me. He showed the Star Wars series of capabilities, which he says. <br /> <br /> I have not been surprised by a movie since I saw 'Darby O'Gill and Little People'!
