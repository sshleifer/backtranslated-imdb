The movie has two stories: it's a political murder of a call girl, the other is a senior political party. The cross point is the nature of public relations directed by Al Pacino, the witness of the crime and the instigator of the afternoon. <br /> <br /> The script, with no fussy drama and no fussy drama, is a memorable representation of Al: how many credible friends can be a powerful and horrific man (as "Grandpa") as a small servant (see " Donnie Brasco "too). <br> /> <br /> Actually, the old old lion has become old. The movement of these ages is very moving, because the viewer is doing medicine on the elderly. <br /> <br /> But its slowness is nothing more than a constitution because it can recover the church scene. </ B> <br /> It's good that the movie is so scary, because Al's talent has become a bright star!
