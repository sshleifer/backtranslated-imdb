Probably, by encouraging his much-loved "Orlando", Potter sends his vehicle in a bad way: he writes, writes, stars, and actually writes music, including a mawkish love song. Teenage girls like melodramatic obsessions and obsessions seem fascinate to a college or college project in adolescence. Potter is similar to the object of his romantic character, and the whole narrative narcissism that is covered as a tango celebration is a shame. Maybe if he did not throw himself in, he could work. It can not act, whether it's playing. Pretent, pretty, dull and stupid.
