I've never seen one of the worst movies. It was my only thought: "How can I get my money back from the Hollywood video?" This is not the way of four dollars or dollars. I think that Mexican film was an attempt to extract Vin Diesel's films, but this failed to fail. <br /> <br /> The effect was horrible, but the actors could not find something better with time. The story was ridiculous. The actors were calling ahead lines, it was predictable. The Mexican accent of the main woman was insulted, worse than a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Skip it.
