This movie is not worth the title of Omen. It is so bad that the classical nature of the first three types has been damaged. They should never change their title. <br /> <br /> They did not write Damien's Arantzaren NAME correctly. And there is no dagger, the most important feature of all Omen movies. Take them out of the shelves and burn them.
