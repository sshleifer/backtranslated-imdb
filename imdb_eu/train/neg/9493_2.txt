This playful movie features a standard "hippie mentality" in the 1970's and walks in the process of nuts. It is an attempt to rationalize the senseless marriage of old and innocent women with older and older offspring and cleaning. The na√Øve boy played by Waif-like (Kay Lenz) walks along with hippy and all the evil slept, and then one day he ridiculed (Holden), already aged, drunk hard drink and acted as an actress, and He decides with her that she is "love". If you think it's over, all the movies bring together scenes. He says that the number "loves" and only knows him and he is very quick and fast. I could not laugh at all the movie. It's obvious that he uses it as a meal card, but the manager does not think we'll love to buy it. The scene is boring where both are naked and sex. I had to hurry up because I almost dumped me. There is also a wide range of music from the 70's of the movie. If you can not avoid it. Grade D.
