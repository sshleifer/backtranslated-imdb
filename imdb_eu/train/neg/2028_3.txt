On the cover "Show Me The Money" would have to end a whole season. It was always entertaining as a host of William Shatner, surrounded by the beautiful dozen leggy models of "The Million Dollar Dancers" dancers. Participants of high-level knowledge were interesting stories about their life and the curiosities of pop culture that they knew. And you were great! So what happened? <br /> <br /> The format of this game was a failure. The good game show requires at least two things: simple rules, an exciting career and the ability to play at home with the viewer. The best and lasting are three. <br /> <br /> Sadly, SMTM has not been. <br /> <br /> The rules of this game were one of the most complex games of the first time in history. . Let's try how the game works, as briefly as possible. <br /> <br /> A competitor starts with a single word or a brief phrase, A, B, C eligible fonts (the smooth plug of the network?). ). Each letter was linked to another question, all started with that word or phrase. Once a competitor has chosen a letter, he or she could respond to that question or write one. If they passed, they saw the next question and they had the same chance. However, if they had passed the second question, they were asked to answer the third option. <br /> <br /> When they answered, and before realizing that they were correct, they had to select one of the 13 dancers. On stage, each one has a different amount of money on its own. They have shown the amount of money (from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000) and if the competitor responded well ... or if it responds incorrectly ... this amount will be added or withdrawn from his or her pile. <br /> <br /> Still so far with me? There was also a dancer named "Killer Card". If you selected Ballerina with Killer Card and you understood your question, you were safe and continued the game. However, if you were wrong, you should answer a final question. If you get this last question wrong, you were outside the game. Reasonable, the game continues. <br /> <br /> He did not leave, he did not earn money, until six questions were answered correctly, or six questions were wrong or you are hurdle to earn enough money to get away. Do i have Okay <br /> <br /> The main problem, as I have seen, was lacking in voltage due to the design of the game. A competitor could overcome questions that they did not know, and they answered a lot of questions they knew, even less pressure. Afterwards, they still could find a small amount of money, even though he was not aware of a question, there is still no "drama." And they were able to answer the five wrong questions and it was a great mistake to win yet. And it was a slow interval of questions: often the questions were so obvious, trying to create a ridiculous tension, as if it were a question of the most common. <br /> <br /> The pacing, at any time of the show, the actual lack of voltage and complex rules are not prevented from operating this program, though Shatner's talented terpsichore.
