In my life I have seen many great and incredible films. I'm not a professional reviewer, but I have to say something about it. First of all, I've seen the worst actors ... Their performance is so unrealistic that you want to throw it on the DVD in the first two minutes. I think the actors were not interested in quality. <br /> <br /> There is another awful thing about these conversations: they are not so tired. Sometimes you feel uncomfortable when you hear. It seems your 14-year-old son works better. I think this movie is similar to the cost of 14-year European cars ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
