When anyone enters a movie of these films, there is no need to say that a cancer of the head is an excessive amount of this medication, the suspension of credibility, generous. <br /> <br /> Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna / Brigitta, Nelson Eddy has not realized since the beginning of time, but also - an angel sent to Earth. <br /> <br /> I found that my reaction was silent. "Hunh?" Where did I see it before? It turns out, I've seen it before, but a movie much later than this. With an angel, the unforgettable drecktable staged in 1987, because Emmanuelle Beart did not have the eternal beauty of unmuted lines, she also wore their hair and gave life to the actor Michael Knight. At much worse angle, with low values ​​of the 80s, but surely an upgraded version of this 1942 turkey. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's not working, this is not a memorable movie and the door. Information Because MacDonalds and Eddy were the last time, they were very good actors but great singers, they had the "innocence" and "clean-cut" love that they had together. Then it's a cold shower, it's not here if the scenes are fiery but to get rid of memory.
