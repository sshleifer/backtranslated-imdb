This movie has given a good review of anyone who has related to its creation. This movie is suckfest painful. The play is hard, the soundtrack is not surprising, the direction is smooth and strange, the teachers are not really attractive (because the student's progress is more complicated). The dark creations that are behind the trash should be diverted and spread, such as unconcentrated contamination. I am sure that the famine in Africa may use some of the lost money in this project. In hell, the funds also saw an apparent intention to create an attack. At least someone would have a free time. The only reason that gave me a last illness I will give two films.
