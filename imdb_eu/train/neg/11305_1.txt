Western is very bad, especially because it is historically unknown. He lived in Jack Slade in California and seems to have fired on the back of Idaho, Colorado, and Montana where he lived. Everything that is known about this mysterious "evil man" is fictional. The script is horrible; There is little direction and bad performance. Dorothy Malone is totally useless with his wife. Mark Steven never seems to portray this mysterious Jack Slade. The superintendent of Jack Slade, a real life, was very good. He was afraid of local citizens because of the hard drinking. When he was drunk, he would start fighting and cause other problems in Virginia City, Montana. To make sure he was not afraid again, the watchmen Jack Lynd lynched his warning immediately after he left his town. This is a horrible movie. I can not recommend anyone to see this movie in other ways about how Hollywood wants to see it today.
