With that movie, Maysles Brothers reached a low point of human interaction. Keep in mind that you have used words like "masterpiece" in this movie, in reviewing this movie, Maysles's guys were guiding Hamptons and some strange people who filmed a strange movie. No, when they found these two poorest people, they had to finance their project (and money to what people imagined to sell the project). Then, two very difficult women joined. Here is no intelligence or real consensus. These nasty Maysle smiled and kissed their donkeys, as Beals did all they needed to cooperate and then exploit them. Someone would like to think from time to time thoughts and guilt. However, the pre-creation of the films, real filming and later editing took a long time, and their purpose was not to make human beings related. An exploitation movie by the weird people. Since time was being filmed, they fervently swore by what they did here. The nature of human beings is perfect. People will remember that. Grotesque
