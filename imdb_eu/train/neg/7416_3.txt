Fashion designer goes through a cat and falls into the pool, floating in the head with something stroking on her head. It was quite a matter of fact (it was a television movie) that came out of the body. It walks through the tunnel ring that falls into crisp orange, and black figures stick in its view (they look like a dummy in their apartment). I thought I was watching the Franco Franco movie while his friends revive a black arm from his wrist and struggled to get loose. When he is reborn, he remembers everything and has the neck of a bad skin. <br /> <br /> Soon afterwards, he hit a car that almost controlled him. Halloween decides to go on vacation with her boyfriend in Mexico. When he arrives, he is surprised that it is the day of the dead. The other American tourists that continue to follow continue angry and almost drowned. <br /> <br /> The designer is encouraged to join people who have experienced death experiences. All of the tunnels have lived, but they are not black or near to run away from death. One of them is very nervous. He also wants to get together with a psychic. <br /> <br /> A doctor tells him about the people who call him "Walkers" (this is the name of the novel that is the basis). They have died due to a cause that proves to have died as a result of another suspected cause. So they continued to die until they continued to die until they died again, but he managed to save the guilty. <br /> <br /> I saw that in a 102-minute video, and I felt very long. I can not imagine a 192-minute version! Perhaps two or more nights to watch on TV, it would be best to be sitting seated. <br /> <br /> I only read a novel by Joan Brandner, Floater, and if he has a significant part of his work, but he is not the original writer. Floater had a plain plot: the children gathered to kill people. Although the variation was quite common: the dead son killed and the people die a few years later as a vengeance outside the grave. And indeed, it has a similar point to this movie because it practices the astral projection of the child, and when it is drowned it escapes from the body as here. I do not know what the death penalty is between Walker. I understand that Howling films do not look much like that. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite slow, and it's caused by special effects and cinematography low budget (and supposed) bass. - TB deficiencies. There are many actors who easily identify the character. It is also dated, in the mid 1980s, from the beginning of 1989. It seemed boring. I do not think much better about the previous movie, Survivor (1983) (the inspiration for the final movie for 2000). It's out of darkness.
