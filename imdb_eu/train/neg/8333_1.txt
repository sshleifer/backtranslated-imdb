This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The play is bad and the story is almost incomprehensible. You do not like the lights or the likes of such ships. As far as special effects are concerned, it has no movie. The whole group of films were probably taken aback by the rough seaside studio, and some men "pillaged" (though they could even call) their reactions are completely unrealistic. Guns are more silent than a mute. Both prizes have a serious question as to how serious human condition is. Well thats about that. Reviewing this book is more fun than reading it. If anyone views or tells the purchase, I would strongly advise against it for clear reasons. I say a spoiler included. If some people are tight and the gun is firing, it's a plot. I think it's only good part of the movie.
