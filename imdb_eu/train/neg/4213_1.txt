Wow, I'm terrifying at the time of Henry VIII / Tudor ... and that's ... interesting. I only saw that it was Catalina de Arag√≥n. And wow ... just wow. I've seen a bad performance before, but this came to new heights. Did Catherine actress cry? shouts and shouts and I have to confirm many times many times ... often, often ... fun and fun. The only person who showed the little talent was Anne Boleyn (but I think she was a little obsessed with Anne Boleyn, she was a really wonderful woman, read it and deserve it!). ) Additionally, I've read a lot about Tudor's time and I think the characters are not very exhibited, all very stereotyped. See if the movie is only available for a very important time, and it has become a hilarious life for those involved.
