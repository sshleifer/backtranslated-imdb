It seemed like a good premise for a movie ... unfortunately it's not nearly every level. It is very difficult to continue at the beginning of the film, I actually saw that if the problem is intended to deactivate the main problem of vision, the camera's work is more than "arty" splicings and semi- so much. the whole movie that sublimates the film, which really goes away from the general story. He really tries to get immersed at that moment and get to the end of the end, but the film has thought so many people and does not create a good script. That's why it's just so loud that you've tried to peel it. .
