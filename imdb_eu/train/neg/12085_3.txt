This small review is not really necessary to start with a plot summary. Shakespeare's Hamlet is for the sake of the good? probably one of the most famous plays ever written. Am I not ashamed of how Hamilton's version of how most people on IMDb came? Through the Mystery Science Theater 3000 program. Although the show is not the best place to use to judge a movie, in this case I can not imagine trying to watch it without a comedy soul. In a nutshell, it's a dull version of the German version of Hamlet. 152 minutes? In no case! It's a shame and a disappointment, everything I want to spend almost three hours. I have said several times, but entertainment is the thing for me. And this bracelet is not entertaining. However, I'll give him a couple of points because of his good performance. 3/10 sounds right to me. <br /> <br /> As I enjoy MST3, their comments do not help make Hamlet more pleasurable. There are some Riff here and there, but in general Hamlet is a bad movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is too hard to be the rhythm or flow of the comedian. When I'm so glad I'll give Hamlet 1/5 my MST3K scaling scale.
