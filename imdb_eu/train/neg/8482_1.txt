Some of my old friends recommended me to watch this movie, but I just had a chance to get it. I expected something interesting from Kamal Hans. I saw a bunch of high speed garbage cameras. I could not understand what was the message except Hinduism demenge. I am very similar to many types of religion, but I thought Kamal Hasan was a low character. It could make a horror movie more than mere. He tried to add the genre of Hollywood viruses and would not allow the god to mutate this mutant and eventually go to world dependence. It's a movie that is much more suited to film schools than ordinary audiences. His talents are not held by himself. The beginning of the story Chaos asked them to borrow the ideas of the Butterfly effect, then the cost of insulting Hinduism was low in religious harmonics (again a hint of Hinduism, but this film is not the same and my insult may be a general religion - an intellectual film.)
