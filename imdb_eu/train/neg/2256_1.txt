I confess that I have seen five minutes in "Jerry Springer". I do not believe myself, but I think that my show is what it is. You should also try to climb upstairs. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie as part of a social studies event. This movie told me that Springer was very little, but instead focuses on the life of the "Springer" appearances. Better managed, this movie could be truly fascinating because people's lives are really pathetic. I confess, I felt empathy with Connie (Molly Hagan). That's all life. How sad it feels Jerry's show must continue to solve this. <br /> <br /> I really feel that Molly Hagan has appeared on this. Did you notice that this movie has fallen on TV's "B" roles? I'll tell her. She is a very beautiful and intelligent woman. Without a doubt, I do not doubt that he is very interested in acting, and tries to play roles with great empathy. The problem is that Hagan can not take the scene. Simply it does not have to do the main task. Her best work is Angel's "Herman's Head" (the show is not great, but the heart was in the right place) and she was invited to "Seinfeld" as her sister, Roberta.
