Having watched a video game about 8-cartoon Spider-Man 1994-1997, I realized why I could not burn it when I first came out. <br /> <br /> I'm an old school, where in 1967 Spider-man was the best cartoon and it still remains the best. (I will not go into an incredible psychedelic version. Give me traditional criminals.) <br /> <br /> It's wrong to play in new things, read a page without feeling or misunderstanding. Paul Soles, where are you now? The guy was the best at Spider-man's voice. No one approaches. Seeing Secret Wars made me a great idea for the cartoon series. Dr. Doom is like a comedy version by Bela Lugosi. With Red Skull and Doc Ock on a scene, Red Skull does not accentuate German, and Ock is Russian! Marvel's ancient comic hero series interpreted voices in 1966. Iron Man felt like he was wearing an iron mask, because Captain America was not authoritarian as a teenager. Paul was the only thing that was released as a thing of 60 years. The old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anybody like that. You heard Mel Blanc's son? He could not play his dad. <br /> <br /> Animation is rough. Well, therefore, they have all the fantasy shades of the character and have well-painted backs. Sometimes the movement seems less likely to say more movement. Sometimes, when the computer takes the movements, they are robotic. I really do not think any of these entertainers know what it is. <br /> <br /> Stories are poorly written and the lines that the heroes give me are horrible. Why, for example, do heroes get together for the first time when they start fighting together? The gratitude of Secret Wars was an excuse. I see that the dark, mysterious, and mysterious hero - like Punisher, but why Gauza and Iron Man can not keep their minds from each other, it's ridiculous, and then the Antorcha is introduced. The tendencies for a few seconds to get the heroes away from each other, because everyone wants to see these things. Better cause to fight and maybe disconnect, but "Hey what you do here" and "Do not know what to do" LAME is the reason. Another bad story is in The Wedding, where Harry Osborne hid himself. The whole scene was horrible. <br /> <br /> In the end, but not least, other critics call it Youth Violence - it does not mean any holes. In Secret Wars, Lizard was very careful about this. But Thing goes through the whole block of bad boys in comics. It's just a matter of lifting things up and getting rid of the bad guy by capturing cartoons. Of course, the cartoons were not made for adults, but under the age of 12. That is why they can not drill, because mommy and father do not believe in that violence. But you can beat these things, cartoons will be included. As a child I saw the political correctness before the fashion came when I saw the cartoon punching one another. What is a drilled chop? In the current world, there is less violence due to the drudge of today's black and heavy cartoon? Everything I see in the newest thing I find this insults. They wrote "Punch" because they could be hurt. <br /> <br /> For children, the cartoons you want to enjoy, I've seen enough. <br /> <br /> <br /> 3/10 score
