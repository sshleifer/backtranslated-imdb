I was happy to see a sitcom that would replace Indian Candian, but this show was not fun. Producers and casters will be happy because they get a good attitude and because they are talking about them. I am ready to make some stereotypes and I do not have problems because stereotypes exist for reasons, it is usually true. But there is nothing funny about these stereotypical characters. Fresh "boat", father who does not understand his daughter. A radical feminist Muslim daughter (incidentally, a great actor), and trying to make the youth of modern man politically correct the mosque (the actor is pretty good, I see it only better). </ B> <br /> <br /> It's very thought-out and the conversation does not open properly. something like that had a great potential but unfortunately I think it has failed, and I do not like seeing another section. <br /> <br /> However, I saw a great Canadian actor Sheila McCarthy again. Everything that looks natural and natural, in the show, the daughter does not have the same abilities!
