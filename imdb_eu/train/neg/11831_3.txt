I do not know how those animated movies are coming out and how people who love it (or bad). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two children (5.7). They like something similar to animation (like most people rated this movie). The theater was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its excellent work. Actually, I was bored. The preview was incredible, and it was plain. There were some rumors of Pareka in the whole movie and that was it. Of course, they repeatedly tried to get cheap, but they did not work. My son almost always tells me that the DVD after watching the animated film, but not about it. My daughter slept halfway. Kids also believed that character animation was curious. I have not heard from them, The Polar Express, because I saw my daughter's nightmares. <br /> <br /> Confess me, I'm not looking for everything negative. Quality is quality, and there is a lot of animated films.
