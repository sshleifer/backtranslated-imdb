I was in the rainy sun, I wanted to get into something else. Curiously, I went to the comments here and found myself in the end. I really do not want to do it - that is, one of these films "captivated" and "see other minutes", you just saw it. And it seemed to him that the discovery of the majority of these comments was fascinated. A person who really likes the comment is Ladd and his favorite Spano and his previous roles. But the great thing is not to find anywhere. The story, the performances, and especially the absurdity of the boldness. We all know that Perry Mason (before Raymond Burre exceeded 300 lbs) and Ben Matlock overtook courtesy around the court in a lectern. And Matlock is often given the privilege to enter exhibitions, to go to the jury and to show them, even if the magistrates and prosecutors have been informed or shown. He should not be a true judge or prosecutor. <br /> <br /> Perryk and Ben almost always ended the procedure by shaking the true murderer of the murderer. Actually, Perry has almost always done that, but often Matlock claims to be overwhelming proof of the guilty party, "racially uncertain," and then prosecuted police and prosecutors, sometimes in some cameras, sometimes supposedly. at the end of the show. <br /> <br /> But this said, in the story of Holland Taylor's history and number of advantages, Matlock / Mason's actions were very similar. A boring and often boring detail, such as Court TV and the actual courts. <br /> <br /> All the characters in this presentation did not suffer from any kind of ailment, not similar, boring, boring, improbable or a combination of two or more. of them. <br /> <br /> It was the endless mistake, nonsense, stupid, but it is wonderful. Ladd and Spano are attractive people and t.v. They would probably appear to be the best of the films, probably the best in the best (although probably better) "3" role in secondary schools, even in the headquarters. One of Taylor can be thrown as aunt or mother. Give this one a star for storytelling / performances, and for another 3 fascination factor.
