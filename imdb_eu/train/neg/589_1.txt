Honestly, I did not see the movie because of the actors, not the plot, but 17 was in Luxembourg, and the movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to access this category. Believe me, for being a terrific movie, I've seen a lot of brutal films throughout my life (Ichi Killer, Ireversible, Hellraiser), but this movie has been the worst and wildest image ever seen. <br /> <br /> The soil is stupid, directing is horrible, acting was not fashionable, although the music was a cheap copy of "Horror soundtracks". There is no single smart part in the whole movie, and some scenes are really difficult to stand up. (especially the scene, where you see embryos on the glasses and hear the baby cry - horrible). I can not understand why the movie was in Germany in 16, usually a really hard criterion (for example, the "murder bill" (brutal but also fun and a reference to Asian cinema) and a short film, the state of grace 18). No one can call the horror movie. "Creep's face was much worse than showing off in the middle of the movie," I apologize (forgive my statement), it's just an insane director who lives in a disturbing fantasy. A scene is seen as violence, unrelated to the plot and he explains nothing.The land has holes and mistakes, the conversation is boring, I can honestly mention the only positive aspect of the movies except British and Scottish accents. <br /> <br /> If I say something, I would like to shoot the movie theater. I understand why large-scale production companies have not invested in money. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to getting feedback on my thread and I'm happy to discuss one topic or the other.
