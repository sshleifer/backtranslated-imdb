Teleporter is a simple movie about a scientist who creates the device, when it is used to transport itself to the machine. Simple crust before and before. Not only does it also allow the inappropriateness of an inappropriate person to touch. It's stupid about this movie, we hope the guy works wherever he works. It is possible that millions can be made for the organization that works, but the head of the organization carries on its roadside telescope sabotage. In the end, the projected man electrifies three people for no reason, since they continue to do so.
