It's a movie made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Care Foundation says it in 1969 and IMD was said in 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film seems to be a very significant global timeframe - camera work and pop art styling in the early 70's of the early 1960s. <br /> <br /> They make up the movie. Three simple images are distorted by using strange camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is no way of dialogue or plot. This was, of course, geared towards almost all forms of performance art, and as a performance art, it is initially interesting, but it quickly becomes. The film, even more clear, is completely boring and does not bring any imagery, but maybe they could make films, family and friends, and maybe even a few people, and "understand" them. human beings
