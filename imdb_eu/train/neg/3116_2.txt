The biggest part about the negative aspects of the film is true. <br /> <br /> BUT ... if I sit down with a movie: <br /> <br /> the director <br /> <br /> the director of photography <br /> <br /> editor <br /> <br /> You can not RELEASE the damn boom of the microphone in the movie and go through all the episodes of the movie that comes out, how can I enjoy concentrating and considering the story and when I believe in the bad stuff that reminds me of techniques to make a movie !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> OFFER ON DVD OR Do not take it out
