Wow, I hate this movie. The subject had to be a great movie, and the main actor was definitely sensitive and talented to handle this issue, but the script - though * that was * script - is a mess. This is not a movie that is free of any slideshow slideshow. I would say that it's fast going, because you'll have 81 minutes longer than ever. As I mentioned, it is the main protagonist. So Faruza Baulk (SP?) Is sometimes hard for her mother to love and accept. The filmmakers respond a lot here, because it's wrong. It really was a shame, I really liked this movie, but it's basically the result of a movie that was never made. Skip this - it was not worth the cost of $ 6.
