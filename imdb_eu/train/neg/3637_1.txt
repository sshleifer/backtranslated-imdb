I'm surprised by the good reviews about this amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Often I see some of the best international films, unbelievably fast, and "unbelievably fast" over the reviews. to follow the western Hollywood style storytelling storytelling. <br /> <br /> I like the situation with traditional and well-known foreign film instruments. I like that I associate many foreign films with a nice little arch. <br /> <br /> That's why this film did not serve as a valid redemption. It is not a significant development of the character, it is not a funny story, there is no emotional way with the characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: A bunch of colonial colonies against emotionally immature sufferers suffer from abuse and a girl suffers from a single friend when the "domestic boy" suffers when he is finally fed and takes away his excesses. . <br /> <br /> Although the previous paragraph is a changeable and dramatic one, this movie is terrifying to you while you play the stage. I had a three-week session, and I would not even have done it for such positive scores. <br /> <br /> In the absence of academic interest in that period, I recommend that you strengthen this.
