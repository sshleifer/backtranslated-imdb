I'm Ziyi Zhang, and I'm going to go on any movie to see her, that is, I was taken to Purple Butterfly. As I like to like this movie, I agree with other comments. It is very confusing and very slow. Because all the movies have been filmed with a camera on their hands, their significant parts are unfocused. <br /> <br /> The film has little conversation and nothing will be said. There are endless scenes of people sitting around in a room that looks like smoking cigarettes or chatting together. Film change is also very confusing and difficult to follow. Before reading a lot of reviews and having a general idea of ​​what movies were, it was still difficult to understand what was going on. <br /> <br /> I knew beforehand that the movie was not the protagonist of previous films like Ziyi Zhang, but he liked to see something different but, sadly, I was finally disappointed. This film never smiles, though, above all, it does not have to smile anymore. They could make sex scenes, they were sexually unattractive and could not be felt among the participants.
