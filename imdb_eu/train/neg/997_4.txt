After several decades of re-reading on the "Lipstick" magazine, I've backed it with the "Downhill" backing, although other movie friends have heard as much negative comments as mine. <br /> <br /> It's interesting how the special narrate of the Rape Revenge in the last 32 years has been raped with the keen sensationalism of "Lipstick" from the entire gore called "I Spit On Your Grave". Manipulation of the "Acuse" theme. But despite the significant "downturn" points, it never really offers something new to the meaning of revelation. No, "Descent" is so badly done in terms of quality of image and sound that it takes away from any meaningful messages that can be done --- when it's closely analyzed, it's not that pioneer. <br /> <p> I know what happened on the plot. I wanted to see Dawson's "fall" or degeneration of nature. Being a fan of Rosario, I was determined to take the layers off and see the psyche twistily. You know, DeNiro portraits the type "Taxi driver". Unfortunately, the criteria chosen by the script and the director / writer do not give a credible transition. <br /> <br /> The biggest bankruptcy is the second act. It was clear that the director's intentions were for Q & A on DVD, for the sale of clubs, drug use, and the obsession with the big black Adan stallion (DVD white kid nightmare), but Dawson's journey is never compelling. Rendered We do not know exactly what he does half, what he does, or why he does it. The bad quality of audio / video does not help again, but the sequence is very long and absurd. The investment and destruction of the protagonist created during the first action that was exceptionally successful. As the final, our interest has disappeared. <br /> <br /> Dawson points out that Q & A has stressed that it is a successful success when it comes to putting an end to the "vengeance" scene. Then, realize how reality is drawn-out and ugly. Although it's really valid, it's not a scene that is more believable. <br /> <br /> If you have a DVD, check out the "classroom" scene. This is an 8-minute increase, energy and provocation (though all the words) and shows that Dawson's slow crack materializes, as poor adviser Counsel Francie Swift is. If such exposure were added more scenes and if another third half was cut, we could have an interesting psychological analysis of the implicit impact of violent actions. <br /> <br /> As the film shows up in the final cut. However, we only get everything we've seen before, rather than a more graphic rendering. And what?
