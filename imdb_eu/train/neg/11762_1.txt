In South Africa, it's insulting to think that someone was really paying for this nonsense! <br /> <br /> Although the director is one of the original mini-writers of the Shaka Zulu, this "addition" series is awesome! The original series was based on historical data on a man who was a strategist, leader and a great warrior. A man played a leading role in the history of local tribes in South Africa. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie is not a hogwash, but a writer drawn from the bottom of the barrel. In the mid-nineties he was not surprised. While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors, what does David Hasselhoff do, slamming the slaves with his red bass and a whitish smile? <br /> <br /> I expected the smooth and wet women to look out of nowhere and the small red bathing suits on the screen, without apparent reason. Not surprisingly, it was possible that 10 fantasy lines in a line of flowers dreamed of 10 beers dreamed up by someone who inspired the man-made wildfowl to return to the African theme for the next "super-production". .
