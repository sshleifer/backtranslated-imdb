If you are 6 or under 7, you will really enjoy this movie. When my youngest daughter is stuck with TV. As an adult, I can not stand !! I've begun the followers ... with a decent story. But that is not a standard. Please forgive me, explaining what is happening after a child's movie, but if you feel almost every day that your loved ones love so much, why do you understand? My daughter watched the movie every day. <br /> <br /> I've been giving this film since the 10th of this month, because they keep my youngsters entertained.
