THE SCREAMING SKULL (Over 5 stars) This movie has pretty cool opening credits (offscreen narrator narrator, warns that filming of the movies will be offered a free burial if they watch this movie, if it turns on a quiet body, a frightening pool and music everywhere ) but, unfortunately, the movie slows down. A widowed man carries his bride in his solitary house ... his mistress and colleagues explain to her that the new lady is very fragile as a result of a past tragedy. Well, no-one else can see and hear mysterious things. Her husband assures herself that they are only in their minds and ... surely, you will see where everything is. You will tell us about what's happening before our evil hero ... probably because you saw the same plot in eight films and television show (and better yet). To add a lot of transgressions to the movie, it seems that the cuts in this movie (which include a large number of DVD compilations) are missing some key scenes. You see the heroine slowly walking in front of the window ... it opens ... she sees that she'll see something terrifying ... and then ... suddenly the scene cuts her husband's arms in weeps. So what did he see ??? We never know
