BFG is one of the most beloved books by Roald Dahl, but this animated adaptation is just magic. This version is fairly loyal to Dahl's original story, so John Hambley's scripts can not be blamed. Any blame with colorless animation, the rhythm is useless and generally full of weak voices. It would be a good idea if the story is a happy, vibrant and fun movie. Films, it can be boring to see it as pretty boring. Children of unknown stories should first read the book! All movies are a classic for children. <br /> <br /> Sophie's young orphan (Amanda Root's voice) has a pleasant orphan with a cruel supervision. Mrs. Clonkers. One night, from the window, he sees the massive image that sits down the streets of the town. She sees the image, she walks through the window and slams Sophie out of bed, and enters her huge pocket before escaping. Sophie immediately learns that a giant has kidnapped a giant from the Giant Country, and she is afraid that she will eat it. But, due to its relief, she is a kind and sensitive member of her species, who presents herself as BFG (David Jason's voice). BFG does not want people to eat and has jumped out of snozzcumbers with vegetables known as "snozzcumbers". However, Giant Country is experiencing many other giants - it happens every night, as it happens - they have no headless humans. Sophie and BFG become excellent friends, and soon they plan to fight against other giants. The queen of England (Angela Thorne's voice) attempts together to fight off the army and air force in order to fight human beings. The queen agrees, so a dangerous operation begins to catch the bad guys in order to damage another person.

Likewise, BFG is the only imaginary animated character. Sophie has no appeal, and the giants are bored (and not separated from each other). Places are also invaders; Giant Country is particularly short, it is only a desert, occasionally with rocks and canyons. About 88 minutes the movie is not very long, but it is still quite wrong due to the bustling management of some parts. Dahl's infatuated mood is poorly used. A book chapter explores the love of the "whizzpopping" of the BFG (farting) and it is the most ridiculous laugh. In the film, the same section was completely slowed down by manipulation. I came to the BFG for zest, when I expected fun and delight, but everything I got was pretty different! This has failed an unsuccessful debt, which any department does not match the quality of the book - unfortunately, so it is necessary to jump.
