Oh, Sakura Killers is a great ninja movie, do not make any mistake. But it is also very nice. This is largely due to the tremendous presence of Chuck Connors, which is featured in the movie, but only shines in a few scenes. I think it's a kind of "Obi Wan Kenobi" ("The hard-ninja-buster") that shouts in the box, but "his wisdom" is not horny. "Move without thinking" ??? My friend says, that is, the mental retardation sign, not the highest concentration. <br /> <br /> But really both of his helpers, Sonny and Dennis, have a great conversation with 'Brooklyn', as we call it the Colonel. vice versa shines. Above all, he will watch over the logic of Dennis' logic splicing. If you know anything about cloning, you laugh. Yes, this is an important land plot, people. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny movie, Sakura Killers is strange. I will not finish the "trick" too, because it's perfect for a Sakura Killers. 2. Bad Connuck is dead. :-( Because Ninjas is the easiest way to dispel.
