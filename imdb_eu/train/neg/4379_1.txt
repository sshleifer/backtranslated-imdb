<br /> <br /> Ok, well, I rented this movie when I walked into bed when I took the killer, and I said I did not help the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about a man who is buying a car, as he is making a central crisis, he loves more than his car, one day, his wife decides the car loan. As I want to ruin (because I do not want to ruin it) I will leave your imagination "Zany" (and I use this word lightly) as follows. <br /> <br /> I had it. This is a whirlwind for a minute to sleep the movie, and I would like to say that if you venture into the movie shop and think you're adventurous, please do not miss it. printed <br /> <br /> Then I would be wrong ...
