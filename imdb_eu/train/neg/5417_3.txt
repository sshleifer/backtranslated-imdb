Three Russian aristocrats were expelled from the decay of the Monte Carlo century, though they had fallen from the latter. Life is a way of protecting their lives, using counterfeit services and using casino notes to exchange false Jackpots. Andrew Hughes, the US authorities, arrives in Monaco with his wife Helena, and three friends decide to go on a trip to get financial help. The three Russians, Sergius Karamzin, want to move forward steadily towards Helen, who loves the Countess's serious maid. In the end, the circumstances intervene against three aristocrats. It is evident that Von Stroheim tries to convey a message (with American nonsense nonsense and erroneous behavior of aristocrats), rather than telling a story, and the movie can really be a modern viewer, like me, easily. Even in the play, later on, Greed is a great event like EvS and the wedding march, it's just a mill run here. Film can be used at different levels. Rating, 3
