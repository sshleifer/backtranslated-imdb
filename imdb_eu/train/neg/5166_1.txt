An enormous play, lame argument, stupid stories and horrible movie describes this garbage. She was worried to sit down. Wonderful. Do not miss out on a penny. The cinemas should be felt inadequate for the film to be seen by people. This "horror" movie was not so scary, terrifying or disturbing. In any case it was not attractive. All the actors who had such a huge influence on the actors, the attempt to enter into the film through the conversation is completely destroyed at the moment when the actor opens his mouth. With more of the whole story, I do not know why a movie would make someone else with this story again. Do not waste your time or money. Although it's a free card, it's not a moment to miss this movie. You will feel more sharp for watching.
