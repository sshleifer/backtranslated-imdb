There are two types of characters in THE SHIELD: people who do everything they can and do good things, and those who make the most of their perpetual interest in their own self and make every possible sins that they can while they and others are saying. heroes, and the only hope of everyone. More than any other show, THE SHIELD is about hypocrisy and self-deception. Unfortunately, hypocrites and self-deluders are the heroes of shows, and therefore the genre's fictional heroes are unusual to defeat immunity or capture immunity, and they get up repeatedly fools out to all their fellow people. <br /> <br /> The show has a great camera job. Lead prospects and disappearances are always excellent. An artwork is actually seen. Unfortunately, the story is a cartoon scene, violent violence, rape and a lie-filled scene. <br /> <br /> A warrior who fired by a hero has failed to do what everyone who failed him was like a Warner Bros. The cartoon character, always running away and happy with his head (anyone who does not accept his lies and crimes) automatically attracts an attractive character to the exhibition. , and ALWAYS draw your ears with its invaluable self-justification. The other police detect something badly in something that is being done, and if someone is hurt by their actions, they always blame the suspicious police officer because they are always a cause for any craft and a fake plan. Every time <br /> <br /> As in 24 days, this show focuses on many thoughts and delays in its story for the season's season. Fantastic and incredible stories of long-standing stories are injected into the season with a skeleton to hang rigid and evil beef that are corrupted by their characters and their inevitable covers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Sometimes they want to see Shane as an enemy. Sometimes we want to see it as a misunderstood soul. Sometimes we want to see Vic's dangerous sexual dynamics. Sometimes we want to see the poor man with a golden heart. Sometimes, we want to see Mara Jezebel as the bottom down. Then they think he is sitting and Shane talks about his dreams as if it is a sympathetic and tragic affair. <br /> <br /> This manipulation is not intended to be guilty of wanting. . After showing these characters, they ruin the lives of others for their purposes, that is. It is nonsense to try to get back and forth. But it's also nonsense to take all the supermodels that existed in seven seasons of heavy clowns to their beds and run a crime syndicate outside the police station, all under our nose.
