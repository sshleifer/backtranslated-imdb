I looked at it. A couple of laughter, but nothing to write home. Jason Lee was looking good. The DVD gag coil (the longest) is almost entirely uncontrollable. Selma Blair seemed to have puzzled her time, but once again her nature was considered a mud stick, so I think so "well"? Jim Brolin was amazingly funny. (Babs married can not be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip and eclectic. Larry Miller, Julia Stiles's father (brilliantly), 10 Things I Hate About You is fun here too. It's great, but the best part of this movie was Julia Stiles's casting. I can spend two hours cleaning up its folding, and I'm just feeling it.
