I've seen bad movies from the past, but what did they think about this movie? The production team became zombies, because they intended to make it happen, because we must be dead in the brain for any delight. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of most of the genres and enjoy it. "Shoot em up" games, but making scenic scenes in the game became ridiculous and uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> As most of all, there was hardly any script and the performance was weak. I will not lose my time describing. <br /> <br /> Anyone who values ​​this movie over 4 must be a production house or Sega. Otherwise, the concept of entertainment is very damaged. > <br /> I should say, I was annoyed with the video store, that is, this picture was given to me, which he rented. Thank you, God saw a movie in my cinemas to recover my faith. <br /> <br /> The comic guy would be the "worst" ever! "
