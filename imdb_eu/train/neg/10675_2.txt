When the name of the image appears incorrectly in the initial credits, you should not have fun (you do not read "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). Get behind the wheel of a good car, shoot, blow up all the action if you want action, because the plot is in the best position and is absolutely incredible. Character motivations, especially those at the end of Gooding, are worse, and as a result, irrational ones do not go away. I think that Andy Cheng should be really pleasing to the best actor to get this mistake in a project (it can not be anything, right?).
