Over the months I've heard about this little movie and I've seen it now. It's pretty, very nice, how many directors create films that combine creative ideas with others to make a single premise of a movie. The Troops, Swingblade, a million-dollar parody of Blair Witch. If all of these directors walk on the Hollywood gate, they're doing well and they should keep track of the plot's composition as Hollywood makes. How often have you heard the phrase "Animal House returns to the future"; "Wall Street is a Dead Poet association"; or "Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars"? I remind you that independent films are original and bold, not safe and predictable.
