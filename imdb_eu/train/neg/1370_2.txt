**** NOTE: Here are disasters. **** Why will I lose my quick flight over the years when I see the landfill? This movie is a comprehensive collection of topicals, a bad writing, a worse direction, and then we have not yet performed. <br /> <br /> And, of course, you can announce the whole story from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> Experienced heroes fight against stupid, rotten, and wrong. A balomero is disappearing, in other words, if all the heroes survived and dragged across dangerous types. The affected partner who has concluded everything is frying to earn his money. The second mountain range was diverted by heroically deviant adventurous experiments. In the end, evil defects also have a heart. A troubled teenager falls into the arms of her mother's mother after she has saved her. Etc, etc., etc., etc. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are few reasons to warn about disasters. It is possible to work on the whole plot to give me the basic ingredients. At least, most of the time I did not open too many brands, predicting what would happen next. <br /> <br /> And then we did not discuss defective errors. <br /> <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous comment, although there are some features that may be recovered from the worst movie. You will find it hard to find. I think I've given 10 to 10 for some beautiful landscapes, but that's it. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since a film tears me, but this one certainly did.
