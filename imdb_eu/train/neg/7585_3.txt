I like to see color early morning movies ... Did not all those 40's clothes mean gray? <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford directs this film. Her "weird" clothes are very attractive and, well, it has an excellent watch. But I think that he has given too much of his head. Probably, in many performances, this characterization was developed, and nobody said "if he laughed it, leave it". Surprisingly, he stumbled upon the ground when he was terrified. Madame Arcati's joke is that many media are often portrayed as woven females. Arcati is played as a retired teacher (we'll really go back!). The contrast between his agility, his usual way and his supposition is not really coming out. <br /> <br /> Because all the actors are in English (not just Cummings), they feel they use "Brit", "hard", "lip" and "upper". Oh, rest your time! The three main characters are constantly losing their minds and their comments are overwhelming (did you love yourself? Yes, but he was very cautious!).
