Much wrote about Purple Rain, apparently a bio-film "quin-essential", but I am here to say that the film does not deserve a lot of praise. <br /> <br /> First of all, let's get it. A straight Prince is an excellent musician and stands out for the Music Purple Rain. Although the scores are fascinated and only filmed as a concert movie, it would be a wonderful experience, unfortunately, and therefore it has some problems with the movie. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, it's a great performance. Writing, the character "The Kid" assumes a mysterious single word, in a few words, unfortunately, that's just crisp and passionate. A good lone character should have at least some controversial ones. Unfortunately, the character of the prince has little more than just words in the interview in the film, and it is hard to believe that she would get that girl. Everything seems a bit like this here, because it's shameful, that is, a character with a huge conflict and a very complex life, but we do not allow it to enter it. <br /> <br /> The amazing part of this movie is something that happens in a concert. The life of Prince and Morris seems to go back to here, and I think it's sensible from the business point of view, but it's hard to have a 2-hour movie, half of it on the stage, especially when you get the background stories of the character. aside. <br /> <br /> So, summarizing: This is not a very good movie.
