This is undoubtedly the worst western one I have ever seen. The story follows the usual formula for western and martial arts film. The hero learns that family / friends have died, so the hero wants to determine vengeance, preventing the effective legislator, rescuing the kidnapped lover and kill the expert. archim-nemesis brutal in a duel. This form has been a great success - otherwise it would not be a formula, but Gunfighter is the sophomor performance you will ever see. Scripting is atrociously-minded and insulting; A senior teacher wrote a conversation because they lack depth, maturity and realism. The sound is bad; Sometimes it seems dubbed. Cinematography is a lama, and groups are just fa√ßades. The effect is wonderful; surely, some interpreters may guess the script, but others can not use that excuse. I hope I never give roles that never talk to Chris Lybbert; Every time he tells him anger or a line, he only reduces his voice's timing, and he just does not feel like a boy trying to make up his mind. And with Chris Lybbert talking about what he plays in Hopalong, see his doubts (if you dare to watch this movie): he works like a Roy Rogers, who looks like a dirty and dirty cowboy. . If you enjoy the movie rate that Hopalong Cassidy's greatness merely wins, get this, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else.
