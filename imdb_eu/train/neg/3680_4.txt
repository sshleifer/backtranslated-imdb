I remember on Tuesday, 02/02/2 morning to be exact. Soon I fell, I tried to convince myself when I heard a terrifying fear of getting out of bed. I watched some neighborhoods in Southern Jerusalem and went to the kitchen and saw a smoke column from a distant point, after hearing the smoke, the mermaids passed. I rememorate to wander in my room, get my binoculars, go back to the kitchen and see the image of a glass bus. The bus was picked up by the station, where a terrorist and TNT with just one click killed 25 passengers; Many of them went to school. The good friend of mine, in the back queue, was sitting on the bus, rescuing her life with an arbitrary and nonsensical look. <br /> <br /> I am sure that all of the Israelis are at least terrorist. He never wanted to have a memoir, and it was only time before someone made a movie. As it turned out, the film itself was repressed. <br /> <br /> He also wrote and directed Haim Buzaglo (also called Hmmm, Haim Buzaglo), a film that has been written in a dry competition, and spends most of his day with spectacular competitions, with a pure word processor. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, Israeli commercial channel reporter, decides to make a piece of a rigorous army officer. Buzaglo, bored and paranoid, because it is known as the "what is the earth's hot babe", it is a question of a private eye to find the girlfriend. <br /> <br /> As a detective he advances in his research, his observations are played and later, the life of his actors. In the meantime, comic plays will be performed against comic theater against the elimination of Israeli society. About the film, the movie turns into an exercise that frenzies, engaging in small cards of cardboard and impossible conversations, while it was about a mile away. > When I say "Cartoon characters," I mention the characters under the obsession of the "significant" writer / director who have no real dialogue or reliability. I will not work too much about that. It's enough to say that I am sure that homeless barefoot prostitutes go to the theater. In order to see a play, that is. <br /> <br /> This movie, according to Haim Buzaglo himself, is the first part of the current trilogy of the current schedule. Honestly, I hope the other two films, as I have written in the experience of the written experiences that have been written at the beginning of my review, face a different world of characters that are not existent and compelling. /> <br /> 10th in 10th my FilmOmeter Movie was a milestone in simplicity. It was filmed in ten days, all the work was free and the cost of the film was around $ 12,000 (no, I did not leave zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). They ask you that they needed 34,000 dollars to complete the Blair witch project.
