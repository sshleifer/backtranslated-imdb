This movie was awesome. I was emotionally involved in all the characters, the biggest antagonist of the movies I was. I played very well; I waited for myself to go away, but only drink a beer to transform myself into an addictive path that would transform myself into a magical transformation. In that situation, I could not even notice that Cuba was as weak as the play's role. The obsessive dedication to his work did not persuade himself, even after night failure after his bad standards. Burt appeared on the screen in general, that is, a general (he has too much makeup). I was a tough fight against Cuba, except for authentic mine and I stepped on my finger. Awarded! Receive my crooked toe!
