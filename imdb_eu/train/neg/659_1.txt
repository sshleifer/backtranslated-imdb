This film is a good example of Hollywood writers and directors in the extreme. If you pay people for this piece of garbage, the original ideas and talents of the entertainment business are missing. To watch this movie (and as I rented the movie), the idea of ​​paying the audience is also recommended. <br /> <br /> An obsessed teacher (3 years before) wants a teenage family to die. He does not die for a mother, father, and brother without any reason. In the first five minutes you will see a bad performance and direction. A few years later, an obsessed teacher came out of prison. HMM - a bad writing - no one knows about the town until the last moment. The damned instructor, in other words, is like Navy SEAL and can be indented by people, sniff out to people and a killer with a knife. Of course !!! Now, an obsessed teacher kills the maid of the hotel for no reason, the toy plays with fun for fun and hunts teen friends. Now you love the most perfect girl. An obsessed teacher leaves the hotel --- he is once again stupid, he never knew the police face, but he walks by. He now kills two police officers outside the teenage house and somehow says he is dying in his bedroom and his boyfriend. <br /> <br /> There is not a single positive thing about litter. If any other professional qualification works low, they would be shot. However, these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars to write and correct the trash.
