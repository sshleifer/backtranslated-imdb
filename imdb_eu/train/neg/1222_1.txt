This is a seriously disturbed movie. Even though the boys got something they deserve ... sadic rude executions were "a bit" up. One person who showed up at the beginning of the game had only killed one person before giving him the help of the sad plot. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, it appeared to be correct. But this was just what the audience had to immerse themselves in a false sense of security before they would come. <br /> <br /> The movie could save me Jack Nicholson from the bushes and cried out: "and where's the batman?". Kim Basinger could scream. <br /> <br /> Now cool!
