I did not feel violated as I had done with CHRISTMAS ENCLOSURE, but BELLE's MAGIC WORLD is still an antithesis of beauty and wildlife. Like CHRISTMAS, BMW hates its audience, though not so extreme. Ugly, married, stupid, and bad writing is wrong. No one in the story works. These are not the characters we love BATB, they are a bunch of people. I wanted to dissolve it, but in a few minutes I gave up, because they did not get bored seriously by anybody in the right mind. We have three stories here. The "Perfect Word" investigates forgiveness and forgiveness. You can only "Fifi's Folly" function as the name of Babette is Fifi, and a wardrobe is James Bond due to the villainess and that the woman is a fool of Lumier. Like "Broken Wing" (or "Broken Wind"), it's probably a bundle. Is the beast hates the birds? Since Do not watch this dog: all copies of this video can be creamy. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a cinematic classic, transcendental celebration of love, art, understanding and human soul.
