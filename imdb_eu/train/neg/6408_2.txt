UPA movie reviews are well rated, although the quality of the animation is clear behind Looney Toons, Disney and MGM. Unfortunately, the high cost of beautiful cartoons and beautiful cartoons with beautiful origins, the UPA style (debuted in 1950) began to dominate the 1950s and early 60s. In the end, the films made a dirt cheap and received several Oscars to prove "cartoons". As a result, malicious animation became a norm and the trend was not changed until the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This UPA movie is an original. The characters are drawn in a very simple way (they are easier and they should use stick images) and the backgrounds were ugly - simple drawing lines added to dashboard (often with sponge and very few full items). <br /> <br /> In the story, it's a story about jazz style. Some will love it, others are very, very loud. "Frankie and Johnny" is a traditional story, and as a result of filming, it's probably not a great movie for kids. Because of fish, animation and jazz, it's not very good films for me either! Some will read my review and I'm definitely thinking that I am a beehive (who I am). However, I love animated movies and a bit of UPA minimalist style is a very, very long way and you can not seriously consider big artworks - cartoons quickly and quickly. Ignore the Oscars and try to watch classic cartoons or anything else ... anything!
