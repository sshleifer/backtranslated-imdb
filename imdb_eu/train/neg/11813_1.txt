While Stan Laurel spent half of the biggest comedy band a bit less than usual, he worked with Broncho Billy Anderson in some series of cheapies, many of which were parodies of Hollywood's main functions. After a confrontation with Anderson, Laurel continued to parody the parody of the smallest production company Joe Rock. <br /> <br /> The majority of Laurel's parody was fun at that moment, and even less fun. Laurel is a parody of modern viewers who have not seen the original movie. 'Western Hot Dog' cowboy shoot-em-up is a pretty general parody. "Pecos of the West" is a specific parody, released two years ago without the main actor. Since it was not a success since Pecos 'West', it's hard to see why Stan's films chose this movie as their purpose and, much less, why they waited for the parody. And where did the title "West Dog Hot" get? Maybe "Hot dog!" Due to being It was a sexual intercourse driven by American lecher in the 1920's. (Like the beginning of Machinal's play theater) "Rock of West Dog" was produced and directed by Joe Rock. Among other achievements, Rock introduced Laurel to Lois Neilson, and then he was the best man at the wedding. Full Disclosure: I had a great privilege in the last years of his life, with Joe Rock and his interviewing. When he was ninety years old at that time, Rock's memory was very clear ... but he was not remembered "Hot Dog from the west," and I did not blame him. This movie is very unforgettable. <br /> <br /> The first lady's character is named Little Mustard: If you want to be parodied in something like 'Pecos of the West', I do not get that. There are a couple of "unplanned" gag including a mounting horse in Laurel. For a moment in this movie, Stan Laurele reminded me of the excellent Buster Keaton, when he suddenly ran. 'West of Hot Dog' is a box similar to that of Keaton's 'The Frozen North' short comedy, but Keaton's version is much more fun. The plot of this movie is predicted by Keaton's "Our Hotel": here, two varmint brothers are expected to inherit the Last Chance Saloon, but the previous owner has weakened Stan's Bachelor. However, the brothers become legal heirs, if Stan died. Hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Really, is that legacy legalized? As soon as Stan gets under ownership, other questions of property or inheritance will become his decision, not the decision of the previous owner. I had a lot of time to analyze the legal points to consider in this law. <br /> <br /> At some point, rumors include cartoons shot directly. It seems cheap and not fun. <br /> <br /> 'Hot Dog' does not fear and does not win: it's just scary. My rating: one point from 10. Hold on, Stan: You will be half a legend of comedy in other years.
