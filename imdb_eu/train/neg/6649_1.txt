OK, anyone who could say that this movie was good or good was misfortune or knows the director, the writer and the producer, and tries to push the buzz of this movie. I saw the movie worked by one of my friends and it was horrible. I am an actor and I have done a lot of work in big and even independent films. This movie was crying. The reason I was tough was that this movie was "clearly" in "Mice and Men" because it was too much for the story to be seen. Hollywood in a creative industry that fails ... seems to be carrying a classic movie and movie "Mice and Men" and creating mistakes with another spin. The actors, the accents, the conversation and the direction were amusing and shameful writing. If you want to make a new spin in an existing story, make sure it's as good or better as the original to justify the new spin. I did not like this movie.
