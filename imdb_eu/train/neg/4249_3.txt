I did not know this movie after seeing Blade shortly after: Trinity, when I was around the Trinity table, a user mentioned how much better Wes Craven's series, when I saw Blade. I did a quick research: I saw the scores and RottenTomatoes in Drakula: Ascension, and I've seen some trackbacks in Dracula 2000. I saw it for this great movie of contradiction. <br /> <br /> Now let's take a quick summary here. I remember that I had seen Dracula 2000, and I remember that I did not like it any way, and then, seeing Drakula's scores: Ascension even lowered my expectations, but again, for me, the movie is a kind of person I can really see. (any movie) to complete my opinion. <br /> <br /> When I started to watch this movie, I found out that some things are a small budget and that's why I'm going. With a lot of v / fx, and just to be compensated according to the story and the performance, I was also surprised by some of the questions in this movie (Jason London, Roy Schieder and Jason Scott Lee). > <br /> Oh geez ?? This movie was CHEESY! But the cursia can be fun at least, it's pretty nice, it's recording again in some FEW scenes, the stupidity of the characters in this movie. Surely they knew some vampires and some basic things, even if Luke had a book, but did they keep them in vain to get "infected"? No, this is a bad slasher movie where the girl has to leave the shower and look at the rumor, it's just a towel. <br /> <br /> I also need to be blinked at some point. I do not know how to dress Drakula in her own body, especially if it was a great savage and angry, and I think that I am in this situation, I would not want to wear it. <br /> <br /> So, does the movie end up like a mid-film of the trilogy ?? It's not "Cliff Hangar", where I have to wait for the third installment of "Legacy". Cheesy movie entertainment value.
