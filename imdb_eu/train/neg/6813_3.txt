Jean Rodin, an artistic nonsense about vampires, aliens and immortality. Women are beautiful and beautiful photography. This interview is inane. It's a messy mess. It's amazing to watch it, but it's just like a horror movie or a thriller. It seems to me to be scared or not. Is it placed at the same time or not? It's a strange mixture of art and horror, it's never quite frequent and it seems like a nice look, it does not seem to mean anything, and it's not terribly frightening, though sometimes it's a kick or sequence that's just like the Frisians. annoying A must-have in the background for those who like nude women.
