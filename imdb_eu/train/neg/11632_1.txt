This movie I saw in a Sneak Preview projection and I'm glad I did not pay. This movie is very fond of it. He is full of dick and fart jokes and takes no pride in regard to action sequences ("Little Germany" shooting). I made a small list of things that I liked on the movie ... and I did not agree with them. <br /> <br /> 1. Dave Foley's penis. 2. Fart jokes. 3. Poop jokes. 4. It was a Dude pussy. 5. Do not Gary Coleman. 6. The Taliban 7. Making a funny laugh to the Bush 8. Dude has a blonde hair. 9. Plot. 10. Murder of minors 11. There was Uwe Boll. 12. Most actors were just attacked and there. <br /> <br /> Now (a few) good <br /> <br /> 1. It uses a cat as the silencer used as the Dude game. 2. Many actions. 3. Crotchy returned (and was in charge of Postal) 4. Uhm .. I did not have to pay. 5. There are some "what are some" moments <br /> <br /> Boll once again. He made a movie game in film adaptation. Buri white, Mr. Boll. 2/10
