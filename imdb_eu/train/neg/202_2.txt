This is not the sound of bees, that is the effect caused by a very long, very boring, poorly played movie. How I ever did without sleeping every 3 1/2 hours, I never know. The plot is simple ... 3 half suspected morons talk about sex 3 1/2 hours. And you thought Rohmer was deadly. That's even worse if possible. > I really need to be a masochist if I can watch the whole movie or let it go off or kill someone.
