OK, I love terribly fright. Especially I love being afraid to make it bad enough. Demonicus, or the House of the Dead - these were bad enough to laugh. It is not cut <br /> <br /> It was worse. <br /> <br /> (spoilers - who care care?) <br /> <br /> My friend and I have seen the whole movie, and I have some comments, "suck it" in style and in the true critique. <br /> <br /> Plot (like) - There is a guy in the city (this is probably Seattle). comments below) who runs and heads cuts. It's been doing for more than a year (I'm not getting specific numbers again, thank you for BAT) for two or three years. The head is a week. And the police are calling JUST NOW "specialist" (ONCE names it as a psychic, but that will not appear again). <br /> <br /> Right! Are they represented by THREE THREE homicides? EACH MONTHS STARTING LATESTS WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE HEAVENLY FIGHT LEGAL WARNINGS !!!!! <br /> <br /> In any case, this "specialist" has not ignored the police all the time, and both consult. One of them concludes: Samedi is a baron, a voodoo spirit, who cuts his head to obtain enough power for a body, and then to take the world or perhaps to go to Disneyland. <br /> <br /> Um. <br /> <br /> Setting: where does this happen? Well, if you're not a Seattle people, you might not realize that a cartel with a local radio station is busy with the barrister (tenths and family members). The entertaining, "Pulp Fiction" esqe dialogue (IF), between two police officers (who cut their heads for about 15 minutes), is arguing that the "new stadium" might be a problem. the movie was made. <br /> <br /> I'm going to be from Seattle, ask for pardon on behalf of the movie and embarrass me. <br /> <br /> Well here's where it's really critical - I'm doing a horror movie (I'm not published, I'm not looking for my name on the IMDb). A lot of research. Unlike the writers of this film, I know that Baron Samedi - a Voudon Loa (spirit) who cares about a cemetery, and "traditionally" ("some Christian oppressors") is a deceiving "Loki". God. <br /> <br /> In other words, it will not cut its heads. <br /> <br /> In addition, Voudoun is a great part of religion when Bares Samedi wants to have a body. Their religious ceremonies are known to the congregation, sleepers. <br /> <br /> It's worth mentioning, you already have someone, why do you have a new body? <br /> <br /> Likewise, if Samedi Baron got a body, he would not cut his head, he should not get a good rumor and cigar and TAY !!!!!! <br /> <br /> In summary, the only thing they did was to Obtain (surprisingly) the right to read the Tarot card's utterly useless (voodoo chick that is "terrifying") to interpret the cards that were not interpreted by the way they do. Once again, I have done the research. (Anyone remember late-night ads on the phone for tarot readings - "Beloved ones - will you fall in love soon ..." and all this nonsense?) <br /> <br /> <br /> If you did this by my comments I congratulated you. And I feel again. I'm sorry if you feel like watching the movie is necessary, please.
