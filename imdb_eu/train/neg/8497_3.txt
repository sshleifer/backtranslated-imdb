My title should be enough. <br /> <br /> In a literary excellence (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant), a culture that is so richly bored with a new "movement cinema". XX. Until the middle of the century, France had a clear tradition of art and clarity and philosophy. When they give you a movie camera, they start as a WOOOHOOO LOOK. PLOT? THEME? PSHAW! SHOES PARTICIPATE IN CINEMA AND ROUND! At least, this is not as bad as Godard (a healthy fascination with the backs of the crowd). Oh-the-what-what-you-art.) No, Truffaut maintains a clear level of clarity. But the security camera is also fast moving. Both are not distinctive. <br /> <br /> Haha, excluding all the nerds in the movie school: I bet my neck is spreading right by the side of my neck. But do not leave the last phrase of my review unread. <br /> <br /> However, if you like French literature, that is why you will hate it. Those who love this movie probably have never read Jack Kerouac's or "Guide to Hitchhiker's Galaxies". Or maybe they read the lyrics of The Doors, and they think it's deeply moving. Anything you float on the boat. It seems ironic that this movie injects some (weak) mentions to Balzac, one of the best and most significant writers ever surviving. Nice, Truffles. But you're not close. <br /> <br /> Avoid using a syringe that helps this film. <br /> <br /> If you are a type of person who likes to think, paste it. Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and the Japanese masters of Teshigahara (SONE NO ONNA). <br /> <br /> If you're an idiot, enjoy Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol. For Pete's sake, push your wrist. You look like cabbage
