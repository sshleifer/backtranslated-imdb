... and I actually gave it a ZERO on my 1-10 personal scale. Since 1952, I've been watching movies and have watched over 1000 theater (I do not even have films that I watch on TV). Zero is the only movie I rated. <br /> <br /> My wife and I took four children (then 15, 11, 8 and 6 years old) and also thought the kids were horrible. The fact that my daughter (now 26) was this site warned me (that the movie had a 4+ overall score). <br /> <br /> Dinosaur animation was amazing at that time. (and even worse is retrospective), acting (especially Sean Young) is very strange and the story is just a slogan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
