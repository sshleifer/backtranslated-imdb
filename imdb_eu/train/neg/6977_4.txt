Here I have read comments and I am impressed with the imagination of those who love this movie. I can not recommend that I have found a lot to recommend. The sound of Leonard Cohen is not excessive but overwhelming. The movie is pretty good, but something must happen, and nothing is done: a plot (not a real problem for me), not so much character development, anything thematically. It's only slogs. Even so, Cimino's "Heaven's Gate" has an amazing moment, and I'll see it again. For a magnificent West Highland, "Deadwood" is much better than HBO's "McCabe".
