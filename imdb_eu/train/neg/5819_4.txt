It is the story of a dysfunctional Jewish family. Parents have divorced and their mother is at home. His father, Murray Abromowitz, moves along with the children of California, moving around Beverly Hills to get the best education possible for his children. <br /> <br /> Things have become really fun Marisa Tomei, Murray's nephew, will come. He lives with a group. <br /> <br /> The film's family adventures explores complex, complicated, drugs-rich neighborhoods. <br /> <br /> Murray Jessica Walter has to move to Murray as a woman who wants to be a friend. <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally they enter Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno. They play Murray's brother and sister, respectively; There are also parents of Tomei. In front of children, Reiner warns Murray of paying bills. <br /> <br /> The film ends an annoying note while scaring the family ashamed and ashamed. Beverly Hills walking around in their car. I think films promote independence and old self esteem.
