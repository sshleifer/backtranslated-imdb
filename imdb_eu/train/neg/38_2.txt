or when Al Cliver fined a tall, stupid, 7mn nelson, when he prayed to anyone, his movie has come! The Starlet movie by Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) has kidnapped a group of $ 6 million in rescuing her island secretly. Peter Weston (Cliver), Vietnam's veterinary flexible, is not counted by a film producer, to save the girl. And they did not really pick up a local tribe who likes to give young women to their divine cannibal goddess through bloodshed eyes. <br /> <br /> This is the same shoot as CANNIBALS. They are a little bit better about the value of entertainment, especially a hilarious monster with fun and double-minded mummy riffs (frankly confirms the conversation with the ping-pong balls). Franco has achieved a strong EuroCult, with Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (one of his deaths is one of those things that most does not show as a man I have never seen), trying to be her. ). The film has many nudes and gore (Tempra painting variety). For me it is noteworthy that Clive and Antonio de Cabor gently fights in the world. Sadly, Jess takes away a wonderful hour and 40 minutes (and sometimes agitation), which means he had to spend 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> In most cases, Severin DVD looks pretty nice, but there are some dark ghost images in some dark scenes. There is also a long dialog box in Spanish (not an option, but only when you hear the French track). He has a pleasant 16-minute conversation about the Franco film and he has a nice thing about Buchfellnerri, about the star Sabrina Siani CANNIBALS.
