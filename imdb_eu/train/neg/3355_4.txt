There were only two things that sparked interest in this movie: Owen Wilson was killed, and Catherine Zeta Jones. <br /> <br /> This was essentially a woman's exhibition. Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to offer eye candy. Liam Neeson was completely in vain in this movie. Like Jones, he did not have any roles. All the film was Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). It was the only part that David Self had written on this scriptwriter. He was his first and he recovered with the Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the director was Jan de Bont's problem. Speed ​​and Twister did a great job. really the job fell here. Maybe he regains his disaster Speed ​​2: Cruise Control. Wild Wild West should thank his fortunate stars; otherwise it would be the worst figure in 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid with all costs.
