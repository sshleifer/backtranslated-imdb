Spanish production is very impossible, unbelievable and incoherent ... well, let me see how close I was to see. The movie begins with a young girl who killed her cat. Then he prays to his lover somewhere on his holiday. He calls them work and says he loses vacations and says he will pay for it. That's why it's important for someone to guess at the end of the film, a dumb guy. Patty Shepard looks like a spying seems to be a Spanish horror movie queen, because she asked her to take a picture of her bikini to take a moment. for lunch, and then for Sorgin Mountain, we are no longer at this time. Before going, Patty must stop by the house and make a big echo on our hero's ears. Again, this is never explained. The film continues to stay in two innings, to go to the mountain and, finally, why the mountain of the Witches is called. You know, the many aspects of that film are better than bad movies. It has an atmosphere, some of the characters are very good (especially curtains and old women), it is at least suitable, and the peak (although it does not make any sense) is well-written (literally) witches with seasonal whites and long black hair. On the other hand, it does not make any sense, which is very detrimental for me. I saw the movie ten times and I still do not know more than I have seen. That is a serious problem. In the twelfth, it's a curious movie and horror film of European horror. More to me than to get it out, you have better power.
