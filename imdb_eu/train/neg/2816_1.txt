This is one of the films you see in the video store, because we just need to get it, because it's so bad. And, in fact, we can not take the most. Great progress was made. <br /> <br /> But then we found a scene that captivates the protagonist Robert Englund (this time I get my name to mind). CRIPES. I have never seen a movie ever so much (roughly fifty). And I have never laughed so much in my life. You see, Englund has the same thing to show off his keys. I saw the last movie two months ago, but I can not stop laughing as I write. In any case, the scene is an editing of the shots - Englund steals the lingerie of the girl, Englund, a naked horse, and a mysterious woman falling into a snake's head. This is absolute genius. You need to see yourself.
