I do not know what the rest do for Steven Seagal, but I see them as absurd as foolish, at least always laughing. Why would you rate this movie after 10th of a duplication, when it makes a favorite that wins this kind of thing? Are you ridiculous? <br /> <br /> <br /> Attack The great force is not a big movie, but Steven Seagal felt that the vehicle was worth a lot of other films; Actually, I did not think it was his longest. Most of the time he had a semi-conspicuous plot of land, and above all it was basically exciting. He finally succumbed to the end, but he also had some nice trash items. In the end, the story itself did not promise, but I thought it was acting, I could use characterization (such as big words) and the rest of the production values ​​as expected by a real fan of Steven Seagal. Seagal himself was a stone face, it was a male man who expected nonsense, and the rest of the boys were pretty well protected, he never thought of it. That is, the people who make a film by Steven Seagal. Face yourself Or even better: laugh. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 4.
