Spoilers ... if applicable ... . . . . . As Robin Williams is a bustling fan, it was necessary to feel this movie buying the first appearance on the screen. Wow ... I could not imagine a more headless movie. In essence, the movie takes bad jokes after others, after telling your uncle Artie dinner and dramatizing them. A lawyer Robin Williams is a 30-second champion. <br /> <br /> I am totally humorous, but humor is not pleasant or plain or innocent ... it was just stupid. There's no movie left behind, not only the fanatical Robin Williams, but also the owner of each movie like me.
