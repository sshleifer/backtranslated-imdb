First of all, I do not know why I rent this movie, because I am still confused ... <br /> <br /> Air Rage is like any movie I've ever seen hijacked. Of course there is an important person on the plane, and harassers are looking for revenge. It's sad, some methods of pausing seafarers have already been used in other films. Do we become so unusual as really? <br /> <br /> It's ice-T (although some incomprehensible reasons make the ACTING attempt painful it does not bring back "c" rapper) who's it. Glorified in the portfolio, the movie actually has less than the amazing Kim Oja, as the reporter of the five seafarers. This naturally returns to hauntz. Steve Hytner has been the only person to know about "Seinfeld", Kenny Bania. <br /> <br /> I can not forget to leave my favorite part of the movie when a seal on a PLASTI POZTURA blocked a door ... BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Atrocious script. I got the point that I was able to say something I'm going to do to make the stupid idea, and it would be the next line that would be the movie. <br /> <br /> In terms of special effects ... the only thing about this movie has wasted the cost of electricity for my TV and VCR for 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the title - DID is filmed in the Air. But for star shows, the only rage on the film was the viewer. <br /> <br /> So, if you're looking to pick a movie apart, it's bad. Save yourself, do not choose this.
