If you are looking for a movie, it portrays the tedious and boring existence of middle-level communications and false networks, then this is a movie for you. Although you still keep your interest in the movie, you should look elsewhere. There are many movies that are much better. For example, try some of the darkest movies in Bergman. The filmmaker felt the spiritual half-level of poverty evoked that the viewer had to dump other sad and silent accidents one after another, until finally the movie reached its endless and pathetic reach. If you evaluate your time, the two ways to spend two hours are much better, for example, cleaning the house.
