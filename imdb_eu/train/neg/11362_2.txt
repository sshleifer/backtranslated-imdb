"Fly Me To The Moon" has been the worst animated film I have ever seen. This tells me something that my son has seen all the animations published in the last four years. The story must be generous. If you play the voice, it's very nice. Romper Room is a variety of humor. The animation can be used for Nickolodeon cartoons, but it is published on the big screen, there is no cable television. <br /> <br /> That is because 3-D images are OK 2. Some scenes had a heavy image but we saw it much better in the past. Also, filmmakers emphasize that the characters escape from the screen in most scenes. While initially interesting, it was tiring after 3 or 4 times. As for the creators, it seemed to me indifferent. <br /> <br /> I'm going to say this, it's been a nice soundtrack. And the record, my son was not so mad. Bad movie
