This new curiosity of DORIS DAY COLLECTION should not be required in less than 30 minutes into the film. However, what makes it shine on the screen. Less plot is a movie that is just a pretext to hire a few players of the day to hire a Warner. JANCIE RULE reveals it and it's shameful not to have a big star. RUTH ROMAN handles the role of "go-getter". It was better if this color were. Travis Air force positions work well with rear projections. The best movie around is the wonderful music games. Thanks for your LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANT.
