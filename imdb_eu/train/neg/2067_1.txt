Directly spot: "The Groove Tube" is one of the most unpublished films, foolish and crazy. This "comedy" is a gap that is so far removed that it is almost incomprehensible. I said almost everything, because after all there is a lot of fans. <br /> <br /> This movie is not too bad or "bad" bad. This movie would be a crime of films like "Plan 9" or "Robot Monster". You can really watch and shoot such movies. But this film is very bad, so it's a bad idea, a script and a script, and a terribly old SO, there is no trace of "camp" or "schlock". <br /> <br /> Although Saturday Night Live was released, this is probably avoided by comparisons. I'm not a fan of SNL, but this movie is worse than the worst thing about SNL. And man, that's it. Not to let men see the audience, Shapiro repeatedly sheds a few breasts, but the breasts not swollen in 1974 will not make any excitement. Actually, the movie is so badly done and it's sleepy, but I'm sorry to have any emotion on anyone in 1974. <br /> <br /> A man named Ken Shapiro made this film. I swear to God, it would make a person with a video camera more essential and clearer. It is exciting, unreal, that is, a really incredible movie. "Jokes" and "gagak" are so little children that little boys who want to avoid pornographic gangsters dancing at night. <br /> <br /> I'll give it to this movie - the last sequence. The "dance man" sequence, where a guy (Shapiro) dancing in a NYC street tune, is easily the best thing about this horrible movie. It's not a great sequence of "dancing men", it's definitely that Shapiro does not have time to strive to complete the whole song, but it's really true. The part of this sequence that begins with the police dancing with the man is the only light in the whole film. It's not surprising that this Shapiro sequence has been put to the last time - again, it is not so great, again, it makes it easier for this other "movie". <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> Otherwise, this movie is a very crap piece, it is impossible for mankind's true human being to be absurd. The name of this movie should be "Ken Shapiro's Craparama". It's amazing that this has been done, but many talented filmmakers have never been able to access it. However, I can say that NYU geniuses would love this movie. Full garbage
