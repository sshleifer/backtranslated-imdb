A good actor (with an important exception) encourages Epstein's satira light and clear. Mansfield was never better or more entertaining, here he was paired with Walston, a veteran who wants to become a war-torn congressman. He and his friends, including Grant Artillery Suave, will leave for San Francisco and take part in the city's most celebrated festivals, who are fully fled to the service, organizing industrial conferences. It's not so nice about this movie, the special Suzy Parker concert, the interest of Grant's love, which takes too much time for the movie and slows down the second half. Walston and Mansfield have a good chemistry; Gimmick has decided to make love to all the soldiers (the war effort is necessary, of course), but he is a married man, but he loves his wife. They steal the movie with Grant without any hassles (it's fun here in the first part of the movie, with no known actors or actors).
