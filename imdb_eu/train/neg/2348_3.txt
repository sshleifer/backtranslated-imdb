Ashley Judd, I think as his first role, shows his real life rebellion in his slow feminist toy. Wow, what is it about political justice and extreme liberalism or why? <br /> <br /> With a passionate feminist in life, he guided this script. Not surprisingly, Roger Ebert, the left wing of the critics, loves this film; He is right in his political side too. <br /> <br /> Unlike reviewers here, I'm glad I am pleased with Judd Elevate this books from moronic fluff movies with the best roles of movies, not a generous generous liberal agenda.
