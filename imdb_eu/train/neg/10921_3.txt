I get the point that I often see with bad movies and science fiction films are one of the best sources of film that you can find original movies. That is why I am sure that you can imagine my disappointment when I saw Sands oblivious. The sub shows of the play featured, the science fiction screen is usually unlucky. There may be a few cameos from people you know, though you might not know your names. The CGI special effects are very small and therefore one of the greatest sources of science-fiction comedy is missing. Of course, there is a funny moment when a bulldozer is cut off or when the main character dies to save a girl who goes through a few days, but generally does not. Laughter is falling down to the ground, and I think that's a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> If I play a 10-star scale to judge for a cinema movie, I would probably give it. 4, maybe 5. I may really be ashamed to get a good laugh at the next science fiction movie and I hope that this movie is not part of the general increase of religious science. -funts original
