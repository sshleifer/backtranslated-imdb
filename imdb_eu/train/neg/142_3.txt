First of all, there are good things about this movie, but they are ordinary things that are combined with teenage movies. I've seen the ads on this movie, it's obvious that it's in Denise Richards, but it's a poor actress, and it's not so good that people are trying to get their plan out of it. that are unrelated to the movie). And what does it look like to everyone? Maybe it's part of the character, but as I said, acting ... However, the script is okay. You know who is in the whole movie, and it's almost impossible to predict what will happen, but not irritating. I think the book is a good base, according to the line, but next time I read the book to see more than knowing it.
