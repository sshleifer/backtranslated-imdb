This movie seems to be quite trivial. There is no reason why this happens, as if it were written by a small child who is bored halfway down, how can we "think" how? And what did they think of Jared Harris and Christopher Walken? Did they make a bet? I can not tell any land, I am not sure of one, but it is not registered. Jared and his birds go to Ireland as they fall down the stairs. They go home to a very annoying girl, who dug an old woman in Christopher Walken's peak bog. He stays in the story for another reason that continues, and shows his gratitude hurriedly. From now on, everything gets a bit stingy. I'd like a couple of hours of my life!
