I should trust my instincts better: no hope - no despair. However, I hoped that Koyaanisqatsi (1983) was a similar masterpiece, and I was disappointed. Powaqqatsi, in my low opinion, is just an avoided work to achieve worship of the past, and - artistically, it fails. It seems that a producer gathered the rest of Koyaanisqatsi's material, soon pulled it together, put everything in motion, and got some pop musicians who knew what was known as Philip Glass, repeatedly singing pure music. When Koyaanisqata expresses the viewer that changes the slow and slow movement, Powaqqatsi is a long sequence of everyday images in a cell phone (if you watch your VCR on a fast preview, you will see what you mean). He was most disappointed, though, it was Philip Glass's sound. I was not able and I still can not believe that New Age-type commercial drones came from the same composer who could make an afternoon at a 14-year-old Casio calculator. Koyaanisqatsi was an emotional and highly synchronized music complex. In short, waste time! My advice: forget the merchant! Check out Koyaanisqatsi again!
