These flies are very surreal ... eh ... this is a cartoon, so everything can happen. <br /> <br /> I want to tell you at the beginning I love the animated movie. Unfortunately this year's repertoire is very weak. This drawing is just a list of errors: <br /> <br /> 1) I mentioned the label line. This movie suggests that 3D effects are superb. Well, I did not see it, I never saw something special. <br /> <br /> 2) "Flying" in this movie does not look like a real fly. They could have at least black. But did you fly, seriously? Head with giants and fine tors? <br /> <br /> 3) The story. I think it was written for 6-year-old children. I could tell you more than two simplified sentences. <br /> <br /> 4) Excess patriotism. For example: "American files are ultimately!" Oh, give me a break.
