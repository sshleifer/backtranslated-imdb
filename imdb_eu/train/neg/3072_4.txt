Margret Laurence surely did not take one of her novels into the movie, instead of being Stone Angel. Hagar, as a character, constantly questioned the social norm (Gainsay, who dares, anyone?), And almost ended his human process. Book symbols (Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc., etc.) They constantly remember the massacre of the battle against the old and new paths and paths. While he is faithfully honest in the film's plot argument (but it's not really a plot storyteller, right?), I think he lost the point of capturing the spirit of the movie. The last challenge (for the challenge) was not there. Bram could have been much worse than portrayed, and Hagarren's father was "traditionally", so to speak. If the filmmaker stresses a stronger portrait, he would direct the film to his home. <br /> <br /> In the same way, why should we see mobile phones, organic products and other modernizations? We're trying to do some points to make some points (for example, Muslim and original girlfriends). Hagar and co. They are politically correct in the book, so why should we see that in the movie version. Modernization may be a pretext for a low budget operation, but when you use the novel (and the movie) as an excuse to post messages with subliminal, non-important aspects, it seems we must punch under our minds. <br /> <br /> They also have audiences. It seems that we were conditioned by the bitter and elderly people. Why should he laugh at Hagar's cholera? I'm not sure that Magaret Laurence made her laugh or was laughing at Hagar. These people are frustrated and overwhelmed, and we only laugh. I do not believe that Hagar and other people do justice to their own situation.
