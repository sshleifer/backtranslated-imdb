Well basically, the movie blows! Blair Witch knows the bad fantasy that Sean Penn is about to show in the world of Iraq. Scripts are written by 8th grade teachers (without 8th infringements); The two main actors complete the entire film; They used the wrong type of camera and the wrong type of film (I did not know anything about these things, but I did not see the real documentaries I have seen), and Christian Johnson was a great idea. and sucked it. I tried to draw a picture of my dog, and eventually it was a stick figure, which looked like a giant turd. I'd rather see Blair Sorgin VIII, through which I sat down again.
