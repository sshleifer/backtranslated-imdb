Another movie that is based on the bad topic of the mad scientist has fallen. The movie is about to kill a life-long ambition. I know, I know ... that you've never heard before! Obviously, as all these films go, the experiment is very wrong and generates a profitable creative being. For this trusted hope, I believe that it will be minimal. Wrong Like many films of that era, it's a nice idea, but the script and the script are half-like. I have not seen the worst horror movie I've ever seen (no, Abominator: Evilmaker 2 still catches the cake) ... but it's not a gem.
