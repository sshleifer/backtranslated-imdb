This movie mentions Ben Chaplin as a bank employee in England, asking him to apply for a Russian e-mail, Nicole Kidman receives it by email, but, surprised, he does not seem to be. The story is very predictable and Chaplin does not emphasize much as anoying. Kidman is very good at this role, considering the only thing that is interesting in this film. GAIA: C
