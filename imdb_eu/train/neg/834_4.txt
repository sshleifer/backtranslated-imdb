I decided to lose time, effort and money. Disney always shows a lack of creativity when it comes to creating "live videos" in movies, but placing the "new vision" on the plot of the original movie is a bit small all the time ... they'll be back soon. Publish original movies with new animations and songs and call "the new version we all love". Nathan Lane immediately returned Timon's role. Timon and Pumbaa "Lion King" animates the animated world of the original world in a narration trip to tell the story as it really happened ... as they see. <br /> <br /> Of course. Timon is currently the star of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah ... <br /> <br /> Music sequences are not violent and animations are empty. Voice talents are spectacular in the running of the video, but once again when did you remember Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane in real commercial substance? If you liked generality, you hate this. It's raining because children and adults are not. It summarizes that.
