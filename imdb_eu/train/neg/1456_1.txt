Simply this is a simplistic and dimensional movie. The title, The awkward rise, should say that it is not trying hard or trying a lot with Hitler's character. But Hitler's first minute of the first minutes of the first minute that plays the evil child with malignant music, it gives us a vision of Hitler, which presents himself as a surrealist cartoonist. Really the film wanted Hitler to think he was evil, but does he need something to convince Hitler that he was evil? In the end, being a character of evil nature, boring and confusing (he ought to ask that inept and phytoskotic cold cold films persuade a nation or Man of Time's year). Movie XX. Some of the most important acts of the century have made this film that he wanted to take on a character and tried to enter it. Instead, he basically just said, "Hey! It was a bad Hitler! You might just want to know," I would like to know. It's ironic that the film still attacked a pleasant vision of the character. Give me a break one.
