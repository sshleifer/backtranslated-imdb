Wow I was bored with this movie when I saw my pants. Bland, nothing and unmoving. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Ash and co. You will travel through time with the help of "The Spirit of the Forest" ("Princess Mononoke"). There, they meet a dorky child called Sam and starts "on the plot". <br /> <br /> So, Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) have a great character, they become hippies and Celebi ("The Spirit") strives to release a strange hunter. I do not know what else he continued. Everything is blurred. Ash's friends were hardly there, and all the fighting scenes were dreadful. <br /> <br /> After saving the day, Ash and his evil friends have to go back to their time while Sam goes along with Celebi (seeing this scene). Then, after returning to his time, Ashk's new friend really learns the grandfather of his opponent. And I think that's it. Is not it too late? If you love your children, you will not be told. (From 10 to 10)
