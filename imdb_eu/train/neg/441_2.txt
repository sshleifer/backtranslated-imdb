We do not have TV in England but I have been on the Internet on YouTube. It is dumb, immature and boring! This is "Earthworm Jim", the creator of Douglas TenNapel, I have never entered this drawing, but I have to admit that it is better than that. The drawer has not done anything for many years. For Doug TenNapel, it's nice and all the time! The story has three cats and a lot of money that inherited the house in front of their old lady's master. They are arguable and do not agree to spend money. "Boring"! Animation is awful. The main character is cats, right? But they do not look like cats! Strange creatures with extravagant animal creatures, sharp teeth and bulgy eyes! Human and other animals are also ugly. The subject of the song is horrible and angry! Likewise, stories are waiting and are probably copied from older shows. I was surprised by the fact that other viewers got a score of 7.5 / 10 votes. Television is not really what it was! But now most are dumb, inexpensive and boring. Some of the websites may not agree with me. Sorry, but the money is wasted and your time is completely ruined and I feel completely outraged and happy that Britain does not suffer too much. If you have a digital one, you need it) but I do not, so it's not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and I'm very lucky to get that worst of it!).
