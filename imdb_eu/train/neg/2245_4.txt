This movie is not the same as the version of Judy Garland and James Mason in 1954, and this is a shame that the 1954 version, in my opinion, is much better. I do not deny the talent of Barbra Streisand. He is a good actress and an excellent singer. I do not know about Kris Kristofferson's other work, so I can not give judgment. However, this film leaves a lot. The route progresses slowly, with nudity and language inadequate, and it is very difficult to sit down. <br /> <br /> However, I'm not a big fan of rock music, so I'd just like to have a natural one. Judy Garland version better. Watch the 1976 movie with Barbra and Kris and judge yourself.
