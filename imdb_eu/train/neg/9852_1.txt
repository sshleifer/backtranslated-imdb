Discovery Channel / Animal Planet must be ashamed of himself. This fantasy has been modeled after the "Dinosuars with with" series. Although 100% fantasy is present in the same archaeological and factual manner. Even though fantasy dragons mix with T-rex and dare disappear. To show up in an educational channel, as well as being Sci-Fi, it gives true authenticity to this show. So the show is about 7.5 / 10, depending on entertainment. But I have to give it the way I present it 1/10. Do not get sad with fantasy problems, but the way they put it is very wrong. I can really see that children think young and slow adults find a dragon and that's true. <br /> <br /> I also think that you have to see that the series "Dinosuars with Walking" is getting worse now. Think of how miniature fantasy is.
