Ok, I found this movie well on my father's old movie movies and it seemed pretty good on the cover, but the movie really was absorbed! Forward, the first story of the swimmer was pretty good, but it was necessary to take some time before the boy was completely downgraded! It was not terrifying too! His dream is like a story of a child's bedtime. After all, the girls were totally postponed. I'm sure I'll call people to people and ask that they'll go with you. But that was over, when he confiscated him, he told him he was in the hospital and saw it in the garbage bin and the trash can. Next, the story about the guy that led to the dead was pretty enjoyable. So stupid I'm not going to say anything more about that. This was the best one. It was not so scary, but the idea of ​​the story was pretty cool ... well, the girl got up and killed all the boys, or something else. Then after dreams, the losers put on the bus (AELL HAHAHAHAHER) and they see it in the dreams of the people on the bus. End
