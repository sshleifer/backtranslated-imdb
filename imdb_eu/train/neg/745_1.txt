I'm not sure how this film starts. I like bad movies, it's often entertaining. Special effects I love bad, bad performance, bad music and unknown direction. Except for music (except better than I expected), this feature was all featured. <br /> <br /> The special effects are very bad. I've seen the worst since Nintendo since 64. Scenes to watch, such as Thunderchild, woman's mechanical foot, Big Ben scene, wrecked train ... Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the positive side, however, some foreign pedestrian scenes do well. <br /> <br /> Efficiency was as bad as it was, H.G. Directly based on Wells's book. Because of having such good sources, it would be fun for some actors to be entertaining. And then the bibi ... I have seen the facial hair that I have seen for a long time. Of course, it only plays half the movie. The rest are the characters that surround the correct and poorly rendered effects. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hines is a mere director to make injustice to inept managers. Using different color filters, for a specific reason, using backgrounds used in the scene or using a bad projection, it is amazing how this man directs this man. I would not imagine an excellent book that would make this film a bad thing. Mr. Bravo, Hines. Bravo <br /> <br /> Doing whatever advice I want to see this movie is to make friends, drink, play poker, watch, drink and maybe you have not done the whole thing. It's a really bad movie, so have fun and laugh at this disaster.
