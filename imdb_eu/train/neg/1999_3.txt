At the end of this episode, Holmes asks Watson that there is no event for those who have registered. For some good reason! The super killer left his little gray cells (sorry for Agatha) for this story. There is no deduction of reasoning, the analysis of signs of crime scenes. Holmes moves fifty feet behind the plot. In the end, CAM Charles Bronson treats the old CAM like six bullets in a brown bread. In a subsequent harassment, an attacker attacks a Watson shoe. I have not decided to extend the movie Cinderella story. The murder, Holmes and Watson, escaped. Well, it's a bit of a change of pace in late Victorian London. Curious Law :-)
