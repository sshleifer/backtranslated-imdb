How many times do we watch horror movies with a killer with a Scream-ripoff mask? Bleed argument is an original but the movie is a complete failure. For some reason, the interview is poorly developed, it is boring and in vain details it loses too much time, the performance is bad, and so on. I want to get my money back, this wreck feels worse than a mistake.
