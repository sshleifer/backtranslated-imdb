When I was seven years old I remember a lot of crescents when I saw a trailer for this movie. I decided to ask my curiosity about the absurdity and I asked my parents to take it to this movie. As adults are wise, "Absolutely not!" They told me a bunch of binoculars. Of course, I was very disappointed. I would not see the first baby in my block "Unbelievable Melting Man". <br /> <br /> It was a short time, perhaps a couple of days. I forgot about "The Incredible Melting Man" and my disappointment blurred. Twenty-five years have passed until I get into the forefront of my thoughts. While I was browsing the channels via digital cables, I lost a long relic of a movie. My curiosity was prick and I decided to eventually partake of my forbidden parents. I should hear them. The "Incredible Melody of the Year" is perhaps the worst movie that man knows. "Def-Con 4, films like" Metalstorm "and films called" Freddie Got Fingered "feature film Oscars. I got rid of two hours of my life tomorrow, gross, even in 1977, anyone convinced a movie company to film me to produce this. <br /> <br /> Do not do the same mistake I made. Listen to your parents if they want to ban it. They were right.
