This film had good ideas and a good story. The director and screenwriter of this movie failed and I liked the film, The receiver, Mr. I felt that I was returning to Hartford's Class 8 Social Science class - again in the year 67. <br /> <br /> What is waste, someone takes this story and takes it to a real movie. It's worth the story. <br /> <br /> Whenever each of the scenes are potential, we've combined everything left with some black topicals. The footage from the history channel was most likely to get white footage. Shaky <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was a bright photo on this festive occasion. The other theater was very sad: the movie is in good shape and Edonork has set a new bass line that plays the captain. <br /> <br /> However, if you are ready to accept all such mistakes. They're not worried or entertained, but if you want to learn about USS Mason, it's worth the clock.
