Film: There are very interesting comments about this movie about this movie. It's really awesome. It's not enough money to spend on the film and it's about how Spike Lee's way seems like a combination of an indie movie and action movie. Characters / Actors: Denzel has done "EXACTLY" on all the movies, so it's not surprising. Here are just a few readers games. Quickly think 10 Denzel movies. Now count how many police / detective / bodyguards were, whatever he played. Clive Owen, hmmmmmm, this boy soon plays a better role on his plate. I think his best performance is "Beyond Borders". On the other hand, he did the same thing he did in all the movies. His tone and conversation were similar to "Sin City". The guy arguably knows what he is doing, what he does not know is the best way to choose roles. The desperate need of a better agent has resigned. Jodie Foster was a great movie, if you are watching for the first time in your life. He's better. He has had better roles. It happens in Hollywood, so that the greatest stars fall on their knees and includes low-class roles with Jody Foster. Argument: The plot was not confusing, they could think of such a plot, namely the whole movie, after having taken a parking lot after a Chinese dinner. I mean, SPOILER: PATHS ...> I am sick of Haulokast and not a necessary racemaker. The movie is about banking robbers, why put Haulokast and Racism there, nice to try to play the emotions of the people, to work anybody? NOT ME. Did the police think about banking robbers? Last week, please, we're talking about US police and security. Nobody could know where Clive was. I mean, they did not find anything with that room. Are we kidding? Conclusion: Surely, watch this movie, if anything, you will be happy to talk with your friends when the movie is bad. At least people do not think they're stupid to watch this movie because they think they've got a "star" star of "Reply".
