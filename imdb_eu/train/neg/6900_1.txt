I sat in the theater to get bored in hell, I wanted to leave the movie halfway. The plot is simple for 4 samoiar boys. Therefore, they must bring dates for entering into weddings. Hatred <br /> <br /> Most often they called me the raw jokes they pushed me ... They were very shameless, the coins that were thrown on your face to enter the sad movie. The performance was below the average, and this movie was going forward and forth, just like jokes and a planned plot. <br /> <br /> I've seen all, one of the wrong movies I've seen. In 2006, similar, bad, just ugly. <br /> <br /> Well, thank God, a friend cried out to me. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
