THE FAN's Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? The problem with that problem is that De Niro has played very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER, COMEDY-A-EEC and CAPE FEAR, and unfortunately the characters were better developed and better scripts. It was difficult to think that Renard was a frustrated obsessive sports hobby that could lead to being a psycho psyche <br /> <br /> The arc of the character is not the only problem with that script. A focus on people (I had a problem with De Niro, but it was a little flat), I thought Bobby Rayburn was the main character in the movie, and I thought the story changed to Renardo. Likewise, it seems that the disagreement is that many athletes who think they should concentrate on the baseball a little more. I do not know that this was originally intended for baseball fans, but there are once again those ideas that producers should tell themselves and what they need. <br /> <br /> I'm going to be entertained with THE FAN (especially with the soundtrack), but it's a very bad mistake, and in the middle of the 1990s, we must remember the characters, WHITE INITIALS, THE ONLY INTRODUCTION, etc. for a long time
