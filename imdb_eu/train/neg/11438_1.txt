If Gray Matters had a worse comedy, I do not know. The premise of the Jewish comedian in New York is "fun" because Sam & Gray's brothers and sisters are confused, so they decide to settle with Sam with a maid, only that Gray will be attracted to their destiny - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is silent is gay is an apparent surprise. The wedding scene is deeply offensive, a shameful drunkenness of "drunken" Moynahan and Graham, and a performance that embarrassed forestry with Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Spacek has shown the inability to comedy and wants to get it out of his recovery. Molly Shannon plays a nice friend with lumpen insouciance. Alan Cumming only produces credit, but does not hesitate to work. The whole disaster showed Graham's awesome look, which at the beginning of the previous scene, dressed in a comedy hood and coat, even when it was set in a lesbian bar. It's amazing that this movie has never been published, because it does not have a source of exchange and it has to be avoided at all costs.
