Wow, I can not believe that people play this "good" movie. Now, I've seen a lot worse, but with John Cusack there are more romantic and funny comedies. <br /> <br /> It's a hellish movie at best. The play was not horrible, but not great, for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, there was little love. There have not been or are not targeted loose among many. Unfortunately, the main characters get excited. They do not know because they do not love people who care enough for themselves. How do we know that they are not in love? Absolute remorse, the characters must leave their finances. I think they are more romantic than these two little things. The commitment shown in these two cases is the constant escape. <br /> <br /> The movie does not end with a wedding scene, it's likely both get cold feet and dropping each one. After another compromise with other hot potatoes. This movie is about two people who can not commit anything, unlike the previous characters in Cusack, they wanted to make a deep commitment (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blanken, etc.). <br /> The highest failure of this movie was in any round, or it did not have much interest. At the end of the movie, the story failed when it arrived, which fits the whole movie: boring. There are no suspensions either ending together or not, if they are not happy, they do not have any effect on their actions. <br /> <br /> It's sad that people are so honest that they blind the removal of that movie, just like they remind us. Through any critique, 'Everyone is cynical!' The criticism of this film is not cynicism, but rather an inverse analysis. There are other more romantic comedies, including Grace Kelly or Eva Marie Saint. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is great, try these movies, which will explode in your hearts: The Princess Bride, Say Anything, Grosse Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Faith, Charade, Rear Window, Northwestern North, or About Mary (that is, analyzing idealized love with contemporary society).
