Film is horrible, a great script, a bad direction and an absurdity. Also, bad performance, except for Clancy Brown, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was a purgatory, so you get enough movie to download in the bad enough to download the bad karma. It is likely to be related. The part of the male head is not well-written and there is no significant role in this role. You can see the landmarks a mile away. The lead woman and the servants of her brother also have no sense. So, in the end of the movie, an important action on its part does not make sense to script wise.
