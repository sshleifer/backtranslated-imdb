This movie is a mixture of topicals from a recent film. There are promising ideas in it, but the director was clearly convinced that he was planning an ambiguous movie, when it was over when he was confused. The pioneering actor Daniel Wu does a good job, but he does not have much work with the main subject. In addition, the film is not waiting for anybody (although there are some horrible moments that can be correctly perceived). <br /> <br /> * AURKAKO MILD * * <br /> <br /> We have a mysterious death, twins, diabolical librarians, fantasmagorical interests of love, personal confusion, wild monkeys death, edict conflict, child abuse, Subordinate homosexuality and crime gang bonds. These elements are the only real community that seems to be the protagonists with fuzzy feelings of confusion and falsehood. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is that perhaps the monkeys are pretty much on the DVD cover, but the same act never imagined. Instead, the director Julian Lee uses the look of the monkeys, which is not very scary. <br /> <br /> * RETURN * END /> <br /> Avoid this. For a psychological and ambiguous horror story, see A A Two Sisters (2003) Korean film.
