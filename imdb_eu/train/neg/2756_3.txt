{rant start} I did not want to believe in the beginning, but I think people are talking about why it's the best Korean film in South Korea, and it can go down. After a surprisingly entertaining and shocking monster movie "Gwoemul" 2006 (2006), after achieving a sharp satire of the B-movie genre, the Korean blockbusters have become more and more general. Although budgets (especially those spent on special effects) have become more and more fantastic. South Korean filmmakers want to waste the goodwill of investors and audiences by the "Shiri / Swiri" movie for 1999, which featured huge, giant quotes like Peninsula China. ? {rant end} <br /> <br /> The only "reason" I know about making this movie is the throne of investors as I have seen, the most accurate digital coverage of a Korean / East Asian dragon. so far, the last scenes. Now that dragon was introduced, and in 1996, as with "Dragonheart", there were more personalities and goals, it would be a movie that could have a few more quality retrievers. In 2000, do you remember "Dungeons & Dragons"? Nobody learned this trick is not how you use special effects, but how will you use it? I hope that Korean (and better) legends are used more, as many international interests have been killed in Korean dragon battles, as they shot it. <br /> <br /> In the end, I agree with all the negative opinions made beforehand and ask how the Korans thought they had acted at the end of their "Arirang" hymn. As a creature, I would give at least 5 stars from 10 onwards, if they have deserved special effects or action sequences, but I've seen a lot of video games with camera and scripting (less than dragons).
