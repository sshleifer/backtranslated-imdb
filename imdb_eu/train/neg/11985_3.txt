Do you want to eat worms? Here's how to show 'documentary'! Yes ... the boy eats live worms! And this is the most interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> This film, the previous reviewers, summarize very well that it is boring. Here I totally agree. The movie is just about to go anywhere ... Do not you know how to eat a worm? This movie is almost impossible to write a spoiler ... because nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Now, in the technical aspect: They should cut that child. Who is it anyway ... Bozo the Clown. It was almost comical ... I expected that it would become almost a hairy dog ​​or something. <br /> <br /> And on top of that; It was like a child to look hungry! Before leaving the weekends you should leave food without litter. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie sleeps. And my children could only take around 15 minutes to leave the scene to make them more interesting. <br /> <br /> I admit that the landscape is very spectacular. And if it were a decent story that will go along with it, it might be a success. <br /> <br /> The sight of the kids seemed to be quite safe: white bears and 'oddball' eyeballs were weak. Frightened most children, and the short skinny-dipping scene did not show anything. <br /> <br /> I have given this very generous.
