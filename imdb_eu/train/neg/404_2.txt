As soon as I saw this movie, I questioned the capacity of all the actors and actors who accepted a role. Elizabeth Shue is a good actress, why would she take this opportunity too much? I have to give credit to credit, however. Several moments of the film were unpredictable and quite varied, but Sebastian Cain almost did not solve the wicked tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character. I would not recommend this movie to be self-respect for someone, men or women.
