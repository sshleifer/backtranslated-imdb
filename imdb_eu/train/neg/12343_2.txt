Oh, brother. This exciting movie is the only reason to avoid the "bomb" being at least historically noteworthy as the first movie of Three Stooges (they were not yet on their own, and Ted Healy was still saddled like that). . However, as a fan of Stooges for a long time, Mr. Moe, Larry and Curly should be used as a favored sworn assistant with three misused wizards. Healy's eldest lord. They are not permanently animated by the film and draw them back in shadow and draw cartoon characters back in more than one cartoon character. Pearl vainly asks the viewer to forgive Munchausen Baron (that is, a good example of humor) as a man: "I have an object!" "What causes?" "Caffeine reasons!"). Jimmy Sid, his party, is not another, but also schnoz boring.
