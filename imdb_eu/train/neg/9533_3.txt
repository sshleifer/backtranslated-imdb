The preamble to the text warns us that we should ban the introduction of evil at home, but I think that a more appropriate word is "entropy." Good pain, what are the hindrances? <br /> <br /> George (Seymour Cassell) is only at the San Francisco office and the house of Tiburon is very expensive for his wife and son in San Diego. Two girls (like Sondra Locke Jackson and Colleen Camp Donna) knock on the door asking for directions. Well, it's raining, and they're shaking like a naughty heart, and they do not know what they're looking for, and, with one thing, George invites and invites you to take part in the pizza fireplace. They are passed over three months in the bathtub of George, and they continue for about five minutes, especially non-differentiated nudity in double exposure, triple exposure, quadruple exposure and exposure. They spend the night in a threesome and commit to breakfast for the girls the next morning. But Georgie's guests have something to breathe a bit because they fall on their fingers and they are placed in ketchup and syrup throughout the linen, and - "EATING ANIMALS!" In her dreams. <br /> <br /> Now do not hate yourself. Sondra Locke's eyes are cobalt with black eye and Colleen Camp will return like a superb. It is worth mentioning that it is created by Shelbyville (Tennessee) Locke, which is very nice and grows with heavy bodies, which we can not notice after five or ten minutes. <Br> /> <br /> But when girls are in love, they also have a movie. Then, the movie goes into a thin green light. They put the pair with makeup make-up and make a mirror in the mirrors. They head to the boyfriend of the shipment and then they are stifling. Storms and furniture break up. Two people sit next to each other with one of those scenes, licking food and then jumping the bones of others. <br /> <br /> And Georgie? In the first place Georgians make unconscious maza (McIlheny's Tabasco sauce in that little red bottle you can not find in your kitchen cabinet), bind it, flour and milk it, give it a psychotic judgment. One of those half-run Tolstoy, put on rucksack, dressed in extravagant costumes, and then the home of the upper middle class and nearly destroyed, and the delivery by vans are ex machina. <br /> <br /> Regarding the performance, as someone told Georgie: "First of all, these girls are polite, then you're upset when you're upset." And for girls: "The first act is shameful, to anyone who does not want to impose anyone, then mad fool." And that's it. <br /> <br /> Photos and locations are part of a movie taken directly from the 1970s. I am not sure to suggest any skills. We need efforts and talents to make San Francisco ugly. The score is given by two Leitmotiv. Georgie's letter is about "free being" and "delivered" about the letter. Jackson and Donna are catchy rinky-tinked "My Good Old Dad". <br /> <br /> I accept the moral lesson behind the story. You just have to give a few things, though they seem to be fun at first. Very educator
