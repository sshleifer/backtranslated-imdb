The 1963 "The Haunting" version has been one of my favorite horror movies over the years. So, in 1999, I released this remake with great anticipation. It was almost impossible to keep track of any original masterpiece or the same. Sadly, my worries were well-established: the film is supposed to. <br /> <br /> I do not know what they thought of this movie. When Jan De Bont directs it when he directs "Speed", it seems to have been wrong, like "Twister" and "Speed ​​2: Cruise Control". "Hey Jan, with cinematography, is it? Liam Neeson is a good psychologist and role-playing psychologist - I do not think he's capable of transforming really bad behavior, but he can not keep a handwritten record and a weak story." Catherine Zeta Jones proved again (as he did in "Entrapment") a lack of ability to raise over the material that he or she gives him. "The X-Files," the female director made her wonderful here, lost Eleanor over the edge of nonsense. And the guy, that is, any In fact, the children's statues of wooden beams are woodier than laughably strange. I do not think that the whole movie changes the whole expression. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS AHEAD) <br /> <br /> Because the first movie worked so well We never knew if the house was really scared or the manifestations were due to the precocious psychic state of Eleanor. There is no original spirit, much more rudimentary - "The Changeling" and "The Blair Witch Project" featured other horror films. In this updated version, of course, we get tons of CGI ghosts, basically (in front of the script / weak graphic) that makes the movie a bit inadequate. F / x are not very large, based on the ILM. Frozen breath is particularly fake. The effects of the movie "The Frighteners" on Peter Jackson before I saw this were much better. Children's wooden boards are considered to be terrifying (especially when they scream), and CGI monsters are not typing at home. Apart from damaging bad effects, directing and typing, the effects only add to the mix of a movie. <br /> <br /> Especially stupid scenes: when three other characters enter Eleanor's bedroom. , and one of them does not seem to be surprised that a great demon was sitting on the bed. Eleanor's "old-fashioned" housewife hanging out with "dogs" is a particularly bad scene. And at the end, but not least, Wood Blond Guy, a curious jewel that tells of a shameless cry, jumps over a piece of furniture and builds it at the beginning of the evil man's painting. House. We achieve satisfaction in this scene, after the second half of the attack, Guy Rubia pulls the ghosts of the boy in front of the fireplace and immediately cuts his head off the creek. I liked the only part of the movie. <br /> <br /> In short, follow the original "Haunting" 1963. 3/10 stars.
