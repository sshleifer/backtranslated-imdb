This movie is a long time after another. First of all, despite their fee, there is a supposed John scene, where John gives a bad smell as idiot. Wigs and accents are awful. Beatles make the worst cartoon in the old days. John da Yoko, a movie, envy, homosexual wardrobe, slave, portrayed in Albert Goldman's book of discredits. The song titles continue to flow even in the usual conversation, "we were always only two!" John would not have had such a hobby. We showed him like his death was beautiful. It's a fun scene, the only Beatle boyfriend John confesses and tells Paul's Yesterday to sing. An insolence John says something "Certainly, and why I did not fall down on my knees, put on my wife's hair and nail it." This made me laugh a lot. Actually this movie is fun when it tries to be ridiculous. John and Paul did not pontificate all day; The Beatles is fun amongst the boys, who are more reflective of The Beatles. Forget
