This movie is not the inevitable sequence "gotcha!" Successful sequenced script at the end of each. Actually, there is no character development and real plot to speak. It's only a skeleton of motivation for the characters, while their inevitable over time. It's just an excuse to show a fantasy boy (in his acoustic gesture, there are some family cats) and his ghostly mother (hanging with long black hair like "Ring"). A bunch of cardboard trimmed at the bottom to make two-dimensional excuses for humans. <br /> <br /> This English version of "The Grudge" is equivalent to garbage kinematics; for a moment, but not really what you should live for. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended.
