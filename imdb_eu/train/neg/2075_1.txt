I must admit that when I saw the movie, I did not really have much hope. But I was totally disappointed with my small expectations ... <br /> <br /> Essentially, Luke Wilson has a long movie that falls with a little girlfriend. There is a small mention of a girl that follows a girl, but she likes this character. I certainly do not give it a reason, it would probably be as unprofessional as the movie. <br /> <br /> So, with the Rainn Wilson meter (I really liked it before this movie) he will convince him to talk. Uma Thurman "hot" girl. This is at least strange, as everyone sees clearly Uma Thurman does not fit into the "hot" category. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rainn Wilson's performance is also "hot." I usually am due to his acting, but he did not save the movie. His character was terribly, realistic, and annoying. If you're trying to get writers out of the comic closet, you could never say it, that you're gay or just desperate. It was almost painful. <br /> <br /> But, though, he steals a bag while he goes to a subway, and Luke Wilson is a great savior and robber by the thief. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is a superhero, or as they call her in the "G-Girl" movie. However, I understand what "G" is, but we will be able to discuss the message boards. <br /> <br /> I think the sex scene is fun, but I find myself. asking who is that sex? Almost a few beds have been thrown through the wall, let's say Uma Thurman's "passion." It hurts but it does not "I'm really hard to understand. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < No discussions, not only can not detect the movies properly, it can not act and it turns sly into a blonde and it's typical. <br /> <br /> In general, I'm leaving the theater, not paying me $ 8.75. Typical characters are not They have chemists, especially Uma Thurman. Someone should know that you are moving a lot of yourself because you're not saying. <br /> <br /> In addition, the script and the story could have been used for a lot of work or a game and a lighter one. I was annoyed by the careers of the actors and their dead. In general, if you value your money, and respect for yourself DO NOT waste your time using a pathetic attempt at a movie.
