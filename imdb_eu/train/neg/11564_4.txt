An Italian horror / suspense film, about a rich English gentleman who runs through bars and pubs, with a red hair girl, just like the wife of Evelyn recently deceased. You know that he really loved his wife, because he was going to take her home, a giant castle, rot, and dressed and then tortured, punished and killed. For me, the most curious aspect of this film is to say something at the end of the film, like that of Antonio De Teffe as a movie HERO. In any case, shortly afterwards, under the direction of his uncle Bob Maldera, De Teffe is determined by a girl who finds her uncle's party. It's moving and strange things have started to emerge from De Teffe's brittle spirit. His wife is dead and she starts listening and finally looks at the title, if you are still curious. Similarly, family members and friends have begun to die in brutal fashion. Izeba Agatha inadequate (It seems that it may be younger than Defrere and is in a wheelchair and looks at the old one) fills his fate. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And, of course, there is a whole description of what Evelyn did. The director Emilio Miraglia does things quite well: the movie adjustments are very good for this film, trying to think about England's best. No actor in English. Many have dark black hair and Mediterranean colors and an Englishman would not wear dead clothes. Cars drive on the wrong side of their road. However, the scene of the crypt was effectively filmed and I liked the resolution I liked. And, of course, any movie with a red Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a line of sex perversion; However, it seemed terribly terrifying for me that torturing women was quite healthy and healthy with that idea to alleviate their mental devils. Pull up
