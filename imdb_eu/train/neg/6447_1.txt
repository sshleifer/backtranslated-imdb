I bought this movie about 5 dollars in my local store at the bargain store, Chase Masterson, but I'd have to throw it in, put it in the toilet and throw it in. The film brings together a series of 20-point high school students that meet in the anniversary of their friendship, drink and dive in the woods and die. The problem is that the reptile monster is hunted one by one. The play is bad, it seems they were thrown into shows like 90210 and Dawsons Creek. The boarding school was twelve years old, and the script was probably thirteen years old. The entire set seems like a backyard for someone in Malibu. People who have praised this film, of course, are friends of the director and / or actors. Avoid this landfill stack.
