I'm glad the people of the IMDb have been able to describe what that movie is. I suspected it was trying to be a comedy, but I was not sure about being a dark and solemn melodrama. For a comedy, it is amazing that even in the humorous areas it is left without danger - until the end of the hilarious "twist", the whole film that truly confirms the total desire of time. It's hard to describe how real a real amateur is. Anyone who participated in this film had the idea of ​​what to do? See what you really deserve, so you can look terrifying to your screen.
