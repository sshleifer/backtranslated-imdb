As George McDonald Fraser was a fan of Flashman's books, I was looking forward to this great movie when I first watched Flashy. Sadly, however, it was a great disappointment. So I left alone for 20 years before seeing it again, but it was not better for the second time. Mr Fraser is a good writer, but I'm not in film with Richard Lester. The slapstick bet, the "Three Musketeers" spoiled me, and the same thing happens here. For me, the movie is very tone and feeling is wrong. Flashman's book is fun in some fun episodes, but new adventures are. The adventures of Flashman are very serious - in short, it's in dangerous situations. This is given in the novels, but is not transmitted to the movie, due to its comedy style. It is a terrible pity if the movie was a lighter adaptation of the style of the book than could have been. When I read that the book was going to be filmed, he said that the article was the protagonist of Oliver Reed. I'm glad, Reed was the kind of Flashman for me. How I would love to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but does not fit the visual image of Flashman created by books (it looks like it looks like a flashman is a big horn). Neverlessless Reed was brilliant at Bismarck. The dying movie is made in comedy mode. The only scene that creates the book's atmosphere is Flashman's scene that kills Gautet (Tom Bell). A great pity, production values, clothing, sets, etc. They are excellent and they are excellent quizzes; All of the film is well distributed with Malcolm McDowell. It might be directed by Richard Lester's film director, because the latest adaptation of 'Flash For Freedom' adapted by Fraser was very well. Perhaps, maybe one day Flashman will see justice on screen.
