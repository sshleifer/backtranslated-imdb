Mixed mess from beginning to end. As they said about the Beatles' modes, there was a secret message if you backed the LP. If you are patient to watch the movie from the beginning to the end of the scene, you would get the same level of despair. <br /> <br /> Besides all the wild psychedelic flashbacks and fake beginnings, the brightest figures were the protectors of the movie, as if the movies were not revenged. They did not like about these two things. Abuses, cries and threats were delivered comic. However, I believe that a measure dimension is excessive. For that reason, the types of art are shaking their eyes, unlike them, because we did not achieve that. Well, I'm afraid I do not get anything. And two cardinals who carry the wrong movies from the beginning to the end. In this sense and a pathetic story, if you want to call it, and the worst of the distant, you do not at least take the only character you care about.
