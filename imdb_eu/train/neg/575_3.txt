This movie is not very good. It's boring, and there's not much blood for a horror movie. The plot just goes wrong. And I think the vampire woman was so stupid. Vampire hunters had many opportunities to kill, because it reflects them as lighting. But when he plays one of them, he just takes his time and something always happens, it does not bite them. It is not surprising that this has gone straight to the cable. <br /> <br /> LAST GREEN: It's not as good as the first Vampire movie. You are SUCKER if you lose time for this.
