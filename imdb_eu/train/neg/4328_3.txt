The title "National Lampoon" is completely guaranteed when death dies in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy, and anywhere else. It may be a US organization, but it's almost unknown to Europeans, "The National Lampoon Holiday" is not correcting this situation. Griswald is just awful: horrible. They are not fun. Clearly, Chevy Chase thinks it's fun, all Mrs. B. Di Angelo laughs a lot with her jokes, but pays and does not have to lose Â£ 2.50 for privilege. The section in England is typical. They are old-fashioned old-fashioned people, including Idle, Smith, Coltrane, Old Miss Lippman, old-fashioned old scams, Chase hotel passes ... yawn, yawn ... Bucking - Ham Palace, Big Ben ...... deceive I feel I've never seen Bobbies bikes two-by-two ......... Rosie kids with little kids - Dren, should I go? English buffoons are French fake Yank-haters. The Germans pomp and winds, (not mentioned war, Clark), and the Italians have huge moods. I forgot something? In all possible "comic" deaths, Mr. Chase is desperately gurned, sweet Mrs. Angelo, children are a shame. As a consequence of this franchise, you should not lose money because you do not lose money because you do not lose money.
