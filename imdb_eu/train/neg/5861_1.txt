When I first saw that movie in 1978 when I was in the second cycle of secondary school. I saw a date to see. I do not "get", I mean, the movie was so bad! Joan Rivers's journey was never so badly dealt with, as he deserved a great mark. In fact, unfunny is not enough to be a tough term: this movie is ANTI-FUNNY! You would feel out on the outside, whatever laughter might have been that could have happened. This is not worth it because of curiosity, or that it is "nonsense good". The MST3K gang could not even be worth watching. It is a miracle that Billy Crystal's journey to survive the ongoing attempt to commit suicide.
