I watched the whole movie for the participation of William Hurt, Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch. I'm glad I did not know about Peter Weller's presence. At the end of the movie I said "It was Peter Weller?" Mr Weller paid great attention to Mr. Wellerri. Weller played an important character, and his theater was unknown. In fact, it was a bad plot, it was a bad handwriting as well as the shows of Nosbusch and Weller. they were dependent. Landscape and setting were of interest, and Weller was amazing. <br /> <br /> 4 stars, 10 possible.
