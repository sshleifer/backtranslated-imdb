I remember when I saw this picture when I was 6 or 7. My grandfather received free video in commerce. I remember that it really sucked. The plot does not make sense. I hated the fox that turned Casper's friend. He was so stupid! Casper cried out to a friend when he could not find a friend. And what? Come on! The best thing about me and I do not want to listen to my enthusiasm when I fired the foxes and died at the end. I laughed at my amortization because this cartoon was so sucked. The bad news is that the fox revives and becomes a ghost. I would like to stay dead. I think I hate someone like that. No wonder they offered me a free trade. If you do not have a child, do not see them. They probably agree with me that they suck.
