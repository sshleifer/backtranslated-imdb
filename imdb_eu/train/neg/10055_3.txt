I grew up in the "Superman II" theater version ("S2T") and I loved the girl who had more Superintendent than I, Superman and three Superman criminals, started with a bang? ? Clark Kent Superman is the best transformation and rescue scene. Kids should no longer wait for Superman to wait on the screen, in Section I. As an adult, I see how adventurous that fell with S2T (See: my review.) I have always been back - the original director of Richard Donner, the original director, without preening and unwarranted, how they released it. (At that time it was very rare to shoot two movies simultaneously, now it is common: 'Back to the Future' and 'Matrix' for 2 and 3.) Sadly, Richard Donner Cut (or) has finally seen S2RD ") I can not even recommend it completely. Gone was a great scene of Superman change, the whole rescue of Paris, a summary of the first part of S2T's inauguration, in fact, wrote all the words: "Before Superman?" S2RD. Special effects were not excellent in part I or S2T but S2RD, especially those that were absolutely hilarious, such as falling into the window of the Lois Daily Planet, I admit, some new scenes of work and some exits were welcome, such as the scene of any "honeymoon suite", generally in S2T If you grew up like me, and I loved a child, as I did as an adult, do not crack, you should see S2RD with new experiences of childhood in close proximity to new scenes. (Spoiler alert) Unfortunately, change The worst thing that comes with the end: it also went am2 strange music S2T from 'I.' The exact end was replaced, the reason is not useless and plain, it is not sensible to return to the restaurant if Clark did not happen, and is it "is it time to go"?
