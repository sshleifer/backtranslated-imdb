As I have seen in TMC, it's cool in my head. It is evident that while the stars are great stars, they are not really running the show. First, they are divided into 2 groups - Moe, as "Shorty" and Larry and Curly as a wand, so there is no work at all. Two women not of interest to the love that feeds the soil are the only ones with any acting abilities; small music groups also have a strange thing. The music is exhausting, the cars are taken to the ranch and then dependent on horses. West dorky is a stupid wear, and there are many movies without a camera. By the way, this is, of course, after Curley's first blow, and the reduced energy is clear. Vernon Dent initially does not give roles. I loved all those guys that never did, including Curley, but this little dog is pretty bad.
