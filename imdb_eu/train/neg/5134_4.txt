SCARECROWS seems terribly afraid of supernatural film. A group of workers steal Robin Campbell's California payroll as paramilitary. They rob a heavy-duty aircraft with the demands of the rider and his daughter in Mexico. Along the way, a wealthy robbery decides to get some money to get it controlled by a sting-eater to get money out. These are not just birds every month ... they can die. The operation is not better than a horrible conversation. And humor attempts are not fun. Very low budget and shot in darkness. <br /> <br /> Throw: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
