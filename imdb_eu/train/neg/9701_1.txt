Really bad part. Section 1 had a lot of fun moments - Part 2 is bad (boring way) and, of course, it's a good thing to get money from fans. <br /> <br /> Get mad, Otto Waalkes! <br /> <br /> The funny little moment in the movie is Helge Schneider, but he seems to report on other characters. It's easy to identify with him ... <br /> <br /> The script is wonderful / not there. All managers should go away and immediately leave their job. Playing is worse than in the theater of the 2nd grade school. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's also a great movie, but can it blame the photographer or sound they had to work with the group that directs them?
