Frank Tashlin's "The Home Front" is one of the privately-owned movies of Snafu, a cartoon as a military teaching film. Snafu instead of adopting some unnecessary action to bring disaster into his home front home, "Home Front" also wants to offer his loved ones to war. Snafu realized that he was wrong when he thought. It is a concept that has little choice, and instead Tashlin plays the most dangerous cardboard, the dancers dance and dance dresses, instead of comic relief. The result is a summary, with little or no entertainment at present.
