You know that you have read in many other films, no doubt here, if you are reading comments, but the voodoo academy is still the worst film ever. Certainly, really bad are not available for purchase or viewing on television, but I think it's a good reason not to categorize the only mute renter mistaken. <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw two thirds of the lowest 100 ratings in imdb here, and I have the option of all others in all the options. Their heads and shoulders are mostly above ... absolute monotony. <br /> <br /> Some people who like bad movies (as well as those who have no humor) liked how much I like. You have to watch it to make it all the way. If you only see it, it's not bad. If you can see it with a single friend ... it's bad, but it might be worse. <br /> <br /> We needed five years for us to complete through voodoo academy. and also the funniest moments of seeing bad movies (for example, "boom mic", if I'm not mistaken for these 3 times) in fun moments, it could take a dry taste in your mouth. Yes, I saw it, but I also had to see 4 of my friends with me to get that end. <br /> <br /> I await and we prayed to cut the director ... thinking that this could be a version 20 minutes longer because eyebrowed lugs baby oil glands scrub their torsos because it just fears me. So much of this film is around it. <br /> <br /> David Decoteau praised this work for two days in a short budget for managing this lens, so I applaud people to persuade people to pay what they need to pay. Certainly, it is a celluloid version of some of its fetishes. But it's not a good movie. For a comparable amount of money, which was shot for a long time by the original horror stores (taking into account inflation), it was a very weird one. There is no excuse for how the baby is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br the steps of the film ... it is mad ... nothing is very interesting, because the decoteau pectoral car massage is a long time. whatever your alignment or sex ... scratches can only keep the screen time. <br /> <br /> It's an operation cheese ... but it's not very nice ... I've seen much better movies ... but some of the worst possible lines you ever hear in the movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rent this, if you're fascinated by me. worst, and you will only see it with a group of trained people. This is not a stirring affair. You probably want to skip a resistance test. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it will be a lot worse ... but I would not be surprised to be the name of the decoteau.
