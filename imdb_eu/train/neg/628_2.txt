This movie was a great horror movie. It was made by the main character, and I felt sorry for him, and there was nothing. However, everything else is sucked. Emmanuel's director does not make any sense. It now uses some of the attacks. <br /> <br /> - It uses a random sequence of random images scattered throughout the movie. I did not know he tried to be deep, intelligent, and poetic, but he did not. He was stupid Random plane of the main character trailer, random buildings, random random shots of random buildings, random cats. WTF? And the clouds. Dark clouds <br /> <br /> - This technique really liked having a scene cut into different shots, constantly shot. EX: Guy is trying to circulate around her lair and camera. Instead of just one shot, he edited on 10 different shots, so it's really EDGY! and HIP! and SMART! stupid <br /> <br /> The operation is awful, but the movie is so funny. And he is a gymnast of the scarlet, rotates and turns round and rotates. Some deaths may be better. The main blast you expect is a well-built death, but not. A simple cornflour in the ear. The interest of love was hot. Voluptuous That's why this movie gets 2.
