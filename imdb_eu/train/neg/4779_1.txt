I liked it in 2004 Then he became stupid. It suggests children are unmanageable. It insults children Cartoon Network was great. One of the shows I liked was Hamtaro. It was an interesting and imaginative vision of children's programming. The exhibition (Homemade Foster House) is like putting 20 spoons of your sprite sugar. It seems that today's television producers are only interested in making money, as well as gaining imagination and money! Lately, my children are tuning into old shows (60s) to find something interesting. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, TVs looked to the past and recycled children's programming.
