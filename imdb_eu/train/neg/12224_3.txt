Barbara Streis directs and stars the story in these very Jews. <br /> <br /> In order to get education, Babs loves to disguise the boy, which is a difficult thing because he already looks. a boy, anyway. In his new school he meets other men without classmates, who do not believe in a guy. <br /> <br /> Do not miss one of the best moments of unintended humor, a friend of Babs thinks he is a man. but they link it to the ground, "sitting" on it and lovingly looks at "his" eyes .... * snicker *. <br /> <br /> In the middle; an especially interesting story.
