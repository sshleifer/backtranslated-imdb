This was probably the worst film ever I've ever seen. I saw it with a great group of friends and after that, no one understood the plot. Unlike plots, theater was obvious, "special effects" were not so special, and writing was absolutely horrible. The film's recovery factor is very funny that it's pretty funny. You can not help it, but a zombie who was attacked laughed while the actors make a conversation. I would not recommend the movie for anyone looking for a good movie, but it's something that a group of friends can unite and laugh at. It's a joke between my friends, and from the 10th.
