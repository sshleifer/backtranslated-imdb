I think the cause of "The Best of Times" was lost. The initial premise (the guy who plays over the winning touch against a second-class team can never pass up and try to re-group the two teams again) is one of the most extreme moments I've ever heard. Because Ron Shelton started to write much better sports, I wonder if there was any more. I hope this film has not been clarified by Shelton's story as I wrote. <br /> <br /> So, we have the premise. You would expect to go from here, or hope, to make things so vibrant. There is no luck. This script continues the clue outlook that you can think of. There is no moment in this movie, you will not reach a kilometer while the movie shows up and the end ... If you can not get to the end of the first coil In your life you will not see another sports movie. They bring Robin Williams and Kurt Russell (and get bored). Williams was a great passion for Russell and he fired the unlucky passageway with the quarterback. Well, do you think Russell will do it again and correct Williams and the people that they have never forgot? This is a duck cordy comedy, with a duck-styled script, asking what might be shaken by what he can do. It is certain that there are some chuckles and, actually, it's really a fun scene. Williams and Russell have problems with civilians and they invite you to dine at wives to fix things. No one realizes Monday that they have been invited, yes, Monday Night Football. Having both teams playing a single victory, men (especially Williams) try to find out how they are tempted to play. The scene becomes soluble, as Williams verifies the score as a bathroom visitation adornment. Upon return, he gets a score from Russell. Later, while Russell begins to move with his wife Williams, the television starts to see it from another room. <br /> <br /> The scene is inspired and fun, in a most inspired and stupid movie.
