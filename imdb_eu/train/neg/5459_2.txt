In 1971, it was a short episode of "Night Gallery". Sue Lyon (the popularity of Lolita) and Joseph Campanella, children and vampires, respectively. The vampire invites the baby (a man seems to be a mum or a monster) while the blood comes out at night. The boyfriend looks like the vampire is completely ignorant for the first time, and only two and two begin to think that the reflection in the mirror does not reflect, when he unconsciously realizes that he has a curious library book. He listens to strange rumors while the vampire speaks to the child. It turned out that maybe the man he contracted was not thought of as an original. Opens the door, the vampire is shocked and the section is over. I do not know what the goal was for a shortened episode of 5 minutes. The first section of these 5 minutes would have to be expanded and they jumped. Total unnecessary effort.
