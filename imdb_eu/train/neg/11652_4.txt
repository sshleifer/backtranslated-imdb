The script for "Scary Movie 2" was not ready. This is a problem with the bug and audience. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans, and many actors is fun; so the movie is not completely funny. In their opinion, the movie has a lot of fun moments. But, in general, "Scary Movie 2" is not as clear and fun as the original. <br /> <br /> The first "Scary Movie" laughter was a minute movie. Slasher's nuances of the genre of the film made it the smallest in the gold comedy. The humor of "Scary Movie 2" is not what is original. Parody unexpected obvious opportunities lost. They are two star films of the "Beverly Hills 90210" band, which was a show to be a parody! The final analysis was opened as soon as the bottle of wine "Scary Movie 2" was fine. The script needed as much time. 2 stars with 5 stars.
