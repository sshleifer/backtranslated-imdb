You can not go away when the initial story is not very good. Cyborg's blood premix is ​​just dopey. <br /> <br /> Script is blasé. ' The actors do not work hard. Groups to reduce the costs incurred in the desert. It's a brand, if the background is desert, then it does not have a movie budget. <br /> <br /> A quote is missing, if there is a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of different works. But this film must change the appearance of the truck to buy a baguette. Again, if only the laxative story is just sucking. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie makes the biggest crime of all: it's not over! On the other hand, the rest of the film ends as a commercial break. But the rest will never come. Just odd <br /> <br /> Very bad.
