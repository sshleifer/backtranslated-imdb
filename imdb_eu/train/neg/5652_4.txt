This is not a bad movie ... but it is what your girlfriend sees. The story is not bad ... it's just that hour and a half so long. It's hard for me to throw this movie into the trash, I really like the idea, but it was just a long and thin story ... bad. The main character never seems to change everything from the beginning to the end. I mean that "change of life" goes through something and can make a smile a bit. I really think Mac was really good. His peculiar curiosity was the complete disaster. Maybe I did not get this movie. If anyone could explain to me, I would be informed.
