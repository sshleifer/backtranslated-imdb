This movie was a horrible God, from the execution of the conceptions. Should the United States establish a "Star Wars" site in this remote country? Is this your premise? It gets the chance to reach accessibility, so the US concludes: getting an obstacle course is to win as a crossword race, to win the lead by the leader. And who would play better this race called "Game" than a gymnast? Of course! A gymnast would be a great option for this mission. And do not forget that his father was operative. As for our heroine of happiness, gym equipment is in lukewarm places, in the middle of the square (without any reason) like a horse-horseman horse in the middle of the crazy people. Perfect <br /> <br /> But over and above the overriding premise above and beyond, the romantic falls of romantic scenes are, of course, very depressed ninjas, whose work only seems to reveal a flag. and the worst of the last point. After winning the race, our hero presents the wishes of the US government. And, on the other hand, he deserved all the effort, because the US got his "Star Wars" space! Huzzah! Is this your TRIUMPHANT ending? Wow <br /> <br /> But, despite being a bad movie, it can be very fun to watch. Only cover, representing ninjas with track tracks, was enough to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> But I would probably like to meet Kurt Thomas (the gymnast star) in real life, I would probably give his face a double face after a somersault 2 1/2 twists in the design position.
