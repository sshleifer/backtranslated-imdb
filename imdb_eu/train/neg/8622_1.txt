Since Crouching has come up with Tiger Hidden Dragon, there has been a lot of controversy about Hong Kong's film industry resurrection. Do not believe it. The people that make movies in HK give meaning to the sense. Running time is an excellent example of 2 times. Ekin Cheng is the name of the drawing, here, but he spent most of the movie in the stupid and dumped a coin. He turns the coins over and over and over again and again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lauk is a policeman who is swim in a pretty coin. But again: who knows why? She has a beautiful actress as a company, and has to pay a fee or something, but above all it looks just like a camera would be in a spa or shopping center. Nothing makes sense. No action There is no sex. No comedy There is a name: Ekin Cheng. And what do you know? Who is it for?
