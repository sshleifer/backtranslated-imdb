None of these people are Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc. Approaching, and yet, today's audience is not as receptive as this reward. It's a trivial handwriting. Soil plot is shivering and clear. Chemistry between major protagonists is essential. It's interesting that Julia Roberts seems to be a reincarnation of a Hollywood "golden age" star, whenever possible. It's an effect and he does not try to get it back in Richard Gere Runaway Bride.
