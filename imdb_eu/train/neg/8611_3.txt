When Rodney Dangerfield rolled down, it's horny. My 5 Wives is not doing it. The seasonal line-up is off, but it's the best for the movies. Five women wives do not add an entire actor among them. The plot is very weak. The premise is pretty weak; There are several jokes for many wives, but the situation is not all about anything in the movie. Most filmmakers would even play the same role if Rodney's only wife had a wife, so the premise seems like a fantasy of the ancient man rather than the essential part of comedy. Another age-old fantasy: Rodney's character is to be a skier of sports. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller seems to be moving away from a friend and on behalf of the rest. The actors must be disappointed at work. <br /> <br /> In the short film, the votes they make to political justice later do nothing in the movie. For those who like politically correct movies, humor is not yet in the first place and still seems like apology does not get any points. The film cave hates those who hate political righteousness, PC add-ons are just annoying digressions. <br /> <br /> I have to be the R type I have ever seen. There are some jokes breeds, and the rooms have made dramatic scenes 40 years ago, but that's why. Maybe the topless men (jokingly) were. <br /> <br /> The DVD has interviews where members seem to find themselves in a depth and importance in this movie and their roles. I wondered if they were ashamed. It seems as if it were a shame, but I thought: "They must be in a joke!" In addition, there is a special negation, since the film is never named Mormon or the Church of the Last Saints, this is not one of them. Keep in mind that the movie has a Utah polygamy religion and it refers to Brigham Young. <br /> <br /> In short, My 5 Wives was disappointed. I expected Rodney, but I can say that the best movie is that he was pushing Rodney over the past 80 years.
