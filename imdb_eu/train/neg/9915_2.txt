I've just finished the "Dark Camera" under the name of "Surveillance" and am impressed. No movie, no movie, but I've had a lot of criticism. The story was so destroyed by the holes in the plot and most of the plays were flat, it was appropriate to classify it as a comedy. Seriously, I shook my head and was surprised when I found this movie. <br /> <br /> Justin puts himself in the house with pain with intelligent murderer, although his mother goes to live with his parents, Abisua is not a good father. When a young woman was found dead, suspicious people living in adjacent Justin apartments are suspected. With the help of a couple of Pals, he installs hidden cameras to play them. As soon as the truth begins, Justin finds an unexpected secret. <br /> <br /> It's a positive point that Felissa Rose is HOT! I would use some or all of these extra stars if it was slightly down here, but it was not there anyway. It would be a potential savings for the movie. Eric Conley understood Justin well, I thought, and I would not be surprised to see more about him in the future. <br /> <br /> The general premise of the film, even if it's full of clichés, might be likely to have been worked out by "mere" interpretations of "essential" members, especially Alexandra Eitel (Kayla) and David H.. Rigg (Justin-in-father). Fear! (sorry puncture). <br /> <br /> I have nothing with low budget movies. Indeed, I think that independent films are the only hope for our future films. I will mix small budget movies to reduce the quality of the overall effects, lighting, musical scores and overall image. However, I do not give any improvement to the performance of the wand and the idea of ​​Swiss cheese lovers. There are a lot of low-budget competitive films. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I can not believe that some reviewers praised by "Dark Chamber" will at least be linked to their production.
