After seeing the previews, I thought this movie would be a nice improvement. So, I already expected the storyline to be missing, but at least this time it's not that powerful to load with a bunch of people. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you think about a fast line and a furious movie, this movie can only be imagined for you. <br /> <br /> The movie I've ever seen is the worst (I'm nice - I did not get a baseball as I would say to others' faces). It was not just history of the story, but it was just action. The director thinks he could throw the series of female and exotic cars and then call them a movie. For example, there is a sense in the film, where the guy pushes the button nos and his Lamborghini air goes out and flies over a SLR McLaren. And when Eddy Griffin entered into a fight with his "little girls" (a comment on Imus would work in this case), the girl asked to overtake the plane and, of course, in the middle. desert. After this wonderful scene I could not take it anymore. So I only saw half of that monstrance. This is the first movie that I shot for the first time. Then some drinks would stop my brain from killing all affected cells. <br /> <br /> I gave it to 0 because it was not an option. It is better for you to go to the local car show and stop at the way home. I will keep all audiences in my prayers.
