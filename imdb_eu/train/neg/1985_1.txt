Costumes, conversation, historical accuracy are awful. For example, - Stacey Dash and hanging scene. The rope was accurate (as can be said), but this kind of honey broke the neck of the person. Mrs. Dash hangs at the end of the rope, if she does not have a bad effect, until she shoots the rope. This type of non-astonishment does not surprise the person, he killed at the end of his death. <br /> <br /> And before stealing a bank (in a shining voice), they stop on the street. A group hug - whose bands hide their faces; people who could be evident show a "long walk" on the street, then returns the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that they kept riding a dirty scene, it seemed symbolic. The whole movie was empty.
