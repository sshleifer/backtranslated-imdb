When you go to an outdoor cinema in the summer of Greece, you do not care what the movie is! Edison was very fond of singer-songwriters and Morgan Freeman once again made a great effort ... (In a movie, it's a good start to catch the audience, make it a bit boring). However, the story is in the midst of the film about characters and It's done with less action, and the third part is a really good thing to remember in the movie ...) When you see 30 elite police officers (it's packed with weapons) it could be a demolition of a building), without firing a guy behind a car He can not even die while he dies (but 3) and then the guy throws the flame (the other 3 kills), you realize that in Greek summer. The sky full of stars is very nice to take care of such films!
