When I received this film for the first time, I was fascinated with the basic idea and I wanted to see what would happen. I am a fan of animation and I love direct action when it comes to the footage. However, it was all that I liked the animation of this movie. Actors' performances should be said to be excellent. Visual appearance - including animation - gave the piece of air a wonder. However, poor quality was lost in the image, in visual and written, when you first thought about it. Relative importance to the plot was annoying about it. It seems that the plot was shoe branches and, at an irregular stretch, the stuttering effect could cause the mass flow of the piece. Felisberto's voice, especially the last one, greatly liked the desperate despair of the gaps in the plot, like side-like aspects (and even more so). correctly addressed). I'm afraid the whole piece has come across, the first attempt made by a teenager reading DH Lawrence DH Lawrence wisely. The director of cinema does not expect it.
