A wonderful story about a family vacation family of dreams coming from a different family from the sub-genres "Hillybilly Horror". Do you know? Well, definitely, anyone should have a knowledgeable horror genre. Here is a completely new one. The film seems to be recycling old old topics (deformed hicks, a calm family shows the murderers of a powerful gun, but a rebel, a good heart and a strange ...) ... but that's enough to lose that time. This is to be forgotten, but J.D. Hart was the protagonist of the movie "Films that Suck" earlier in his career, but an iron tribute. <br /> <br /> My grade: D-
