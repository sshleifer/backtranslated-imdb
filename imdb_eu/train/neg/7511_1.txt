It has been one of the most ridiculous and misguided films I've seen for a long time. Spike Lee never liked it, but I thought I tried it: wrong. The film showed how the real murder of Sam's children was in the summer of 1977; According to what they did, drug problems, marriage problems, etc. I was looking for some of the most boring characters I questioned about caring, etc. They are just scenes that represent assassinations, and nothing more; shooting and sunday the night of midnight is coming back! Spike Lee is the most rewarding opportunity to appear as a reporter: Spike, trust me, you're not Hitchcock, stay in film, get worse. Did the stupid scene be full of goat's goat in the place where she was depicted in a scene in front of her? Spike, what did you think of this movie? Do not think my intention. People who see a crime drama take my advice and do not lose or lose money and money. You better watch Jerry Springer in this case! I spent 10 out of 10 on the waste of the movie: unhappy.
