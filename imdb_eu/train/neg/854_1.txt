Please, ladies and gentlemen, do not be fooled by the tags of "A Stanley Kubrick". This film has been very bad among horror films ever unfortunately made. People had to think about a terrifying horror movie. Shining is not afraid of horror, but it is nothing more than foolish attempts to create horrible horrors. whether reality is different. Everyone in the movie is a vision of the frozen valley. Most hotel actors seem good too. Jack Nicholson looks like a lazy soul that loses a word, never knows what to do. There is no point in mind. A colored actress will usually look for a humorous actor. There's no need to blame for bad weather. The film was not avoided and the poor Kubrick did not make any changes.
