I've finished watching the movie 10 minutes ago ... WWW I have not seen what I've seen. <br /> <br /> EVER is the worst movie. If I list all the bugs in the movie, this review would take me a lot of sentences (very funny mistakes, even if it's wrong) <br /> <br /> You should be surprised. Commands assigned to rescue the plane. They did not know how to move too. <br /> <br /> The ice is so bad a actor ... and what I do not understand is how to make a production like a hero, but it's zero .. <br /> <br /> Of course, big mistakes They will land on the 747, only need 3 or 4 tips for a man of transmission to land the plane ... amazing ... because there is hardly a dead body. <br /> <br /> But it is highly recommended to watch this movie, which is very interesting to see if something is wrong
