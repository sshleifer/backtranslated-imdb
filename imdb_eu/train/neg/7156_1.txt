Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Well, the resistance of a movie made it after the test. I made the move forward on the ground. Only knows the Lord <br /> <br /> Maybe I am! Maybe I do not have the film's premise ... or maybe I do not think the supposed atmosphere is mystical. In my low opinion, the movie has a mystical atmosphere as McDonald's journey. <br /> <br /> In addition, the characters were horrible and there is more development of cartoon characters by Tom and Jerry. Yaarrrghhh! Why do I do it? Why do I see such trips? It's enough to run away and join the Monastery or Foreign Legion! YAARGH !! An awesome movie about all respects. In addition, it's not bad.
