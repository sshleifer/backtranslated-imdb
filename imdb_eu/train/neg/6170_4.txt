This movie starts to slow, but eventually the action starts, it's a bit too much. I could not understand why some events happened, and there were many events before explaining it, to be confusing. The only thing that really matters is a large amount of blood / gore, although most special effects are lacking. Blood Kool looks red. The skins are scratched, like a pile of sticks. Once again, the story has something like love, just like the writer did not have to do it for a long time. Much better could be a movie, if the effects are made better, I get more time with the script. Honestly, I did not see that I did not see it, not for sleeplessness, but I feel that I've lost 90 minutes of my life. If you like movies that are very popular, that's it for you, otherwise, take it away.
