Since it's a real Elvis fan, this movie is wonderful and the script is a disaster. The beautiful son of the movie "Stay Away" opens and the landscapes of the Grand Canyon gives the audience a glimpse of something special. Elvis gets into an image and his talent is wasting time, especially in the rest of the songs. I was sitting twice with this film, it's simply a piece of rubbish! 10 to 10 !!!
