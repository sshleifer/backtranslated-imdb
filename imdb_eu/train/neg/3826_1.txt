Damn, I thought I saw the bad Western. This can not be ended. I think hell I would rather rub my eyes in front of a triple trick. I do not think I can see Ben Hur again, without laughing at my ass. Really bad <br /> <br /> But, if you like the stupid western we like with huge stars, look at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's bad, but it's a lot more fun. 1/10
