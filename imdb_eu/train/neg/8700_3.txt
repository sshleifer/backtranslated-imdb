I really hope that Concorde / New Horizons was not a serious horror, or even an action movie on Carnosaur 3. The movie is nonsensical from the beginning to the end. C3 humor is also fun, it's bad. There is no doubt that there is a great watermark in the genre 'So Bad is Good'. If you enjoy the worst, this is for you.
