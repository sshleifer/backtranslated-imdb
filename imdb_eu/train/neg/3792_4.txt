I've seen several Nutcracker productions. Now, perhaps, I saw this movie from contaminated views of a theater director, but I was disappointed. I am convinced that people of specific choreographic ballet businesses seem to be impressive, but I have found it to be a "no-movement" because of the lack of design and choreography in theater only. It was traditionally similar to "strange" and incredible costumes (for example, sweets were not like candy, like rats were not like rats, but like chocolate mice); the performance was perhaps weak. On the screen too much weakened, and choreography just did nothing for me. This shows the whole show is very beneficial (at best) as if it were not intended to distinguish it from any other production. But remember, again, this is the theater director, not a dancer or choreographer, but a direct director of male theater.
