Hg is usually exploiting and never worried before me - I loved "bloodfeast 2", but I really do not like pseudo-science or heuristic playing. The entire film is based on an electric accident and a man inspired by witches. I'm not against witches, and I liked "carrie" (novel and movie), but this made me worry about me. I think it's the main character that has developed from an electric line. Also, the university professor learns his time in unnecessary cases. In the 1960s, I did not know whether to know whether it was common or not, but I assume that any theory of this nature will be inadequate. He really worried me when the police described the schizophrenic, unlike ordinary people, they could retain 99% of all the time they felt normal. nothing more can be from the truth. I hate these concepts because they add public idiocy. Many people still think that schizophrenia is a confusion of dissociative identities. This writer who wrote this script did not know much about psychology. <br /> <br /> There were some decent films about it. The witch liked how he used men; It was a nice change. I liked how attractive it might be, but it was not about poor love. The second lover was also interested in burning his face. a few weeks before the production had been recorded as if it were not a script, when the public became more rigorous, perhaps it was a decent movie.
