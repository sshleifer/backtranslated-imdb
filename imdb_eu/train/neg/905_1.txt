An unmarried woman named Stella (Bette Midler) is pregnant by a wealthy man (Stephen Collins). The duty to marry for the marriage, but it blurs itself and decides to raise it by itself. The thing is that Jenny (Trini Alvarado) turns baby into a teenager until things get gradual (and predictably) worse. <br /> <br /> I saw the silent version of "Stella Dallas". Nobody caused me too much (and I cried easily), but it was well done, if it's dated. Trying to rebuild in 1990 was a stupid idea. I think Midler is the power behind the incomplete success of "Beaches". This (predictable) is bombarded. The story is silent according to current regulations. Although Midler and Alvarado give good performances, the movie is really stroking and I get bored for the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (two good actors) do not help in supporting roles. Terribly and sad Really, who believed that this would work? See the Stanwyck version of 1937. I give this one
