I watched this movie on a local TV (TV8's "Big Chuck and Little John" in Cleveland, Ohio). I never heard this movie and I decided to see it. <br /> <br /> I do not know if a thesaurus can be used to help explain this movie. The script is horrible. Even though the play, with two exceptions, is no sense, there is nothing worthwhile in any kind of effort. <br /> <br /> It seems small ideas, coming from different writing sessions. he went into the blender. It's not just fun. The "Parody" is tightened in the best part. Some references are not up to date (as well as in the version). It's not surprising I never heard that, it's very bad, worse than anything Saturday's Live Live, MAD TV or In Living color is also its worst day. <br /> <br /> If you watch on TV, it's an excellent example that you do not want to make a movie. Whatever the case, do not get damaged. <br /> <br /> Adam
