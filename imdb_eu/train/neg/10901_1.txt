And over there "no" more. Voodoo Academy is undoubtedly the least ambitious movie of all time. What does it try to do exactly? Tell a story? Of course, no; As it has been indicated, many people just play it. So is the essay of subversive homoeroticism? Well, perhaps, it never never happens in the form of harmless and painless forms of male relationships. (This is not for delight, eighty thousand times). It's a kind of horror film; is she trying to? It is not because the director did not want to make his "work" without title and title <br /> <br /> <br /> I never had a short film in my life. This is the boring and useless thing I have ever seen. As soon as the Voodoo Academy acquires horror genres, zombies, and gay movies, it sells them in an outfit, and then, through coffee filtering, it only replaces the coffee filter that filters coffee beans. everything that is vital, edgy or interesting. The result is a 74-minute movie, just as exciting as a glass of warm water, only 10 days after Gin Binge, it is inevitable that you may experience the abomination of this human effort.
