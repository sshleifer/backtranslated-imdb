This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I started thinking about a couple of actors with my actress. Now, I want to punch Jason Schwartzman to take that face. I was physically ill after watching the movie. Occasionally, Hollywood does not understand. We are trying to avoid many people and I am also sure that you can overflow and get the best deal. The worst film you do in this way is Ferris Beullar's slurry instead. They extracted gag and jeans like a hair doll, it was added to the movie's mood. I was glad to avoid this movie and I watched it on TV. This proves you have to avoid releasing January notes.
