This series would be much better if they were just a simple thing: Made Ian McShane Code name: Diamond Head Code name instead: Tree. Diamond Head needed someone who could handle the role of the evil character, McShane proved someone who proved Lovejoy. Roy Thinnes, the real Diamond Head, is true in so many functions. McShane is not really bad as good as a tree. In France, Nuyen's character, Tso-Tsing, can not take himself into account that he is a tough and willing woman to fight the wicked or struggling victim. He really won at the last hour when he had to play Diamond Head's lover. After seeing one or two episodes, I started to look after nobody. Trees hate us, but Diamond Head does not like us anymore. Unfortunately, in the 1970s, the spy genre was not quite like in the 1960s.
