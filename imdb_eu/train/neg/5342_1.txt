Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are here. The Dark Knights are worthy of their performances. I'm a TV fan of TV. Their musical rocks are very talented! SARCASM !!!!!! I'm a great indicator !!!!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The performance is terribly weak, the conversation is horrible and the jokes are not running correctly (I feel the director). It's so unbelievable to joke that the 8 small and passionate fans of the S Club do not laugh. They thought they could do better. And they did it. The world was conquered. They became S Club Juniors. Paul, "he started a mosh band, a fat and ugly man", thanked his star congratulations. Never made a bad movie. Beware THOSE THEM! DO NOT go and see! You will not tell! CHOOSING YOU! 0/10 RJT
