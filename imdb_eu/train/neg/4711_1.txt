I really hate this show! I saw one episode, and I knew that this show was so terrible. Storytelling is poorly written and executed and the jokes are very bad ... I mean Dexter's Laboratories and Johnny Quest's hopes are "flaming with smooth, twin hair." genius sisters and talking dog; Homemade dad stay and intelligent mother and very busy ... Oh-my-flippin'-like God! Father's mother is the founder of the home, she's not so gay! If my father is a founder of the household, I would personally die! It's a pity ... I really would. <br /> <br /> I do not have anything about it ... I have no word whatsoever; count 3 words to describe: <br /> <br /> · Lame, · Stupid, and especially ... · F ** K UP! That's what everyone is saying, I'm definitely doing the worst TV series EV-ER! I have one.
