I watched this movie in my English classroom this afternoon and this version was very bad. I did not write poorly, it was just as good as George C. Scott Scrooge, but the rest of the casts do it very badly. Sometimes I could not stop laughing at the stupid rhythm and repeated lines: "Merry Christmas!" Other times I stayed almost crazy. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the story of a rich Charles Dickens story, and does not believe that Christmas is humorous. After 30 minutes, we visit the rich three ghosts, then convince them to celebrate Christmas. minutes, so it can be well valued. Instead of a piece of rubbish, I recommend you, Scrooged comedy Bill Murray. At least it was fun ...
