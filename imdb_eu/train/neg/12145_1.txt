Since I have received this title, I think this movie is the worst movie zombie of all time. Plays, cameras, scripts, special effects, and any other things that are related to that movie remotely. People have argued that this film is incredibly playful and incredibly productive, but it comes with a smart and intelligent script. Wow The plot has more holes for me or others can probably count. For beginners, why would they say that governments are safe for everyone to work? I know the government thinks they are evil, but they do not earn anything when the whole population of the country dies. Nobody would rule! Another thing I was asking about was that, despite the government's promise to go to work, why would people go by the streets to shake the zombies? Did the zombies hide in the bushes and help them to kill the unexpected people so that the government can kill all of the planet in their plot? And at the end? Torch stupid guy sacrifices his life to get some shots of some zombies. You have probably forgotten that each camera in the last 35 years has a zoom function. And another thing, why does Hindenburg say before he dies? Hindenburg was a strange event that saw very few people. All threatening zombies will be visible in the country, perhaps in the world. Does not anyone think that they will make photos? Likewise, the soldier who managed to lose only the semi-interesting scene of the movie was watching exotic dancers. Why did she hide the area after five minutes behind a curtain girl's attack? Especially, the area could come with PORTA. Probably a cinematic movie like zombie that could not understand me should understand something. Every day I pray that God has the power of the brain longer enough to feed all the subtle nuances to the mass of feeding. <br /> <br /> I think it's interesting that this was the first movie that he gave me. the people involved in the production want to physically hurt. Hey Trent Haag, you call me!
