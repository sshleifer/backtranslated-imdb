* BACKGROUND COLLECTIONS * <br /> <br /> With the title "Bleed". You know that creative juices did not work when this dog was born. The movie is a basic movie for your low budget Slasher movie. Oh, surely, he tries to be a creator because it is a premise of "murder club", but we know that this was just a joke. Well, those who really care about these things, in the basic plot, the young girl of the town begins to start working with her. Invites his friend to the circle, and at a party they say how they say "murder club" and kill people, blah blah blah. Well, we know it was a joke, but before our heroine killed a lady in a parking lot. Now, Murder Club "members" are dying one by one. Oh, and the bad guy wins and the movie ends in a downer. By then you will not really care. <br /> <br /> Looking back, the first 10 minutes of this film make no sense. The motivation for murder at the beginning of the film is never explained. I would say that the director was a way out of the movies, but there are scenes that are deleted on DVD! I do not know if someone wanted to see more than the version of "Bleed", but apparently the people behind the DVD believed that the audience demanded more. In the box, it's been said that there are no Easter eggs, but why would I not lose the time I was looking for the extracted movies? <br /> <br /> I was expecting a bad movie and it was given to "Bleed". It was not a bad movie. Everyone has a good look at the movie, and there are many nudity, but the performance is horrible. My favorite character is a character that continues to be a murderer ... I think it's fun and fun, but it's just ending up as an instrument. The funniest moment in the movie lies in the fact that our heroines are dying of a woman in the parking lot, mortal and not accidental death. The heroine will put women in the cement cellar parking lot and she seems to be almost unmistakable, and the blood is blooded and "dead". <br /> <br /> Look for "Bleed" for those who think of a complicated and creative process of creative professionals. Your opinion will change, and you will realize that you can get any hack that can make a movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not waste your time or money for that.
