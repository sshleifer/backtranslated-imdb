I want to clarify some things. I do not know the Ming-Liang Tsai movies, and I know the art film; Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others grow in the sixties. Art films are then ART; like paintings. People talked about their inner feelings, who really worried others understand it. They were out of business value; Look at some ancient Antonioni (or the first Picasso) and you can understand it. <br /> <br /> Tian bian yi duo yun (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with it. The movie is an opportunistic film to deceive judges and critics, many things to say without saying anything, <br /> <br /> The story does not make sense. Water is missing from the government to promote the hydration of watermelons. A girl with dismay has stolen public toilet water from the toilet. It seems that a pornographic film (neighbor) does not want to make a movie that does not want to make a movie. There is a romantic awakening between the baby girl and the porn star. People end up with a sex scene (not pornographic) that many people are surprised, but I think it's less provocative than American Pie or History of Violence. <br /> <br /> The two main characters never talk. Sometimes a 60-style musical appears and explains what happens in the mind of the characters (through a song). These videos are really welcome, people who only watch the previous scene, no conversation or music, take 4, 5 or even more minutes in the movies. <br /> <br /> "Sexually Inexpensive Difficult" is also referred to as "the reactive enthusiasm of the porn industry". <br /> <br /> It is evident that he wanted to deceive this movie with festivals (jury and critics). There are some pseudo-stunning scenery (within the limits of the censorship of Taiwan), and many subjects are open, but nothing is deduced or free. <br /> <br /> These tricks were shot at some of the great movie festivals and they got a commercial success merit (I see the movie in France and the theater is full). <br /> <br /> However, please do not be fooled. There's nothing new or original, or originally filmed or shot in this movie. It's boring and empty; public fraud Boogie Nights (I really did not like it), Intimacy and 9 Songs are much better movies.
