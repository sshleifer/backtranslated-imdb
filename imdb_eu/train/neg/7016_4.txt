A film about a club of the same name of the Seventies is 54. He has a classic bartender that looks good. Sexy women The owner of all Partying. When all chaos is linked together, it seems that the bartender (Phillipe) plays a bigger role in all. <br /> <br /> I will be as honest as possible, avoiding as much as possible. Unfair or fake comments (for example, it's a 'ok' movie). I will definitely find that the film is totally wonderful. When I sit down to watch a movie with Salma Hayek, I'm always waiting for her to see her beauty, at the same time I'll play it with a brilliant performance, but, in fact, she remembers me quite without talent. I would really like to say what has ever been achieved by the masses, among their horrible dance table, 'Dusk Till Dawn' ...? The same goes for Ryan Phillippe, with the other poor actress who plays nothing on the screen, but who plays a good look and a totally sad face. Mike Myers is not as bad as 2; At least, it's worth the movie. 54 Founding founder of the club. The way he most hates the type he sees most (that is, a good job), puts it in a conventional small performance that made me enjoy the short film. But, alas, it's not enough to have nothing to do with rescue. The bad movie I found a lot of "bad" movie out there, but that's not it. Neve Campbell is not very bad, but it's just "there". The story is sad, it seems that the writer wanted to add a style and decorative movie, and wanted to add something else. Any meaning Any class Nothing. Like most ornaments, they are mere vain objects, which are just like beautiful looks, very similar to the film's disaster base. <br /> <br /> I spent really an hour and a half. Better something much more exciting, talking with 90-year-old relatives around the weather around the phone.
