The worst thing about Crush is not that it's pretty bad or that it does not exist at all, and much less that camera work can be better. <br /> <br /> No, the worst thing is that you are going to come up with the most amazing moments from this movie. <br /> <br /> But in the end, it's too small, it's too late. You are a fan of violin music and 40+ women's dreadful scenes by crying and embracing and talking about babies and weddings - and, by doing so, do not miss. <br /> <br /> I am not myself. Certainly I saw the things mentioned in a movie and, therefore, I had a great time. Completely shiny jokes can not solve everything else. <br /> <br /> Judgment: 4/10. I missed time <br /> <br />
