Although I often used other sites to see what other people are saying to be a defiant or just pleasing movie, I felt the need to write something down at night after "seeing this four film", though it cleared me. again. <br /> <br /> I have never been to the movie experience, Danny Dyer (23? sure?) and Gillian Anderson (it will always be Scully Leonard Nimoy). Spock will always be) does not have any real substance on them. I do not know if the first half-hour of the movie had a last-minute operation, but surely you would like the empathy among the victims of a vengeance ... I do not care less here. In fact, the only thing that they looked after me was the dog, being the second in Celtic. And both the animals Dire (sic) and Scully, were quite pretty horrible to play. I think that I am just as good as the script provided, and I want to thank the writers, producers, directors and castors, 90 minutes of my life and some good electricity.
