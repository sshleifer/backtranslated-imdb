This movie liked me. But it falls in the middle. The premise is very good and well connected, but the center is a tangent. I watched when people were upset about the course that was going on, and hoping it would end sooner than that. Another person slept in the middle segment! For a few days I found them in the dreams that I crossed through the parts of Schtick, which were unrelated to the plot. I bought it for an eye candy and I delivered it well, but Pixar's handwriting and writing is lacking. I think that 8 years and less will the kids face their faces while remaining in the plot. It's too easy for a crowd to continue to land and get it quickly and easily. Edit most of the middle sections, make them 50 minutes and it would be a good flick. I would like to say better things. But I do not
