This is a typical example of technically trained video clips trying to make their first full feature film. On the one hand, they have images, cameras, lights, CGI and even polished sound and expensive looks and "feelings". Although the actors show a certain amount of potential - the best art practice could not be hidden from the bad plot. <br /> <br /> In this case it is not a bad plot, but it's hardly a plot. <br /> So, 50% of the interview is: "What the hell was that?", "What's that?" and "What the hell was that?" In every case, no character or viewer gives any response. In most other interviews there is a feeling that there has never been a dialogue book and they should improvisate a plot of the actors never before. <br /> <br /> The only reason why it was. Skye Bennet's interpretation may be so good, as her autistic girl, that her actors should interact with each other so that she could give her an interview with tragic lines. In this way, cast performers could not approach it and showed their active talent. I mean that there are no other actors in the world, such as a conversation: <br /> <br /> Ben: is it authentic? Emily: Stop. Ben: a mass psychosis, right? Jon: Someone must take control of this situation. Ben: This situation can not be controlled. You do not have anyone, no one. Emily: You do not even have one. Well: No. <br /> <br /> Goosebumps. But not for horror, more intense attempts. At some point I felt ashamed that the actor added to his life. <br /> <br /> 2 great technical star.
