I am a fan of Columbo, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it was fun to watch Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this section was very lacking. The original plots and plots were obvious and pre-invented, even though today's modern detectives show up today. But it was fun to see a softer model and "modern" electronics equipment and, of course, fun for suburbanite mandatory humor to sell modern art. The high-tech house is a Tomorrowland Jetson or Disney version, and it's fun to think of writers who guess these "fun-out gizmos". <br /> <br /> If it's sunny on the outside, play, it's much better for Columbo episodes. However, we should be thankful for Cable TV, which was broadcasting these episodes.
