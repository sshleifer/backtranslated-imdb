Okay, as an orthodox woman living in Boro Park, I'm going to have a bit of going against this movie. However, it seems that Boaz Yakin's movie was just that he was an Orthodox-bashing. Our hairdressers, a modest outfit, and extra seating are already pretty easy. Yakin never surpassed. The result is a movie with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi has told Sonia that he loves G-d or more than his parents. He then defends his father's command deliberately, because he does not swim because of his bad health. 2. Sonny flattens her son's breeze. Why did the startling female monkey have a strong reaction? It's hard to believe that he never attended. In fact, the reformers also have bris milah events today. 3. Mendel was sleeping during his Chosson classes? His wife's passion implies satisfying herself in bed and stop cushioning the street. Most of the streets of Boro Park, above all. 4. Sonia and Mendele should have been married for a year and now realized that they did not have each other? A small clue - organized weddings does not mean that a girl should take the first type that her parents have created. Nor will the community be harmed if the marriage does not take place. 5. If Sonia had really wanted to enter the business, she did not have to go on her hairy brother-in-law. There are orthodox doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Instead of taking control of life, things went back and forth, and then he said he did not get the result. This is not in the face of one's own environment; That is the favor of the stereotype. It's true, I think he deserved it.
