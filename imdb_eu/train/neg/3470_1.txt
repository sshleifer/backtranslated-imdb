As with most Ben Affleck movies, comedy is dry and it's about to predict the story. This is if you want to call a story. Many points were left untouched. I would like to thank the Director for explaining the points better. I say that, because torture lasted longer. As for Ben Affleck's failure, this is no exception and only other actors can survive. However, the majority was thought to act and was not compelling. Memorial trip with non-performing actors in the year is not worth the price of admission. They thought everything was to be thought, even when they came to "be quick". My choice was to wait for my car to get ready or to watch the movie. I made an incorrect decision. In general, I gave him a laugh ... especially what I have done.
