This movie is similar to Conan Barabari, but has more sex, rape and murder. Under this farm there is a plot somewhere, but filmmakers do not show a good job, that is, because it's shameful, it could be a decent story. Richard Hill gives a strong performance in the main role, the criminals did not appear in all other notes. The scenes of the battle are not too bad. I love Deathstalker who allows him to drink the blood of his sword victim - and there are bosses and sex to fill the general level of machismo. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's not good - but not necessarily bad either ...
