This should be the worst thing, and I mean the worst film ever I've ever done! And that's a lot to say, because the stinker lines are long and smell! <br /> <br /> Now, at least, we know what happened to Ginger since he saved Gilligan's Island! Tina Louise looks awesome (surely someone was scared to see this mess!) It's a biker who is racing motorcycle racing on a motorcycle. But do not worry about fans! Batman, I mean that Adam West rescues as a medical hick-town! Pow! Crush it! Boom Holy of Toledo, Batman! <br /> <br /> The good points of "Bomb" are some cute women, the fights are dark and still "sexy" Tina Louise!
