I can say that it was better than the gymkhat, at least my money was not waste. <br /> <br /> Then I saw the Deadly Ground on Steven Segal. <br /> <br /> This film would have to be seen even in MST 3K resurrection. If he conquered Santa Claus, Martyrs might blow Tom Servo's head, and he asks himself what the cause may be. <br /> <br /> Kurt Thomas is a very good reason he never has a movie career. <br /> <br> Writers of Dreck should have put all of their life's newspapers "Bitch Slap!" I mean. I was a Gymkata writer.
