This film features excellent neorealist generations / realists and tells a story that is free of freshness with Hollywood sack. Could not be an independent foreign film. But some scenes are too long (especially the wedding), and the excessive theater abuse and conversation seemed to be better suited on the stage than the silver screen. <br /> <br /> The interview focused on particular attention, and it seemed worse for the movie to continue. Most Italian-American characters or Italian Americans living in the thirties and thirties were Italian immigrants, but they were focusing on Shakespeare's acting lines while they were cemented and brick in the conversation. At last I was laughing, and I did not want filmmakers to like me. I think that, according to the stylist poetry, it would be possible to say that the characters would speak Italian and talk the conversation literally. But it does not work for me. <br /> <br /> Another line of conversation laughed me for another reason: the main character, born in New York City and grew up in the 1920's, suddenly catches him. British accent I only guess that this was something that was made in England. <br /> <br /> I'm giving this film an 'A' in the effort and intent, but the execution level is considerably lower.
