This is the first time I write a comment on a IMDb film. but I had to write this. No abuse for three hours. From the beginning, think of it as a bad movie. acting is pathetic. I am a fan of Ajay Devang (I loved Bhagat Singh) but this is his worst movie. It seems that amitabh has worked hard, but somehow he is afraid. prashant raj is not an actor. and the biggest part of the movie is Nisha Kothari. I do not know why the director took it to this film. background score is repetitive. In some ways, I tried to repeat the camera angles, the color theme, the background score, the angle of the camera, but it did not work. Please do not look at IT
