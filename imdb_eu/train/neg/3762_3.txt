I took this movie out of Blockbuster at one of those parking lots, like 5 movies of 20 films. I should say that they deserve my money about that. I expected a horrible conversation, unhappy monsters and heavy cameras. As stated by Meatloaf, two out of three are not bad. <br /> <br /> The play is a bad one, although I have not seen some films. Or maybe I've seen low-budget movies I've lost sight of it recently. It's a bit bit that the performance is awful, but at least it's a High School Play level. <br /> <br /> Sasquatche's CGa is the second worst movie. When I saw that (and when another reviewer agreed with me) when I thought, a stick stickman would be a better man. Clunky stop-motion animation would be better. <br /> <br /> So you'll ask why I call CG the worst part of the second. This is the worst piece of the movie as sound effects. They are loud, annoying and constant. I walked out, I know what insects are like in the woods, and although they may be loud, they are not as crazy as the cacophony of the movie. Usually the "background" sounds when the movie is drowned in the conversation, it's bad, but as I caught the conversation in this movie, I did not miss it. <br /> <br /> The action was strange and boring. The tension did not exist, as it was with the empathy of the characters. Talking about the characters, they cut all the cookies. It was nice to play ... I really can not think anything about it. There were one or two lines, they smiled, but that was about it. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was a decent one, one or two steps that you would usually see in a movie. However, "home movies" still had a quality change in pockets and films made with prayer. <br /> <br /> If you think you like it and if you look for old short budgets and see it in the dollar box, think about it. Otherwise, keep away all costs.
