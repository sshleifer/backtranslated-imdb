When I first started watching this movie, I saw Buffy, the dude of Xander, and it seemed to me that the film's still-honest activity. Now I notice a strange movie, David Lynch films, twins, lost highway, etc. However, this reminds me of the crazy websites of conspiracy theory, which have no sense. Would you like me to make people who interact with Nazi Americans, make a third-rate trinity of the most powerful wicked? I was surprised that the plots of this movie were not mere Hitler dishes and people of musk. I might like 60 grams of heroin that would make sense with this movie, but I'm not serious about medication, if I do not have this exception. It should be burned, crushed and forgotten. Xander would get another theater job. It was not his performance, it was fine, but the script does not make sense. I'm sorry.
