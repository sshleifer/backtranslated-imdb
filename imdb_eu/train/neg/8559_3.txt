"It's just as hard to describe as exciting as it is to make relationships similar to drama similar to drama, such as drama, counter-creation and even more money and things like that." - Ellen missed a quote. "Kissing, Like, On, Like, Mouth and Stuff" has never been the best artistic effort ever made. As Ellen's handsome kisses and Chris masturbated, my long-lasting movie experience and things like that were. But I like US-20-something to break new airhead records with my "liked" before, let it be a short list of high-speed audio visuals like this: <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. Chris deeds through his genitals. And not only that: the camera (which is so elegant by guided by Ellen and Patrick) rewards the viewer with Chris's trash full-blown reddish screen, which was really exciting after the end of the Catholic event. I can honestly say I have never seen such grace. For Chris, for example, you should make more scenes in your next films, as Lars von Trier and his "Idiots 95" man would have to follow this brilliant and brilliant. After a quick and then hairy, fatty and white belly, what more could you ask for the movies? Needless to say, I can sit all day and I can see Chris ejaculate (although I am direct) ... This poetry is moving. Such elegance, that style. The divine inspiration began to film this sequence, as well as a strong Zen philosophy. Although Barbra Streisand could not get more spiritual than this. <br /> <br /> 2. Ellen's hairy and thick arms. The close reflection of the camera of photography, which is very well illustrated by our two photography photographers (I can not stress enough), Ellen and Patrick, have often caused their sexual identification to be confused. When we saw some scenes as part of a body (leg, arm, or foot), it was often an invention game: the parts of the body belong to a man or a woman? Of course, Chris and his associates, Ellen, Patrick and Whatsername, are directing themselves, creating their own body to create a genre-based confusion. Sometimes it was difficult to see the leg of women or men. Patrick is so thin and hot in his movements, so hairy and impersonal, Ellen and the other girl are very slender, with legs and thick arms. Brilliant <br /> <br /> 3. Excellent - especially the path that is linked to the topic of recovery of sexual roles: so original and stupid. She plays like a man in Ellen, she wants sex all the time, and her father Patrick wants to talk like a girl. Spiffing <br /> <br /> 4. Ellen looks for her left pair. "He loves Simpsons, quite to the left". I'm glad that I decided to break a long tradition in order to offer the left intelligent leftovers. Ellen is refreshing and realistic. The number of "likes" with less than 80 friends and their liberal friends is actually phenomenal (3,849, more precisely). They got the least effort at the big screen that they set in real real life and that's why I applauded them. <br /> <br /> 5. Observations proximity. There are many things for foot fetishists, and I think it is a very liberal and highly praiseworthy way of looking at sexual minorities. In the end, shoemakers and pedestrian fetishists are offered so little in modern cinema, so it's nice to see someone who is CARES. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> KOTM, or rather It offers more than KLOTLMAS. It is not just a small crowd that works solely on shelves of low-lying movies, in a senseless conversation. No, it's much more than that. It's about the light that drives all foolish creatures; The wannabes of pseudo-artistic peoples who have abandoned the film school, who want to disturb the life of the demanding life and to make our senses disturb, will play well in pretentious festivals like Sundance and Cannes to win. The necessary exposure, therefore, for real money for a change, will then be hired by Sean Penn and George Clooney to promote the saving of this planet and solve all of the prevailing political problems in this world. Which is the best way to make porn at the beginning? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Ellen did the camera here, as clearly indicated in the final credits, then who was the camera camera while in front? Probably they were hired for pedestrians and they were thrown into the hands of the camera ... <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~ Fedor8 and look at my "TV and film: 150 cases, the worst Nepotism list".
