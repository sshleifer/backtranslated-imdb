Sorry you can not vote for a zero review on the IMDb, I would not doubt it! In fact, I would say that the movies were negative stars. <br /> <br /> Like many others, I bought this movie because it's Michael Madsen, I think it's good ... No choice! This movie was amazing! Imagine the length of the movie "The Bold and the Beautiful", but Primal Instinct did not approach it well, and I thought it was a long movie that was "not as beautiful as it would be." <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how can we do that? It was the worst part, I did not go a bit, and at last I thought that the joke was sick, it was unthinkable, it was fun to see that it was a bad movie bad movie. . <br /> <br /> Where did you start ...? Direction - Zero Stars, Screenplay - Zero Stars, Cast - Zero Stars, Cinematography - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Production Design - Zero Stars, Make-up - Zero Stars, Casting - Zero Stars, Edition - Zero Stars, Trailer - Star Half, Graphic design - Half star, DVD menu - Half star. <br /> <br /> However, I think it's very important that the bad movie that I saw was a bad movie. That's why I'm happy to see this happy movie, to have a bad movie at the bottom of my film.
