I missed the beginning of this movie, which was why I was not told. On the other hand, I have studied the fall of the Roman Republic over the years, so I know the story. Again, this might be why you did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has a history that is extraordinary. Although it's so indefinite, I do not think it's going to be a good deal, in that case it will be forgiven. It is a strange thing that sometimes it is still a long time to be historically accurate to make it confusing. Just like Antonio's marriage to Octavian, and afterwards abandoning both scenes. Why do not you bring it to the plot and Octavia is never seen? And Antonius in his scenes (Marcus Antonius), and the English names of Mark Antony in other scenes. <br /> <br /> Exactly, aside from that, the movie can still be a fun watch. If it were not the main one. There is no ounce of dignity. His hysteria is dramatic and completely absent. Instead of being a clever Queen Cleopatra, she becomes a hysterical teenager with a bad PMS case. 95% of this comes from the poor actors, but 5% are not scripted. They are written in the script without much dramatic writing. Sometimes you were not seeing Anthony and Cleopatra, you were watching immature versions of Dawson and Joey on "Dawson's Creek". <br /> <br /> If you want to see something about that time, see ... this is nothing.
