This package means that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn bank are stealing a huge robbery, but that's not what I've got! I did not get anything! For the first time there is a new character in every other scene (without input). The first half hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest of the long, annoying scenes of bullying. It always strikes a dull sound with the sightseeing, a glittering siren, a whistle or a Quincy Jones score. It seems that many parts are too bad. We're delighted, Beatty runs away with thin ice to the CAR! Or, the police scene arrives about fifteen times. I really hate this movie!
