ALL FOR LOVE (when it was given as the title of the weekend) was captured by Captain Saint Ives in the Napoleonic army and the Frenchman was arrested and his period was jailed in Scotland. A young maid who visits the prison. There is also a story of a murder. <br /> <br /> I will be honest and I will admit that I have not taken too much in the movie, I do not have a great hobby of theater at all and it feels like scripts. It's a bit episode, but I'll tell everyone that they all work well and has Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough, and Jason Isaacs. The exquisite costumes that you can expect are also excellent <br /> <br /> I'm very surprised if this movie does not have a complaint after going through the BBC2. The captain of Saint Ives is sitting on the bed when his prostitute is there, where there is a scene of the French prisoners, who gather all the nakedness of men, without the blood being shown without mentioning the murder scene. You really have to worry about what BBC programmers do
