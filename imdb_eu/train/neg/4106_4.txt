It was almost impossible for me to be a bust movie, but I was disappointed. After getting acquainted with the Pekinpah film for years, I found this DVD, completely reduced, for sale and I thought it was worth a shot. Opening a few symbols for Pekinpah enthusiasts has a human and animal cut; but we do not have the environmental noise of children in a school that is not working here. Fantasy suspense Then, when Caan and Duval travel the next time, Duval has thrown bombs by Cannon, who last night had STD in his purse, with Canno being close to him. The following laughter is fantastic and clearly a tribute to Brian Depma's Dressed to Kill, at Angle Dickenson's short expense. The Killer Elite's problem is that after the opening credits the films fall flat. Even if the manager of Alfredo Garc√≠a has a stronger value in production, he is brave for anyone who knows what he's talking about. I use Pekinpah credits as a supplementary lecture material, but when it's done, Killer Elite is activated.
