"Show your boobies!" It's not fun, and definitely not the cartoon that shows cartoon, from where you understand from where you come from. I do not want my daughters 6-7 years to hear such thoughts or that. Sad it seems to me that Nick has grown a lot since then, as stupid children as stupid adults. I know it's funny, but we do not take into account the small innocent young girls who can not see K and 1st. When I saw how I was disappointed I had to comment. My daughters do not see. Nick would like to block me but at this time I did not have any heart, but Nick continues to make that effort.
