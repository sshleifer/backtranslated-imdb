The writer Guild of America has had to shoot this section in 3 days. It is exciting, because it has second-cut prints of season 2 and writer Maurice Hurley described "terrible, just terrible." <br /> <br /> Why do not producers know how to wait for a decent thing to shoot. By this stroke I think that production was left without money and only a section that could be retracted, or perhaps even at that time, was able to fill half-theater with Roddenberry. This episode also shows the latest look at the series Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski).
