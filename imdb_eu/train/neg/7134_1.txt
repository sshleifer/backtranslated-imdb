So this is achieved. Only fast and expensive cars that drive the top 1% will only drive. Girls posing next to them in script magazines. Secondary and unnamed actors. Creative business appearances by niche culture people. <br /> <br /> It's a rubbish offered by Hollywood. Do not get bad; I like the action without a headless headset just like the next one. But please, Braintrust collectively clarifies that these things stop, count ten, breath, you have to be "Woooooosaaaaaah" sensitive, then delayed for fifty years and remember what the movies made once nice? Then do you really do some of these films again? <br /> <br /> I do not oppose poker, but the whole pop-culture explosion that has been in the last five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mothers think of Maverick now (not half of them will get this reference). The executive director said: "Hey, what do you want demographically to get $ 9.50?" "I know, Mr. 18-35 market." "Ok, let's have poker, girls, and fast cars." "A wonderful idea, sir." The result? At night, I've seen the movie Spike on television and it's often the protagonist of Dolph Lundg. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not misunderstood; I'm not a movie snob. The great drawings like "The English Patient" do not float on my boat, but I also worry about generic DVD movies that are not intended to be directed directly to the DVD. I think they will only have age-dampers as the engines will push them, and I think those who are at the top of the IQ range will see what it's like: dumps.
