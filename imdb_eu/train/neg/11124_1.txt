In general, I do not worry much about film violence, or a great deal of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All of this is very well with me, and the film brings us many faces. Beautiful images are especially good for lake and nature, the setting of the characters, good direction. This movie can be voted as a good movie. However, it is damaged for two reasons, and these two causes are disgusting. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is violence against living creatures to make this movie. Not about the violence of the film, I'm talking about real violence. Only if this violence can not be justified and the reason is the second number; The message of the film was not a mere observation of direct relationship between women directors. We do not all have real twists of women (respectively men). But the consequence of the film destroys everything. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * Our "heroine" eventually dies (I remember her here with her hand, remember that I watched this movie a few years ago and I was annoyed by myself, I'm a guy with a new witch movie. No doubt he has not seen ) and today it is clearly shown as one of the kind of natural demons, which grows above nature, especially its sex. Of course, the female heroine is "dead". Women must die, especially if men are attracted to sex. It seems the last conclusion. ** final spoiler * <br /> <br /> Well, well, probably, would be fine with me if the director kept looking at himself. However, for the use of large photographs, cruelty directing for living beings, men can scared women and women cruel. That's not enough. When I saw this movie, I would get some good reviews of "philosophical, oriental and artistic" and of any kind. But, for me, this movie is totally distorted.
