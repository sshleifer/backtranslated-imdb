Oh, my dear ... I thought they had appeared on CBS TV shows <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> <br /> Four people are experiencing bad experiments. <br /> <br /> computer That's it, do not rent it. <br /> <br /> I saw it under one of its many titles - "Gray Matter", and perhaps <br /> <br /> perhaps one of those films is the last memory. Other <br /> <br /> reviews are straightforward, it's horrible. Never have so many shots <br /> <br /> on the screen, NEVER. It's a huge bounce <br /> <br /> the direction is horrible and the script is awesome. I can not stress how horrible. <br /> <br /> Avoid as tiny. <br /> <br /> This is valued according to physical violence, gun violence, gory and fraudulent. and some adult situations
