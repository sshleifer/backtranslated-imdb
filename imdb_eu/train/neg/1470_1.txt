I wanted to see something I saw at night on our DVD tower. We were among NetFlix's messages and sat quiet on Saturday night. I realized that I did not hear a prior hearing and I was borrowed from a friend. The jacket was heard as a source of "The Big Chill", but he deserved all the stars he deserved. Boy I was wrong! It was like "Big Chill", it was virtually the nature of almost everything. Bill Paxton's character is a copy by William Hurt ("where you've been with it all the time") - a reminder warning - and behind it, it's behind the old place (booth / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; jerk womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum, etc. I asked him why I'm seeing these people. There was not enough to develop nature to find any interest for me. How has the character "Unca Lou" been discovered after 20 years? Also, it was not fun too, when Perkins fell, it was "flopped" the first time in the morning, it was a sign and I lost it. After finishing, I asked my wife: "Did you have a fairy character in this movie? Do you sleep?" He replied: "No, I'm still thinking ... No, I can think of anyone."
