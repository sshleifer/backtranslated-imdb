This movie is divine. The quality of this movie is not. She thought it was good, but bad. The effects are worse and the worst thing I ever see is that you can detect acting. This movie was shot in a camera and probably had a budget of around $ 500. If you want to watch a good Zombie movie, see the dead day or the dead day. If you want to shoot good films like Zombie movies, it's a better way to watch Redneck Zombies. Please try this movie with all costs. It is unchachable and pointless. You have been warned I do not mean anything about this stupid movie.
