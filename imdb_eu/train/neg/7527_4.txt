There are many stupid moments in the 'Tower of Death' / 2 'Play of Death', when you ask, it's a mistake. Sometimes I was watching Kung Pow's film in Bruce Lee. <br /> <br /> Actually, this film is influenced by "Death of Game". Otherwise, "Enter the Dragon" is a sequel / remake of the movie, including several elements of this film, especially true footage. Bruce Lee's character Billy Lo (apparently) investigates sudden death of his friend and finds a movie that he has left with his daughter's daughter. When he robs the body of the cemetery (!), Billy also dies and his brother is too much to avenge the death of men. <br /> <br /> Tong Long has a brother Bobby Lo and does not really have the type of charisma to take the movie. Their fighting skills are very good. Bruce Lee reveals (is no longer) an inherited strain to access equity. In general, the footage was said to have been better than "Game of Death", but it did not stop the movie. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the fights are really. very funny (I dare say I'm saying it) and I can see the least of the movies. But there are so many fake elements in this movie that really tries your patience. First of all, there is a dangerous criminally resident in his alleged property ... or that mental institution? Seriously, he eats raw raw nut, who drinks deer's blood, monkey wears his shoulders and has pawns and lions (?!). To try to make it hard and intelligent, you feel that feeling: you expect half expecting someone to return to their room. <br /> <br /> In fact, this central section is horrible and involving the scene when I get naked with a dog and a lion suit. However, I finished the movie and I was glad I did, because the scene of the last fight ("God") was a complete reason for observation. Although the story is embarrassing, the action is very good and it has excellent choreography. <br /> <br /> But at the end it is also wrong if the premise should be everything that should be taken. According to the saying, the 'Death Tower' pagoda was buried and buried. This was very good, with the original idea with Bruce Lee's different styles of fighting in each level. Is it a "Game of Death" originally planned? No! The film should be called "Death Generator Room," as regards the tower house. Yes, there were some different styles ... Lentil-covered faces, leopard neck and religious monks. Enter the Dragon has never been done, as it is a bad imitation on the plot. <br /> <br /> It's worth it to watch the battle scenes that can be marvelous, but sometimes it hurts so stupid. If that is the case, well. However, the scene of the Thumbs up project 'regeneration of' Enter The Dragon '.
