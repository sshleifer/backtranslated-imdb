I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time in 1986. At that time I saw the BBC version Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was a great version and similar to the book. A few years later, I was looking at this version and I was terrified. William Hurt is very bad Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is a fervent character, where William Hurt represents an ice block. Charlotte Gainsborough does the same thing. As it began to see two zombies. It's a story about love and passion, but I can not see it in this version. No, back to the BBC version. Fantastic time is guaranteed.
