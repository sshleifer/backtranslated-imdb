I have never traveled to Paris, but after seeing "Paris, Je t'aime", I'm so glad to visit this city! NY I have been several times and I love the city and its boroughs. I would touch this cinema, I would like to fly to the plane and fly there immediately, but I will regret the time and money I've spent with him. There is no love story between person or person and city. There are many dysfunctional meetings and functions or people who know each other and it does not work well. Perhaps it reflects the city's characteristics, and they say thousands of people live. Can you find love in New York?
