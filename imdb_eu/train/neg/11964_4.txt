Billy Crystal wrote, co-produced and starred in this safe and comfortable dramatic comedy, for parents, children, caregivers and old age. Billy plays a heart surgeon, who plays heart (ha ha), who collects his unknown father (Alan King), a movie that stars a big star. The script is sub-Neil Simon nonsense, single-line, flat and expressive direction by Henry Winkler (stuck as a sitcom), and family disputes ready. Crystals and the King taste their best, but King is eager and often higher. JoBeth Williams has one of the most gifted roles, but she is a girlfriend who can take her original class. It's a comedy, I think, but one tear retreat ... it's shameful. ** ****
