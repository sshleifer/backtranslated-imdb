***** NOTE, WE DO NOT USE YOUR REQUESTS. **** <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a good advice to anyone who resides in the UK, Channel 5 has an eleventh-old comedy of 80s. read a book later at night Today, I am recovering as a result of a kidnapping, as a result of reading comments about this film. I'm really surprised if someone really said it was a realistic movie! I can only say that God's Cold War scale has ever increased or, otherwise, could be the limits of the Commie ... I found this movie in unfortunate imagination, maybe my movie is just a British perception, who knows? But in every aspect, this film is not only horrible, its teeth strictly frightening. <br /> <br /> I have never been a fan of Bill Murray, and such garbage justifies my feelings. Do not get angry, Ghostbuster made only three years of this film. But that's just Bill Murray's actually created amounts. I can safely say that I have not squandered my time for the first time in Operation Delta Force operation, unless you think these two films think more than you think in common. For one thing, both have terrible actions sequences from the beginning to the end, and the second. Both are with the kichen with crossbows. <br /> <br /> One thing, these guys should be called "U.S Army". However, they are allowed to be proud of their camp, Willy nilly, to seduce women of the Military Police, and then to assume stupidity in the neighborhoods of Generala. Talk about randomly! I am afraid of this film. Now I will not be wrong, I am not a feminist sponsor, but these two women really fall in love with the two characters, immediately arrested and left behind ... It insults twice. for women's races. A red-haired and fat-sucking kid (Atera) and Ramis, his elderly party members can only enjoy MP's underwear, and they both feel guilty of being completely playful. <Br> <br /> Then there are workout scenes that threaten to kill anyone who touches him or her touches, after excessive weight (late and late John Candy), if he does not meet the "Phycho" team. who told the army he was "avoiding paying $ 400 for anger management." Murray was so honest that he was paying tribute to "Toe Giants" (WTF?). "Drill Seargent" could not honestly create a $$$ at the beer store, much less his record group. All this scene can be done to pursue some battle scenes, which people say "the way to go"! all the time, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> Scene follows the assault at the Assault Course, one of which will lead to a scene and one of them shot in the air. When a bird flew with a rifle attack, throw a clock tower. (Just like this. Yep, he said, this movie was random ... a discipline that also escaped miraculously ...) Eventually, it leads to a parade, where hapless groups turn magic into space for two hours. . (Bugger me, Miracle!) Thanks to the intelligent words of Murray, that's why they do not even have a live mass in front of the other rhythms of the military rhythm dance. All of this is a great pleasure for the two lovers of the booth, who should really be detained ... Everyone laughed. This bit is amazing. He then chooses to protect a new Italian Prototype Protected Vehicle from the Millionder Dollar (that is, a house with a green painted inside), "this is what Armad needs!" Right ... <br /> <br /> Then it's an excellent ending to steal this high-speed vehicle from military vehicle that decides on Murray and Ramis to buy a new Ladies' Girlfriend in Germany and get it somewhat hyperactive. The Hapless Captain (John Larroquette) finds himself in a mission to retrieve a vehicle for a new charge team. Then they take a "wrong turn" on the route and eventually get into the Czechoslovakian Soviet Union where they were captured. (As we did not come at that time ...) begins the Ramis and Murray + bird rescue attempt, that is, a great fight, shooting down the leg and throwing tanks. They will return like the Nationals Heroes, calling Russians humiliating "pussies", etc., etc. End That's it. No Martial Court, nothing. They stole a prototype of a military vehicle, led to the Warsaw Treaty and brought about an international incident that could almost wake up the WW3! <br /> <br /> This film is honestly more fun with a terminal illness diagnosed. . I know he wants to be his comedy, he has got the best actors, but where he is in hell? Channel 5 cuts? The only advantage of this film is the fact that female naked women are doing showers and females. (As I said, randomly) It is not, of course, that it helps to deviate from the completely missing film. This film must be realistic for 9 years, unfortunately, we must see instead. One star from 10th - Total tripa. My advice to help you get something useful. As you are like Kastea ...
