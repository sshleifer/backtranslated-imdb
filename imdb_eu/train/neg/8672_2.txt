Most of the action films are Hindi film series, especially Sunnyk and her family <br /> <br /> Typical films include sunny, intense conversations and melodrama <br /> <br /> Films also have typical Rajiv. The Rai component and many bad guys <br /> <br /> The start is fine and then Kenyan is good, but then the movie is moving forward <br /> <br /> The sequence of events moves at a slow pace and does not occur There is nothing in it <br /> <br /> There are many stupid scenes like Kenyan police, especially Sharat <br/> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <> br /> Rajiv Rai works well Music is well, only 1 song works and that's TOOFAN's final camera work is good <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol is common As it is, Chunky plays like a monkey. The scenes are laughable, Naseer's good heroines are pure woods Amrish Puri is not even terrifying as it was terrifying that TRIDEV had the rest well
