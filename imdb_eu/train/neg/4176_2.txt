Maybe I missed the meeting when the meaning of "B-movie" was explained, but I just saw it as ridiculous. Want a good summary of this movie? Take the aliens, replace xenomorphic vampires, and remove all that was good about it, and that is quite enough. <br /> <br /> In the 5-minute movie, "V-SAN zuzen" (this is the most acronyms). I've never heard) that a vamperman checks "base" and then goes down (DOWN? What?), Clearly, there's a staircase in the backdrop of the newspaper's backdrop. When will this happen? 2210. Okay ... (hold on, I'll be back to that) <br /> <br /> Yes. characters Wow, it's okay tokyan lesbian Asian Chick, redneck cowboy wannabe, weather captain, goth vampire / Hot Topic partial ATM, and wussy noob second command. Everyone plays their actors with pure ambition. It almost threatened me when I saw it in Micheal Ironside. Is not it enough money for Sam Fisher's voice in Splinter Cell? The only thing about Vampire Wars is that he really likes it. <br /> <br /> As I see the successor of a movie, my attempts have gone out of my heart. When did they make the board room empty when the PCI computer cards are recorded? The money needed to make this movie is much better.
