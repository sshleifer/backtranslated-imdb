It's a great idea of ​​the story. Unfortunately, the execution is dropped. <br /> <br /> The movie does not get pace for one thing. The trip should be exciting, but it is boring. <br /> <br /> I think the problem is mainly in the script and in the edition. There is not enough barrier and vice versa to slow down, and this story is not really moving the story very effectively. <br /> <br /> Producers should look at the script and stress it. main rewrite Unfortunately, the producer is also a writer and director, of course, that will not happen. <br /> <br /> A large part of the operation seems flat, and in terms of the director, all actors have been very competent in other projects. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, with writing, editing and better management, because this could be a very thriller.
