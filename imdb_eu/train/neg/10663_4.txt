The movie was not among the waste, for example, except among boring scenes. The show given to women was also very good than the brightest desire. <br /> <br /> But Krista Allen really got up in the film. His voice was brilliant and sexy. They had to shorten the scene of Krista's bed, but that way, it was a clock and sex of any kind. It is one of the greatest tasks. In the last five minutes, this movie has also been called evil. It's an interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds was not so good and this was it. It's not his best star. However, he could choose a better script. I really think that he got the money.
