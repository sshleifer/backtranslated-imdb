I am a great fan of Willem Dafoe and I really looked for this movie (I had to get a Chinese 5-region Chinese!). But, really, it's the worst thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Impact (except Dafoe) is horrible. Dafoe and Colagrande BABE have written and directed (although they are not nominated as directors), and they do not write or direct distinctive talents. (Adapt to Willem to act, leave the Giada company!) <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. These two people (just know it) except a series of convincing motivations, absolutely incredible in this house. Colagrande sleeping, I can hardly ever change any expression. And sex scenes are crazy. We really did twice in one of them. Yuck! Without a doubt, they are not the least erotic, and yet the movie is not the only time you sleep. Then repulsing you are busy. Just awful.
