If you want to see a lot in the Altıoklar spa, as the label line has promised, you will be very disappointed that the movie is just about to look like Altıoklar, populist style, about the most popular topics like sex, marriage. and cheating. It seems that there is nothing much iniquitous and unrelated in the plot, as Altichok has tried to successfully "try something new", as mentioned. For a centralized joke, Altıoklar seems to have fallen as the famous phrase "selling sex". I wanted to see a good story told by a good narrative technique. However, in the end, I was sitting for 90 minutes and I noticed that Altichok's experimental was still centered around popularism.
