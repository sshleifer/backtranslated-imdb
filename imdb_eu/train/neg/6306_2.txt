Working in a video store I have watched some movies and sometimes I see some of the biggest movies. She was one of those pride. The idea of ​​telling the story of a first-generation ship of WWII was merely insignificant. However, when viewing the movie in less than 10 minutes, the first major point of the film was to talk about the tensions surrounding World War II in the Second World War. The story below is about the ship, the crew and the exploitation of the war. This first point will take you to the point of overcoming the whole movie. The men who served in the USS Mason were defeated by happiness and suffered the difficulties they experienced. A movie had to be made by men focusing on accomplishments themselves, their armies and their countries, and making no sense of racism about World War II.
