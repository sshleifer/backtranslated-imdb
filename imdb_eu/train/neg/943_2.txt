Here's an interesting little movie with a short movie called "low budget". With nine children, our physics teacher creates a strange serum that "restarts the molecule". Students kill fake casualties of underwater sandwiches and school wings. It seems the revival of classical B movies of the 50s, right? Laguia! There is no example of fun in the camps, that is, the way. A fascinating showcase for breasts and boots raises pleasure, first of all, to be 99.44% more against horror. Barrika's best entertainment, with the help of red blood and the dead body of the students. Such filthy movies, GURU MAD MONK (1970), would turn out to be the latest destruction, the work of a clever genius with a film production master! "F" is automatic, so be quiet!
