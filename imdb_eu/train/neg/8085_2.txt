Oh happiness! Oh joy! Another very bad movie is good! Or, I thought. Actually, it loses the phase of "so good" and, unfortunately, it could be "really bad, but it was unfortunate and they felt bad" <br /> <br /> The start is too long. It can cover up to half an hour and more. Then put the crazy plots on "The man who is sabotaging the land saving mission because he collects all the food and he will be rich if he misses the mission." Duh! Or the "Speaking Bomb" plot has been seen on Star Dark. Guess what ... Like a dark star, the bomb has a bad operation ... hmmmm. Add "we can not play our way to nursery" in a dash and the Solar Crisis in a red. <br /> <br /> Lightning relief Jack Palance (or Jack Pants, as we call it in this movie, is the only target in the film to drive the baby around the baby and the baby's dad is picked up on the phone ... Finally, between driving and calling, Jack It distributes meaningless drivel and lines and it is very disturbed, but it does little to such a story. In short, it's the best movie footage. <br /> <br /> Go to the Charlton Heston Award for "The Irony Line Directly" It is often said that when his eldest son met him for the first time, he commented that his son looks a bit like "he's" hanging himself up while hanging and Kirk Captain needs a corset. <br /> <br /> < > Also funny is a bad thing, with a bright white hairy redhead, which continued to think about Andy Warhol for some reason. <br /> <br /> Besides these cheerleads, this short film is not recommended. It is a sequence that has been copied from the end of the 2001 sequel to 2001 (mercy). <br /> <br /> Tips for enjoying this movie, if you see nonsense, as I did: <br /> <br /> 1. Whenever the bomb speaks, imagine what is called Tarquin (believe it, it works). <br /> <br /> 2. Chuck Heston on the screen and every time he speaks, he anticipates that he will recite Planet Apes's line, for example, "Take off your soft skirts!" or similar. <br /> <br /> 3. Whenever the female director emphasizes (that is, in most cases), there is no hope that aneurism will be in place and will soon die. <br /> <br /> 4. For the final "break the ship" during the scene, follow the technology / engine guys Scotty-ism spout as "Cannae physics laws change!" I hope or like that rough <br /> <br /> In addition, do everything you need to do it. I fell asleep a little and I woke up that nothing was lost to me, not even on the plot (even if it was so greedy). So do not worry for a few, you have not lost anything.
