I watched this movie on American Airlines' flight. It was so bad that the flight seemed longer. The land had a potential (who would not love a movie about a woman who loses an image of the elvis who would not like it?) But she confused it for millions of times because of the really bad writing. At the end, a group of Elvis' empires returning to the casino's casino on a rooftop casino is badly bad, and a group of stars move together to create a "Elvis" constellation. In lightning flashes, they sank down the roof. Wrong ... really bad What is the theme of the whole movie? I would avoid this with all the costs.
