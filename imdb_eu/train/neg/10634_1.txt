Bart Sibrel writes and directs his work here around the movie, says NASA's mistakenly sent. They show astronauts showing television shows on the moon with the tricks of the camera. The astronauts had their Earth orbit all the time, and the editors on the ground introduced this film a few seconds later. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sibre's research is so popular, but he did not realize his research. The "backstage" footage was also considered to be millions of watts for up to 30 minutes of live television (as well as coil) over television. And we must ask why Sibrel puts his conspiracy narrative on astronaut's audio footage, as astronauts hear in word, they are clearly pointing out that the astronauts are testing the camera. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < (She will show you more about the Zapruder of JFK's murder than her "smoker." Sibre thinks she's the only one to see. It seems that the clips that have been chosen footage by Sibrele NOT to use, such as window frames that bring remote Earth, such as slots and slides in windows of spacecraft. Create distant Earth's enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> As with most films of this type, Sibrelen's inventions, based on hypothetical layoffs, misleading comments and selective mentions, allow the viewer to accept a conclusion and accept a conclusion. it's not a real proof.
