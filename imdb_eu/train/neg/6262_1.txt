I agree with those reviews that I have read here, and I have not been able to define such a turkey, but, in spite of everything, such films may find reasons to exist. Would you like to remind those happy days of great video clips, and have a lot of movies been done for the sole purpose of filling in the video shelves? It's a movie of that time and I can imagine what was the only reason that was produced and the same thing happened to others, much worse. Do you remember imitations of "Rambo"? And Z grade so many slashers?, I still feel nostalgia for this period. I can tell about this movie I did not miss out on this observation because I clicked the advanced button after the first fifteen minutes, finding a whole find a fun scene where a guy pushed his ax on his head and that exploded, well-known, because they were made of plastic. And about the end, well, it was so badly shot, I could not understand what happened. It's not the same, I did not follow any plot. But boys, video age was so great that movies.
