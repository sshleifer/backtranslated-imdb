This film was the blame for the presence of Steven Seagal. Or say Steven So-dull! It's as good as Seagal or is it stupid enough to duplicate its lines again, allowing someone to let their voice go. He even made some films before that, but I do not think that way! To make it sound, the movie looks pretty good, the script can use some works, but the parts of this movie look like real movies! Of course, everyone has said, this movie is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> It would be much better if Seagal did not turn himself into a drawing. Do not worry This is more than just a Buck! Honestly I think this is the last time and a Seagal movie. What has happened to me to realize that?
