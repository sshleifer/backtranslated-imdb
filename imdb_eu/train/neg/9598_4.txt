Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs. It is widely known worldwide as a globetrotting TV show. They are less well-known but equally as possible for their farms as full-time workers. <br /> <br /> I dubbed "Vivre pour Vivre" in English, dubbed "Live for Life". Some life! Robert always seems to have a life of at least three women: when a lady goes out, one is taken out and a fraudulent wife. Robert is a close lie. His lies include "Tomorrow" and "My work has been longer than planned". It takes a lot of time and money on airplanes, trains and hotel rooms to keep up the relationship. When you ask him, he asks you somewhere. <br /> <br /> Some people will find their life exciting, but it seemed to me boring. His friends, his wife, including Catherine, are all attractive and desirable women. But his life is very fast and it is so misleading, if you ask if he is enjoying all this. <br /> <br /> An increase in echoing is a great footage that increases the plot. There are extended conversations or conversations for non-French speakers. War documentaries, torture and soldiers training can be seen with direct action. When Robert returns from Africa, we wait and wait for the plane to land and wait at the airport terminal. <br /> <br /> Annie Girardot is a leading figure in this film. He was the most interesting character and he played perfection. Candice Berg was also very enjoyable at the beginning of his career. I can not blame Yves Montand for basically the interpretation of what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Claude Lelouch's innovative techniques. In a hotel room scene, the camera surrounds the room around the room, arguing with Robert and his mistress. When we go through each period we will see them briefly. In another scene in a sleepy train, Robert is lying downstairs while his wife is smaller. Robert's wife gives news but it's overwhelming, but we only hear the trains. His wife could not dissuade each word from the horrible news. I also liked an African safari. The cinematography of these scenes and Amsterdam has been excellent. <br /> <br /> I have reviewed this film within a Library of Congress project. I've been nominated for the FIFTY project: 50 Outstanding 50-Year Films. As far as possible, movies like the other forty-nine I have identified do not share video, television, or the United States since the original version. In my opinion, it is worth getting it back. <br /> <br />
