The Christmas secret came as a wonderful movie, but I was really disappointed. They sold copies of the VHS and DVD copies of the film, when it was over, which is why producers are proud of this project. As an incomparable actress, I realized that most of the performances had been called, although Beau Bridges, Nick, had a moment or another. If I were to go to Richard Thomas, I would not put this movie in another good recovery. It was shame I was passionate about Walton's days, but I felt worried about watching the works, this offer was so bad. <br /> <br /> In the defense of the actors, the direction was rigorous, mechanical. and well amateur <br /> <br /> I hope that this is not considered a bad review and negative assumptions about my qualifications as a critic. I turned on a good movie because I had a good cast and I was ready to enjoy the movie. In any case, I would question anyone who wants to see this movie and I do not want to make money, even if T.V.
