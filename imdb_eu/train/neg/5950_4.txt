After seeing this film, "Why is the title of LIAM?" Since he was planning to tell a story about the boy's perspective, it was not well done. Of course, the camera's angles were the use of the scene of the boys, but many decisive actions came from their perspective. Being a "main" non-capable speaker (obviously, suggests the mood of the child's strength and strength) this character is deeper. <br /> <br /> Melodrama is defined as: "dramatic or literary work, the use of stereotyped characters, excessive emotions and language, simple morality and conflict" LIAM adapts to that definition. The viewer is in the head with typical fire stereotypes and The Church of the Catholic Church of Brimstone and the priestly nurse could hang money over the Church. (The stereotype becomes very tiring). In addition, the Jewish characters are donors and plant owners! <br /> <br /> A large part of the film was foreseeable ... Who did not think we saw Theresa cleanse the toilet after her mother said: "My daughter does not allow a woman to wash her toiletries!" I'm a fan of Britain's realism. In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
