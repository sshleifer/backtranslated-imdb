This is at least a third remake of this movie, so while watching, it's the sense of deja vu, do not be surprised. The story setting changed, and the differences are not significant. And it does not get any better, because the plot is the first mistake. It never works. And like the predecessors, the play is crazy. <br /> <br /> The plot has a special ending and will surprise anyone who has never seen the movie, but the end is not the story. If this film had finished ten minutes before, it would be happy and was very encouraging and would be worth it. But here is the spoiler and, finally, he has not been caught by the crime. I do not like this message as a result of the movie.
