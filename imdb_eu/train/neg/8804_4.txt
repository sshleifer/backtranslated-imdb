CGI's excellent effects and Oscar's best actress Gary Sinise. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is a rumor on this movie, how he got it from Oscar Morgan Freeman for Best Actor. <br /> <br /> This movie is a love letter of love, a letter of love for the next generation. It is not hidden concealing the right prejudices, ending with Forresten Vietnam at the service with Jenny at the "resolution". <br /> <br /> However, he said it is very entertaining and is an American film again and again. I find some very aggressive parts of this film, Zemeckis almost completely diminishes this movie. . . Maybe it was the point he wanted to do it. <br /> <br /> See this movie and ask yourself "What does Robert Zemeckis say about the good American?" <br /> <br /> It seems that Forrest has made "appropriate" options and has been "in the right time" for the past 45 years. According to the director's view, those who are mistaken seem to have paid a great price. So, as Zemeckis said, the idiocy-friendly and even American-inspired disguise as innocence and ingenuity is also quality?
