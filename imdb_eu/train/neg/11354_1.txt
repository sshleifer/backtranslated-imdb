In the past, I'm worried that I've ever seen hundreds of children's films. <br /> <br /> 1) I must explain to my children to my children. Russia is not "bad". Likewise, Russian called "Poopchev" is not considered appropriate. <br /> <br /> 2) A feast of Father's wings birthday party was almost a joke, where men ate beer and the woman spoke on the phone. Two other flies do not even use the word "crap" twice. 3) The whole movie is considered stereotypical and propaganda in 1950, and we are proud as a nation since we passed. br /> <br /> Totally raw, badly animated, bad writing and not worth the time to watch.
