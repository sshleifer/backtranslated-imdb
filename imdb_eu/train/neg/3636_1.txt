I am very open to foreign films and I like to try to get it done, although some things go back. The simplicity and "intelligence" of this film was boring. I often thought it would be interesting to make a movie that would be interesting in the day or typical season. Now I've seen a movie like that, I will not think of it anymore. Social, racism and some wishes ... but South Park has it. And when I see South Park I feel an emotion. In this movie I felt the emotion that was the closest thing to me after the first five minutes after breaking. I value the typical movie for seven or more, I love the movie. I gave this movie.
