This movie promised! What a wonderful idea is a paintball team that is struggling for recognition and personal glory, because it lacks the speed of dialogue, bad editing and half-written story. The initial characters were of interest, only to promote steam half to make people of dreadful lines that tired. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it would have been a great movie if it had been a long time in the story and the conversation, instead of an almost thought-provoking effort.
