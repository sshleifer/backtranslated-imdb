Sugar & Spice is one of the worst films in 2001. The film goes through with Heathers and Bring It On and fails. When I saw him last January, I used to play the movies I had so sharp and talked to my mobile phone with my mobile phone for the last half hour of the movie. I've heard that DVDs can have a cut of a director, maybe I've checked it out, but this PG-13 trash movie is *** and the worst ***. Perhaps, if the movies would be welcome, there were some T & As. But the gag are lame and act is horrible. Troma worse than a movie.
