A vampire woman paints young women with blood. He has an assistant who does not want to be a vampire. That is why he has orders that he or she needs to become bloodstream. After some murders, the assistant gets dizzy and falls in love with a homeless girl. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this movie? Its stimulation slows down, it has extra sound effects (it's never so weird that weird) and a pleasant atmosphere (the new jazz is here I'm going) and the lights do not seem to be included in the set. It seems "autore" with all the self-sufficiency in the horror film. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely stupid and guesses how it kills a woman who kills one by one. it should not be done; Of course, the crosses, lights, garlic and sticks do not work. <br /> <br /> It's not a fun movie. Maybe with friends and a lot of beer can not be fun for her (honest, 10 to 15 minutes is fun for the end of the movie). Do not deceive Troma sticker, they present a bad movie.
