With the work of British brilliant 1950s of the British film industry, I expected it and I expected more to be entertained. Unfortunately, I was stuck by the wrong reasons, I could not believe it was horrible. I have seen thousands of old movies and I'm always ready to become products of my time, but it was really difficult. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, there is no such thing as an important problem. He does not seem to know what he wants to be: a romantic romantic comedy, a comedy slapstick or music. Jeannie Carson gave him a little about 15 minutes of compassion. It's not credible at any level, the story itself or Daisy has never been a ship ounce. Among other aspects that are not credible, Donald Sinden's soft-songwriter (for God's sake), Diana's casting owner seems to be the smallest interest (I mean Diana). Back! Let's go!) And a fascinating scene in an office of a song publishing house. The whole thing is the worst way. <br /> <br /> If you were to select your favorite scene, I would be the beginning of the actor's actor Wilfred Lawson. Then everything went down a great way.
