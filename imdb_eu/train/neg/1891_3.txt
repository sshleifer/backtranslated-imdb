A documentary about Persan's nomadic, a betrayal of the massive mountains, to bring herbs to his ear. The oriental music partition that could not be used in the original exhibition, partially silent and seeing this black-and-white, is even worse. The spectacular landscapes are lost in a small black-and-white screen, and there is no plot line to set. I loved Nanook of the North and the March of the Penguins, but I despised this movie, aside from the similarity of this issue. Only physical difficulties are not interesting.
