I can not say much about this movie. I think that he speaks himself (even today's grades). I rented this two years and I totally regretted it. Although I / tried / tested twice, but I can not. I can safely say I never wanted to see that time. And I'm not throwing a movie into the trash, but I really think it was horrible. It was not funny anymore. Christopher Walkenen's twin little scenes. I think this movie was damaged by me by Jack Black and Ben Stiller. When I see one of their films, I feel everything that's awesome after all, and reminds me of losing my money. Amy Poehler is too annoying. <br /> <br /> In general, well, I think they do this. The stars are for Walken, by the way.
