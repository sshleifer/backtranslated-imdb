The movie was so bad, obsolete and stupid to see the era at the end. I saw this Rodney guy on Natur Born Killers and I thought it was fun to be hell, but this movie was pure. "Jokes" were not funny, actors were not funny, nothing is even fun in the remote. Do not miss this time! Only beautiful things were positive about them :) and Molly Shannon, I'm sure they tried their best, but the script was very bad. That's why I named "1" instead of "1", but I've never seen one of the worst movie ever.
