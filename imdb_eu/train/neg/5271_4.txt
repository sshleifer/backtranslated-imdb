Bickering, an American family, vacation on the west, found a strange fantasy town in the middle of the desert. They do not know that the ghost town was once more a site for testing nuclear bombs, and its deadly presence is taking place. In general, I love such mysteries and horror movies. "Cube", Spielberg's "Duel" and "The Birds" all do not respond, but yet they want to be more intrigued and more. Apparently, the writer / director of "disappearance" was just trying to make this kind of filmmaker Walter Klenhard, and whether he had success or not belonged to the viewer. Personally I think it's half way down, then the movie has sunk. <br /> <br /> The actors are just "ho-hum". They are not particularly bad, but the audience never feels fear and reacts in realistic situations. Do all other people have the character to study sounds strange? Give it a minimum of some to justify it !?!?!? <br /> <br /> Television is an average fairly sure film. Klenhard Director should be happy because of the threat to the desert environment, and some of the settings were amazing. There is a really beautiful scene where two characters find an old nuclear test and, as far as one eye sees, the sand is glistened. I wonder if it was true to myself? <br /> <br /> What does not mean, and what is "creature" or what hell are never such people ever show up, not to mention it, we're never really traced, what are they (mutants, aliens, ghosts or evil old Indian spirits? Oh, that's really tightening us down!) or where to come. <br /> <br /> Here too there are many topics. Why are the people of this type of movie country really really? Why is it always that the old boy thinks that this crazy person is correct? Why? Why? Why? What a new scenario, people! <br /> <br /> The "disappearance" tries to be different and intelligent, but eventually it fails, in many ways, it is known that live-horror fans of the horror video. Hey, I've seen films worse and the disappearance is not bad, is it too much? Average <br /> <br /> 4/10.
