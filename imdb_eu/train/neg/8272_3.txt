At the end of "At the end of heat", I could think of everything why I left the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The film's premise is interesting and Maggie Q is so attractive to me. to the first movie. But I was never disappointed. Writing Director Daniel Lee can not wear a candle for John Woo, Ringo Lam, and Corey Yuen's favorite. <br /> <br /> It has to be one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen. Lee is so much in his visual style - and I use this phrase very freely - the film fills in completely unnecessary black and white frames, freeze frames, slow movements, fast motion and other visual nonsense. I think that he has done all that he has done to solve the story or the lack of good conversation. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the actions are not anything special and any other music is played as a video clip. There is no person to look after, a wide open side of an inner raft could not even have two professional sniper snipers! - Those that are loaded with a buzzing conversation I have seen in one of Hong Kong's entrepreneurs. <br /> <br /> The plot does not have bends and the initial configuration, everything happens Predictable mode - and Lee reminds us of the need to remind us of the background story, for the first time we have not got it. This writing and shooting are terribly amusing, and Sammo Hung, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. are wasting their talents <br /> <br /> If you're really looking to be a great Hong Kong activist, John Woo's "The Killer "(1989) and" Hard-Boiled "(John Woo)" The Killer "is much better. 1992), Ringo Lamen "City on Fire" (1987) - Quentin Tarantino stole "Reservoir Dogs" (1992) or "Point Blank" (1967) remake "Full Contact" (1992). Or even look at Yuen's "So Close" (2002), the popcorn is very entertaining, but absurd. And there's always a massive French police activist, "The Nest" (2002). <br /> <br /> The truth is that most of them, if not all, are just a little bit more, but they are still a thrilling film. exciting and even suspenseful. We carry out the characters and actions sequences we take care of. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Heat Dragon", on the other hand, is very medium. The problem is that Lee did not make a bad action movie, he's sad.
