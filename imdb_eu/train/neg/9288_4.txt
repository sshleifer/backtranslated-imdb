Half main partner, Steven Seagal was the main protagonist of B-hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a sequel to a live video, a movie that loses nothing but has no power to win. It's more fun than the first one: on all sides. But it's worth the look. If you want to play action movies or see something in the Crisis session; Would you like to see the old WWE old stars or watch the sequel, whether it's live or not. <br /> <br /> <br /> Kurupt worked hard, Bill Goldberg was below the average; I think it's not doing the job. Kurupt is a good comedian, I said. The rest worked, but it's not surprising, it's not what happened. <br /> <br /> Technical details, well, Sony's production can not be great. Cinematography was a disaster, but the general direction was acceptable. Anyway, if you want to see it. If you look, you will not lose anything. But if you do not ... well, you do not miss it.
