I sat down to see a documentary about Puerto Rican and I finally saw Nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I fail to see 50% of people living in poverty. When I fight, the Haitian, Dominican or Cuban people who have just arrived on the island. There's no spanglish ... whether you speak Spanish ... you do not ... and since I've heard ... you do not. Pedro Albizo Campos is not for me MLK. MLK was a great man. The male field is 1% of independence. In the rest, Osama is like Bin Laden. The Puerto Ricans wanting independence are the stupid set. If you want a proof of all the dreamers of an independent Puerto Rican, see Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, South and Central America, and Mexico. They did wonders. This documentary is not related to Puerto Rico, this documentary was about Nuyoricans and their battles. <br /> <br /> There was not enough Africa for the spectacle that was there ... It was about the port. Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will come soon for you. <br /> <br /> In the end ... all those who think green cards need to come to the United States and want to know how the Prime Minister is going. It is not a good documentary about Puertorrique culture. Tell your children to focus on Geography and History. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc." He was about Nuyoricans. He encouraged all of us as we feel. Your title ... "I am Nuyorican ... lunch ... it can not be spoken in Spanish." APPLICATION FOR THE APPLICATION OF PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA, OR PROVIDED TO PROVIDE FOR A NON-HORTICIAN LANGUAGE WITH A NON-INSTRUCTION. God forbid this to play on the island.
