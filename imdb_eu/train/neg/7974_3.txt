At first it's interesting. A simple authority from the park, named Colin Firth, will marry Lisa Zane, a beautiful and mysterious woman, who only knows for a short time. It seems happy, then it disappears without warning. They are looking for her and, after some extreme extremities, she finds herself in childhood childhood and in noisy past times, she may have criminal activities. And then it seems filmmakers do not know what to do with the story. At the beginning, while it does not sound, it's the least. Then it does not leave interest or even make sense. And the end is somewhat neat, so sad and so much illusion or ingenuity, the scriptwriters do not know what to do and try to get bored. What good idea was it lost?
