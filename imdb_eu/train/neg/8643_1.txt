Blair Witch-War, a movie that was as bad as Bwitch! The title says everything, it saves your money and time and a good movie, such as "Once upon a America," "Shawshank Redemption," or "Enemy at the Gates" (if you want to see a GREAT one). "War", etc. <br /> <br /> If this movie was a baseball team and the League Grand Prix was a great value and it was a Single A rookies, then this movie was a High school ball. He filmed a movie with his father's old camera shot at the High School. Be sure to join an enemy (to make a movie), but I'm not saying that, we're calling it stupid! This is a great way! Now let's see what you think and then say what you think.
