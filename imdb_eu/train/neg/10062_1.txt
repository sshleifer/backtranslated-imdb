Nintendo !!! You #% $ @ ERS !!! How did he do that? I can not believe ... the movie is worse than the first one. In the theater I went with my brother, because my mother had to seal it ... God ... where am I? SUCKED LANDS Voice voice. Sucked animation. Finished really bored. If you liked this movie, YOU SUCK TOO. And Futuramafan1987, the biggest ever movie ever, is TOOL, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. This is not a movie for anyone, but for ten years, children think that Pikachu is God with Game Boys. I still cried the fear of a current movie ... and then Pikachu's Adventure ... I did not start a horrible movie. Actually, it's one of the most boring experiences of my life. Ignore any cost. <br /> <br /> Based on the bottom: Go ahead, look for all the copies of this movie as you can and burn it. Burn everything and follow a wonderful movie, Aliens ... or Bowling for Columbine ... or even back to the future!
