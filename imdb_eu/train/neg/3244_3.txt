The story about a psychiatrist who works with this artist is so beneficial, I think it was my intention. The sets are artificial and I have never felt that I was watching a movie. The actors seem to read their lines, rather than responding to each other. The film initially has elements of black cinema (except color), the approach is so exaggerated that I have almost finished parodying the genre. <br /> <br /> I did not think it was a presentation, at least it was a wonderful story I expected. I usually continue to be enough about the stories they intend to do, but you would see what happened in the first fifteen minutes. "I forgot the $ 80,000 dollars" moment, I thought it was really ridiculous. Experiencing a addictive experience with addictions in games adds to the stupidity of playing a psychiatrist. Even if he played as a normal intelligent person, he would fall into the whole story. <br /> <br /> This wooden production has left me cold.
