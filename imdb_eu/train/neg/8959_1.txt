Some people think this movie is supposed to be an artwork - to create a movie full of pain and death antagonism to your imagination in film. I think this movie is disgusting, what they never need to be released. . This movie is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. Time is wasted, but a few days will come. The great images that appear in the film are not only retained in the air, but they enter your mind and forget about the days. It is shameful that people mislead imagination in inappropriate misconducts ... "Kill Bill" would be another example, but at least "Kill Bill" will have its purpose, meaning, supremacy and resolution.
