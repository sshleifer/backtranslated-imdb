The intention of the directors about these films is very beneficial, but as I realized the history of their productions, this would not make much sense to other filmmakers. Taking into account his excellent 30-day TV series, MTV production, "I bet you will", is seriously disturbing the documentary issues, and I did not even tell you about the "pretty supersize me" production. great hope unfortunately it's enough that I'm disappointed with this movie. After happening with "Supersize me", I asked myself exactly what was the point of all this. The main expression, after half an hour, will appear quite clear, but the rest of the time fills quite absurd things, repeats the things that were before or after, so it gets bored and it is very boring. end
