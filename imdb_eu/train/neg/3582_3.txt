No, it's not a horror movie ... This is really a love story. <br /> <br /> The ring is a silent film of 1927 and is a boxer and two women. "One Round" loves Jack, a boxer. He loves to get his champions, that is. Although he is married, he starts flirting with the champion until the last battle of boxing between the One Round and the champion. Returns to One Round, where things are most unfocused, and miraculously finds his inner strength to win the inner struggle and to love his wife. <br /> <br /> This film was very early in the career of Hitchen. But the time limit did not make a permanent film. Even though movies are special tricks and comic reliefs, this film does not respond to their latest work. He had to be very hard, however, with a shameless shameless wife. The drawing may have been in 1927. When analyzing these old films, it is surprising that they can be reproduced on the current screen and really come out. Maybe I would be ... <br /> <br /> Do not forget to watch this movie if you do not want to watch all Hitchcock movies. You can sleep in the middle.
