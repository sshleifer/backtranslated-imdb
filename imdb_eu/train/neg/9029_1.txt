This movie almost vanishes the ability of almost all actors to make the "potboiler" the most beneficial. <br /> <br /> Although "Top Gun" is an open act, it goes down in many stereotypes and in bad situations. following each other until you try to choke on your own crises. <br /> <br /> There are so many dead lines in this movie I invented to tie together the TV series that were shut in there. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Quinn's Mexican drug addict is an appetite, and its "association" Quinn-Martin police show comes out in the 1970s. Costner's character is wood and we can not reason that he really fell in love with Mendez's wife. We believe that we do not believe that we believe that our wife is being created by the help of her wife, and we believe that she will jump into the first warm body. <br /> <br /> It's a definitive "B" movie and it's lost all the time.
