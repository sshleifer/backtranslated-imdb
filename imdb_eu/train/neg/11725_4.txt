STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> <br /> James Landlock (Wesley Snipes) is hiding in his ranch a famous terrorist Montana after catching it. The agency then approached again to travel to London. His purpose is arrested and he has a heavy protection from the police, but he does not want to capture his man. Everything goes well, then the mission goes wrong and when a senior policeman, when Windsor (Charles Dance) dies, the fault falls at the foot of Dial. Trapped as an animal, he arrives at the nearby home and becomes Emily (Church Bennett) with a young girl, who deals with her subjects and turns her betrayal into a girl who makes her betrayal. <br /> <br /> This last getaway on Snipes DVD came out of nowhere, with little advertising, even though it was so small (I do not remember seeing any ads or trailers). and the story of Snipes's DVD efforts, Snoop Dawg seems to be hot. However, I wanted to give it to him. He does not classify the worst amongst himself, but he does not achieve higher standards than his best ones (Detonator, 7 Seconds, actually). <br /> <br /> <br /> This is at least a bit suspensful, with minimal action, naff in all the cool conversations and Snipes is not exactly the protagonist of his best role. Likewise, in a main assistant, it is clear that only the fees paid by the Danes appear and that, in general, no one can cry out on their curriculum. <br /> <br /> Many say that the "only" contract you're interested in is "end up with Snipes's Sony and end up with any other DVD participation movie". **
