Previous is Ruiz's intention to do the psychological thriller. Although it is not a classic piece of this genre, there are compensations. The tensions produced by Huppert and Balibarre are quiet but women who calculate the war against one another; However, since it is a true European art style, Ruiz does not release this strain that women play with each other with compassion. Huppert is the only voicemail that awakens from a nightmare (an irrational event impossible in the film). <br /> <br /> In fact, if we keep the title, the movie is a thriller of Jane's little scheme. Campion's In The Cut. Instead, it is a psychological examination between men's attention. Camille (Nils Hugon) decides on a practical joke against a woman who is emotionally more vulnerable to the mother. Both women do not shy and compose the problem. The back is a permanent psychologist (Charles Berling), face to face with women in his life - his sister Huppert, nanny or her father - and thus campaigns Camille (adult) as a symbolic manipulator. . Especially interesting is Henry James's Screw, as the Father, the lawyer of Denis Podalydes, Father, that there is no film duration. Ruiz is adapting an epic moment as a result of Huppert's return to the film. <br /> <br /> Read it as a thriller or as a psychiatric test. I am very buried with the Mme Huppert screen method, as I am officially bored, so I started looking for the stage again before watching it again (European - Heaven's Gate). Good help Ruiz makes no favors. Apart from a few lights and some unwanted shots, his direction has ceased to characterize, especially when I'm playing Isabella with Edith Scob's neighbor from Shaman. The pieces set are not linked to a line that drives forward - the tension that I have already mentioned is not only weakening the wastes, but it is wasted in its potential direction. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see a good French thriller? Go and see L'Appartement. 4/10
