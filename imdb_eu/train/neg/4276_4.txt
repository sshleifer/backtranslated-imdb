The circuit and the short-lived series (approximately two seasons) is an experimental and unique ride by a truck driver. I do not know what that means when they say "Lynch and his little TV". What is its original criterion? Surely, compared to "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues", it's the original. Without a doubt. Next to "Law & Order", TP hides originality and turns it to the left. <br /> <br /> TP fans have often said that the show was abandoned because there were not too many audiences, the "curiosity" of the show was enough open. ", his supposed wild creature, or whatever, I should like to correct this misguided idea of ​​curiosity. There is no outer wall around the TP, it's just a whirlwind, it goes through circles, rotates websites in every corner, but (or that's why) will not go anywhere.Expected curiosity is always bound: the characters do not strangely play half-way in the way they are IDIOTICALLY There is a difference ... <br /> <br /> Strange dream of "life's oblivion" "Every time I see the sequence, the dwarf criticizes the director (Buscemi), to make use of the old ones. -Menget-in-a-dream-scene-cliché, Lynch. Do you like it strange? Eraserhead is strange - so It's a bit strange, it's mostly abstract, do you want a unique TV show? See "prisoner." Do you like a curious look? Felini and Leone feature films like TP, a dramatic drama over a TV crime It's where all young people look like a fashion model. TP gives TP a plastic look. Kens & Barbies massez. <br /> <br /> In fact, one of TP's producers said that Lynch was looking for "single faces" for the series. Single faces Like Lara Flynn Boyle? Sheryll Fenn? Men's catalogs (or gay magazines) like straight face emotions? Do not get bad; There's nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with beauties like Fenn (though it's 1000 times more beautiful than Madonna), but do not go "with strange scenes, saying that you're doing strangely curious people." And I have never understood Lynch's worst fascination with Kyle MacLachlan (I should get the medal to write his name well). It is not very difficult, but it lacks charism, it seems a little bit gentle. The enormous "eccentricity" of his character was not at all interesting, because Lynch had just tried many attempts to force his curiosity, trying hard for his reputation, when he lost his time. Lynch did everything by "Elephant Man", compared to his first two films. Below, the efforts based on the small but fanciful base of Lynch's fancies were mediocre, without interpreting the stories that the people interpreted the meanings of good-looking interpretations. In other words, Lynch is a dear child of the intellectual. <br /> <br /> So, his father, Laura Palmer, died ...? He obsessed demons or such nonsense. That's the best thing that can create this "great mind" ... B-movie horror film ends with more originality. <br /> <br /> Lynch has not had enough hard work to get a wonderful story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~ Fedor8, and look at my "TV and film: Nepotism 150 The Worst Case" list .
