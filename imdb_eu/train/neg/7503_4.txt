Before giving a well-deserved mixture of the movie SUMMER OF SAM, Spike Lee, I would like to make clear something. I'm not condemning this movie due to the buzzing and unpleasant images. This film is so relaxed that Lee thinks that SUMMER OF SAM is supposed to be considered as a social drama. Quentin Tarantino's crime films, for example, are filled with violence, guilt and another joke, but Tarantino is very careful not to try to recover social work of these films. He knows that these films are only for entertainment. On the other hand, serious plays, for example, RYAN PRIVATE and SCHINDLER'S LIST, are unpleasant for example, but unpleasantly develops the drawing and characters of the movie in order to have the story and characters emotionally involved on the screen. SUMMER OF SAM, unfortunately, only confuses his sensationalism and sleaze, but believes that it serves as a social comment, just like other trash cans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> His characters are card-cut stereotypes. In his plot, the intention is to show the emotional influence of the Son of Sam, the neighborhood of the Italian-American neighborhood, where the murder happened. However, as well as presenting local people as a mix of different personalities, Lee only imagines the negative Italian stereotypes that have been imagined. Men are ignorant, lazy and delight. Women share the weak and agreeable "good girls" (Mira Sorvino's Dionna) and the "little girls" (Jennifer Esposito's Ruby). Apparently, Vej wants Hollywood "recovery" for its African American stereotypical negative stereotypes, and cares little critics. Martin Scorsese, for example, if resident residents of an African-American neighborhood presented Amos's Andy and Aunt Jemima stereotypes, critics denounced these stereotypes. Most importantly, single-stereotyped stereo-scattered stars make every movie weakened as a serious social comment. <br /> <br /> Exceptionally, SUMMER OF SAM is an excellent cast. However, acting is, in most cases, inspired. We skip motions, or do not have to work with the script. There is also a great deal of disorder. The comic John Leguizamo is very talented, but Vinny's character seems to be obsolete by John Travolta's Tony Manero. And the actress Michael Badalucco, a "pleasant guy", is badly in love with David Berkowitz, who is so funny and scary. The only performance that deserves attention is that Adrien Brody is a confused but honest neighborhood that is well-suited to Ritchie. Brody's performance and the elegant Lee's star are the virtues of this film. <br /> <br /> * **** outside 1/2
