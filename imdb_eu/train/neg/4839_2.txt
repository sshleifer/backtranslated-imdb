... And being bigger than ever. I do not make a direct reference here, but at least this film is pathetic. If you are a military training, do not worry. I put it on DVD with two friends who want to see an interesting / war movie. Why I could not read the first time comments. <br /> <br /> In the first scene of the "bomb" scene, the whistle has a horrible whistle, and they show up and become bigger. My 2 friends, who have no connection with the military, saw two defects of the director almost as fast as myself, and I asked him what realistic things happened. Well, maybe you guessed it, they're not - in any way. <br /> <br /> Do not miss out on this film to be completely stupid and never forget when it happens again. First, 2/10 to catch my interest.
