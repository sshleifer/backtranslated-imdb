John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) stars a rock band that turns Esther Hoffman's singer (Barbra Streisand) into the night of the star song. Esther's star rises as John goes down, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John carries out a self-destructive-red-convertible-160-MPH-crack-up-on-desert-highway. The best thing about this movie is music, especially the "Evergreen" song. Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can not take it seriously and take it as a star, a star already. The first time he appears, he is singing in a back alley, it seems like a famous star of the night, a star who is not trying to start an unknown song career. Too sure, it is very professional. His apartment looks like a "Apartment Living", a wall hole apartment that is not a real singer. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson is centered and eliminated. -Control like a rock star ... well, like a singer who wants to be an actor, but not with a great performance. The direction is tough, the story is slow and dull. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about that movie is not acting or direction, or a slow story. It's hair! After watching Kristofferson and Streisand's hairless hair in the 70's, your eyes are hurt for two hours.
