What a stupid trip? <br /> <br /> I do not spend time studying any point of this show. It's not worth the time. The only comment I'll make is: why get DUMB like that, doofus inarticulate star?! <br /> <br /> There is not much more testimonial than the worse psychological state of the network. FOX has indicated that it will NOT USE John Doe (a decent series), but it will lead to a brain-like drivel like Joe Millionaire, for another turn of the dead American public brain cells. <br /> <br /> FOX has lost, IMHO.
