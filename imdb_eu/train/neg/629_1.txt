I want this movie 10 desperately ... I really do it. Some films, especially horror films, are good. A cautious little ninja who plays a deadly weapon that can carry fair skin ... definitely fits in with "budget". The depth of the film is undoubtedly a turning and rotation that affects its strength and itself. Keeping the audience on the edge of the seats is really awesome ... ninja ... teenage years ... a thirty-year-old student. ... cowboy non-drawing ... nonsense ... the boy of the scaremeal has become the greatest horror icon of the year. I can really say that you're "punching" and I recommend watching movies, such as Frankenfish, if you enjoy this hilarious horror. <br /> <br /> (WHAT IS HELL FUNCTION!)
