Linda Lovelace, Chuck Traynor, was a sadistic woman. I do not know how to have sex with a dog (ie, abuse of animals) is entertaining or fun. Linda Lovelace was a presumed virtual prisoner for making these films. I know some people will criticize this comment, but I think that these types of films are hatred and more misogynistic feelings. Society man continues to represent human sex as a human object. We are called "civilized", but we have a long way to be able to get the skin of being civilized.
