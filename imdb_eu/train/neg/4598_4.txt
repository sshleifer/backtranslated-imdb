The wife of a London-born stage producer intends to set her husband's final show together with her husband's latest acquaintance, who lives in an American girl who is in a circle of social circles. Unfortunately, the couple have already met on their own, who really thinks the girlfriend is married to her friend (the wedding ring does not realize that it's misunderstood!). The musical Wafty Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers falls to the ground Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott's idiocy, full of youthful behavior. Astaire and Rogers do not just 'meet' - they play hilarious (he jokes dancing at the hotel innocent himself and complains). The viewers of 1935 probably did not mind how these two would come together, but fortunately. The main characters that are currently seen do not appear motivated to finish each other: he covers flowers (he tells his friend "not to be loved" in love) and brushes him. . A little dance could not heal! This glamorous twosome is deliberately unreal for London and Venice settings, but we only see that they are led by Fred and Ginger. I do not know ... it's fantasy fantasy, they do not mind dumbed-down plot. The moments of music break the monotony of the scenario invented, but they do not overcome silliness in the area. ** ****
