I watched this DVD at my friends' house and I thought that Hollywood acts that were not very popular with Turkish films. I'm pretty interested in deciding to shoot later ... I think it was a tough experience. Then, after seeing the latest credits, "Turks began to suck in the Hollywood style movie." This is an insult to the seized genre of the movie ... but wait! Some names were not checked, there were no names of the Turks and no, there was no Turkish film; On the contrary, American American director and crew shot in America! That again thought to me! - How could you convince the names of Mikaile Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to participate in this project? money probably ... I kept thinking about that. How can you get the money to offer them and supposedly an international draw? Then all my meditation paid off and I came across the answer. You can hire the cheapest equipment and crew to hire. And if you still need difficulty adjusting your budget: writing and directing the movie you're trying to produce, or vice versa, I do not have any information about it. So the bottom line is not a bad film as everyone is so pleased ... In my case, even though you think about it, it does not matter if there's a lot of movies. you think at least; She asks you ... She leaves you credible ... and asks again.
