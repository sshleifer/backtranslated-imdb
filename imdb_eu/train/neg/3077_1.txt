Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a master with this film. It was a reality that he could not act to shoot the actors. He also decided to write a script based on the bad acid way. Put together, with a movie that absorbs more than one of the stockpunks that suits you with absorbents and washers. This movie was very painful. The spoonfuls of pain generated are the same as those produced by your genital organs, after which the whole wound is covered with salt and hydrochloric acid.
