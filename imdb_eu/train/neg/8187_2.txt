I went into this movie to be really awesome. And it was. Kathy Bates was a wonderful actor ... Before Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were unmistakable, Miranda Richardson could not get to know her wonderful performance. and love Fred's father had a line of Trevor Peacock (including the issue of Dibley's reputation). <br /> <br /> The land was predictable and full of space, and humor ... it was missing. (However, there was a part of the film that goes into the home of a Jewish family ... that made me laugh, because their expressions were classics) Do not see this movie as your other alternative. collision with a train (actually the train would be better ...)
