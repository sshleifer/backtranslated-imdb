A group of foreigners who are looking for human beings who have landed on the planet of prehistoric histories, where they eat fodder mushrooms and delay everyone. Dinosuars's "Planet" footage and huge jokes are definitely full. The play is also horrible, and this is not as bad as "Chickboxer" (what movie might be). This is still a stupid and foolish thing. The duration of 90 minutes is like an eternity and it is possible to curse life, so make yourself a great favor and go ahead, dirty, there is nothing to see. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers try to sell again as MdT3K style, they worked a decade ago to make fun, and it works, but it's not visible, Ariauna Albright is hot, but Lilith Stabs has a rather attractive voice. /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD More: Joke Commentary, 17 Scene Lies; 7 minutes into black featurette; Jessica Mills; Stills gallery; and the original trailer
