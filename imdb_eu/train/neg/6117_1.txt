I can not say that it's the worst movie ever, but I personally think this way, when it was originally published in theaters (1), when we saw the initial buzz was positive when I saw my girlfriend, and we've got tickets for INTRODUCTION, and (2) I still remember the movie I have a "serious" and the viewers trembled at a certain point and basically laughed at the rest of the movie. Once we got to the evil (and endless) fight against serpents, I think everyone has given up. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing that I give is the shooting of a sharp position. Oh, and Bo's breasts are, even though his action is so woody that the nudity is unerotical and that it is much more than a Playboy pictorial. <br /> <br /> The "dramatic tension" in this movie boasts a great performance and the tremendous direction of her husband. Snake fight must be one of the most ineffective sequences of "action" ever filmed. However, this is a bad movie that is bad enough, it is worth the trouble to see it unfortunately at the level of humor. Without a doubt, the worst movie ever I ever watched.
