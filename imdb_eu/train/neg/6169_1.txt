Being an enthusiast of horror movies, I thought it was pretty good, J-horror, and, moreover, gore nikeddo burâddo. I looked at the earthquake, I read comments and even looked at some pictures, it seemed good and horrifying before the download. So I was amazed by the enormous hope I had hoped to end my enthusiasm and be prepared to be afraid and amazed me. The land was ridiculous and did not make sense and it was not explained to us, it was the horny gore and it was horrible, and what was the cartoon sound effects? Playing was probably the only thing that was terrifying. I did not understand the idea of ​​cactuses and after having made a mumble mother disappear in the midst of the sea, they left pretty skins, or maybe I missed what I was seeing. I appreciate the way I appreciate it; Exciting and some scenes (talking about rare canary and mum?) I certainly think they were a little distant and not even in a terrible way, they were persuaded, and this was more compelling than being a comedy. I think it is more than horror. However, it's a very entertaining film and got a lot of laughter for me and a couple of friends, but unfortunately we did not expect a horror comedy worth the clock for the value of entertainment, but do not wait for a dreadful, profoundly horrifying and overwhelming movie; you will be disappointed. If it were a horror comedy or a mistake, I'm sure about nine, the scene was curious when the husband went up through his wife's womb and closed the wounds, but I was terrified as a horror.
