Plot is not worth discussing even with corruption, murder, power and other issues about thriller. Sometimes they are interesting characters. It is not realistic but interesting. <br /> <br /> Development is slow as tea tea drinking ceremony. Visions are not surprising, but enough to ease the eye tension. The film must be well-liked before dinner before going to bed - nothing surprising is nothing, nothing is excessive. Movie sitcom style. <br /> <br /> Woody liked me - excellent performance. I had to fight the wrong ground and work was pretty good. The rest can be endured, but they are very predictable. The whole clock is better than most of the television shows.
