For years, it has been a bad start for two comedians of the sitcom story, such as the back (for example), and from there it went down. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) meet in New York after a long detachment and continue to live with each other. What a new concept! However, when they relate to sadness, these two years have been the ones that deserve to talk about them (much less to make the movie). That's why the scripts place old-fashioned tools behind each other (most of them work in the women's workplace), while the original show wins the charm and sophistication of the winners. The help tasks are immediately unforgettable, humor does not exist, and Moorek and Harper have once collected chemicals that have disappeared. Moor believes that this project was paralyzed for many years before he was committed to the "right hand". If that was considered "correct", what buried them? It's not the age of the characters that make it (it's time to go untidy), but it's almost completely lacking in imagination, and it does not exclude the elements that work the series. He was a rider at one time, but, of course, he was unable to create an interest in sponsors. Or, however, among potential audiences. Quickly forgiven and compassionate, the film is a terrible insult and is a classic insult.
