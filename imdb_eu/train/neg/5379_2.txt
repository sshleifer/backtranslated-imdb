Released as a DVD in the UK, like Ax, Choke is a teenage teenager in almost every category: the story does not exist, it's mostly a movie that's mostly about a dark building. except for two characters (except those who want to survive the movie), everyone is wonderful, the viewer can not care less when they die; Deaths are not enough to be overwhelming (if you miss a stroke of a crushed veal covered with false blood); and the sexual scene is free of nudity (a mistake that can be made in a slasher movie!). <br /> <br /> The fixed helmet lines are part of a group of world-wide blocked people in the world. The biggest nightclub (there are no-canceled corridors and rooms, unlike the one I've ever seen), which is an invisible invader. In order to get a low budget effort, the production values ​​are in agreement, and cast seems to be quite capable of being actors, but it is not enough for real fear, it's really dirty (this is slasher?), A terribly overwhelming conversation (especially a non-compatible battery) ) and in trying to add some style to use some nasty techniques, the movie is very boring.
