First of all, I can say that the first 20 minutes are excellent, the monster is wonderful and CGI can be reasonably done. It's so bad that the rest of the movies are so depressing <br /> <br /> ******** SPOILERS below ******* <br /> <br /> From this movie anti-American In order to see the first scene, I would not have to worry about this stereotypical situation (British people are just enough from Hollywood), but here Americans are not challenging the brain dead. He asks realism and his left point that Yankee has raped his mother. <br /> <br /> The love scene was very bad and the movie part began to decline. <br /> <br /> Here, we introduce ourselves to the awning and aunts of the Olympic medalists, who enter into remembrance and the father begins to blame for the death of his daughters, and then he begins to blow up the ground before crying. There is a realistic connection during the crisis! <br /> <br /> The whole line of the virus is ridiculous. Americans know that there are no viruses, why ask about time, money and resources to research? The U.S. government agent will order Korean innocuous brain drills, which Americans seem to be malicious (or stupid), it did not help him to make a comical effect on him. <br /> <br /> The movie is about mammoth hunting. The United States and Korean special forces are assigned to be looking for creatures, even though the films are indirectly invisible. The only person that hunts monsters is a random tramp that looks like the Korean people, the main family and the end of it! Of course, some US / Korean agents are trying to stop on the road. <br /> <br /> The sister introduced only the movie, eventually could make an indispensable shoot. It was classy, ​​you think it would be happening, but to make it worse until everything is sharp! and my last annoyance, what reason did the mother survive? Within 5 minutes the monster was swimming under water! why did not the monster eat the kids?
