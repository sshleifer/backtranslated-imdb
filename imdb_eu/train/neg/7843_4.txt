The sequence is weak: the interest and slight touch of "Man Called Horse" is lacking almost everywhere, and compared to each other, it does not seem to be the same gender. <br /> <br /> The first parody of the return match is almost impossible and Indian attempts to reminisce several events, but finds a tough way to get the first bottle of magic. In this movie, the tribe is lost and abandoned, after losing their country, modern life has gone into paradise and they live unhappy poverty and poverty. Perhaps this is the point: it took us to a place where the first film takes us, a much easier time. This leads us to the indies of a miserable world, and the White Man is a hero and savior who denies the whole idea of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> The first beauty lies in the white man in white man. They learned and found real civilization rather than values ​​in Western materialism. It lacks the second movie, so we have a weak film. <br /> <br /> A great despair.
