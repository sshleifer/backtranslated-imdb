This could be very good if I could see. Handheld cameras were very strong. I was worried about the initial credits. We felt a little miserable at the end. But we were left to the end of the film, which was charming and interesting, giving a broad view of South African pop. The black and white movie improved its passionate feeling. The performance seemed really authentic. Some of the interviews were difficult to understand, but the theater was not so much a lot of fun as non-African theater. Although it does get a disease of the movement, it could be considered seriously aside from this film. It's funny, but nausea is not worth it.
