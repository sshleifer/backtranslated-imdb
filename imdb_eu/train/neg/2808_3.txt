In the story of a photographer who slices pictures of the television and television series from the 1980's (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel, etc.). Of course, patterns and other people start to start the dead, creating all types of complications. <br /> <br /> Not very good thriller is not enough nudity and violence to get R grade, but it's not enough to be a real material. interest This is the best Cinemax channel described as a kind of movie that gave Channelx a special name for Skinamax. I can not really see it except for the sense of that observation. (I also have to comment on the fact that I have to keep the movie full of smoke, when it is silent when anyone is silent)
