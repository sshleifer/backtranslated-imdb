There is nothing to exchange this movie. They took a stingy story, mistakes, wrote poorly written, they wrote poorly. Bad conversation is wrong and trash is done in a story. <br /> <br /> As the art fails, it is as bad as trade. Who can have that goal in the market. Which age group? What interest group? <br /> <br /> Someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie. I would like to see it. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of bad movies, from "Sailor Who Grace" and "Manos". My options are three bad options. The movies I've ever seen. All of this has to be continuously forced to conduct interviews with VanDamme. <br /> <br /> I challenge you. Watch this movie and do academic activity - how can you take it and make it worse? I can not think of it in a way.
