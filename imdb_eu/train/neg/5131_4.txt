I liked it, but I think it could be iron. This work by Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is completely understandable and is directly saved by non-gossip video from Janeane Garofalo's turns. When he looks at Frasier's animal, he finds himself trapped in a trap of enthusiasm when he refuses to give himself up to the best friend (Uma Thurman) when a caller is seated. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting film by Ben Chaplin's fascinating career. He shot a British actor with the Hollywood movie treadmill. It is noteworthy that the anonymity of studio productions is not surprising based on its foundation, although it appears in the essential cameo scenes in the two films of Teres Malick. Uma Thurman is an automatic pilot in the automatic pilot, and Michael Lehmann is competing in every way. Although icky phone sex. 4/10
