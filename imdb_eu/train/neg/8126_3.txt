I did not think it was so huge, it seems some. You can not go in the middle of the horror movie curves you need to sleep when you can not sleep, but of course this is not a better quality. It's true that the performance is not very good - I thought that Marianne McAndrew, Cathy Beck, thought she was a passion, but the main problem was that some of the plot owners did not really feel for me. Becks are on a trip that describes John (Stewart Moss), and partially did not have a honeymoon (now romantic!). The piece of work has something to do with tourist caves. a group of people in a cave about work?) But it's a bit more strange to know if a doctor is a researcher in the field of medicine prevention (did not this connection completely lose me). The cave begins with the transformation of the cave, a hybrid human bean (although it is finally seen as a man similar to a make-up that looks like a make-up), and a feast is beginning to die. There is another problem here. The first murder is a nurse in the hospital. Initially, everyone believes that death was an accident. The second murder is a young girl who describes how she broke her throat. Sheriff (Michael Pataki) tells us that his death was a nurse (like a crashing ice like it? - how could anyone think it was an accident?) And what about the Sheriff? When the seat of the Cathyko hotel is trimmed into the seat, it seems to be rape, it seems to be quite absurd and then everything seems normal. The endless thing left unresolved is also saddled with one of the most selective songs that I've ever heard in a movie. However, I saw something here. Occasionally, pure garlic can take half an hour. Very bad, yes - but it's not so horrible as people say.
