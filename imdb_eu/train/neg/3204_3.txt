In fact, it was not so bad (although it was much worse), it's still a very good movie. Basically, Siegel's new version of "Coogan's Bluff", the main difference between Clint Eastwood's hat, and Joe Karlos, has more choreography than Baker, if it were one of the actors. <br /> <br /> However, Venantino Venantini is great (and very funny) a bad guy, Vittorio Gassman quote. This is the main reason to sit down with this strappile, since the rest of the casts give an awesome interpretation, especially the girl. The old Rossano Brazzero was hard to ever play a romantic date (see "Mondo Cane" for women to escape). Here, watching Ben Gazzara in the background, nothing happens. Unfortunately Joe Don is the show. And all this was a generic music action movie in the 80's, which was not boring. <br /> <br /> Greydon Clark can make good B-Movies ("Without warning") but travels here, falls. It breaks your nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least the locations of Malta were nice, and there is no Venancio to save that day. 3/10.
