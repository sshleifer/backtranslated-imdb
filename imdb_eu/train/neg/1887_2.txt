At the beginning of the day, I introduced an argument that people complained so much about modern cinema, I found a strange expression: "The development of new movies is just as good or interesting." According to the corresponding film, that is, many things, sometimes special effects are general and on the plot of Hollywood junk, such as War Of The Worlds. Social commentary and the desperate struggle to return to the "art" cinema are movies like Dog Days. <br /> <br /> I usually have a lot of tolerance for the movies, either dull or ridiculous (good, long, like Andrei Rublev and Dogville, for me who likes to sit alongside Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West. I close this film, a bit more than 30 minutes more than I needed. I had no interest in any kind of character and I did not find any amazement when it was not pessimistically covered. The effort to tell about the dirt of society, this movie also makes it very easy to sense in a very sincere sense of self I've been giving it a lot of movies about the same issue, but there are so many best films, depressing, pathetic people (Happiness, Gummo, Kids, Salus, Storytelling, Backstage) with really deep and emotional characters Identity. Dog Days was the contempt of eighth-grade society, how people really do it He knew it, and decided to be a shy and innocent attempt at "art". This is not something that deserves clear, boring, and careful observation of the characterization of the stranger, or of the dirt of society.
