Well, to be honest, I do not know why they all think so great. It's not really. Two good things came out of this movie 1. Jack's performance, it was very good for me to have my hat. 2. Danny's performance was good. There's no other fool. And what was Stanley Kubrick drawing like Shelly Wendy? It was so bad. Every time she frightened she had the same look. The problem of this movie was over. I would have more respect for Kubrick in another way. And all the movies were stupid. The problem of the movie was that the book was so much better. So do not watch the movie book and you will be much better. 3/10.
