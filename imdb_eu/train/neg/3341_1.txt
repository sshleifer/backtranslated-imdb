With Dolph Lundgren, I just rented this movie from movies I have not seen from Rocky IV. Unfortunately, this movie was a great despair. Lundgren was the bad behavior of all parties, it was a good time. Kata Dob√≥ was a nice addition to her ridiculous and make-up attire. <br /> <br /> The plot is not clear in a film that is repeated in millions of times. The insidious ones were completely stereotyped and Lundgren's character was not in that depth. I expected a movie masterpiece, but unfortunately it is not a sincere action. Each turn on the plot is very predictable and commercial characters such as extravagant characters and comics will soon soon get angry. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to some kids who like a comic book, but only if it is not available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I think the average vote of 7.0 had to be 6 votes due to those who participated in this film)
