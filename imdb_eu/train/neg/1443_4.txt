Start a bit: Swayze speaks several times with Zulu friends or tells a language among the tribes. It is a huge increase, usually in the US and in the United Kingdom, public films believe that people on the planet speak English (if you are one of them: they do not). <br /> <br /> But acting is 'tenkrommend' in Holland (it tells you your fingers in a good way). I like Swayze, but that's why it's horrible. His jaw muscles make extra hours, and the entire film wrinkles his forehead - some have to be said. No Patrick: he's stupid and he's indemnity-free. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) chose a performance that does not meet the style of her colleagues. His performance is that the film could be put on today. And it is not. Well, Alison. I was dressed like the best people who liked the African continent and Onopa Barea. The character is clean, hot and horrible. It's a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> Overview: it's entertaining on a rainy day. Pity It could be better. Sack Director
