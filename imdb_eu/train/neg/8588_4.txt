Sith Revenge starts with a long sequence of action, though it's incredibly exciting. The next hour and fifteen minutes are very boring, with a huge conversation and all the pre-series series. The only thing that improves the procedure is slow (and I mean it's slow). We know what we know from Darth Vader. And finally, when that happens, it's pretty good. It's not great. Not good too. But pretty well. This film is praising itself, because the white stars of the previous sixth do not absorb. Instead, rolls are dull and common. But you must say, in any case, these CGI environments are really impressive. Do you fight light? They all are mess fuzzy. I think the dark side started Lucas's budget and nobody realized it. This will make a lot of money, but thanks for the end of God, just worshiping this franchise has been beaten enough. I saw the show at 12:01, and then I said a very small group of children, that was great! But everybody over the age of eight murmured the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was boring. I'd like to see Darth Vader's better birth. So we all said.
