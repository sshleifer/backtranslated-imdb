I can not believe this show is very popular. I think I'm a fan of science fiction. I've read a lot of science fiction novels and I've had a lot of science fiction movies and TV shows. I really can not even consider this true science fiction. Every one of my seated episodes was like the crazy and blue version of the Star Trek episode, which made it all the less interesting and exciting. Talk about something boring, that straddles Stargate from time to time and ends up on a planet that resembles Earth, with humans and people with sound! It seemed very little in the budget. All characters forget about one-dimensional cuts, and many humble attempts fall. It reminds me of a merchant with a famous athlete, when he's trying to be fun, but it's not. It's just sad. <br /> <br /> The movie was also horrible. There are many things you can do with a portable portal, however, ARMY is getting bored everywhere. This is not showing any imagination! I really thought that the "Alien Nation" series a few years ago (based on the Alien Nation movie) was much better. This show really had good stories and decent characters. The "Alien Nation" did not come to my mind, but compared to these misfortunes, it was very good! film lame close! At least every stroller should update the "crispy swimming pool" of the special effect.
