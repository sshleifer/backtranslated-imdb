First, let me say I'm in FanPro. I see myself seeing it in a pleasant way after I canceled it. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are a decent effort. So, I have a soft-point fanpro material, and I'll forget about the things that I did wrong. <br /> <br /> So ST: HF. Well, good things first. The enthusiasm becomes a credible show and, to a large extent, the crew of ships seem all the time with their tasks. Then, the effects are not bad for the effort made at home, it does not hurt you anymore. The stories are not bad either. Nothing is particularly innovative, but pretty strong and at least a story arc. <br /> <br /> But it has a lot of defects. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, if they even have the Star Trek footage to extract footage, backgrounds, music, and effects, I do not see the science-fiction music score that is practically everywhere. Aliens Starship Troopers snaps the orchestra head in one point or another. Similarly, there is a lot of footage from other films that looks more like the CGI's head. Although Gray's war ships, for example, are hidden, Star Wars Star Destroyers are quite remarkable. And the station is the Ticonderoga Flot Battle Station of Starship Troopers. Similarly, the sound effects of several Star Wars films appear in space battles, as well as animated films. In a scene of the first or second season, I believe that you are announcing that the two TIE fighters fly in the battle of the past, that is to say, any favors that you disrupt your dismay. <br /> <br /> Efficiency varies greatly, seeing it extremely painful. Everyone improves their seasons, but they hope they are keen on the screen, especially during the seasons. They also made some interesting plays. Let's say that the food replicators of this show "cake" are permanently put to rest. <br /> <br /> Makeup effects are generally quite effective. However, without a mercy, they should be invited to the death of Ferengi and Cardassian for the use of masks, for background use or for "passing". They are not surpassing realists. I saw one of them at each time (as well as trying to laugh too much) I waited for the misfortune to get out of the gun and announce that "this is a stick!" In a scene, a "Cardassian" speaks really dressed. The lips are not only moving, but the mask does not even have the opening of the mouth. Someone has to deal hard to this. Could it not be an artisan knife, for God's sake! There are some well-done, but necessarily fun, work-related machines, such as Herman Munster looks similar. <br /> <br /> Writing, though consistent, is nothing new. The script is tracked by the DS9, which ships take part in different missions from DS12. The new "The Gray" enemy is not very threatening and the plot of their line effectively rolls up Borg's threads. That is, Starfleet Gray comes across, grays are very strong, Starfleet does not run away from life, and then start searching all the ways to tackle the enemy through technology, etc. the conversation is bone. Star Trek writers have had the ability to write "technology insert here" for years. "Quantitative plane discriminators" or "uninsulated charges", etc. It means using the latest plan to face the future, etc. In other words, I say that it is nonsense and resolution that says that they are in the case. > <br /> The words are really gibberish. This is not a problem, but when ST: HF makes a mess, it takes real-world comments on this concept. <br /> <br /> Tactical tips, such as sounds like "We Need to Re-enlist", are good, but not in a group already given by a trio of characters. Also, when asked about the situation, the tactician is listening to responding "we counted three wars". Did he really need to count? Pull it! The questioner asked, "Are you sure?" or "You can not verify". However, this is my favorite comment: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we set two-way communication?" <br /> <br /> Comms Officer: "No, we can only send and receive it ..." <br /> <br /> Well, duh! ... <br /> <br /> When all is said, the show continues to improve. Seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad, showing 3 improvements but 4 and 5 are significantly improving. Still 6 season is quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> I have a problem in choosing entertainment support. Quicktime gets sucked, in truth, and they're moving faster in divx / avi format. Some of us actually watch shows downloaded and on a decent size screen and do not look at a small QT window on your computer monitor. Quicktime does not only make it difficult, but the 320x180 resolution of the shows is not scalable. Actually, the shows are quite relaxed, like a copy of VHS's tenth generation. It was a possibility to download at least some hi-res downloads. <br /> <br /> However, it promises spectacles and I like some characters. But this is 40 episodes, so I do not know that there is a lot about the development of the characters it says. <br /> <br /> But what is said is free ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> PS: from 28 votes, 19 people show 9 or 10 they rated it as Hmmmm ... were we seeing the same show? Or are you three years old?
