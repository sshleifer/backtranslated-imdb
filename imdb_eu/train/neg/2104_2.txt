This video was purchased at Walmart's $ 1 ship. I think I paid too much! In the 1940s, Bela Lugos made three feature-length films for small studios (in this case, Monogram, made by most of Bowry Boys). The misfortune of most of these films has not gotten a great deal of their latest films (Ed Wood "classics", for example, "Monster and the Plan 9 From Outer Space") "wives), but they do not have bad films, but they have to be avoided, but the toughest fans. <br /> <br /> I am an old film, so I tried. Also, some of these smaller movies were really good, but not this. It brings together young women. They never really did. Why they should be bride or why they should be They had a problem with the women or what their wives had been - so the plot never gave in. The reporter was really annoying (Lois Lane, without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) trying to get to the bottom of all the murders of the body, so Lugosi's house It follows some of the tracks that follow: Lugosi house has a strange daughter with his wife, an assistant woman and apparently assistant son of two daughters (sexual sea hunch backed ugly and dwarf). Of course, this dizzy reporter repeatedly dissolves through the film - apparently narcolepsy and good research journalism. In the end, all of us with their hands are all right. When it's over, the journalist and the doctor they met recently decide to marry. And, naturally, the reporter's cameraman mutes when it happens. If you are not aware, it is deleted in this movie. Or maybe they slept as a slow and thought-provoking movie!
