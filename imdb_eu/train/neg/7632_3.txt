Many people see this as a classic, but, of course, I have to be lost. Anarene, Texas, at the beginning of the 50s, life is pretty dull. This means that life's 50s life in Anarene, Texas, will be boring! What do people see so much? Finally when the last image of Anarene is closed, there will be nothing in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) points to the end of the film. But before closing it, there is not much to be done, so basically everything is in sex. Baccalaureate students plan to begin to lose virginity - sometimes with adults and sometimes bored people in the city. You see, well, they do not have to do much - except for sex (sometimes with teenagers and sometimes bored) or be aware of the high school football team. The three-time movie I thought I would add a sparkling drama. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing happens, that's why Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) have quit, but nothing happens because Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) has kidnapped a girl but not nothing happens That's why it really happens. The only thing that has set the dramatic value of the film has finally come through the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms), which emphasizes the emptiness that inhabits this pathetic little town, as far as human beings are concerned about the body around them. to go for breakfast. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovic shot in black and white, that is, I think I want to emphasize what this country is about, but it was interesting to look at the actors at the beginning. Bottom, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (It was terribly frightening to see how much Quaid - in 1971 really looks like his Cousin Eddie character in the National Lampoon Vacation films). Classic? I do not think so! 3/10
