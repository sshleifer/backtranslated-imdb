I was so excited when I saw that it was available! I could not wait to see. What energy lost! The local music store is like the favorite CD you've found on the back of the rack. If you were a fan of hard-earned you were sure that the discovery was valuable. But when you heard it, it was clear why these dogs were not brought to the real album. This DVD is recommended only for 'fullists' who need to have everything done by Lynch. "Six Men Sick Sick" is quite impressive and short and repetitive. Lynchen's "Grandma's" work is lacking. It's boring and like a student's movie. It was 70 years ... If you are expecting psychoanalyzing the director it is only interesting. However, you can see the seeds of its commercial brands and sounds. "Alpahabet" is unforgettable (it's not really! I can not remember this in any way!) "Amputa" does not make any sense. "Cowboy and French" is just that. The "Lumiere" is the only one that deserves a bit. Without a dialogue, Lynch tells a worrying story that matches Lynch's best work. I had to see this several times. But it's less than 2 minutes. DVD rental or shopping is worth a bit of trouble.
