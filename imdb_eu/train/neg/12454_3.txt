Here I am reading this message for Wonder Woman's clothing television. As the film had to be shown at the time, it did not wear traditional costumes. Producers adhered to the initial conception of the original comic book writer. <br /> <br /> Like the same movie, I have to agree with other posters here. Snoozefest! I was a child, when he appeared in ABC in 1974, so I was in a good age because he appreciated a movie about a comic book hero. However, I was so impressed with the plot, when I saw the movie three quarters. <br /> <br /> Of course, I did not like it at the proper age to be grateful to Cathy Lee! :-)
