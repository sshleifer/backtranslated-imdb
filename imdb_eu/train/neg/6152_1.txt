Many people say that "I have never seen the worst movie ever" was said about almost any movie. However, I have almost seen almost 700 movies, which I personally felt was angry and angry. This is my first movie review, by the way, and I was registered with the filmmaker in the face of the wickedness of this movie. When I saw him at the theater (myself and my two friends there were 5 people there), and after 15 years I can not remember a lot of details, but the attitude I leave from the theater is still clear. <br /> <br /> --- Spoiler alert --- <br /> <br /> Oh, where did you start? The crushed loser behind the altar, runs on a ski Wednesday, who blames her with a lying blonde who is interested in her, will take her home to meet her family, they are all cannibals, and they are the boss, a pathetic attempt at a dramatic flight. butts and brother girlfriend go hand in hand, they will never die happily. Puke First of all, the gag are so bad, and I needed to understand that it was trying to be FUNNY, which was COMEDIA. The special effects, if there are a few, seem to have been 15 years earlier. The last dramatic thing was that it was so bad and they saw that it was not practically impossible to see (the whole cannibalistic family is laying on the lawn, when Tom and Jerry are standing upright). They are sure that they are much more, but I do not want to report them again.
