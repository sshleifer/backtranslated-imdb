I did not have a real hope for this movie and I'm happy. I would have been disappointed if it was too bad. <br /> <br /> Where did you start? First of all, I think that 15% of the movie was in a dark forest in footage footage. I understand They are scarlet. I think the title "Scarecrows" is enough. Secondly, there is never any thing about melancholic and paranormal things. I'm leaving the WTF several times? <br /> <br /> Third, it takes the movie seriously. The blood buckets, women are screams of crying and violence, are the result of a psychopath or an ancient curse. But these films are known as B movies, and yet Dead Snow (Scandanavian zombie flick horny) or Evil Dead 2. But the movie is not about its rigor. <br /> <br /> In the end, there should be more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said. If you need to have a non-download movie, do it with the killer. And if you have a hot and half-hot girl, one of them must show a minimal side edge. <br /> <br /> So, as summed up, "skipcups" must be skipped. and bend before his eyes. Thank you to me.
