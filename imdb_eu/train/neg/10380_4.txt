I do not think anyone watching this movie should be sitting remotely like the classic ghost, but you should ask yourself once you're afraid of it. That does not work at this level, but the cast tries hard and the film does not end up making the happiest. The story is an American couple who travels to Kyotora (Japan), writes a book by Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) and brings his wife Laura (Susan George) and her daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). The Alex Curtis (Doug McClure) friend at the American Consulate helps them find a living home and find a haunted man. In the same house, 140 years earlier, his wife Samurai found him cheating and killed both and then suicide. Their ghosts live in the house and when arriving at Fletcher, rare things do not start much earlier. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sometimes the ghosts live in Fletcher's body and start playing similar to Japanese people and Laura begins with Alex It starts with flirting, which causes it. Meanwhile, Ted begins to play more rigorously and when Amy Amy flutches the soup, Monk asks for help. Unfortunately, the ghosts Ted, Laura and Alex play a deadly scene just like 140 years ago. <br /> <br /> Kevin Connor directed the movie, known as a good television director, but has done it. Horror and science fiction movies have worked with McClure before and with some of them. This is never a terrifying or evolving environment, but I have two things I like. First of all, it does not have the best ending, since the couple are defeated by the couple. Instead, it ends in a bloody struggle, where everyone has fallen into the wickedness of ghosts. Secondly, Susan George has cast! I have always been his enthusiast, especially since Schlock appeared, but his performances are always top class. Likewise, it is naked and appears here in two different scenes, and although it has no classical features, it has a peculiar appearance in its surroundings, which is why it is a reason why it was so popular. After having appeared in such a stupid movie like this, I think it's about to leave the business or just work from time to time. This is not a bad film, but it's never convincing and seeing ghosts when the monk gives up exorcism, it's almost worth a giant. In that sense, it's absurd and I hope that George decides to resume his career.
