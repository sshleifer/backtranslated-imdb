What was with the clothes? At the end of the 1960s, they were dressed in the 70s. Cars were also outdated. The school was obsolete. Moj's dresses were out of date, and the hospital seemed like something in the 40's, on your stairs and on wooden stairs. There was nothing in the whole film in 1991. My mother laughed, "Geeeee-od!" WHEN WAS THE FILM MADE? When we pressed our remote "INFO BOTOIA", we are convinced that it was written in 1991! Did he noticed someone else? But my favorite FAVOR, when she told her about her great body, talked about the inverse cross on the mirror on the phone and said, "Well, look, I have a congressional meeting. I will talk later." This line was classical. ONLY AT HUMAN! My favorite part of my mother was "Devil Child of Spawn" her own Rottweiler. My mother said: "What is the devil's riches ... Rottweiler" he told me. The church also enjoyed people falling in churches, shaking hands. OUTSTANDING THE OTHER PARTY was the school guy in the parking lot, guided by 5 kilometers per hour, with a garbage truck or a dump truck or a front loader. It was about 20 seconds to stop the car ... but he continued, with his face confused. I mean, how quickly can you go to the school car park ?!?! Whatever!
