I got a very cheap DVD and Drewbie is completely, and probably this film is the only one that could ever be interesting. Her scene is very pretty, like a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, numerous sexy outfits and so on. never shows a friendly charm with his latest film. The film itself is pretty average or sub-average, and much more looks like it is for making television movies a lot. No real horror or tension arises and conversations are bad. However, it may not be understood at all. But, at the very least, you do not expect the fountain you're looking for, and it's much faster than you expected. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this movie is only Drewbies.
