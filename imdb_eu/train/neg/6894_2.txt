He writes, directs and produces his cinematic masterpiece. Usually, his concept is above the budget. Usually writes a full script on all lines of writing. Normally, it is more interested in the great fall of the story, than the individual scene with the actors to collaborate. Normally, it ends with an attempt to create wonders in a small budget with a weak film. Usually it ends up in meetings (we do not call justice for the scene) seems like a 12-year-old. And, usually, the scenes that the viewer does not play badly play badly. If you look at judges from this perspective, you can immediately say that it is just the usual rate.
