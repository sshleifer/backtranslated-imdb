I bought this DVD for $ 1 in Walmart. After seeing it, I could return to the store and I tried to get it back! The only reason that I gave the movie 2 and not one is that the story has some novels but it never gets interesting. This movie has a budget for the market for theater markets: low budgets, amateur plays and a liberal sexual dose (early 60s). In fact, I ask myself the only reason that I can make a really good movie. Because some people knew each other. The film focuses on the doctor who wants to transplant his girlfriend's head into an unwieldy donor's body. Most of the potential donors are stripped of skanky or a pattern; Filmmaking is the true real purpose of being the most deprived of clothes. However, they keep too many films worth seeing, and the movie is not enough to be worthy to watch bad filmmakers.
