Naked men who are naked and half naked on the other side bumps over each other. That's it. We see this about 5 minutes. It is filmed in black and white, half-naked men are going up one after another, with a melodic melody. He looked interesting, but there was no plot and really - this was a disturbing violence. In addition, homosexual eroticism is played, but it was not a good idea to mess with violence. I would like some people who like avant-garde material, but it seemed incomprehensible, boring, stupid and (and almost without) disturbing. Really, what's that all about? I watched as part of a gay short film and the viewer was silent. I really want to go less than 1.
