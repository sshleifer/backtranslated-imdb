There is no explanation for the heavy NIGHTMARE WEEKEND. Description fails. A character that transforms personal objects into a computer that can insert silver balls into the mouth of the victim, that is, kills them or turns them into zombies. The whole thing is so amazing. In her room there is also a little girl computer and with a computer she speaks the right puppet !!!!!!!! I do not do this. The computer also controls cars, even if the computer is not connected to the vehicle. <br /> <br /> "The movie" is a complete bin. Surrealistic trash bad. The trash is bad, innate. There are a lot of sex scenes here and there that are not very hot or erotic. It seems a scene that a woman loves seemingly or frankly wants to burst into the ground. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it's one of the worst movies ever made. In it BOARDINGHOUSE, a live-sex video (BOOGEYMAN II) (NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II with scenes with a toothbrush!). At least it's fun to watch and try what happens.
