I am not only admired in Superman's first film, a film directed by Richard Donner. Richard Lester's Superman 2 ... I'm not lonely I do not even give myself to Richard Donner's surgery on the same movie. Only, still an absolute abomination. <br /> <br /> Superman is canceled in the world. Credibility is required in strong doses, but Superman 2 is too far away. No matter who directs Superman 2 script insults the minds of a first-class student. In a sense, there is no plot in which the characters are not necessarily motivated, unlike the original superman. With or without its powers, Superman's power (or its absence) is handled incredibly. Too much criticism, so I will not disturb you. I disapprove this movie ... The version of Lester's slapstick is perhaps better suited to the slow script that is based on this film. Super-duper bad
