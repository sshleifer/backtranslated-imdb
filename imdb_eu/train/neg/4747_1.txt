I thought this movie was horrible. I'm Chinese, so I thought it was totally wrong. Many things were wrong. Wendy's mother was the only thing that featured the story about the statues she had taken to care for her husband ShiHuang. Also, I thought the fighting scenes were very black and fake. Many actors and actors were not very big. Unexpectedly some of the "funny" jokes were stupid. I think that this film should get the worst score that it can get. Disney needs more information on Chinese history if they want to create extravagant films. Mulan was very accurate. See if you want to miss a movie a bit.
