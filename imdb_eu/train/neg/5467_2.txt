What to say about this movie. Well, there are some good students with bad medications and they will become a disadvantaged drug seller. Two people have adverse effects on becoming a type of toxic criminals and their girlfriend throws a creature that grows in a basement school. All this is done for a period of 84 minutes. This movie is pretty bad and it must be permanently blocked. Although it is not a reason, some people like Troma like movies and can watch them. But for me, the movies are the worst film Troma. I saw this crazy curiosity.
