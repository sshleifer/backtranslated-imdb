I only saw this movie for the implementation. A friend was shot at an old hotel owned by shares. The land was predictable, the performance was mostly in the middle of the country, all reductions were frightened, not real fears. <br /> <br /> I do not remember a large part of the plot, and I think that's not because it's not to be remembered. They did not even use the hotel ... The beaches are wonderful and the hotel is located on the peninsula. In the shoreline, you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay, it's a mysterious spectacle for the first time in the morning or when the winds sweep the cracks at night. <br /> <br /> You have the best way to watch this movie in a remote way to keep up with this action (and I do not use that term) to be able to pause the scenes and beauty in the surrounding area!
