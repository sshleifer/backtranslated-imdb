In 1454, in France, Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) wounded herself and her mistress Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) is being tortured in spite of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they die, their executioners curse the next generations. Currently (in the 70s), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and their beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) are attending a session. Alaric de Marnac spirit They decide to travel to Villas de Sade, the estate of the Hugo family in the country, with a treasure hidden in the monastery. They find the head of the wings and the boys are aware of them, and Mabille lives and the natives run in sacred faces. After his father's death, Elvira (Emma Cohen) remembers that Thor's Hammer amuleta is hidden in a puddle; Together with Maurice, Alaric de Marnac and Mabille are trying to defeat the devil. <br /> <br /> Last weekend I bought a horror genre box with five DVDs with Paul Naschy for $ 9.98; Although I did not have any references, I decided to take the opportunity. The movie "Trash" was the first DVD made with the "Horror Tomb of Horror," and the first DVD with the first version, Ed Wood. A ridiculous story, script, director, performances, cinematography, decoration, special effects and editing and bare women are published much. The result is horny and I certify that Ed Wood's style is back. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
