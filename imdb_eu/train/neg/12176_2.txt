The original Trancers is not an excellent movie anymore. It had high soil holes and very little internal logic. However, it was entertaining, made better than most B-movie films, and it could be surprisingly amazing. Sadly, Trancers II is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Trancers II has the same problem with most flop monitors. The plot is visible, and it's a bad writing. It seems to people that are behind this movie that it was enough to bring the first movie together and that it was nothing else. Non-level actors like B Timmin's, such as Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs, were able to drag this movie. <br /> <br /> General summary received: Jack Deth (Thomerson) was sent to a future police station in 1985 to save the members of his government members. After the events of the first transactions, II. Jack Deth Lena is married (Helen Hunt), the woman he met in the first film, and both live with Hap Ashby, who sent Deth to the past to protect men. Whistler's brother (the first bad film) has been traveling over time to create a transition army. People turned zombies dead, to kill Ashby. Jack's role is more complicated as his first wife, since Jack had been killed before he had passed to the past, returned to stop Whistler's brother, and now Jack is at work. <br /> <br /> I have two real problems with this movie. In the first, the Transcers creation method is completely different from the methods used in the first film. It's a bit annoying for some bad examples of Soviet rudimentation, always using something similar to technique. <br /> <br /> Another strange thing is the love triangle between Deth, Lena and Deth. Alice Stilwell (Jack's First Wife) has very little time. This was particularly worrying because it is much more interesting than the real movie. He thought something was in order to fill the movie space. Alice's character, especially when her husband is married to her husband and wife, seems very superficial or too scanty. <br /> <br /> I can think of the only reason to watch this movie, it's worth seeing the whole series Trancers (currently in total six films). Otherwise, if you are a fan of the original Trancers, follow this warm sequel.
