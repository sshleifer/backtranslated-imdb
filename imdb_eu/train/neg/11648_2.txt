As if there was not enough among those around that time, I saw the first GODFATHER clone of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) here this year. The tide value of the time is Telly Savalas, and the procedure goes into the press and is seen behind, a style of French painter dressed in a hat and hat with flowers! Not only does it look like the Sicilian, nor does it even accentuate it as a drawing. Antonio Sabato, then, is not doing any gangster, as well as being a leading man; His relationship with Savalas is not convinced that he becomes a father in the eyes of an eye (especially later joined with his nephew nephew). Also, for the gangster film, there is little action to talk about and it's not memorable (even though the end of the clinic is well managed); In addition, Francesco De Masi's score is useful, but it's not anywhere else. By the way, I started renting a vault in my basement, so cast members will never see a movie or title!
