This movie was not so bad compared to the first two sequels of the original. Martin Kitrosser's 13th feria on Friday. The play is very bad, but the special effects are gore and interesting. Screaming is a thing that I like about Mad George (he is an artist who makes the effects of the film), its effects are so pure and strange as they are, and I will keep you in a bad movie to find out they will be nonsensical. . The movie is not really all that gory, but there is an eye-eyeing Munching badly-nasty scene with a maggot toy (what !?!) Mickey Rooney's guest appearance probably was not very enthusiastic but he needed. then money, possibly? If you liked the fourth installment of Weirdo (my favorite 5), you might like it. I liked the matrix better! Enjoy.
