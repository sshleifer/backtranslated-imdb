The loss of time in this movie was very important. <br /> <br /> I watched this film with a cinematic hobby group, because they liked cinema in many movies, but still a sharp eye for "genius" (as one of these) comments on this site, I think labeling this steamed pepper?) ; none of them found the only quality of exchange. I finished the movie to speed up the cancellation chorus. I will not print again here. <br /> <br /> Here I can not guess the good opinions given here by Sir Anthony Hopkins. Then, as one of these reviewers will tell you, the film itself finances? No other Hollywood or anywhere else in the world, in that sense, could be cited by a single penny or his good name with this movie. Do not let the half-famous actors appearing in the movie take you from their clutter? Christian Slater accepts special functions of "making of", without reading the script or signing the details in the film (I'm sure he will never repeat a stupidity). <br /> <br /> I am a fairy. He recognizes this wall that writes, directs, produces, and finances this self-obedient wall that self-esteem itself, a man who does not admit to himself a masterpiece (and if you do not believe me please Google) Hopkins "AND art".
