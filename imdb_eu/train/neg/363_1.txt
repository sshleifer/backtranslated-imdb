The dying of this movie, among other things, is self-consciousness. here's a short list: 1. shameless behavior. When they came to Beatles, when they injected their behavior / humor "strange and unknown" brand, they got fresh. It was over 4 years ago. overcome <br /> <br /> 2. false sophistication. On the basis of the base, almost socio-political-mindedness is a tough basis for comic tasks. ask woody allen. <br /> <br /> 3. post-modernoa "gogorra naiz mundu faltsu honetan eta bai, ni neure burua ezagutzen dut" bera suge jaten dutena - ilustrazioko filmeko beste animalia batzuekin batera erabilitakoa! - It revives it. <br /> <br /> Sweet smell of 4. <br /> <br /> 5. writers, theater, movies student performance amateurs ... they've ever seen? a victim himself, is the only positive thing that can be said, at least, that it makes sense and sheesh, now that they are worth the value of self-reflection, I catch. <br /> But what? ultimately, the call merely another piece of pretentiotsu - hey, never seen in Woody Allen's Bergman, is this: "interiors" ??? Well, that's just more amateurishly.
