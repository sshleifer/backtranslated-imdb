What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking about? Did Hollywood have a great deal of responsibility, or can I get comfort if someone who did not speak English was the first to miss out on the classic Charlotte Bronze point? I do not think I can improve the comments I read below, so I will paraphrase: "Jane Eyre is a wonderful book, the scriptwriter should read sometime." It's true that the two directors of this movie have been frightened. But pity the actors, because scriptwriters tighten the best scenes. The conversation that Jane and Rochester understand is a sense of intelligence and a sense of fun ... deleted from scripts. The marriage proposal, congratulations ... disappeared. Allusion, half-jokingly, half-hungry, came as a lover of England's fairy to Rochester's response to his despair ... eliminated. It's unfortunate that Zeffirelli has felt the need to fully rewrite it. the end of the novel and Jane's interactions with the Rivers family. But it is undeniable that one of the best love stories written love has ever been removed with emotion. <br /> <br /> Please, do yourself a favor and find 1983 (?) with the Mini series Timothy Dalton.
