"The Screaming Skull" opens with a warning and free provision of burial services, if you see him die, now there is a hook! This story is a premise that is quite interesting for a horror movie: the husband throne connects a woman with a history of mental illness, and then tries to attack the buzzing madness, trying to attack skulls that appear in mysterious and at different times. Add the gardener who protects the memory of the first wife who flourished in this formula. Perhaps, in the 1950s, there was no technology to get some of the horror scenes needed to quit this movie, they think of the techniques used here and seem like everyday. Once again, when I first saw "House on Haunted Hill" for the first time, I was given the heebie jeebies, I am sure this film for young audiences of the same era. <br /> </ br> Do not get bad writing, the movie is not horrible, sometimes it seems boring. But there is a certain atmospheric voltage at Whitlock's house, which was generally huge but not so, and the gardens and pools are nice. One of the best scenes for me is that Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) is trying to regain generosity in the pond, heading for clothes right, with a mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol is double). role). Please, ask who was the real dimwit. <br /> <br /> In a good way, perhaps the most moving thing in the film: the first appearance that Whitlocks has made with his first appearance. In 1958! That, at least, jumped from my seat!
