I usually review MTV movie awards to see a fun and fun reward for a fun show (Chewbacca is an example of winning life as an example). So this year it was not different. Although not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has always been a foolish nonsense for me. I laughed at Stiffler in American Pie movies, and even liked Dude Where's My Car? The MTV film award was awful. Nothing was consistent, humorous or entertaining. Justin Timberlake must be singing and dancing; he probably does not play. <br /> <br /> I'm curious about the writers who were for this show. Last night, Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar's performance were a lot of fun (seeing the Lord of the Rings only saw the parody), but this year it was completely different. Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson understand Timberlake's comments ("They're looking at a movie together, but they never met! They're here ...") Where was the joke? Katek and Luke were not interviewed without reference to Timberlake's "joke". And Seann was utterly wasted as a talent, and even more did not cause me a smile, but he only laughed. And what happened to Harrison Ford? Did anyone have any sense? Writers of MTV might have known only that the young audience would have been Ford's former Han Solo, Indiania Jones, or Air Force One. I'm surprised. And would someone agree with Adrian Brody? How old is this guy and how old is he thinking? The guy looks like he's 30, he's trying to do it again ... give up, show a class (the best Academy actor award in your speech) and do it! <br /> <br /> I give this show a star. Outside the 4th, Gollam's lecture on the best visual viewer. This was a very creative, very well made, and created a unique laugh every afternoon.
