Boyle liked me, but I can say that. Everything was a reason for nonsense. As most of the actors were expecting a 9-year-old niece, he pretended to be a rocky policeman or an ultra-evil witch. The sour voice seemed nice to me. I can buy the best music for buying and selling cheap synthesizers. And what is the 1984 police torture? It was totally useless and had nothing to do with story events. Cox added a lot of things, she thought it was really good, but she had nothing to do with the story. This is a very disappointment because Borges' stories are so good that they are minimal. They are very well connected, they have no unnecessary details. This movie is the opposite. I saw the scene that Lonnrot questions Yidische Zaitung's guy. I rented $ 4 on renting, but I can at least get satisfaction writing this review and fortunately mislead others.
