This movie was horrible. It was very difficult to see all this time. I did not get the point of the movie. What was the movie? The soundtrack was bad, the performance was awful and the story was astonished. The two main characters of the film were very boring and their conversation was interesting. There were no chemicals among cast members. I do not know that, indeed, but I suspect that most of the actors are the first time. The movie can be changed for one and a half hours without losing the plot. This indicates how many scenes are not in the movie. I would prefer the root channel in two movies. I want to return these two hours! If you want to see a wonderful and fun movie, you can see Napoleon Dynamite instead of a Mormon series.
