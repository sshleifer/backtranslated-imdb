I saw the first movie I was about 6 years ago and I really liked it. I recently bought the DVD and after the second inspection, I asked why I liked it. The performance was horrible, and as usual, we have typical male clans that fake our outfits. The play was awesome. Tim Rothe did a good job by Liam Neeson, but I do not know what Jessica Lange was thinking about. <br /> <br /> The land line was good, but the execution was bad. I'm tired of seeing the Scottish being portrayed in these films. Braveheart was even worse, this is what saves the film grace. But seriously, people did not talk that way in those days, why should all agents have Glasko accents? Stereotype is just another film to try to get tired of the annoying and annoying essence. The only people who say that this movie is good are Americans, and I would like to tell you the truth, why do they know that they have men at Kilts? Anyway, if you plan to buy the DVD, I spend something else like a movie.
