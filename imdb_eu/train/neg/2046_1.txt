I can not believe that this movie has also come to videos and the video rental shops are ready to put on their shelves. Literature asked for a refund. Take it that the movie has no historical truth, and the movie found in a video store is still worse. It's not good enough when it's called B movie. Do not waste your money or your time in this movie. I listened to the voice list and the great music. Anyone who takes part in this movie should be thrown out of the game, it will give the industry a black mark, but after seeing the bigger part of this movie, I do not think it's a union member involved.
