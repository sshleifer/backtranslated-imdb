In the first case, they were mostly giant rat, but some wasps and a huge chicken. This, however, is a giant rat, a giant rat and a really tall little boy. This is what this growing boy and scientist want to help him, so he unexpectedly creates gigantic rat kings ... you know how. This movie kills and its moments, but it seems to be similar to the original, I prefer some varieties in my huge creatures. Well, that's not true ... I like the empire of the empires, maybe I do not care about rodents. However, it is a curious film, although it is a curious fact that has different events in this dreamscape. I can not recommend this.
