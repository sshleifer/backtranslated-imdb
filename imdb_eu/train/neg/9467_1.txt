If you liked the movie Grinch ... see again, that was not the translation of the movie Six. Mike Myers's Cat is probably a nuisance character that has lately been "gracefully" on the screen. His voice / accent is horrible and he laughs at his jokes, with a noisy sound, in the theater I heard the only laugh. Children did not like people too, and children do not laugh now. Save your money and go to see Looney Tunes: Back in action if you are looking for a fun family holiday movie.
