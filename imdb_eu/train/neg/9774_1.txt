Hubert Selby Jr. gave us a book called "Requiem for A Dream" and wrote the script for Aronofsky's movie. That film was achieved at all levels by giving an intimate and impartial portrayal of the life of the characters and the horrible plague. "Last Exit To Brooklyn" still has many characters who live still sad, but hardly does the same justice as Aronofsky. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the movie is anti-gay. In the film above all homosexuality is the same as death. A gay character has been shocked by a high-speed car, and dies on the pavement on earth. Another has been crucified and even more simply beat. A great deal of great value for the disturbance that may have been done is the scene of union workers that are breaking down. Who would think Brooklyners' drama action sequences and truck explosions would appear? <br /> <br /> Director Uli Edel has a training level as a television director, but the actual cut is below. movies The film does not seem to fit into a genre. Lake was given an unnecessary role to any manikin, and Baldwin knew he was only stupid in his equally empty party. And then Jennifer Jason Leigh is our director, the evil Tralala (believe me or not, I'm not playing). His performance was not very good and the fate of his character is the dirty. The bad use of color and composition seems cheaper and one of the strangest provocative edges of the "real" edge. Crash
