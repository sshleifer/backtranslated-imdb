A series of children created a theater for the night-time horror movie marathon. As night goes by, someone kills them one by one. Who is ... and why? I saw this way in theater in 1991 I was looking forward, but boy! He did not work in any way. It's a good premise, it's very attractive for young people and some professionals like Dee Wallace Stone ... but it does not work. The story is in the middle of the sense (the movie might have been editable before releasing it), the killings are quite bloody (how did I get the R score beyond me?) And eventually it was boring the killer was boring. and stupid <br /> <br /> It is really bad that this film was a potential. The best script could become a horror movie. As it is acknowledged, it is mostly forgotten and the cast itself seems ashamed (Stone did not listen to me). I give it to 3 and this is only castar.
