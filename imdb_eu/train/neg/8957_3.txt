Incredible Do you have more than this? It is not an option. He would be ashamed of the stupidity of this movie, even Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo. The first part of the series had a middle interview and the latter had a bad conversation, which has a chronic conversation. Amazing. But this time the story has dropped to the level of conversation. Despite the show and the interview, I like the first two movies, but "Cube Zero" will probably kill the franchise. A completely Moronian territory, therefore, starts from a feathered left wing. <br /> <br /> I sometimes ask the left-wingers to own the anti-democratic dictatorship. Are they directed in this movie in the US? democracy Why not target anti-military films for Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe? Surely, most of these places are not as soon as a cube is produced, but that's not it. Evidently, such garbage writers admire these types of regimes, whether they know it or not. In my opinion, I would say that anyone who is constantly attacking US foreign policy would think they are very anti-democratic. <br /> <br /> Return to the film: it's not fun anymore, the movies seem to have a lot of abilities. For example, for some reason, the two men who oversee the cube have done some time and forget about the pain and sadism of the project, but the first one turned against the system over the other! Anyone with an idea of ​​human nature will see this idiocy. Or a wicked character that speaks of a malicious character in a bad comedy Mel Brooks. In fact, as soon as this creature appears, the movie loses all seriousness and, therefore, it is exciting to make it a comedy.
