This film does not recommend, but despite the unique landscape, cinematography and wildlife direction, it is difficult to show its weak points among the most beautiful opinions. In fact, these things are missing the right plot and its execution. <br /> <br /> I saw this with my children and nobody was too impressed. Yes, the images were excellent, the vast landscape of the forests and mountains, but what happened in the foreground? The story of the stupidity of the stupidity of the stupidity of the girl who is studying the basic subject of the savage girl, which makes it quite easy for the course of such things. It is certainly a new story, as there is nothing remotely telling the novel, and we have seen all that before and, indeed, much elder Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. <br /> <br /> The only thing to get out of this movie is to make it look like wonderful lenses and forest lighting. rest is a waste of time.
