Since I was eight years old I have been a fighter. It did not matter what federation I saw. WWE, WCW, USWA. It's all for me to see the action. <br /> <br /> May 23, 1999 That was my 19th birthday. I ordered Over the Edge and I just hoped to pay for each other. But this time. I was wrong. Instead, one of the best fighters left in Canada, when a real man died, was killed as a mistake. You do not have much to change the situation. But what happened to the condemnation of Owens died completely. <br /> <br /> Then, he decided to end the payment for each view and make the right people to protect the WWE first and that was the money paid while keeping Owens dead. <br /> <br /> I will tell you. Vince Mchmaon made some foolish decisions in his life, but he has been the most stupid decision to date. Give me a break. When someone kills a paid wage, he sees the sense of his conviction to stop him. This is a policeman who shoots a robbery or robbery, and then dies as if he were not going to go home and could call him a day as if he never knew life. <br /> <br /> But not what happens. Owen is missing you and we thank you for all the moments you gave her.
