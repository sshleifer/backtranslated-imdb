It really is really. I have seen movies that I liked most for any reason, but I have never seen a movie that fails to make movies at all. However, it fails to make movies as it could be in New York's Hercules. At least I do not like the movie, but I'm the worst movie ever I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> You like to act. I never saw a worse pornographic film. In fact, I have a lot of pornographic films, but they work better than that. It's horrible <br /> <br /> Technically it's horrible. Camera work is a amateur. Editing is nonsense. I think they do not pay the right sound equipment, which means that each car scene (and many of them there) runs around three kilometers per hour and each scene is taken from the same forest (and it is dubbed from these studies again giving more bad pornography The plots are absurd, as they have often said. I will defend vampires separated from the days of days, despite the fact that Nosferatu has spread, this was never the case with the vampire myth. <br /> <br /> Vampire mythos When he talked about it, the writer read Carmilla, or at least see Vampire Lovers. I do not know how I feel about it, surprisingly, that this movie has recently taken on some of the most beautiful Gothic novels, or the annoying sledgehammer references and the worst material sources desecration. At least, 'General' is Peter Cushing's insult. However, he has two stars, but I can not because it casts a single star, or at least a star with a movie. Think both vampires and zombies. Incidentally, I saw Lifeforce (another one and another zombie movie) on the same day that day, and despite the fact that it is a flawed movie, there is a masterpiece in front of it. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, this is not a movie that is so good, or it's so bad for anyone to drink. It's just a mess, and nobody is worth seeing.
