I bought the DVD version of this movie to recommend to a woman who loved the version of the TV. The version of the DVD was a disaster. The lighting did not exist inadequate, and the entire scenes were discarded. In one example, Adele is putting her bedside and immediately cut another scene - entering the middle phrase - next night. The characters like Grace Poole and Mason are never presented, asking them to stay in the movie for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The DVD we've seen has been produced by Platinum Disc Corp and even more. It was a gyps in $ 6.32. <br /> <br /> Be careful what you bought this movie! We'll send it back.
