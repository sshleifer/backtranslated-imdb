"The Brain Machine" at least will put your brain overdrive to know what it is. Different origins and intelligence level have been selected for four experiments described by a researcher as a scientific study on man and the environment. Only the usual nominee named among them should be one of those who do not know family - none of them will be lost. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is not controlled by a mysterious acquaintance. As a general, but it seems to be that a senator wishes to remain anonymous. A good call from the Senator. In addition, there is a shadow guard that constantly increases the camera, and later says that he is not the general or "project". It was very badly effective, it made it very easy to beat all the Kablooans before doing so. <br /> <br /> If it's not anywhere else, the film is a real-world treasure in the 1970s. We will not leave room-sized computers and teletypes. Perhaps the basis of the alternative title of the film was "Time Warp"; nothing else would make sense. As for myself, I would like to take the title of Krisner's test on the "Group Stress Project" title. It also applies to film actors and viewers. <br /> <br /> Look at the head of the General over the pool when he asks for an agent when he puts the weapon, the front microphone can be seen on his head for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Could you get this movie when you're a fan of Gerald McRaney, have you ever had that youngster? James Best also considered a strange feature of theatrical critique, but did not call it Father. You need to get more on the aisle, by the hand of "The Killer Shrews" of 1959. At least that was not so serious.
