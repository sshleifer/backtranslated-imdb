Sorry, it's not good. <br /> <br /> It starts to interest, but in some minutes it loses the video. <br /> <br /> It does not help many who are usually not the greatest actors. (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto, etc.) Provides a good performance. <br /> <br /> Maybe I saw a double version (German), but Dennis Quaid's character was particularly bare and annoying, and Danny Glover does not really make an unbelievable evil. Additionally, character Jared Leto is not helping the story properly (save the main character's life at a point, but first of all, this scene requires an underwater windshield wiper ;-) <br /> <br /> Unnecessary In scene, the main complaint is a story that is really confused and topical: the police (of course!) must set a personal problem with the wicked one and have to keep their official functions (of course!). his personal identity. The killer (of course!) * Wants to track * and for several years he catches his opponent with the mouse ... I do not know how many films are built on the plot - most of them better anyway. <br /> <br /> The plot has a lot of holes and has many incredible and unnecessary scenes that are totally or not working properly (for example, the truck stop scene or the edge of the cliff ...) <br /> < br /> To conclude, the end is trying to be an original and exciting one, but it fails in these failures completely. We saw the results that are much better *, with the latest battle-setting in the winter-landscape set ... Finally, the supposed movement of parents and children is gathered. ... at least hokey.
