Wow, this movie is not just a "real lesson-lesson" lesson, but rather a "real short film" lesson. Do not be misled, 'Zombie '90: I considered the concept of Extreme Pestilence, but at the same time it should be realized when the movie is horrible. If you did not lose sight of the historical event, in the 'Zombie' 90 plot, it is a government aircraft, airborne toxic chemicals that enter into the desert, which spills chemicals, making the locals a huge zombie. Next time you know, while zombies are alive in the city while people are alive, a look-alike and a government agent are trying to crawl the people they eat each other. Hence, it is called "Puzzling Pestilence". Since then, we will see everything that could be visible every day. They are just debates and dismembrations and dismemberments, but buckets of endless peace and gore. As a German film, the film has had to double in English, and when you do not laugh at the tremendous food of these zombies, the voices are quite fun and entertaining. As mentioned by UnratedX * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, there is a scene that crosses the line between a movie scene that is acceptable and acceptable; That's where the scene of a woman carrying a baby's baby is coming. On the nearby wheelchair, some types and a bunch of zombies come out of nowhere and attack them. A zombie captures and divides the baby, while the body eats the baby while crying. Wow, that's a bad lesson REALLLLLLLLLY a new lesson. I tell you the anguish, the anguish.
