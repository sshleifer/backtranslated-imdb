Well, AWFUL is just the first name. This movie is a topical piece of people. High school comedy in a military training camp. I'm sorry I did not need to give this star. <br /> <br /> THEY HAVE RECEIVED: <br /> <br /> Everything is almost absolutely mandatory, convincing and realistic. HEPO (military police) will not come if you do not look your own, especially on the day of the wedding. The actors were quite embarrassed in that scene, because the scene did not work, it was very difficult. You can hear them in their voices. Although they were not bad actors, they did not save the scene. <br /> <br /> The next must be a wedding dress. No, there was not an even time to get it. Man, excellent cinematography! I will remember this scene for life. <br /> <br /> There are also GIRLS in the camp - exciting - as well as a model, but not so great and bad. The actress I have ever seen. I'd like to say just one line to question Hollywood's B. <br /> <br /> Welcome to the military girls! Now this is fun. The girls are also on the same floor, when they enter the room at night! In fact, they would be located in a building of one more mile, divided into two sections, separated by a wire mesh. <br /> <br /> In our spare time there are tanks that can be used for fun walks, many of which we have. No, the tanks are not locked and the ignition keys are inserted. Nobody understands the sounds of the engines, especially at night. <br /> <br /> There are a series of sex scenes and references, all of which are under the waste line. In addition, sexually obsessed Germans like the movie. Switzerland is too small for any film market. Welcome! <br /> <br /> A culinary sex scene takes place. Surely, none of these installations has ever been blocked. They are like military routines. <br /> <br /> In a colorless mind, the anti-hostile men revenge the bad guy trying to shoot him! Because he has left his case! I'm sure they bought it, the Italians are in this way - jealous range (no). <br /> <br /> They try to avoid bad guys two dozen open days in the day. At night, in a dark dark. Once again, military training (if people are shooting live) is open to people, freely driving or walking. There is no guard or fence. <br /> <br /> However, the good captain can join a rocket in the Italian car. Explosion exploded on injured feet and fianc√©e worsened. There is no distance of 40 meters when the car is damaged. It's COMEDIA, remember. <br /> <br /> Okay. It's a comedy, I got this and I live with it. No realism is needed. Filmmakers can easily get rid of that if they're ridiculous, split and entertaining, interesting and challenging. Unfortunately it is not one of them. It's just shame. Based on American comedic feats. The latter are, at least, professional, without amateur actors. <br /> <br /> It's pretty boring and predictable, it's time and energy to lose, especially if you're sitting across the whole movie, unfortunately.
