Television productions started in 2000 were bad and bad. Before similar brands (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives or Monk), television still did not succeed, to show the attention and interest of the audience in the 2000s. Titles (Relic Hunter), (Mutant X), (Lost Worlds), (Sheena) or even (Baywatch Hawaii) titles were not encouraged to watch and continue, or at least not all that was attractive and interesting. What was the time before. (2nd special unit) is no exception. In fact, the X Files' Spoof of the Men in Black Collection! (If it was a special unit 1). But in accordance with this excellent formula; it did not work well. He was hopeful; At that time "supernatural" saturation in some cases was still a long time after some X files, so that natural spirits can be misleading (imagine that Mulder was a woman!). However (the 2nd special unit) was not the strongest one, or the most powerful part of a comic Sci-Fi show. It was very ridiculous, for instance, in sexy situations, it was all a great pleasure to become. A bad taste was ill. (Michael Landes) was not charismatic, and especially disturbing as a comedian. His chemistry (Alexondra Lee), as well as alleged sexual attention, was a language. Surely the show got a funny look but, in general, it was inadequate. It is clear that there is no more interesting thing than the main idea. (Evan Katz) as a writer and co-producer (Seven Days), or (24) later, this should be a low point! Despite being a distinctive personality, all the time he was jokingly chorizo. That's why, if that's the case, so stupid they joined! And really, it would be very grateful for 19 days before leaving a show!
