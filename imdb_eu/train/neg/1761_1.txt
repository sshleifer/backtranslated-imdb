First of all, I realize that the "1" rating has been booked for the worst. I get this film for myself, as one reviewer stressed, it is not bad for one's own conscience, it may have a high level of comics or worship. Mark on all accounts fails. ** There are disasters ** The conversation is completely false. Continuity is so essential. Daniel just finished talking about his lost love and the flamenco dancers start their final word. His name is a mock-shock (see? I do not remember the name of his character, much less an unforgettable actor), his husband (Baldwin) first told his friend that it's a bad guy. Cars and motorcycle accessions made good things. Vegetable carts fly. Cars falling apart. Skid steer with motorcycles. Although people are almost knocked out, no one is noticeable. Oh, that's ... except for a guy who has knocked him several times, of course he's hanging on his knife, and a car that comes close has not seen it there. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> More and more, I'm reminded that such films can be done. In the film industry there is so much pressure to make money, you would think of good Hollywood films worth watching. Now there's a new idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: do not see this movie. Do not rent a DVD Do not see the cable. There are many other things that will make you feel more enjoyable.
