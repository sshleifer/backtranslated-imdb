I have to be absolutely honest I said first to sleep somewhere in the middle, so I can not give a full opinion about the movie, until I have not seen it. In essence, a thief, Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), end up with the Finisham maternity hospital pills to steal a delivery of contraception. Here are headmaster Matron (Hattie Jacques), Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Prodd (Terry Scott) and Susan Ball (Nurse Susan Ball). Patients and visitors are also included, including pregnant women, Tidey (Joan Sims), and her anxious father-to-be husband, Tidey (Kenneth Connor). Also featured with Bill Maynard was Freddy and EastEnders's Wendy Richard Miss Wing. Incidentally, this plan does not work well, since all employees are entering the road. This is almost everything I can say about movies until I see it again. Okay
