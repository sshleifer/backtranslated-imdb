God, is this "Run, Lola, Run" to adapt Persuasion? It was horrible. Poorly written "scriptwriter" (and I'm using the term very bitter) I cut and paste the conversation from one character to another, often outside the context and foster the story: but Anne Elliott is looking for Wentworth from the location. At the end of the piece it was hateful! He must go to Austen's tomb. No respectable young woman would have done any way. And Mary acted as actress? Horrors Needless to say, if the rest of the Austen remakes are bad, they will turn off a new audience generation. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a terrific version of this wonderful novel, Get It Versioned by Roger Michell in 1995 with Amanda Root (whose only statement is the books) and Ciaran Hinds. It's great.
