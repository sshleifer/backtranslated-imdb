Like most people, I'd like to buy this movie over the Bolo Yeung adventurer's box and I find that the images (the aforementioned images and the title of the movie) are about Beast. He plays a donkey about 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, because of my despair, Hercules goes to Chinese Bolo Yeung, but there has been no withdrawal, Jean Claude Van Damme and Tearless Tiger ... Bolo Yeung - maximum exposure time box for maximum time. Okay <br /> <br /> The story is pretty basic, but it's been done - the peaceful kung fu fighter (played by Chen Hui Min) accidentally kills a man and will not fight again. Then he fled to work as a worker in a dock, raising his heavy sack with his colleagues, and suspects that he is a great fighter (I do not know how it works but he does not care). In the meantime, the decommissioning of the dock makes an agreement with the gangsters, with the exclusive use of the dock. As a result, workers are forced to throw in their ear and live on the beach. There, they meet with their leader, gangster boss and Bolo Yeung's squire. <br /> <br /> While it was quite a while in the movie (especially waiting for the next Bolo's audition), I've had some problems with it - first of all, bad dubbing, but of course, old kung fu movies . But, moreover, the film was dragged into battle scenes. And like the fight scenes themselves, I found it longer, poorly choreographed (apparently Jackie Chan!), Badly filmed and sometimes people who did not have theater skills. Indeed, most of the fights in this film were not "fights", just for people with no resistance! <br /> <br /> In the end, a hero played by Chen Hui Min. I have never seen any other movie with this guy, but I did not even get up with it. He was not only stunned and tearful, but he did not find me bet on fighting violence! I understood his reasoning, but many people could save a lot of pain as long as he was confident and if they could fight! There was a bigger mystery why he hoped for a man who never fought for the whole community expecting them! <br /> <br /> In fact, the great savings of this film was the presence of Bolo Yeung. He is as huge and horrible as ever, he has wonderful and entertaining lines and he gives the rest a classic film about the director. The guy places the screen on the screen and you can easily see how it became a star. The senseless thing strikes my life for me, but I am sure I did not see this movie being animated by Bolo for the last Bolo movie! <br /> <br /> With all of this, the average kung-fu movie was lifted up by some great personalities, why did you know? I met a person who thought he was not a Bolo Yeung. The legend of man!
