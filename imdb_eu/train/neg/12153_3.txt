Food The Masses is just a movie, it's just about trying to make money from zombie craze money, especially for movies such as Land Of The Dead and the Resident Evil series. <br /> <br /> It starts in a television caring for the military, and Lazarus Virus (zombies) is approaching, and it will soon be the city to do business again. The problem is that this is totally false. Zombies are rampantly running, and few people will know it. Among them are Torch (William Garberina), a male camera, Sherry (Rachael Morris), an anchor woman (who plays for some reason on the Shelly website) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), his military escort. Torch and Sherry are the ones who lie to the people, but the station is run by secret services (or other government agencies) and very censored. <br /> <br /> This movie puts the pot in the back. box-cover "According to forecasts, more than three dead movies by George A. Rombero". The source of that budget has lost all credibility with me. <br /> <br /> Let me say this movie is BAD. I do not like it more than I expected (though, of course, I was), but I mean, I do not find any changes in the movie. It is made in all pieces or made of wood. Does anyone remember the lines or are they reading? I can not think of the best part of the movie or the best actor. There was really no one. If someone wanted to shake my head, Roger would probably say that the military escort was the most interesting character, but that's not really saying much. <br /> <br /> I would recommend sending this movie. Although the cover of the Kutxa is pretty good (it originally took me the movie). 3/10
