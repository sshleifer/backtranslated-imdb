I watched this movie in my film class. I'm glad to pay no to see. I got into an open mind and was a little excited. I really enjoyed Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest was interesting. I have never linked to this movie. The play was excellent, cinema was interesting, but the story, or, in other words, it was not a problem. There was no main theme for the movie. Was love between Norton and Wood? Well, no, really. Was it in the West? Type, but not. I am in the movies. I recently saw "Brick" and I loved it, but this movie also went where it was. It was so strange, and I did not have to sit down all over the movie, I would walk. The writing was not horrible, but it was only a place. When I finished this movie, I was very confused and I wanted to finish it earlier. There was nothing more than a film about non-resonant, I understand different films like "Fight Club", but I do not like the characters.
