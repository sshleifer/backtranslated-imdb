Director David Mamet is very interesting and very different. His first film was the one of the "Games of the House", and he set a series of films with characters that are changing their life perspectives, as well as complicated situations, and the viewer's perspective. <br /> So, under the title 'Homicide', the mind of the audience tries to become a traditional drama. The main figures are two policemen, one Jew and one Irish, who are related to the race-field. The Jewish assassination of an ancient Jewish shop that demonstrates the existence of an ancient War of Independence in War is the beginning of the mind and heart of the detective of the Jews. <br /> <br /> This was the mistake of the movie. more stand out. The process of awakening is a theater and it is hard to believe, the militant Jewish team is operated, and in the end, the way the detective goes to the final violent fight is pathetic. The end of the film is as intelligent as Mamet, but it is misleading from the human point of view. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Joe Mantegna and William Macy have solid performances, but the story's mistakes are clear, easy to compensate. .
