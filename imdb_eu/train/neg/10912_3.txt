I really liked the movie. It was not very funny and in some cases it was completely stupid. Rob Schneider is definitely a great talented person, and while his performance was fine, it seemed to me that he was really out of the way. Some of the parts I wanted to say were well and in a fun way in a nice way, but that's it. about it. The only thing that really caught my attention to these issues was that I saw women look good and I did not see a movie because of this alone, but in this case the only one was. The smallest case of salvation was also found. In short, an average movie was heard underneath a couple! <br /> <br /> Last query: <br /> <br /> Theaters: I'm glad I did not lose too much money. <br>> <br /> DVD purchase: Ummm, let me think ... no! <br /> <br /> Rental: If you have a prehistoric humor, why not.
