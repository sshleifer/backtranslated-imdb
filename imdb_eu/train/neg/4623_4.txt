If you have not seen the Gong show series, you will not like the movie because it's not a series to know that the movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I give them from 5 to 10, because a few things are fun to help solve their obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) It's fun to take a picture. It was made at the time, at the end of the 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You get a lot of fun cameo people on the show. 3) It is interesting to see Chuck (host) if he does not make his own aerial television. 4) We see a lot of weird people doing the curious things you see on the television show. <br /> <br /> I do not say bad things, many of them are bad, but here are some of the highlights. 1) The Gong Show has a lot of real-time TV clips, which is tired of the feature film. 2) The story line of the film clip segment is very weak and basically consists of a single plot of land. 3) Chuck is a good acting actress, but most of the actors are performing in the top ten-seventies in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie if you do not see everything you want to see an hour and a half. Check for 20 minutes at the same time and it is not so bad. But even then it's not so good. ;)
