Using videos from the Dinosaur Planet (except stolen footage), he talks about an intervention that does not fit people involved in a dinosaur planet. His five-minute draft lasted 90 minutes. It is somewhat better than Chickboxer (one of the Bad Movie Police series) that has a nostalgic home movie that feels stuck with good effects, this movie is still impossible. I am still asking, when we are so creative, when we are stealing old movies now, not only in the plot, there is nothing in it? It is clear that low-budget producers are so desperately getting the money they want
