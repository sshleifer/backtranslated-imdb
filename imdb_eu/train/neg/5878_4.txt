As the skin says, "the village of our time, our time." <br /> <br /> I had to watch this Hamlet version of the filmed directly after watching Kenneth Branagh version and I was really disappointed with the experience. <br /> <br /> This version brings sexuality closer to various aspects of the theater; Osric is a very homosexual and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think this time (60s) this is a very good version of Hamlet, but it can not compare the entire version of Branagh. Just a note ... I found a video in my local video store (in Australia) and I'm really looking for a Keneth Branagh DVD to buy such things. Someone knows, please.
