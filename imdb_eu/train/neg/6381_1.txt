This movie is about some of the gay black gay men on earth to eliminate the Earth's wives, in order to create a gay universe. <br /> <br /> I saw how bad it was to see it. However, I was shocked at what was bad. It was a movie that was 50 years ago. Playing, if any, is very bad. Sets and props are so hilarious as fake, any college movie makes great budgets. And special effects are laughably simple, in fact, dropping jaws from others, but jaw droppingly shame. <br /> <br /> It should be sharp to be intoxicated, or in a changed state of consciousness, to assess this movie. Since I was from Denmark, I would be very embarrassed and humiliated by my countrymen to produce such a terrible film.
