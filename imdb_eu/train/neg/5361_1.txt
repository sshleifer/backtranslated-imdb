When the film appeared for the first time in the 1970s, he hated, hated and hated it! I've had the most emotion I've ever seen. I do not know where Leigh has had his inspiration, but this is one of those films that you want to shake up and make your oral communication. The title says, because there is no time to save on this movie, with people who are not able to feel (probably) with no silence. If you want to see something to drink, that's it for you. If you need to do something better for two hours, you will enter a tray in a toaster: this experience will be much more enjoyable than you can! Yes, Leigh created many things that he deserved in his career, but he lost it.
