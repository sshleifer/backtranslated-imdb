I really did not expect much to see this. After Jason Mst3king with friends, I expect a similar experience here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie took a serious way. About Jason's Problems? Sorry, no. However, there are Legion Ft13th movies. At the end of the day, he is a killer of the series of the dead, but I will not be sympathetic. but, sadly, there were few and when the movie was over, the celebrity became a bad episode of death ... it's just not fun.
