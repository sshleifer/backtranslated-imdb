This is the most beautiful movie that I've ever seen, but it's fairly straightforward and it's quite fun. I do not think filmmakers thought Hollywood was the best of its kind. It is a series killer about a series that releases toxic waste, which reacts with it and the snow (in the middle of winter). Then it's enough to laugh at making your donkey a snowman. This movie is stupid but it's fun. The killings are hilarious. I would not recommend buying it to buy it (as I did, the cover was fine!), But if you want to laugh at it if it's a night on TV.
