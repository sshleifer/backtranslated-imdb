I read Bachman in the royal books and I felt the protagonist of John and his family. This movie can be much more. Problems? The action movie was set during craze. I saw the movie and I had the pain all the time. He felt nothing for my character and less for his cause. Yes, it had fun (or horny) scenes, although I think the movie did not keep me in my eyes. If you read the book, in John's heart you will feel a heart threat and fire as it gets the last revenge. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a low number. Maybe I did not read the book a bit.
