It is evident that the good reviews published for this film have been seen so far by someone who is collaborating with the film or knows someone who has seen cuts so far. Well, I do not know how to get involved, and I've seen the latest cuts, and it's just garbage. The ambition of the horrors is an ambition and a multi-camera (the only one is not on the screen). Filmmakers made a film at a weekend deal and Tony Todd, actors such as Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman will shoot scenes on coffee breaks. XXI. It's an awesome performance cast of cast actors that is not acceptable in the century. There is little or no action; It is an unexplained conversation that tries to explain the plot. Computer FX is a joke, but there are not many of them and there is not enough action to make this movie MST3K a pleasant way. Without speaking, after completing the scene of 8, you will get an exit button ... and do not leave it. It does not matter.
