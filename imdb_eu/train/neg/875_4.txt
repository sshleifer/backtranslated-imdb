When I sat to watch this movie, I expected quite a bit because the plot was quite complex. The use of football as a starting point was interesting. Unfortunately, despite the fear that discussions about Muslim culture and Western culture are intimidating, generations and prejudices affecting the generation of gay / lesbian are being added, it eliminates the solution so that the rigidity generated throughout the construction is quite simplistic. film This suggests that those in charge of the lawsuit took on a rigorous guarantor, after trying to deal with them deeper. <br /> <br /> However, this does not mean that this is a bad film, because the performance of the conflict is very credible and fun. The movie has been fun and fun in these issues, but as we have already mentioned, the writers have deepened. As a result, they have been realistic in nature to face recent conflicts. When the ball was falling, the authors really showed the brightness that at that time could take the movie to other estimates. <br /> <br /> If the movie does not try, in any way, a deep dramatic drama. The environment has so much potential on the plot as the "descending ball" is disassociated. In this way, the movie moves from a well-liked comedy, moving to a standard of clich√©s that will make you happy, ridiculous. In Hollywoode there is nothing left. So, even if the story is wonderful, it may be a bit bigger, it can not be fixed. I was personally close to shouting "It's over!" on screen <br /> <br /> In a short film, there was a slight performance, and two young female actors had good moments. So, parents and other two characters too. However, the beautiful Irish coach was a shameful performance in order to minimize film realism. Although not very pleasing to him, but despite his good deeds, he is involved in the car, that is to say, that the appearance of the conflict between girls is slightly tense. <br /> <br /> I give a film 4, from which I was looking for a funny story and a nice theme to look for. The script and the bass had great characters, and the viewers chanced to go to them, both to discover themselves and others. If it had not been a debate, I would like to give a 7 or 8 film for this film. I would recommend the movie "East of East". I think that's good, but not a better performance of cultural conflicts, as well as fun and passionate.
