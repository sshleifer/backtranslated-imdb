I watched the movie over the weekend, but I was not really surprised. <br /> <br /> Except for 'Combo', I thought it was a poor performance and the narration was limited. It's been like a TV drama. <br /> <br /> I felt the film was very invented. At first, seventeen groups in the context (Britain has been in the 80s - now you can stop) was hard on it and was given a vision similar to what happened in Great Britain in the 80s - that poverty, war, royalty, Margaret Thatcher, is still nothing between? There were half classes that were already there: ordinary workers, decent wages and mortgages. The fact that the Falkland clips were randomly added at the end is a "dramatic effect". I think. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events was felt null and void, without moving the next action by the characters. That our mindset could change so quickly, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Shaun' and 'Smell The relationship between 'was curling on the toe. I can not see the apparent scene. It was very difficult for me to believe that he was very younger to believe that he was going to attract a boy, but he seemed so younger. I know they were just four years old, but it's been four years when it's been thirty, but it's a big difference in your teens! According to my experience, teenage age differences occur only when younger girls, as girls get older and older for a few years older than boys. Sorry, I did not buy - an unknown plot of land to create a shock value. <br /> <br /> The end were inadequate and they invented again. If the incident that was being thrown into the flag was considered an icon, the eyes were shortened for me. <br /> <br /> They swore to me that British films did not play high school or poverty. Do not go wrong, I love Trainspotting and Four Weddings has its charms, but can not the British get anything different? Why are our movies hanging on the class system? I was born in 1973, so it was not similar to that of Shaun in 1983. I grew up in a single parent family in a city council in a city in England. However, my childhood experiences were very different with the portraits of the film: I do not remember that racism is a problem (although I do not say that). Is it "England"? It's not my experience. <br /> <br /> In that sense, I felt that the film had no substance, and I was completely bored and impressed.
