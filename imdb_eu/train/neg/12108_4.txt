This line was required to be written, but it really is. I love Gangster's genre and it's the smallest entry I've seen in recent years. I have a reflection on most of the most important aspects of everyone, the script. A story about a small criminal is weak. There is no lack of substance in the film, or in the black and white style. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear that they will make another movie in general. My advice is not to waste time.
