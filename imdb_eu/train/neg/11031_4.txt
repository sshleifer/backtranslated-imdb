It is interesting to see what the director wants to do. But the problem is not very good. There was nothing original in the film and while the plot was well presented, the main characters passed a bit and you did not have any problems. <br /> <br /> Fuzzy (and sometimes bad) is a little bit of a picture, but I think you can not expect much for people who make a low-budget movie. It's not right to review the movie and compare it to other high-budget films. But, this is what needs to be done. It's not very good at all. And compared to others, it's still not very good. But it's not good points! I liked it on the floor. It was well arranged and well connected to the end. Sometimes in the dark scenes a great feeling was erected. <br /> <br /> But, in the end, the movie fails. Characters are hardly ever existing and we can not care. It could kill any of them, but it is possible to determine from the beginning the "living" initial.
