This is the worst movie I've ever seen in film! Failed to close. To make matters worse, a 12A certificate is given, you can not watch anyone shoot, so if your bodies fall to the ground, even if Babban dies, cut! They cut too many scenes to bring young audiences, supposedly, the makers are aware that the cart would be sharp! Amitabhs has been a great performance, but they can not act like a 'stupid Basanti' wannabe and devgans mate. He was desperately wasting her! <br /> <br /> I would not look at it again for free and I would advise all those who read it so that YOU SAVE!
