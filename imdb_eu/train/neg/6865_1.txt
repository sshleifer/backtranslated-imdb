This movie was very bad and it was not suffocating. I can not see it at all. The plot is standard, the play is pretty dreadful (a regular friend like the cast and the lawyer friend were better actors). If you miss a fun kind and you like to see the result of a dramatic plot. <br /> <br /> The main head that looks like "Kathy" was wonderful, I could not decide that its effect was flat and flat. It was just a bad surgery or bad action (I decided it was both). This leaves the script to comment, it was pretty bad. Pat-comments, stupid decisions, and blame for the nonsense of each character. Perhaps this is so wonderful; I do not know. I just looked at what could be bad. (Actually, the dialog box is not called a "trace", but it's almost completely annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, it's very bad, inexpensive. the same (a house, a building) were repeatedly exhibited without any specific connection to art or action, more randomly falling into action in the bad theater, a scene of harassment that could be filmed by young people from an early school scene: bad filming, cheap props, minimal action ... and I still wanted to see the end. Go to the image.
