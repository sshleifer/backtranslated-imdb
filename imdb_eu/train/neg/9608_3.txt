Men, what happened to this movie? And more importantly where can I get it? The opening scene sets the tone of the movie: it is a naked woman in a fire circle, becoming the rude man. And this is not Rick Baker's 'American werewolf' transformation, people. Here are some of the worst make-up made in the movie. I can not imagine what some glue that spreads the Italian tale Annik Borel (who plays Daniel, the protagonist of the film (that is, the word)), and asking to kick the skin. That's a bad thing. <br /> <br /> From here it's not much better. In a minute they lose Daniel and their status or something (I do not remember them but you often laugh when you cry when you cry). /> Funny thing Daniel is not a man, he is a psyche, a man who is in the head (intelligible, as a child), so he transforms him into a feeder like his ancestors. opening scene). He can not help the throat of all the men he knows, and he wants to love him! Things are looking for Daniel when he's in love and in love, the actress that does not "pass" her. Check here the assembly, one of the hanging ones that you will ever see (laughing and embracing by means of a window). A group that kills the killer tricks unexpectedly misses. "I am silent above your grave", Daniel raises his revenge with bloody rage. <br /> <br /> I will never return 100 minutes of my life. But, yes, that's what you're playing with the movie geek.
