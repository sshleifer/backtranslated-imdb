I usually do not take a few people to read comments, a few who watch movies. However, in this case, I have to warn you to warn everyone who is losing time. I only see them for five minutes. This is simply the worst film I've ever seen in my life. The play is enormous, as an argument does not exist, and the production values ​​are at least a degree of poverty. I know, even the small budget movie may be great, but not this. The only thing that could be saved on this movie is for fans of horror fans: gore and crush on the screen! This is a three times completely outright screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing - especially the last scene - it's not enough. The movie is too long to contain a minimal content, a heavy interview, so it's almost impossible to see. What's happening? When sitting in a nutshell, three girls are carelessly and unwillingly driven away by an isolated area, more than 20 girls are kidnapped and killed. Their cars, of course, breaks them and bring them to the dreaded old man who is madly crazy; One of them is a psychotic killer. In the end, all three have died, one after another, outside the screen, after a boring and slow absurdity. As I said, once the only thing worth watching is murder. Please do not buy or rent it, and do not be fooled by the deception of kutxa art and the description of the movies. Save your money and your time.
