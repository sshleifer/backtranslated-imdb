A star All this is worth the documentary. I did not feel disappointed watching a movie, a short time after watching a documentary. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of the "Walking With ..." series, including Nigel. Marvin spin-off to get information about all their fun and entertaining information. Although the subject of prehistoric man is interested in other prehistoric beings than ever, the subject is still interesting and unique to investigate. Having seen all the other serial documents, I thought I should see this, especially after seeing good reviews in other places. <br /> <br /> Good review for those who like this document ... what did you think ?! lol. <br /> <br /> Although my opinion was interesting, the presentation failed in all other ways. He was terribly embarrassed to say something heavily destroyed (information confused and sometimes out of place), shocking effects (including CGI moments and especially makeup effects) and MTV style too much. camera effects <br /> <br /> Regarding make-up effects, a reviewer has mentioned how the scene is hiding when a young man finds this giant ridge and looks like a horror movie about the 70s. . Well, there are many monkey-like moments that were portrayed by men as ridiculous and ridiculous. This is not a great camera position and composition. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the whole thing is not shown in an interesting or dynamic way, or it seems remotely real. It does not take seriously. Even the predecessors of the series lacked emotional punishment. Remember Ornithochirus (sp?) Fate "The episode of the dinosaurs"? In that episode I'm still tired over every time I see it. Here's the commitment to the most-liked topic. When you focus on the matter and your story, but only speculation, you are more concerned about the events around it. <br /> <br /> The only savings in this production are the narrative is quite good. (At least in the version seen in the BB version) and music. Otherwise, do not worry, even if you do not want to rent this, you want to be a good laugh (I often did, but usually rolling eyes). This does not fit into "Walking With ..." with other documents. <br /> <br /> And is it sensible that this document is NOT made or people who are directly involved learn from other series? Hmmm ...
