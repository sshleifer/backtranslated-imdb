He did not really stand out to be horrible, he was terrified. The story was not half bad, but the execution was awful. <br /> <br /> To start, he moved faster to involve emotionally. He missed The conversation was so bright, very flat and boring. <br /> <br /> And the characters, very in love, made Deadpool boring. How cool is Deadpool boring? It was not fun. He was not mad The sword was a bit annoying, though he did not know how to use it correctly. <br /> <br /> Gambit was boring. And when did the telekenizas float the cards and jump to the plane or fly hundreds of feet in the air? And what the hell was all the movements of the stupid helicopters? I mean, we know they are mutants, but they are still in the field of physics. The roundabout staff does not have a helicopter shovel, but you can not fly faster with a super-stomp. The Gambit could not do it anyway. Not Deadpool, especially when it comes to real fighting for choreography. <br /> <br /> And this film proves proof that only the coordinators who know what the WTH is doing is to use them better than they know it. for every use. single kick Replacing a true battle for choreography. In Marvel comics (Logan, Creed and Wilson), among the three physical fighters, and some of the worst choreographic fights that I have seen in the last film's memory. The defective coordinator may lift the shoulders and leave the boys with special effects. <br /> <br /> And then you did not end with those mutants. They also showed the mutants in their cells (Quicksilver seemed nice to them) when they got out. Emma-really-lame-for-this-only movie made by Frost and Cyclops. <br /> <br /> And when Logan was so nice? And stupid, "the bullet memory will come out all the way." Do not you tell Xavier and X-Men when they saw the huge bullets hurt in the chest of Xamu? I felt Liev Schrieber for the man, considering the script that really influenced him. Marvel is one of the simplest super criminals. But he could not save the movie from his own lameness. <br /> <br /> Really, this "Daredevil" sucked. A decent story, good actors, absolutely horrible.
