My wife and I liked this movie. While you are asking yourself what is going to be interesting and busy with the soil, when the theater is gone, there are too many loose senses. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Christopher Plummer, a huge wealthy head of a NY bank, has a secret hidden secret. During the Second World War, hidden by the Nazis and the robbers of the Jews, he maintains evidence (including diamonds and documents, including the Nazi svastics) in his bank security box. Why? If he ever wonders, why did he not burn or destroy documents a few years ago? And diamonds? Of course, it does not have to - why save them instead of throwing them? How did the bank robbery know his secret? How did you find out that there was a 232 number in the cashier? The detective group in Washington, Denzel Washington, has also found bank records of 233 and 233 SD Boxes, but # 232. Curious. He sensibly found some time to make exhaustive searches of bank records to clarify this strange event. It is threatening to start a triumph of the state of red and the bank robbers for a moment. Wow! Talk about the great capabilities of a detective. <br /> <br /> When the bank robbers have opened, they leave millions of dollars in their currency. They only take SD Box # 232 content to make the bank president's blackmail. This prevents the logical explanation of what the film describes as a criminal film, and even men with smaller brain. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster, with the political ties of the NYC mayor, has obtained permission. bank robbery under the control of many hijacked bankers. He has offered an agreement on bank robbery to recover documents that he has in his hand, but he is not interested. So what happens (if any?). <br /> <br /> My wife appeared to be proud of all the players, Christopher Plummer (chairman of the bank), Denzel Washington (as a detective) and Jodie Foster, a serious problem. high-capacity shooter <br /> <br /> I watched the latest movie, Jodie Foster, "Flight plan", which was also unclean with the holes. I thought it was like Jodie Foster, but I'm sure I'll avoid future movies. <br /> <br /> Now, my problem is rarely to persuade my wife to go to the movies. I can not agree with him ... "Money and time waste". Say A well-crafted movie, good actors, bad scriptwriting.
