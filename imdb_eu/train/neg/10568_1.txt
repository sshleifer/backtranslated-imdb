Wow I've seen bad movies of my time, but this really is a cake. The movie I've seen in the last decade is the worst - it's not excessive. <br /> <br /> As a veteran of the war in the US army of war, it seemed almost impossible to see this hilarious movie, because it was not remotely taken away, but because there was no attempt at "authenticity" anywhere in the movie. Not as small as small. It seems an 8-year-old boy wrote a war (and soldierly behavior) that he has achieved all his comic book ideas. The film was made in Honduras. It should be a clue, but this can not fully explain the value of trash similar to the overall value of production. <br /> <br /> I tried to list all the technical errors, but it would almost always take them. Names that have not been seen during the Second World War or their names, called "ColCollins" ("Colonel Collins" characters), which were not prefixed with shoulder patches, but reversed using mirror image "N". "The list of Russian alphabets (not the alphabet of the United States) continues: Uniforms, equipment, plots, and above all, the characters' behavior, each scene was full of ridiculous, erroneous and incorrect errors that were totally unmarked. <br /> <br /> No It is neither the story nor the characters can be credible or credible. All the fraudulent childhood at the end. This is, of course, a film for the attention of boys and I definitely will not find this film completely absurd. <br /> < > In short, this film has no redemption at all. Wasted time, I would highly recommend reading this waste, it is not worth your time to waste a moment.
