Actually, I really wanted Julian Po. I think that Slater has not been featured as an actor, and many of these contributors are better than showing off in this movie. I know that it is based on a short story I have not read. So, I do not know if the movie breaks are caused by the story that I see, or imposed by the director or scriptwriter. The premise is wonderful, and I loved the confession of the voice, the confessional tones affecting the initial narration. But then ...? Nothing! Some of the common local characters ask Julian to point out their intention to commit suicide. It can be said that there is no answer because their business is not. Julian is, however, the only point of pressure that public intentions thought. Then, Julian, not the director / writer, Julian's nature in the name of God's magazine tape, seems to give nothing more than the inaccurate information of Julian's life. He said he was a bookkeeper. As a result of your father's profession, his family moved as a child. And what? There are several local interactions, Julian seems to be designed to clarify the purpose. However, there is no way to go, because Julian seems to be a foreigner of another planet living in other places, as if it were the last (and only) holy one. This can be used as allegory, if Julian Po could have something to define defining features or wisdom. The closest thing that reveals anything about himself is the scene with the innocent wife of the mechanic and the condemnation of the religious. And what does this scene reveal is not empathy that Julian would turn on. I can only see the character Julian - himself, given - selfish, small and quite dull. The attitude of the semi-cooked film is correct. And the poor Michael Parker, once the actor had so much promise, is given nothing to do anything to work on.
