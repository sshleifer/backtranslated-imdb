Duran Duran lovers who want to see good loyal music lovers jump on this. Producers decided to create creativity, and in the 1980s this video became something of a science-fiction story involving the evil nasty Barbarella named by the band. <br /> <br /> In the midst of the 80's, Duran Duran's great songs, this is a fictitious antagonist that tries to curb some of the band's concave and annoying cut scenes. The good music is interrupted repeatedly, but Dr. We must undergo a story of a cheap spin-off organized by a nasty Mario. It's almost too much. 2/10
