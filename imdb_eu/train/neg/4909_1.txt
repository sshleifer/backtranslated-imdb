It's true, you've heard it. I'm a fan of James Patterson. I have read about the 10 series of books and Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, the scriptwriter must be shot. <br /> <br /> What was the reason why filmmakers had to kill a magnificent fictional work and become a mockery of the mystery genre? I never thought that Harry Potter was dying, and then Michael O'Hara proved to me badly. <br /> <br /> The next screenwriter that directs this fascinating book will do much justice. To Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: do not leave your day job.
