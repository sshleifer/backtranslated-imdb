In 1995 I personally liked "Prophecy". Christopher Walken, as always, was great, and although it was a great movie, it was a horrible movie and horror movie that was terrifying and very original. Still there is still a smaller sequel to the 1998 Walken. Walken is one of the biggest actors, I think, and again it is clear that Archangel Gabriel has fallen for the second time. Once again, the war between the fallen angels and the faithful is carried to the earth. Gabriel returns to avoid the child's birth, that is, the son of Angel Danyael (Angel Russel Wong) and Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child was a decisive factor in the celestial war ... As I said above, Christopher Walken is again as brilliant as Gabriel. Gabriel also includes "Prophecy II", unfortunately, groups that are extremely annoying. Valerie's character was annoying, and Danayel even more annoyed me. The worst thing about her donkey was Izzy's (she was considered by Brittany Murphy), a girl who was suicidal. However, Walken's performance is not the only film's free quality. The whole movie is quite dark and well shot in the dark, it helps a lot of atmosphere. Initially, Gabriel's resurrection scene is very impressive and is one of the greatest moments of "Prophecy". "Profession II" Walken's "Prophecy" is one of the three weakest films. Undoubtedly Christopher Walken's single-man show, entertaining, but beyond anything.
