The word can not describe this movie as enormous. I saw the video last night, and I just could not believe what I see. Basically, a military "Snakeeater" (Lorenzo Lamas) is looking for his seized sister, Deliverance-style Rednecks looking for a captive. Filming, writing, directing, photography and editing is a song called "Soldier", which has to be a bad song of all time! <br /> <br /> However, there is a treatment. "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) is a hit movie on the "Welcome Back Carter" movie. Otherwise, avoid this mess with ALL COSTS.
