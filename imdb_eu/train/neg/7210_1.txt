Once again, Disney makes a movie for children who totally reject their background. The only thing about them and the original Gadget's cartoons are names. The characters are the most glaring errors. Penny does not have his book; It has been reduced to a clever character and elegant outfit. Dr Claw is a lot more than evil evil, and so on. From the first minutes of the horror film, John Brown's security guard Gadget does not help identify Inspector Gadget as a classic. And at the beginning, Disney finds a terrific attempt to make each story a hateful love for a man and a woman - they bring Brenda, Disney to make this compatible. Add that thanks to the fact that "Claw" in this film and classic Claw are almost opposite in diagonally and you will see that this will not be close to the original story. What would be a better script to replace it, but as you have guessed, Disney has failed. The whole movie means Gadget is nonsense after Brenda. As Disney's injuries, Disney has introduced "new" Gadgetmobile - it does not look like, it works or thinks like old Gadgetmobile, it's just canonical "comic relief". Disney was aware that the cartoons of Gadget were comed, so the movies also made a comedy, but they rang all the gag (like the paper that explodes the face of his head) and replaced the fashion wizard. Gadgetmobile wise and "Claw" appeared. Someone says Disney's "children's movie" does not say "total lack of the brain's use". Gadget should be aimed at children between 10 and 12 years old ... except 10-12 months of age, like this movie. Although this movie is, it's NOT, NOT repeat, the real Inspector Gadget. I love the old gadget, I hate this.
