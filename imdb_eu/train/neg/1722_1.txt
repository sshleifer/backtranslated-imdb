This is one of the worst movie I've ever seen with boring conversation, it's so boring and very annoying and looks like a giant look. I saw this piece of garbage the only reason I wore 8 discs afraid. Earth is absurd and completely stupid when the last time. No blood, however, except a few bloody creatures and bloody wounded wounds. PREPARATION TERRIBLE !! Richard Cardella is horrible as a sheriff and she was quite laughable and her character is annoying. Glen Roberts is a comic relief and it's not fun. Mark Siegel is very annoying and not very funny! Bob Hyman is decent, but not much more. Richard Garrison is annoying and has no chemistry with Kacey Cobb. Kacey Cobb is so here, and he did not chemically with Richard. Overview Avoid any part of this garbage! 5 BOMB.
