I have never seen a movie. The only salvation was the fast function of moving the DVD drive. It was like watching a badly produced CBC movie. It's clear that movies, movies, sets, locations, scriptwriters, editors, actors did not make any money ... Oh, there was no story! I have to write ten comment lines ... Bad, horrible, horrible, wretched, severe, tortured, liar, nauseous, sickening, fromage, disgusting, flimsy, icky, yucky, pukey, stinky, smelly, vile, putrid, all -Tumbs -down, and I do not know how to continue the ten lines of production, which is a damaging part of this production!
