It's amazing for me to know the number of fans of this show. I do not say that Friends, especially the "average" sitcom, and not as great as others. Let's take a look at Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc's questionnaire, who knows if this show is going to last. I have no doubt. As the band progressed, Friends became more and more predictable, sharp and boring, I do not care less about the characters - which were most often dominated by TV history or their difficult situation, or who was sleeping with them. And fun in the first four seasons was fun occasionally. And after all those Hollywood actors from A-list all over Hollywood, I was not tuning yet. I became obsolete with the writing of my friends, who lost interest in this show from the sixth season to the end. At least, it was predictable. <br /> <br /> It was a matter of annoyance that lasted for ten years, but some of my favorite shows lasted only three, four years and eventually canceled and out of the air. The show had to be stopped immediately when the cast wins wanted more. Actually, as the series diminished, the actors were bigger than themselves, not vice versa. <br /> <br /> When it was finished in 2004, I felt so much to see the back of this sitom. Now, talk about the show of friends that will soon come to our TV screens. And yet, I do not expect anything to wait.
