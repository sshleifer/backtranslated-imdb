The long-awaited movie. But the first and first day to see the movie, the friends have been disappointed for me. Atoiz was a label, but the comedy was out & out. bad comedy). One thing that is worthy of admonition is the role of these professional actors, but a part of the film has been very successful. Good play, but I do not think he can keep the movie. India shot it beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) All the colors were saturated, well. However, as the special beauty of these places was filmed, I wanted to know exactly these places and when I went there ;-) <br /> <br /> They shot a lot of sequences of actions, nobody could do stunts' heads and tail , Akki (akshay kumar) has been very well used, but they could do much better. <br /> <br /> Animation is the worst thing I've ever seen in recent films. The 90s have been a better scene of animation (the fall of the start of the car's stage), it would be better to fly. <br /> <br /> And the name of the film has been mentioned almost every 20 and 30 years. I guess just the audience, do not forget the name of the movie ...
