Do you remember that Harrison Ford's greatest Hollywood star made some great movies? These days it feels like a distant memory. <br /> <br /> "Hollywood Homicide" is by no means huge, the police roommate's friend and surprisingly boring. It is a fun-filled comedy, especially an exciting action movie. Subplots abuse can not hide the weakest of the center line. <br /> <br /> At least Ford seems to enjoy his latest projects, and is able to take the most time in the movie. Hartnett is right, but Ford and Newman are not as far as Newman and Redford chemicals. <br /> <br /> All "Hollywood Homicide" differences are reasonably funny, but it's hardly any. Get out of Ford, and that's not it.
