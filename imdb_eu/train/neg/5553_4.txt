This third Darkman was better than the latter, but much worse than the original movie. D2 was better than this, as Bad Guy changed and Durant was not brought back. In addition, there were some traces of character development, bad for the dog family and Darkman himself. This caused my heart to soften and I gave this film as big as 4/10, that is, ** / *****.
