Ursula Andress's naked body is one of those things that you believe in God. The other two women, especially the maidens, also have large bodies. So why can I rate the highest quality and quantity to a movie only to 10 to 10? To get to the unbelievable body of the Ursula, I have to sit through a different and boring movie (I saw a full 101-minute version, not the 78-minute American, which probably cuts a lot). outer material). In Italian traditional comedy, most of the characters are excessively caricatured (an admirable navy, "latin lover", a drunken man, a naughty maid) are not merely surpassed. Last word: see this, but keep your finger quickly forward, you will need it. (*)
