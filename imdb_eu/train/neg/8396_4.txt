... but I've also seen better. <br /> <br /> Here's a story predictable - a film-maker trying to film a horror spot where he was murdered. Three guess what happens. This is not a total bomb. It's a pretty good shot with John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine. Well done for a low-budget movie. Do not nudity, swear, OR bloodstained (the film has a very low PG score). I never felt bored: I could see it in a quiet night. I saw it in the video - print it was a HORRIBLE - it was very dark and impossible to see some scenes. I still do not hate myself and amazed me, and it shocked me, I was surprised. Until now, it's not taking place anymore. You see it, but you are the biggest horror movie.
