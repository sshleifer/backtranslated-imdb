This mood comedy really wanders comedy talent. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are being misused here. I could laugh at this movie once or twice, but, in general, it's boring, with some stupidity in the right way. The premise, even the routine, is still not bad, but when it was set up on the plot, the movie is nowhere. Do not waste this time with this wrong mistake.
