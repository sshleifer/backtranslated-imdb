Start with script. I've seen cartoons deeper than "Invidia". Anytime they do not repeat when you repeat characters, and it was not fun for the first time, the movie has serious problems and "Invidia" is definitely. A joke based movie is better than going somewhere. Here we do not get a movie that's out there anymore. Christopher Walken wants to forget this bomb especially because his character is so weak. Some good black comedies by Ben Stiller with "Flirting with" and "Duplex" came to my head soon. Surely "Invidia" is not a black comedy. There is no double meaning, nothing but nonsense. "Envy" is a low score, because it is similar to that. - MERK
