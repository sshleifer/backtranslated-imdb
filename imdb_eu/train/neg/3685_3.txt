The main reasons to see "Red Eye" are Rachel McAdams, a star performance and Jayma Mays, a wonderful hotel manager. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy covers so badly the cartoon. The rest of the film is being worked on, I will work on it. <br /> <br /> Please do not read more if you do not want to know what happened! <br /> <br /> Here is the synopsis of the argument. Rachel McAdams's character (Lisa) manages a hotel that intends to stay at that Homeland Security Office. Rachel dies from a funeral, but calls to his assistant until he leaves the plane. Meanwhile, someone has stopped his father Joe's house (Brian Cox plays), if Cillian Murphy (Jackson) is ready to die. All Lisa must make their way to the hotel and take the director's suite. Jackson's cohortes intend to make a rocket mission (from a fishing boat) to make a rocket to kill the director and his family. <br /> <br /> So, there are plots or nonsensics here: <br /> <br /> 1. Jackson finally called Lisa to commit, and in the middle, the aircraft's telephone connection is lost. Lisa tries to make calls trying to forge, but by chance, a man in a Jackson corridor is making a phone call and starts to kill him as he is dead. Jackson picks up and Lisa picks up his phone. <br /> <br /> 2. Sometimes, Jackson plays Lisa's heels and, of course, eliminates them ... but only 30 minutes. <br /> 3. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It's sensible, the only listener to hear is an 11-year-old girl whose word, of course, is discounted. <br /> <br /> 4. Lisa plays Jackson with her neck leaning on her neck, stole her phone and crashes into the exit, depending on the seats and the 18-way passenger corridors. Although it is aware that there is a passenger hanging in the shelter, the wingers open the door to Lisaria when the door opens. <br /> <br /> 5. Okay, all this is reasonable (if not very difficult). But here's really stupid. Lisa gets into the terminal at Miami Airport, and there is no telephone signal (all major American airports have a great phone reception). <br /> <br /> 6. Jackson goes through the airport and is not delayed by security officers. 7. Jackson, when he lost his train at the airport to the terminal from the gates to the terminal, lost his voice in the necklace, but it still can be understood. However, he does not worry about his man's Joe out of the house. (PS: there is no train at the Miami airport, but they have looked great like the Orlando Airport). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa stole a car and rides away. When this is called, the phone says "low battery" and will soon shut down (when will you stop this plot?). While the device still says "low battery", when Lisa's assistant arrived at the moment, the director directed the 40th floor to drive the missile-driven window into the fishing boat room. move around Of course, we do not notice that the hotel is surrounded by 3 sides of the ocean, so it is likely that the missiles would be placed in the first room, and therefore denied the need for Lisa-Jackson's plot. What's the story here? Was the room manager of the 38th floor original room one of the single rooms with a bad view? However, everyone goes out before the missile. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa Joe drives home to save his father only to see the killer. Although he was carrying it (while it's being shot) if Jeep is in the house, no one wants to be warned or worried. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jackson pushes Joe home and knocking outside (we do not see how ... maybe another butt butt). Lisa then explains that she did not want to kill her father, because she wanted to see Father Lisa first (give me a break. What's this? Saturday morning cartoons?). In the rest of the film (about 20 minutes), Jackson continues to play Lisa around the house, and resumes his resources. Of course, the real killer (that is, Jason Statham can do) should do it with Lisa (or anyone who is not a killer) for the first 30 seconds. In this harassment, Jackson spreads Joe over at no time without killing any work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> In the end, Jackson prevails and kills Lisa (when you guessed it). <br /> <br /> So, here's my suggestion ... I'm afraid of Wes Craven. Or, perhaps, Michael Bay (who led the stupid "Uhartea") had to meet and named "Red Island".
