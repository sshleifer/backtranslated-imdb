I can tell before I saw the movie, I was not suggesting that Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or was a story of her life, and I have to admit that the movie was to get these data ... I did not have much help. Doing some research on Google's website to avoid success; However, I can say that the actress Jeanette Hain was very well-versed when she acted with her silent self-expression and showed a profound state of mental depression, as it is true. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, based on the movie about the turkey and teheran, as well as the script that happened in Afghanistan ... but believe me the area is about an Arab desert in Morocco ... Turkish people and Persian people are completely different They are in the language of face and culture as in non-Arabic language. <br /> <br /> I suppose this is a movie, a type of document, a detailed research on small items is mandatory.
