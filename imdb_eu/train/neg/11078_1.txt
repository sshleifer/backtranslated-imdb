Honestly, where can you start? It was a small budget, it was the fault of this film, so maddening that it was so much for us to laugh at it! The sword fight scenes were also not a sword fight, they were playing around playing Wal-Mart's plastic swords and they were doing just what they were doing just like they're trying to be moaning ... My family and the day We enjoyed a good day's action movie. That's why we decided to go to the store and we searched for The Sawtooth Island. I mean it was so great, but when we saw it at home, I was killed after the first scene. <br /> <br /> Oh, the movie plot, the story board, the script, etc. I also do not know why trash producers and producers are losing their time! But if you go over this movie ... do not get it !!!!!
