This movie seemed to be as interesting as the outcast kanibal. I was very disappointed. It was the same type of despair, "I saw Friday 13th: it is taken by Jason Manhattan." so much waste is the potential! <br /> <br /> The grabber is a decent attention to the opening scene. then stops it. Many minds and dreadlocks in the 80s can not help this movie. The only thing that you eat next to the many cannibal islands of this island are piranas! I do not ask for a 'cannibal holocaust' level, but I was looking for a cheap inexperienced explorer. I did not have anything like that. <br /> <br /> The two parts of two fighting scenes seemed very interesting to me, that's why 2 stars. I do not think that it really deserves time to see it. I see that no one knows what happens and if you want something in the background. But I would not tell anyone: "Oh, man, you've seen this movie." Not enough good or bad care is guaranteed.
