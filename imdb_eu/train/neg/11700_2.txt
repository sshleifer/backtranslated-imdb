I really expected to see this movie, but after seeing it, I was very disappointed. Hardly Stephen King was there. Rober John Berk can not save his life and no one else can. Some of the shows also laughed aloud! The movie was not as I imagined, after reading the book was amazing, it seemed darker and much more awful. When I was Esteban, I'd be so mad! <br /> <br /> I do not know why they changed their end, I thought it was a good end to the book. If you found out that your daughter had died, could not we feed it to anybody else! <br /> <br /> The book was much better!
