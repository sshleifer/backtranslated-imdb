I have nothing in front of religious films. I think religious people need to see something on Saturday night. But what's really ticks off in the DVD box does not mean that this factor represents the potential of the viewer. Overcoming religious recreation propaganda NO it's nice, brother. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And if it were a religious person, I would still have to agree with other posters, the movie was wrong. It was badly targeted, poorly played, poorly edited, and a ridiculous attempt by a soundtrack. False accents were awesome, the characters were primarily stereotyped, and the continuity was out of the window. We sat down with the loss of time for the only reason that it was too late to see another movie. You should lie down. <br /> <br /> The restless nature of this movie is not a type of religion, and you believe that you immediately believe that something is preached to believers to beliefs, even if you have a garbage stack. . If not, avoid at all costs. Do not be fooled by writing the box.
