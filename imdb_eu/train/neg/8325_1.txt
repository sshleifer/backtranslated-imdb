This week I watched the movie and was initially disappointed among those who had little hope. The most obvious mistake in this abomination of a movie is that the point of the main argument (it was awake during the surgery) did not have to do anything. It would end anyway, whatever. So what was the point? Who knows In addition, this surgeon played 4 against him, and did not believe that people would ask if the sick died on his table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is completely talented and Christians is almost as bad. The whole thing came from the beginning to the end. I'm sure if you feel that you have someone cut your chest through the scalpel, you'd be so much worse than that.
