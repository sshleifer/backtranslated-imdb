The low exploitation of Spanish (which should not be added) is a wonderful look (it might look good), but not? Leave me this sentence again? Actually, "huh?" It would go through your head a lot. Nothing makes sense, or even tries. I know nothing of its cryptic or merely a confusing one, but it does not deny how it feels weird and weird and weird <br /> <br /> <br /> Unrelated sequences linked (the nasty opening of a little girl like Mario Devil and Firefighter) Mario's photographer (a deep story about John Caffari's breed) is a mustache for the iconic Nintendo Mario. What does your girlfriend get into the house and she'll find a young lady (Patty Shepard) who wants to ask her to take a picture assignment. Here, in this remote mountain retreat you will find witches with chandelier. <br /> <br /> Look at what is not part of the plot and surprise what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and an increasingly misfortune. Raul Artigot directs strange and extravagant images with incredible passages, but most of it does not exist and there is the same as writing. The surprising cinematography of Ramon Sempere works on a rich and rich landscape, watching over the landscape, and it's time to relax. However, it seems too dark to see what was happening. Fernando Garcia Morcillo creates a great and aggressive and incredibly disturbing point. Directors are capable, but there is a solid set of secondary shows (Victor Vaticano is selected). <br /> <br /> A little bit of interest, but it's dreamy (it seems to go). and good) until it keeps watching close.
