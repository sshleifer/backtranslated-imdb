Is not it tired of that old clich√©, almost a dead man appears in a horror movie, gives us some information, and then blurs his head without apparent reason? I know that I am. <br /> <br /> This sad thing in this movie is not valid. If you saw the first movie (which I should say first), the information provided is completely invalid, as it was already known. I think that the main characters are useless. But why shoot the idiot in the head? Should not live Of course, he would die anyway. <br /> <br /> This is the second movie called "The Hills Have Eyes II". The first film was the sequel to the 70's. This is a complicated person like me. I probably see that I am part of my childhood minority, at the beginning there was an HHE2 and much more than the original HHE1. And now, we keep track of a remake and the sequel is named as the sequel to the original HHE1 ... it's worse! But, nevertheless ... <br /> <br /> Wes Craven's original Hills has been a decent eye. In the end, however, the idea was better than the presentation, but probably had a small budget. To make it sound, Wes Craven is not for the sake of a horror director. He has just made some great horror films (Nightmare on Elm St., New Nightmare), some good (Scream) and some great (Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn). Oh well, and he also made Swamp Thing ... but he gets into the final HHE2 category. I've seen a few minutes, but it's been awful. <br /> <br /> Now he has written the HHE2 ... and nevertheless fails! Last year's remake was better than the original movies. It was a tumultuous one. I thought the main characters were a family and not a teenager with beer, pot and sex. It feels dirty. The first time we were in hell, and in some moments at times the good ones revenged the bad and felt well. <br /> <br /> This new film has no tension. No events. Only stupid things are the most stupid ones. There is almost no threat here. Undercoats hidden under the rocks. <br /> <br /> The horror movies are because they kill people because of stupid mistakes. The next day, when I watched "Deep Blue Sea", Samuel L. Jackson continued to walk around the water, while talking, and eating a shark only because the idiot was closed. ... when nobody would do something! Here's the same thing. People only escape to escape, even knowing that people die ... Can not turn it on? And then, when you think people will learn, another goes on their own! Seriously, is not it more scary the characters throw their game and still lose? I'd think that way ... <br /> <br /> It even more. "The Fog" remake ("Becker" was more threatening than a section) should make the first remake. Bad guys More time in caves. More voltages Everything else. <br /> <br /> But it's a version upgrade. Bad bad No tension Surely we will have more time in caves, but it does not happen much. In the end, it seems two or three are bad. The latest movie looks like a whole tribe of people. Where is this tribe? Who still sees binoculars? Actually, these films are things that should be brought to us, but the final promise that has given us the final film ends with the same "observer" scene. Come on! I will give it to the devil. The movie looks good ... but that's it. <br /> <br /> I do not think gore-fans will like this ... I'm sure it's wrong! There are gore (most of them are blamed on the darkness), but with no voltage and characters ... the reflection does nothing in my book! In the end, you are not afraid. You will not be surprised (if you are an 8 year old girl). You do not feel that you have seen anything.
