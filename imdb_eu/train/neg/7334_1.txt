Stuart Bliss I think I've ever seen the movie worse. The effect was awful and the plot was shocking. In fact, it seemed to him that he had left the wife of the main character, but it was so absurd and boring, after a little while I took care of less people. <br /> <br /> The film continued on more than just the same ideas, without adding anything to the plot, fresh or surprising. Through the Geiger counter, Stuart started to open his wall, when he was behind him, he began to see what the counterman could see when there was something. <br /> <br /> Then the scenes were repetitive. the flyer, and the confusion of what he knows himself. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was a flop, when I did not know any of the actors. Let's face this when the movie appears, read a book! You'll be better.
