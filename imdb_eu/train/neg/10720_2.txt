Last weekend I watched the movie and it's nonsense. An ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in a pajamas? Victims are frightened by nonsense and they can not escape the slow-moving elder. They drop their lantern and instead of trembling, they are trying to remove it or avoid it. Quentin alias, owner of honeymoon Fabersham, married Diane Brewster alias. Miss Canfield of Beaver's reputation with unhappy marriage. Wow, in love. The rest cast goes back to the tomb and reacts and waits for them to cry out. The Egyptian girl is not badly watched, but she does not give much to the movie. Where is momia It's really a curse. That's not a flash of Universal Mummy movies. Check if you need to sleep this movie, you'll get that dose.
