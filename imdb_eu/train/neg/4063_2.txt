There's a good scene with Faat Kine. The title character is argued with another woman and, after threatening, she throws it into the face of Faat Kine. The scene works, at the same time, because the action is unexpected, curious and quite fun. In this example, the writer and director Ousmane Sembene gives him an easy-to-read character that is an interesting film worth two hours watching. In the scene, she presents a brave woman who is brave in her actions. In the rest of the film, it seems that other things are conflicting. <br /> <br /> The tone is in the whole place. It is true that not all films are included in a specific genre, but I do not think that it enters into the genre of Faat Kine. Apparently, it is a drama, although it is a great comedy (spraying on the face) although some moments are not taken seriously. On the other hand, the movie is definitely not a comic, Sembene collects a lot of images. There is a way to mix comedy and drama together successfully. Sadly, Semebene was not at all happy. Instead, one scene, one after another, moves one after another without rhyme or reason, leaving two different tones to the wind. <br /> <br /> Fat, Kin also has a problem for two hours, with a very big end. The film ends with a big party that has resolved the conflicts of great characters, but they are not resolved quickly. The scene is longer than any other scene, probably for twenty minutes. Still, the rest of the scenes have been immersed so far, and at the end it is difficult to be seated at the beginning of repetition to make the visual experience frustrating. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too hard at Faat Kine. I'm not the right audience. I did not feel anything about the characters and I did not have any connection to the story. There are people who will find something that is significant in the story and who will see strong characters. However, I could not do that and I can not recommend it.
