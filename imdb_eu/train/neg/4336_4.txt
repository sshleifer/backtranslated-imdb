This movie and Carlitos Way originally came back. The difference between two is annoying. Now, I know people will say they've done it with a little budget, but it's never been related to a bad script. Now, I'm just being alone, but I always thought I'd make a prequel to another movie, with some of the great characters and maybe a little bit about life we ​​did not know. Rise to Power is just a movie with Carlito. There should be some minimal characters from the original film, and the ending does not have the original. At the end of this film he is retiring with his sweet heart, but what next is the next movie that will be released from prison? And his wife is not the same woman who speaks as the only love of the original. I would say the movie was entertaining to himself, with a few decent bundles, but when he puts himself in front of his big brother. Do not be awake tonight waiting to see this, see if you need a more original time period.
