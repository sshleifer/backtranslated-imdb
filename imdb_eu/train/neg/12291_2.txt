Humm, David Hasselhoff and a Italian movie by Linda Blaire, I did not expect much, I was less honest and I was less than expected. It does not mean that I have seen this movie because they have seen worse, but the plot has been more confusing and less interested, and that's why they only keep one thing. In addition to loving special effects, they are very fond and bad. I only want to see the director himself "Troll 3", sure he will not be worse than that.
