I am a good person, so I gave him this movie instead of 2. It's definitely the worst film I have ever seen. The areas that were more and less interested in the plot, that is, was what Jesus really wanted to know, were glossed, and instead of sadical punishment given to our hero (Arquette) caused a heavy dose of visual. In the first 15 minutes the crucifixion would be more humane for its nature and spectators. The play was almost out there and the direction was inspired. And, if I saw a drop of water or a blow to the camera, I could scream more than Patricia.
