In the representation of a miserable lesson in Milan, it was probably a very significant film during his time. However, I felt that neorealism was not really a director of the De Sica bag, here he decided to try and create a modern fable that has found a father patch in a country around an old dear beloved. After going to a nursery in a nursery, he lives in a house in Milan. The population organizes them in community action and keeps their spirits on their faces with an angry and smiling smile, trying on one side tables. No one told me what time it was for me to have tables, because people have much more important thinking, as Pot Pot Noodle will be next. However, De Sicak uses a dramatically sublime and subtle device to say why they are imprecise. Clearly, capitalism is obvious, and to illustrate this, miserable people find an oil source on their land. Brilliant! In his opinion, however, he has refused to make serious films, and the capitalists appear to be as serious caricatures, coats and cigarettes. They want the earth, but our math hero does not get such a nonsense. As a result of a curious luck, the old patron saint of the cabbage day appears in the sky and gives it a magical pillar. He offers his friends with his friends, as cigars are as passionate as they are. I think this movie was a lost opportunity. In order to address the issue of poverty, many filmmakers did not even get caught up in a fairy tale until then, it seems to me a bit. How are 'excellent managers' like the kindergartens of the child as we see here? Hans Christian Anderson would surely be less likely to fly over the Duke of Mil√°n and go higher than brooms. However, De Sica is proud of as a genius. Surely, these people are so poor that their faith is inadequate and their wonders never work, it is enough to work on any account. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
