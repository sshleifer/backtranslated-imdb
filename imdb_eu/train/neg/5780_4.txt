I really liked this movie and thought I needed to improve as I saw it. Do not be miserable, it's never the worst film, but never has its potential to live. It's a good premise, it's a great cast (especially when I was pumped out to see David Naughton's return), and you can say that God loves people to try their best. It falls over and over again. "Brutal Massacre" should definitely remind film-makers of films that Christopher Guest Christopher Guest can do, and yet, despite its easy appearance, you should forget to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are wonderful and they should often be seen ... I get 4 stars for the reason. If you want to have a "Spinal Tap" on a horror, I think you thought that guy named "Spinal Tap" thought ... thinking out there.
