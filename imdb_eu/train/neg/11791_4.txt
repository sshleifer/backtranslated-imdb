I do not get that. The movie, of course, has a good budget. Cinematography is very good. It has a nice fit, good editing and correcting is also pretty good. Then, WHY Why did not someone hire someone to write the script again, so they would not be so cheesy and cheaty as to why they hired them, such as the actor, can not a bag of paper bags? This movie may be good. In most of the time he looks good and feels good, but finally you realize that the movie was no good. <br /> <br /> So, it's a good production, but I'd say it's a bad movie. Really bad <br /> <br /> And eel? Come, really!
