It's definitely the most offensive "Chick Flick" I have ever seen this year. The writing and characterization of films has static stereotypes in parody. Before going to the theater one hour and five minutes before the theater, we had the following issues: having a baby can solve all your problems, "interpreter types" are misfortunes, and musicians can not be good mothers to dreams of their dreams for a more ordinary life. What is the ruin of a talented cast and the look and feel of the clothes? Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette, except for a larger private life, she will finish - "only!" I felt vibrant. I can not believe that this movie has reached theatrical release. "Female" is the rate expected for these cable channels while it is performing channel surfing. I am a woman and over 35, so I should be part of the recipients of this film, but the boy has lost his "Evening" target.
