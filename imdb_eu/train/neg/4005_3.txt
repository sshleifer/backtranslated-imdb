I'm the original fan of Cracker series and I own all the DVDs. Cracker was more inclined to go on more than one occasion, but Robbie Coltrane and other cast members, as well as writers, seemed always to wear them. Among the great series of Brit TV crimes of the time, I've seen Cracker, and it's a tough fight: Prime Suspect, Inspector Frost, Morse Inspector, Jeremy Brett Sherlock Homes, and more. Cracker, along with Prime Suspect, was at the top of my list. <br /> <br /> This makes "The New Terror" even more sad ... <br /> <br /> In the end, this has been a very pale honor of Cracker's imitation. I was forced to sit down and be convinced that it was not really bad, and some sparks would be awakened. I was wrong, it was a bad start from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Some critics: first of all, to face the potential of any potential bias: American anti-opposition and anti-war. Most dreated across the Screed show and. Topper: The murder of innocent crimes committed by Americans and a British Junkie, in Fitz's words, are "understandable but not justified." I thought, "I've been walking around for two hours to hear a little rumor?" So, in my opinion, I believe that the anti-war / American tone had a negative reaction ... Outside of politics, this Cracker did not make sense for propaganda, and it already helped to weaken it already. scary script <br /> <br /> Secondly, how long did Robbie Coltrane achieve? Fitz was almost a bit in this player, as if it had been a story written in the original Fitz's role without thinking of a story.

Certain runners and parts of the development of the character (Fitz's son Fitz could not stop at home when he lost his plane to Australia) liked the use of his poor artist. heads and ancient sparks between Fitz and his Missus, but not enough to carry a boring line. <br /> <br /> The fourth, where was the hell in Panhallaga? Now, it would be interesting ... After all, he was Manchester, and he was 10 years old. Another wasted opportunity (or perhaps the actress was not interested?) <br /> <br /> Well, to say a lot more (bad), but I closed it with curiosity: at the end of the show (when it was published in BBCA, When the announcement announced that the "Director's cut" was available on BBC On-Demand, I thought AH-HA! Cutting the director, which is surely a must-have, I hope that tonight I have all the expectations I want to see, but I never had a coherent sequence and Interestingly, unfortunately, after persuading you to sit down with a terrific free version of "A Terror Berria", I'm not expecting anymore to expect a second to pay for a better version of the book, "A Terror Berria", and I was annoyed by BBCA he thought he'd cut it and cut it, and sacrificed the time of the ads to fit the endless stream of advertisement for ten minutes. Then he turned He asked me to pay and what he should pay what he should pay most in the current version. . <br /> <br /> Close, I am referring to the first paragraph of "A New Terror" by Variety: it really says all: "The initial excitement about Robbie Coltrane confirming the role of BBC's bad, shocking and emotional defect Criminal psychologist Snowman's political condition writer Jimmy McGovern has decided to deliver it within this revitalization.
