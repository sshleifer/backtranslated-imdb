Yes, the first "Howling" was classic. I started to slowly begin a good movie for the male wolf I admit, but it was a good momentum, when the anchor turned out to be a pretty young man who had fallen into the camera. Yes, I had to make a horror movie fun ... forget all this, because this film has nothing to do with that movie. Or, surely, the woman of the anchor is the one who wanted to find out what he was and what he wanted to do to find out his brother or something, but they start from a comfortable retirement from the first films. Transylvania or somewhere where the wicked magician werewolves or something they must fight. I'm often asked by Christopher Lee about what was happening in this movie world, but I read that curiosities that he had never before said in a trivia movie, but he still reads the script before taking on a role. It might be possible that hell might come into being "a rough mother of London". Eventually, it was established in London. Hooligan, male bugs do not seem like a genuinely extravagant sex scene that looks much like this movie. Indeed, the most memorable part of the death of the movie was when the cook was aloud and his ear started bleeding.
