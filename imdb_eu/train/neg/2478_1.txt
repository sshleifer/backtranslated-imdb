This movie is S-L-O-W. She really waited for most of the movie to 'start'. <br /> <br /> The setting was not there, the script was bleak, filmmaking was plump, plots were plump (they were not all quoted). Low budget movies are bad, but this has not been free. <br /> <br /> <br /> Plots were hunters and hunters who were consumed more than hunters, because Wendigo made a very real look. movie This, of course, was disappointing that this Wendigo was a strange blend of a tree and stem. Everything about the movie was not inspiring. <br /> <br /> They seemed to be just like the boy's parents, and sometimes they were completely disconnected with his son. Although it's not a bad thing or a bad script, I'm not sure, but it increases my level of despair and boredom. <br /> <br /> There was no thought, do not think interest. Without a real intrigue or a cold factor, this movie was diminished, it did not matter what happened at the end. <br /> <br /> Wendigo's atmosphere reminds me of the dreadful film award ceremony. The end of the film "Mr Bean's Holiday": an artistic and nonsensical movie that is profound and meaningful, but boring and boring. <br /> <br /> I never wanted to see this again. In the end I only saw in vain hope that something could be interesting ... but not.
