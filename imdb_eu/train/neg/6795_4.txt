The Comeback is hopeful, with a brutal scene of death, with a murderous mask. The mask is quite pretty and similar to what was used in the 1990's "Granny". From now on the movie is mostly boring. We get some more deaths, but they are good again, but not many of them. Death is so good that the reason is terribly and bloody. The story behind the film is quite interesting and would work very well, if it were not boring. <br /> <br /> I'd like to avoid that if you're not a hard-boggler, it's not enough to make it slasher especially for the movie's average.
