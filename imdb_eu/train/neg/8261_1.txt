I was looking at seeing this movie and then I realized that without a promise of a consistent dialogue between the actor. Now I am no reason at all, but shouting in the darkness is not a good movie together. Today, Ewan Bremner is one of the worst actors in the world (witness to the divine spectacle of Life of Stuff) and the accent "Cockney" is as bad as Edinburgh's accent. Avoid. The number of filmmakers who need to "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "Beautiful Creatures", realize that the word f, etc., is not a good dialogue.
