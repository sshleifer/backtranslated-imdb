Altered Species begins on Friday night in Los Angeles. There, Dr. Irwin (Guy Vieg) and Walter's laboratory assistant (Allen Lee Haff) are burning their midnight oil while still trying to test their new revolutionary drug called 'Rejenacyn'. As Walter recommends the latest non-solvent attempt, the tubing includes a green liquid jar in the basement where they start drinking from rats that run away from the laboratory ... Five friends Walter, Alicia (Leah Rown, some stylish outfits and some cool buttons) rat ), Gary (Richard Peterson), Burke (Derek Hofman), Frank (David Bradley) and Chelsea (Alexandra Townsend) decide that they have worked hard and that they plan to take it. pick up and have lunch there. Laboratory and Douglas (Robert Broughton) have been more clever because murders have already been attacked and killed by the homicidal illnesses in the basement because a new serum that is injected into Walter's laboratory cartridge breaks the cage. . Walter's friends have appeared, but he can not stop him, the mouse is missing and everyone helps him. All six of them become rat potentials ... <br /> <br /> It was also called Rodentz Altered Species, and it was directed by Miles Feldman and very little recommend. Serge Rodnunsky's producer's script is inadequate and, together with the overall generosity of production, Altered Species is a very lama. To begin, the character is dumb, annoying and topical. Then, with the mad scientist, his monster, isolated location, human performance, and the ultimate occurrence of the hero and monster. Somewhere it's everywhere. Changed Species move with the right rhythm, the best thing to say about it, and hopefully it does not last long. Basically, the average monthly killer of your rat is a murderer and not particularly good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Feldman is like a television series, and the whole thing is bold and unforgettable. Some special effects and some scene of attack left a lot. For starters, CGI rats are awful; Attack sequences have movements that have a hand-held camera and they quickly change to prove that all rats are seated passively. In Altered Species it is necessary to shake rats cages due to rats' movements. Finally, the rat monster seems pretty bad, but a man with a dody outfit. Not afraid, there is no tension, no atmosphere and basements with neon lighting lighting? Here are two or the most unusual parts, someone has a huge hole that dirtys his face, split into his arms and underscores, a lot of rumors of rum, a balloon and a dead cat. br /> <br /> The technically modified species is standard. It occurs within the boundaries of a building, it has low CGI effects and low production costs. The play is not much like it, but it is not very bad and it has a special mention with Alicia like Leah Rowan. In fact, Altered Species only see ... <br /> <br /> Changed species are not particularly good, but I suppose you can do worse, but bad films. It's not great, but maybe it's worth the clock if you do not do anything that's unnecessary or anything else.
