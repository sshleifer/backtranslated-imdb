"Seventh symbol" is much more called "Rosemary's baby" and "omen" (mixes two stories). Although the title reminded Bergman of "Seventh Seal". <br /> <br /> However, it is enough to begin with all the ominous scattered all over the earth, while at the same time Moore's husband husbanded a husband of Moore (when his parents killed his brother and his sisters died) to avoid death penalty while trying. Christian religious times and Jews are called salvation (it also participates in an amazing Jew), that is, the lines sometimes make a mistake funny (did you ever go to a Sunday school, but God was love!). IMHO, the scene is a short interview between the priest John Heard, who does not appear to be serious, he was not very badly attributed to his imposing actors without price, and the young Jew. <br /> </ p> <p> Demi Moore surely registered the same desire as former Bruce Willis: to save the world. It does not store the entire film for that purpose.
