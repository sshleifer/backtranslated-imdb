It's not a long time why managing the name: Diamond Head does not get network schedules. The television pilot movie does not pass credits, it will be obvious before. Maybe I've lost something because the plot does not make sense. As I was mistakenly mistaken, a terrorist or robber or something called "Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something from the secret weapon. Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), the sad secret world agent has stopped. May be more, but trust me? It really does not matter. <br /> <br /> Action movies must be action. Invalid moments should be suspense. And the moment has to be dramatic drama. There's nowhere else the code name: Diamond Head. Did others use the word "turgid" to describe this TV show? And any word that might improve is better than the description. A character is neither exciting nor worthy of it. And Roy Thinnes makes the worst case he can imagine. His charisma is placed somewhat northwards. Ian McShane is the easiest to get this movie, but sadly, as far as everyone else is concerned, he will not come back as a regular member. If McShane series lead pieces are broken, then it might be something. <br /> <br /> Immediately I know that Gawd's terrific television series from the 70's make up 3000 episodes of the Mystery Science Theater. . And this doubles with Quinn Martin. Mike and Botsen are very entertaining things. So I can only give the movie 3/10, while I value Episode # 608 4/5 on my MST3K scaling scale.
