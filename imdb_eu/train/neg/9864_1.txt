As a gamer, I can not say I like this movie. The truth is, I hate it, I hate it. I tried to see it as open as possible, but when it comes to getting it, it feels it insults my social group. <br /> <br /> For me, there are several reasons why. <br /> 1. Non-characters are natural. I have met many players in different fields of life. I do not know who acts as a character of the film. The film's producer has taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and has collected 5 people. Most gamers only have society, some have a fairly active life. 2. The style does not work. Mockumentary style is badly suited to the subject of the movie. Real documentary about gamblers would work better. Although it looks good (IE is cleared), it's not very good. <br /> <br /> 3. Interviewing is forced to feel unnatural. It also seems that there is no real context in the world. Players swear, I admit, but we do not have Tourette Syndrome. <br /> <br /> 4. There is a lack of humor. Although the humor that refuses one's self to find my group and some other groups, that is to say, self-preservation, and it is better to have a common sense of humor. Also, a large part of gamer humor is full of jokes and anecdotes, not a common humor. Most players would have liked to make anyone joke. 5. The main problem for me is basically: Accuracy. I do not mean rules, but rather dynamics. Although this film will compare the smaller quotes The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising. Both players represent the true characters that play the real game. The difference is that Gamers: The Movie is a situation where players want to beat the senseless vs. gamers, where you can say something like: "Huh, I know such a guy ... Yes, that's definitely like Gary."
