I finished the movie before I saw one of the reviews, at the request of a woman. For curiosity, I thought, let me see the people who recommend this to see this movie. I was very surprised to conclude that I am convinced that it is a fraud in finding out long and positive comments on this website. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, as I demand my opinion, "these filmmakers postpone or do they think they have been delayed by the viewer?" The movie is released on many levels and I do not even tell the story or the presentation. <br /> <br /> So, boys and a girl (main actor) make up a group of musicians; Depending on the constant presence of the guitars, it's a ROCK band. Hell, when did the dancers start to become part of a rock band? However, accept Bollywood-a-Rock-band version, but it's pretty funny for both guitarists to make cool "ROCK GESTURES" of all kinds of scores and I think they were playing. instrument, guitar sound was totally lacking !!! Here I can not understand the stupidity magnitude ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Bollywood's directors are not ashamed anymore !!!!!!!!
