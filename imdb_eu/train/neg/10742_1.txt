I did not want to sit through that bomb any time. Disappointment of this disaster. The performance was made atrocious. After that, a totally skewed action led some scenes of action that fell as a balloon. That is, they are mostly just actress reactions. Hitchcock did not think about the modern operation of the new "Lifeboat" version. Hictcock thought he would turn circles in his grave, in the whole thought that he could endure, there is no credible thing about this great movie.it name, but they do not make any effort in the characters. But, you know, to be fair, I mean no one really guilty, I am pretty sure that the first episode of the script has occurred. . LOL.it is possible in order to improve this ending, but for me, I'm not ready to spend at least three days. Also, avoid at least three days a weekend if you do not avoid horizons, avoid them. This stinker / 1/10
