I'm Christian. However, I was always skeptical of the film made by the Christians. In general, they are "knowledge notes" in the production of the film. I admire TBN on the screen trying to present God and Jesus. However, they did a great job. The play was awful, and although the Bible does not know it, it is impossible to understand what the movie wants. The movie was overwhelmed, but the people who made it also had some things wrong. However, in this "criticism", these events are irrelevant and deeper. In summary, Omega Code is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I would not recommend it to anybody, except for the daily grind relief.
