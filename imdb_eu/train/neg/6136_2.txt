Buck brings The Kahn to the role of Bob Barker (The Price is Right), a country that directs his show. But much more baby and whistle for this turkey. Kurt Thomas shows some acrobatic skills as a "heroine" for childhood, but it does not have any active talent. There are some stunning times (especially in Crazies town), and some marvelous martial arts. But "Ninja" will give you much more entertainment for any movie, and you will not be ridiculed for laughing.
