I apologize against the stream, but I thought that this film was realistic, boring and longer. I struggled with Gena Rowlands, I saw that I was tired and experienced the crisis. Maybe the film has a cinematic value or represents an important step in the director, but I would skip it by the value of pure entertainment.
