I have seen Lion King and Lion King II and I both enjoyed them. 1.5 I thought it could be worth seeing with Lion Lion. What a despair! Disney must be worried about the revenue. <br /> <br /> Especially when they lost an agreement with Pixar. <br /> <br /> They essentially received footage that left the editor's editor. floor (or rubbish) and stuck together <br /> <br /> money. Unlike LK I and II, both stories had strong lines. <br /> <br /> This film does not have any story. Characters and animations are always fun to watch, but there is not enough material to make this movie. Some bits may have a second record in the original bids. Disney - You can shame a quick throw in the trash! <br /> <br /> Take time and effort in the next place and put our work on a permanent basis.
