Welcome to the fantasy story and somebody's nightmare. This horror tale has been found by a husband married (John Hudson) and his wife (Peggy Weber) are investigating memories of his previous wife and empty mansions and lily pond. Is the husband really already trying to cure his anxious bride? Or did he question Jessica's farmer, Mickey, after being killed by housewife Alex Nicol? This low-budget horror movie has a story line that eventually encourages participation in the whole way. Special effects are quite bad in the 1958 standards. Sometimes I swear as the red scream should be in Godzilla. Also in the Snow Reverend movie is Russ Conway. By the way ... is the director of the gardener (Nicol). You can catch up with AMC's Monsterfest.
