I really liked this movie, but I was bored and I believed. The first picture is a feed of a robot's camera that sends a bomb and, of course, it's a tremor. But then the rest of the film is kept in shakcam, even in calm conversations, to be ridiculous. Are the rental companies exhausted by tripods and Steadicams? It has not been shot in 16 mm, since the whole movie is grainy. <br /> <br /> Bigelow has set enough vehicles and equipment to make an effort to make mistakes and inconsistencies that reduce the credibility of the film. <br /> <br /> - A car does not turn on the fire after a single shot, and once burned out it will not be extinguished by a small hand-out extension handheld. <br /> <br /> - A single Humvee did not drive around Baghdad in 2004, but other vehicles would protect them from breakdowns or attacks. - It would be unlikely that he could attack the insurgent running a long run, to get a clear goal that gets a second bullet. <br /> <br /> - I think bombs were brought to places where there is a base or near, not a random place in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - The oil attack is said to have occurred in the Green Zone, because there were few attacks on the inside. Most of the area is palaces with little offices and palaces, however, it is depicted as an insurgent hiding in the dark paths. Oddly enough, James never raises any problem with trying to get a ridiculous order from each of his two friends, claiming kidnapping. <br /> <br /> - A three-man team always mentions the cleaning of buildings, etc. Romans are looking for themselves, although there are dozens of soldiers. <br /> <br /> - How many hours does the team look for a dead insurgent hanging on a window? Does it work out? <br /> <br /> There was not any photo to show. The size and design of the spectator's base with regard to Baghdad. I did not know who gave the EOD team or other characters. The characters are things they know, so we should do too much. "Surprise" and many scenes can be previewed. Yes, it's clear that the Colonel Psychiatrist will have trouble with the Iraqi people trying to move, choosing cereal at home will be overwhelming, and when you've been kidnapped, the driver does not have to wait for the vehicle. <br /> In the end, it was almost entirely unpredictable. Renn's initial character has a confused relationship with her home, and she's adrenaline-like. The movie is the same as the ending. What is that? <br /> <br /> This is precisely what is, to date, the best Iraq war movie, the bundle is bad. I saw that in half an hour, I'd recommend Generation Kill HBO.
