MST3K's reviewers have left the movie scene of this great movie, which is a memorable one: the "Ben Gazzara look-alike" is a bad guy with a violent scene (like Maria Gazzara). As mentioned, he later died of TJ's ineptitude). Perhaps rape is a stronger word, "prison rituals" may be more appropriate. The back of this opportunity, but a forced meeting, is a mafia hiding by "Ben Gazzara", who presents girls hanging in his pool. It spreads 30-year-old mirrors, but our evil one must be quite damaged, because love is at that time. He tries to overwhelm his first movement, as his mafia says that the beneficiary gift is reborn. I did not like the secondary school girl, but nevertheless I wanted to get to know the story ... Let's just say he later caught him later.
