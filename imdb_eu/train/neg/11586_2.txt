Nightmare on Elm Street: Childhood <br /> <br /> The movie is bad. It does not run away. I love the series and I think Freddy is probably in horror movies. But if you were a fan, I could not see anything like this movie. <br /> <br /> There is no effort to build an interesting story and strong characters. They left until now. They did not even try. They are the production of the course, in order to obtain more money. <br /> <br /> The story does not attract your attention. It's pretty simple it's almost missing. <br /> <br /> Alice, the bearded part 4 is now pregnant. Freddy will return to her child's dreams. At first, we found out that Alic had to stop him. And that's it. <br /> <br /> The story progresses slowly because it is a small plot, it becomes quite boring in the midst of mischievous conversations and a gruesome performance. In fact, the scary thing is one act, the deaths are not a bit cool. <br /> <br /> The characters are not so interesting, because we do not care less. <br /> <br /> The girls are as little as possible. The whole group reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I have seen better audiences. It's really shy. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox still has something to do with this class. She's beautiful, sexy and talented. But the material just let her shine. A pity <br /> <br /> Stephen Hopkins's excellent management at Dream Master Renny Harlin is nowhere. He tries out some imaginative shots at the end but Harlin and Craven have created such a tension in the previous films, but it was not found. <br /> <br /> The Dream Child is just another sight. The horror series is a type of movie that gives a bad name. <br /> <br /> The end of the horrific end. Now it's sad now. It's not a fun clown. Bad joke Welcome Freddy
