This movie is shy. Orlando, Florida seems to become a more prestigious film industry (like Vancouver's constant). The Brothers filmed in downtown Florida, and the short film was intensified (that is, Walking Across with the African Indie, and The Great Honey miniseries The Earth to The Moon). <br /> <br /> I want to be as good as possible. I think Orlando was the right place for The Brothers. He had the potential to give a 'Boy Band' craze spin. After all, both N'Sync and Backstreet Boys come in this field. However, The Brothers is probably short for the weak script. The two protagonists have almost no development (some of which could be the most curious actress, but some of them are a scriptwriter). <br /> <br /> It's also a joke selection. Many jokes are repetitive (it's fun for the first time, but it's a bit boring). Some of the 'Concert's' scenes are plagued (and many of these scenes also do not move the story in any way). <br /> <br /> I have had great expectations for that, but oh! depressing efforts I hope the best of the following features based on this short. However, I think the best part of John Figg's filmmaker is to go to different genres (fast). Comedy is not his powerful suit. But definitely, it is probably one of the most important filmmakers in the Orlando area (it's just shame that it's not bad at this time, or not so famous). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
