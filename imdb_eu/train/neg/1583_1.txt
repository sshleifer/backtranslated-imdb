I'm a fan of Stephen King. I loved Running Man So, I was very excited that someone made a movie. And when a local network showed the movie, I was in the sky. Everything is ready for fun for a night! <br /> <br /> Something was wrong when I saw the first indicator when someone dropped Arnold Schwarzenegger. I just could not believe that a man with a runnin 'shooting featured feature films could have a higher part, as described in the book. However, I was sure the movie was good. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents? <br /> <br /> Well, he did not. I found out soon, even though he had thrown out the only reason he was about to write a whole story again about the 'shootin' fight. Yes, the Arnold movie was a standard movie: the hero is wrong, the hero fixes problems with his muscles, and everyone falls away and the hero gets the girl. <br /> <br /> I was surprised. This is not everything that the book has said. I know that books can not be literally put on the screen, but this has not been linked to the book. Stephen King had to blame for any affiliation he made in filming, and prohibited The Running Man for this gross dirty film. I do not say often, but this film was BAD. If I did not see it at home, I rotted tomatoes on the screen. Again: bad. <br /> <br /> (Note that I'm using a 'somebody' a lot. I did this, I'm sure that many people are ashamed of working around it and I do not want to shame them by naming them here)
