My father is a fan of Columbo and I always liked the show. I always show the contempt for the viewer and I will tell him how bad it is. But he still watches. I think this as an American. But my senses have been agreed with the series when Spielberg directed it in the first section. Then, my father bought me this show, I could not really stand up for it. I went through the DVD collection and I came home from college to my home. My opinion about the whole series was not included, but I knew that Spielbergen was respected, as he was the most senior level director. And that's a little dribble until it reaches the big fish (get a penalty, HA, HA, like Spielberg. It's like a man before Jesus.) Or I think at least what I feel. He has little to say about Peter Falk, this is the beginning of the series and nobody knows where he should go, especially focusing on this section, the crime of the crime instead of Columbo's investigation, like many of the last episodes.
