You will never be serious, this is one of the most beautiful movies. It's a bit of time and the effects are tears, but it's really nice. There are giant crabs that attack a girl. Oh, and crabs sing Japanese. It's amazing. And the whole film is a wonderful ending for telegraphy. Predictably, but seeing the last fight you will enter the seat. Do not give this film an opportunity and love it. Susan George is spectacular and yes, it will appear naked. His daughter is not quite worthy, but they are attacked by giant crabs. They are the size of big cats. This is 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I give it to a 7th. Did I mention that crabs are giants?
