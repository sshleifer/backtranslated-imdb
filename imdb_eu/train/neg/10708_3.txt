This movie could be very good, some of the plot's science-fiction entrepreneurs HIDDEN. And Dolph always strives for his role. In any case, someone falls on the ball. <br /> <br /> Dolph plays a monk that regains a key that detains the Antichrist who travels to New York (!). 2000 years. He must fight against the lord, who is hiding from one body is a much leap spirit and goes to JASON hell. The server, of course, wants the key to leave the Antichrist. Throughout the journey, an archaeologist is an angry woman and, together, she and Dolphe are pursuing the minions bodies. <br /> <br /> If this sound is fun, forget it. The rhythm is very confusing and slow, with most of the direct behavior, and the battle scenes are poorly staged. Dolph goes through his role and releases some of the worst conversations in his career. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor finally takes the generous when it fights with an army of the monastery. The rest of the films are a snoozefest. <br /> <br /> Very bad, I really wanted this.
