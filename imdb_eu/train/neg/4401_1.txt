We went to the group with the group, when we participated in the version, we canceled it. It's definitely the worst film ever. It's not like worship movies I like. But it does not happen in the movie. Nobody feels any connection with the characters. endless times of conversation And the car. How do they carry a large tent and bedding and costumes every day in that car? It's two places! However, I have to say that the landscape is beautiful, but not in the film, the director should take pictures of the film in order to spend an unnecessary 80-hour period, but nothing happens. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it because it's a waste of your time
