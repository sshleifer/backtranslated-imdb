The reviews of this film were in moderation, but the expectations were high-spirits: a huge budget, a ton of popular faces, a pretty funny idea and the main actor who loves everyone. The final result is a disaster. Funny Alice Tremblay, full of fantasy, fails in every way with the entertainment of the audience (I did not hear a single laugh in the whole presentation), the template and the single-story characters without any spark, did not want a magic sign. 90-minute movies are sterile, good-natured and good-natured actresses who are good actors to get their professionalism, which probably could not seem like a great idea on paper. 'L'Odyssey d'Alice Tremblay' is a comic sketch collage, linked to very thin layer of good ideas. Avoid or get bored.
