First of all, I've been a member of some of the Titanic disaster and Titanic clubs to study for a while. I do not like the many prizes and awards that the film has won, but it is still a totally horrible film for me. Cameron was instrumental in making a "semi-documentary" documentary of "disaster", but unfortunately he chose to make a romantic poem face. Many people from all over the world have fallen down, as I believe, shows the tastes and sad feelings of film critics and viewers on these days. Anyone said that all the movies had to fall in love with hero and hero? Actually, real events are not romantic, but the Titanic disasters were definitely not one. I think they needed better scriptwriters and directors, with a semi-documentary view and little artistic license. I almost drowned in the last episode of 'deceased' lovers, with a pause of applause that they encountered with lost passengers and other crews. Is cinema intelligent? Ask yourself.
