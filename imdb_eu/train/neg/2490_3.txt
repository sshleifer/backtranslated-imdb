The TV shows can be as sad as the TV stations, when the watches that fall under an oak hulk on a boat ship are exhausted. The whole production feels cheap and bad, and it is not a "prestigious" star that helps, in order to give credible lines that can be done on a modest basis. <br /> <br /> Do not make any point when the media material rises above the material; it's clear that the watch is here. Bang out scenes, pick up salary check, go home and try to forget everything. <br /> <br /> It's not particularly bad writing or shooting; There is no real danger, it is completely anodyne and a very small number of very small sets has been filmed with a small amount. The rhythm is a bit strange; The shameless romantic undergrown begins only after the beginning of the main action, which is irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Maiden Voyage gets a couple of points to be able to score and to be a fun game "place Kiwi bit parters"; Most cast are Shortland Street or Xena: they are Warrior Princess graduates. The sadest thing in this production, surely, is a great fracture.
