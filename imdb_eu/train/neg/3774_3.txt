This movie is obsolete and lost the brand. Far from far away is the 89 Batman against trying with coppy. His name can not be sung by female singers, and we see why he killed his carriers. Note that this movie was killed at the box office, since nobody else watched the movie on TV. My uncle and dad were waiting for Batman, and the impression of the movie is like Cop Rock. Not worth 3/10 rental
