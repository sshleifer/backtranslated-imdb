Time is coveted. This movie is not. I have to learn to ignore the critics of small films such as Fargo and those unnecessary over time. <br /> <br /> It was packed with the theater and everyone continued with the same reaction: is it a film about criticism? What a shit part! <br /> <br /> This hook of this movie seeks a daughter with a moving upward daughter daughter and finds her white trash family. Get it <br /> <br /> The effect is excellent. <br /> <br /> Production (lighting, set, edition, sound) is above 60 minutes history. The characters are skinny and incomprehensible. These people could not know each other as the audience clearly understood me; The audience rumored to the film screen why the characters should say the following. <br /> <br /> I cleaned it with great table to have fun.
