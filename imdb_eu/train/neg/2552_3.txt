This is listed as a documentary, it is not shot, it's like a documentary, but I suspect I only run away with a vibrant camera and a bad shooting. This is a DVD in the UK released as "American Pie comedy style". It's not that either. <br /> <br /> Basically, in the spring break, a teenage group continues to travel to Mexico to travel cheaply and seek to find a virgin friend at last. Throw is a pair of dwarves, it's also the same quest, and some teens are trying to get some girls with a drunken story. <br /> <br /> Considering the 18 This score has very little nudity, and the sex scene is nearly zero, especially if I think there is a lot of reviews. <br /> <br /> Jackass's raw behavior is not like humor, this may be yours if you have brain cells. After leaving, I would probably avoid this!
