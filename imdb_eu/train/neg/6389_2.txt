I was waiting for about 25 years to watch this movie, thinking that it might be delirious, since there was no longer any quality of animation. He was one of the best criminals without films of all time, based on a beloved set of children's books and production of Disney Studios. What could it be wrong with that? As it turns out, almost everything. <br /> <br /> Well, not everything. Vincent Price Rattigan and Henry Mancini's heavy score are the passions for saving two films. The price is poorly pleasing, and Mancini is worth more. Otherwise, they bring a class to a dark-skinned project. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, while the rest of the movie is full of unwanted adult status, it still has a dull dull script, an original voiceless voice, wonderful songs and a no-brainer animation. On the Disney Saturday's mid-80s, television shows. <br /> <br /> This was very disappointing to me. It's amazing that this movie was a secret NIMH today. Asserting a part of this, an independent studio has produced something more creative in its trailer than GMD's endless time. The extra star that has more "horrible" goes with Price and Mancini. .
