I saw Australian opening this weekend, I saw the excellent work of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush, that Ned Kelly's final story would open to me. Unfortunately, although Heath Ledger's outstanding performance in the protagonist's protagonist, the plot was thin paper ... it does not inspire me to read "Our sun". Several other points were added, especially Edgerton's help, a Jordanian guideline (his talents were also confirmed at the Buffalo Soldiers exhibition), and the production design, which gave him a real sense of Australian hardwood bushes. At the beginning of the century Irish immigrants had to see. But I can not believe another chance to tell a true Australian story (or was it?) To be an empty story ... I suspect that I'm giving it to Hollywood and selling that image in the US. Well, at least Jordan and the producers were not asking to shave Universal ... <br /> <br /> I should have a great deal of "Kelly's secret story" by Peter Carey. Gang. "4/10
