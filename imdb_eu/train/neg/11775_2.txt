I would like to see "Kroko" I would like to leave Film for the first time in my life. I would not recommend watching this movie: flat characters - no development. The metaphor of the German problem of the German Crown continues to be a pure metaphor, without the capacity for positive involvement, despite the many possibilities of land planning. Unpowered actors, unplanned plots. I think the film has made an environmental survey, but it has not been successful: the camera has been shaken up as it was motivated. The images were low: the contrast, gray and dark - I am deliberate, but the components are not adding a solid impression of the social environment. The story, however, had a certain capability, could make a short story.
