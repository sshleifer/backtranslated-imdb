This movie is very bad, I wanted to move. Badly produced, laughter free. Why, in the name of the god, would it mean, in a way, a deception (and so much fun) movie? The sets are laughable, the effects are so bad, though they are not eager, and the performance is farcical. It's very mysterious why you think of seeing this landfill. The National Lampoon was made by Animal House, because people are still quite hilarious. Now, television films have fallen like this movie like ****.
