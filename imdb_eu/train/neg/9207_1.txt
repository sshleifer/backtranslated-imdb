This movie has been sold to a DVD on a Wal-Mart DVD, so I do not feel sorry for losing anything to watch this movie. He enjoyed the play of Tom Hanks (Robbie Wheeling). He was very young and was so brilliant that he had a performance, because of his horrible script. This story is about universities that play gambling and monsters, in a very realistic environment only. Robbie Wheeling has had past problems in this game playing in other colleges, and parents recommend that you leave the game alone and get good grades. Robbie is very close to a friend and romantically carries with her, and when she starts to play, she loves love and plays like a monk. There are scenes of films that are staged on the first shopping mall in the world as well as on the floor of the observation and on the roof. It is quite sad that this piece of the film died for evil worldwide. This is not a very good movie, except Tom Hanks, which exceeds the level of entertainment of the movie.
