I wanted to see it for two reasons. One was the remake of High Sierra Bogart, two, Bogart's part played by Jack Palance, who had some wonderful roles with theatrical plays, like The Big Knife. <br /> <br /> But now I wonder. why they decided to shoot this remake. The film continues with the same plot as Hig Sierra; Only here, the actors are not minded, the director loses his thoughts and who knows what the producer thought. Jack Palance is getting bored by Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters asks himself what he does. I do not even want to compare Ida Lupin to the same routine. And, of course, they had to use the dog story again! Certainly, ideas could be different. Perhaps the color that the High Sierra shot to see the same position is nice, but it certainly does not add quality to the movie. <br /> <br /> If you missed the loss of time before High Sierra. Otherwise, why not watch a pseudo-black movie. As for me, I prefer to see him die before ...
