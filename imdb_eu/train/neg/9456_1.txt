The sun was not bright, it was very wet to play. So I went to the movies, this cold, cold and damp day. <br /> <br /> <br /> "The cat's hat" was the name of the film. , and when it was over, my stomach was sick. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers played Cat, his humor was not there, and children did not have to watch it, humor was not loved. <br /> </ p> <p> The film was like drinking milk like milk, so it's fun to be fun, however, as filmmakers did not know how. <br /> <br /> This film, after all, is atrocious. The performance was bad, the plot was too much bent, and humor was very surprising. <br /> <br /> Conrad begins with Sally, breaking the rules and a future sheriff. When Mum has to go to work, she protects Mrs. Kwan. One of the fun part of the movie may be Mrs. When Kwan watched a court in Taiwan, `the C-SPAN. Soon it falls asleep and here comes the Cat. <br /> <br /> The movie starts outside the control. Cats tried to have fun for the kids. It's Thing 1 and Thing 2, which suddenly starts trashing the house. She improvises TV ads and accidentally cut her tail. When the cat is full Carmen Miranda, it's not fun. Maybe it's like her funny costume hippie activist. And there is a fish that tries to warn children about the cat. <br /> <br /> Very badly, he did not warn us that this film was as funny as milk, or cut off your tail. <br /> </ p> <p> Soon, kids will be away for a family dog ​​looking for a cane. If the box is not locked soon, his house will be the Cat's universe. Here it gets more interesting, but it's not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a great theater. Mike Meyers portrays his portrait of Pure Austin Powers with Cat, "Tell you, dirty" and represent her life as a female for her whole life. Spencer Breslin is a big problem with Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is just as nice as Sally, but they're just not enough to save John A Ritter from waiting for that awful Aortic Dissection (waiting for an accident to happen). Alec Baldwin likes Lawrence Quinn's smooth and hairy, trying to get Mom's mother a kid who is Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes, Mr. Humberfloob, is the main mother, and it's also a fish voice. The last three are also blurry. <br /> <br /> In general, when I was a parent, I did not have the mood that my children would take, so much more. Save $ 7.00 and watch something else. As Seuss himself said, <br /> <br /> it's fun to have fun, but how you should know it. Really, Universal, stop! Theodore is already turning to his grave. <br /> <br /> As my mother always says, "Curiousity has killed the cat." - Hat In The Cat * *****
