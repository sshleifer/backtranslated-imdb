The night I watched over the night watching. About things that can be said about this horrible movie, film schools can use them to show off how to make a movie. There's no proper character development, wait, I'm not sure it's a character. Configurations were hokey and inane, and split screens were too much wasted because sometimes they can not even synchronize with a substitute shot. I would give a score of zero or minus. Unfortunately, it's not worth the time to laughter. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is just a dull example of wasting money, and now I lose my time thinking about thinking.
