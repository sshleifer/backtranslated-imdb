An archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) accidentally stumbles on the 40-meter-old mummy, underground well-preserved in the Nevada desert. They have decided to keep this secret and call the Jewish translator to find out his story. Mummies, as explained at the beginning, are the son of the fallen angel and there is a huge number of "apparently existent days". To save his son as a result of a terrible flood to kill him, he mutilates his son, burying him with some servants for centuries, he will then wake up. In our present, fallen angels continue to walk on the ground and hope that a mum will revive and a ritual will happen. Most of the movies are slow, a lot of biblical dirty and a lot struggling. Mummy is decent, but it's not enough. That should be more, but it has been dragged a lot ... so. Do not worry
