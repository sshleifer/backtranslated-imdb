non-sentimental love, drama in the spotless (or theatrical) themes ... This movie is all and fails in all matters, as if it were not trying. Or the director / editor / scriptwriter does not really try. Actors are capable - they need better help. <br /> <br /> George Delarue's score is an item that fails.

This editor is covered with music without conversation and movement. The scene of love makes it particularly difficult for this aspect: the insult for innovative actors. <br /> <br /> There is another element of work fiction: location photography.
