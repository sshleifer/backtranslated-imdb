The movie was a mess. The worst edition I've ever seen. Almost at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to the commercial and the filmmaker added a second black screen to fulfill the dream of writers. <br /> <br /> When money was being edited, there was not something bright. A good idea, a compelling spark. But somewhere went wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is about an almost psychic priest trying to solve a murder. It is difficult to harden the first as a priest Richard priest. The part does not call and become a good priest. The second problem is that Dennis Hopper is crazy. He always plays mad madly. Very rumored <br /> <br /> Oh, it was a thought that I had to edit and that all the great connection was possible (Grieco) to try to add a sense of confusion that was happening. And when they proved it was invented, the credits came back. Not a good sign for all movies. <br /> <br />
