Unfortunately, this 54 film was a pathetic essay of Studio 54's real story. The only thing that was good about the image was 'Mike Myers', to be seen. 'Neve Cambpell', although his role was small, was unfortunately bad. In that sense, the movie actors lacked a good performance, except one, and becoming a true story to get a good screenplay was a desperate disappointment.
