What's up with this movie? Lots of things a lot The edition tries hard to make it look good, and it only raises the viewer with a strong headache. Earth is confused and, of course, it has been extended since the beginning of the short story. The good story on Earth makes land less than ten minutes, which is only a long stretch for a longer film. We all know what happens when things go, right? Exactly. They get less money. In the end, the plot is so thinner, if you have not lost it, if you do not pay attention, it is difficult to see this movie. The play is not a bit spectacular. The character is badly written and sad, without interest. One of the worst things that happened with this film, which is why the head of the score / soundtrack did not know what the movie was or what it was supposed to do (I'm not guilty of it, I could not). just imagine it. As a result, half of the movie music is not a good scene. Also, what was it all about sex with all the sexist cloths of the Church Dushku and the main character? Of course, when men were attracted to young people, it was done so well. And does the first scene have anything to do with cinemas? Anyone who thinks the level? Any Two unloving boys had nothing to do with the movies, so they stayed there for some scenes of harassment. Without a doubt, anyone would like to think that an Hollywood-inspired, interesting idea is so insoluble and horrible. But I digress it. I recommend that you have little attention to teenage girls about a horror thriller, because they are some sex and gore (even though this may be true). 1/10
