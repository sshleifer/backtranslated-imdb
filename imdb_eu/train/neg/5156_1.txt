"Laughter is a state of mind," I said, and I commented on Barry Levinson. What did he think of "Toys"? When he saw the storms, he saw fantasy fun and fun? If so, then I'm working on another plane. This is suggestive, production design is 90% of this thing (and cartoon colors are also depressing). Robin Williams and (especially) Joan Cusack are humiliated as a brother and sister toy mogul, when factory heirs surround their father's deaths. There's nothing remotely fun (satirical or stubborn) here. In fact, it's one of the worst movie ever ever made. STARS NO ****
