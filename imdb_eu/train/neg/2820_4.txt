I do not know much about Tobe Hooper, or why he takes the name in the title, but it might not have been a problem. As another commentator says, there is not enough horror or heroic to bring two fans of the genre. Land is not consistent; Sade sequences are free and most of the plays are so. Englund made the weakest material the best, and Zoe Trilling has a very big bottom, but it's not enough to take this movie. This is a tape. Rating: F
