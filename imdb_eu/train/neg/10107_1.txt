Last weekend, I bought this "zombie movie" from the bargain and I saw that it would be a budget version of "Earth's death" with some friends. <br /> <br /> I was a boy. <br /> <br /> It seems that they have spent a large part of the quote on a very misleading budget for fans of the genres of the area. <br /> <br /> Until we saw it. Point out where zombie chicks live in the middle of a business cell that is not in contact with some yuppies that enter the car. The guy really speaks before a girl dies; When I start driving the car, I can not interrupt my credibility. <br /> <br /> Some people really think "so bad, it's good" this movie, they are liars. I did not finish the movie, but I mentioned one of the other reviews that have somehow become police at the end of the movie, and that's why I'm glad I did not see it all the way. <br /> <br /> This is worse than "Zombies". DO NOT EAT!
