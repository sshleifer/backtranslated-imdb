The title is something like a transformation of the wife (reasons, for loss of it). In any case, the film was not for television, it should be such a small budget, written, underestimated, and a definitive 70-year-old discotheque. No one was pleasant and could be careless about what happens to anyone. Unforgettable evinements except bad and bad performances.
