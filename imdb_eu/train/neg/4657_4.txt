Remakes (and follow-ups) have been a part of the basic Cinema media since the beginning. However, it can be successful or dangerous. If you build the original and build on it and update current keystrokes, you can succeed. Please note that films such as THIEF OF BAGDAD (1924/40) or KING KONG (1933/2005) have achieved their attempts. Some others like KING KONG (1976) fail, sadly. <br /> <br /> REGISTRATION (1945) is a template for this movie. It's just as perfect as it is, and we value the IMDb ********** Ten. The story is simple, Love, suddenly finds himself innocent. Why have two (2) people in the wrong time taken part? These represent TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON in a convincing and sensitive way. They are also not strategic stars, but quality actors of the characters. Movie to watch details. <br /> <br /> Now what was wrong? T.V. a movie, the scene of actors called RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN, called the At least ****** Six. Both actors appear to be disinterested, punching time clocks and getting rid of checks. They are not involved with their characters or together. You do not believe that when they are in love or eventually they are separated, one of them is a great loss. It should not be that and that is why it fails with its intention. Sometimes things are just better.
