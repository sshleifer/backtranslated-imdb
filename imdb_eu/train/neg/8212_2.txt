I have read all the comments on this film. I am a great Dalai Lama <br /> <br />. So <br /> <br /> I read this book. The film is a fictional and ugly fiction over truth. I do not criticize <br /> <br /> to change minor details or dramatic events; It is <br /> <br /> not a documentary. But the script influences the reaction, <br /> <br /> changes realities and characters. Young Harras and Dalai Lama change the real relationships. <br /> <br /> A Tibetan woman (who advocates a Tibetan culture demenge) will give her the music box at Harrar <br /> <br /> change the heart, everything about this film is false - <br / > <br /> except for stunning photography. I understand Potala <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Making a smuggling of Tibetan mansion. However, <br /> <br /> changing the real story about two-person relationship <br /> <br /> one of them is very important for this world <br /> <br> <br> <br> movie star is sad
