I rarely comment on films, but I have read other comments and I can not believe that people cheer on this zealous cell. I know that there are several people with their own agenda, but we take merit; misguided, poorly shot, and the story that the director felt was moving forward. I will not focus on the sexual aspect of the movie because little children are involved; Of course, the film makers knew what they wanted and what the audience wanted. I can say that the film is horrible, that the content is bad and offensive, production is amateurs and I am glad that such a law can not be legally today
