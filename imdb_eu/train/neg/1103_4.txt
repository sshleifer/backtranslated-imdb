As a young black / latin woman, I always look for films that represent people's experiences and lives. Of course, when I saw this movie in the video store, I thought I would enjoy it; unfortunately I did not. Although the issues presented in the film are of interest and relevance, the story has just been fully developed. The movie has continued to drag and many of the characters on the screen go a long way in helping the general movie. If the director made a better job of joining the scene, maybe I'd like it more. Honestly, I'd recommend a movie like "Raising Victor" any day. I was just very impressed.
