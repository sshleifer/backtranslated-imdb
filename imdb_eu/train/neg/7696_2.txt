Yes, stupidity! I just looked and I still have a bad taste in my mouth. Too many colors, I suppose a story "plus" excessive unnecessary stupid characters (I suppose they wanted to get comic relief, but I want to cry) ... too much. Shame must ruin the divine stories of "Arabian Nights". Babysitter, naive (both wrong) and plenty of magic breaks, I do not think that it can hold up to five children over ten minutes. The princess is beautiful, but it does not have to be, the actor does not know how to perform a role. The rest cast is even worse ... our "bad" is really bad. A shame is not a good guy. The only clear light of this darkness, of course, is David Carradine, unfortunately heavily goes down that level, but at least his actor / "fighter" abilities are above. I still feel it when I see something like that, but I'm glad I can see something to see something, so thank you David. Only, for him alone, I give this star to this star ... I would give it to him more, but the final score would be filmed in the whole movie. The rest is so bad, maybe I'd like it anyway, but there's no lover of May 1 here, and I think that would be too much.
