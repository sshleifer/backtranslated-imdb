In my book "Basic Instinct" was the perfect movie. Stone, Douglas and all the supporting actors played a great role in the minimal role. He had a wonderful picture, music and noirest noir script ever. Adding everything as good as a movie! <br /> <br /> This sequence is the opposite, it can not be worse, a bad performance and a manual scheme, combined with a completely inept. direction, that is, really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that keeps the concentrate is that the next scene is a relatively short wait for the original copy. The copies are so bad that they make fun of and I made a lot of laughter, like the demolition of a shiny monument. The only good thing about this horrible misfortune is part of the BI1 Jerry Goldsmith score. Michael Caton-Jones and half of the screenwriter also interviewed the scene "No Room in the Burning Log" dialog box and he sends his lawyer (now a lawyer). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I've seen this awesome movie that has never been done! It damages the original, it's so bad. The only convenient value is to think of cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure that Stone can buy the best surgeon for money), but obviously it does not recover the original perfection. And the human body is also applied to cinema. There should be a law: never make a sequel to the perfect movies!
