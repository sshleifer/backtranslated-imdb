This movie was an important letdown. In this movie, the level of tireless cruelty and violence was very disturbing. Some scenes were really wasted and ugly. The main characters did not notice or sympathize. The main character was terribly thin. the illness / atmosphere atmosphere was dedicated to very theater theater. He can learn little or nothing about the Spanish Civil War in the film. Fortunately, I have been in Spain and I realize that this is not realistic! In addition, the use of the same-sex attraction as a "horrible" horror was also very offensive and improperly handled, since DVDs are packed and advertised to attract gay audiences. The actors seemed uncomfortable in the roles, as if they tried to get away from it, I think that if you can see how kids and pets brutally kill you, this movie is particularly appealing to you.
