Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze is a horrible movie. Badly written, excessive, and empty. Having said that ... really a movie is nice at some levels. This movie requires a group of cheap beers. A movie like "The Martian conquest of Santa Claus" or "Yor, a future hunter" ... it's so bad that it's pretty good. You have the right people to watch this movie. Campy da. It's fun Sousa has a theme. If you're looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. 3/10. <br /> <br /> BTW, the rumors I've heard that some studies are studying the possibility of a remake ...
