This movie is not worth the time or money spent. Klixetan and it does not make any sense of a plot! I can not believe so many people have given this wonderful movie 10. My intention is that they are the creators of the movie creator. <br /> <br /> If I could give this movie a zero, I would. This bad movie does not support it. <br /> <br /> I really saw the only reason I saw myself going along with a friend. Unfortunately, I started not having much hope in this movie, but I have still changed. Take my words, do not miss out on your $ 8 trash. The only entertainment I got out of the film was named director. Absolutely not very discouraged!
