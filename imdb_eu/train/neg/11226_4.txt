I was a little ducky ANGEL. The film has a "direct" tribute to the highest ever pin-up, but the film itself is hardly so "so content". I can not see the motivation of this movie or the "point", since there is little biographical information given in the narration - so those who do not know much about Bettie know much about DARK. ANGEL ... <br /> <br /> The film has a chronicle of Bettie's career over recent years in bondage modeling. The entire film is almost complete by Bettie's "re-casting" of some snapshots and snapshots. In these fifty years, the movies are 75% and Bettie does not make almost any personality. The film touches upon a brief decision of its short duration and the decision to turn it into a "business" afterwards, but this is much brighter to show long and drawn back scenes. ... <br /> <br /> DARK ANGEL is not a horrible movie. There is no substance. The other problem is that the actress that plays Bettie resembles the more distant shots: it's close. Another thing that was annoyed me is that despite Bettie's many topless make-up shoots - the short film shot at a zoo was a short segment in the final credits. The film itself is a small budget, of course, but what limits it and what it does not limit, so I'm not myself. The cast is quite woody and can not be remembered at all. For me, it was the most memorable thing about me as the whole film, when it was discovered in the final credits, the real name of Irving Klaw is the actor Dukey Flyswatter. Without a joke - check out the cast list. I can not say this too I recommend you have a true Bettiefile integral and you have everything that has to do with it. And if you are bad, you must seek treatment ... 4/10
