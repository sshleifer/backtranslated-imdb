A family enters an old Japanese house. But the catch is awful (BOO !!!). Aw, does not mean to jump. It's just a review. Fix it down Ah, now, in any case, an old samurai dies to his wife and his lover to die. Naturally the 3 minute scene is between 7 or 8. Frightening play Awesome story But how are you asking? Well, it was a very bad thing to mix my brain and spill through my nose with a dash of thought. It was very bad when it happened on the screen of Doug McClure, I prayed for the flashbacks of Small Wonder (Yes, I know that Doug was "out of this world" and not "surprising", but it's so much, and the "wonder" theme is better I like it) There are so good movies that are so bad. This is not one of them <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Beyond Showtime <br /> <br /> My Rating: F- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Mako Hattori gets topless by Susan George It gets 2 love scenes (naked, topless) <br /> <br />
