What does "executive producers" do? If I remember, it's a person who has received financial aid to complete the movie. Sean Connery will see you in a number of movies as an executive producer of film because she was an important player who made money from Connery. Unfortunately, it should be underlined that the film "has been the main protagonist of Sean Connery because it has only been the main player of Hollywood since it has been able to raise money," when it comes to reading the credits, the executive producer and the star. A movie and the same movie itself is just a star of a story / script that is far from the scratch. <br /> <br /> PROTOCOL is a descendant of a Sunny Davis series, a cocktail server from a bimboes kooky server. He keeps a famous visitor and gets a high diplomat as a reward. It may well be that way forward, Davis (having trouble joining the two sentences with problems) finds more bizarre situations and less when PROTOCOL Goldie says stars. I tell you who is also the film producer executive to understand what the story / script is not scratch up to?
