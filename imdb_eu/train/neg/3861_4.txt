I'm not the biggest fan of rom / com at the best times. Some have been pretty good (looking for a Dream Insomniac), but this is just the same, but less. <br /> <br /> When it's 100 minutes, I expect more than 1 out of 1 laugh over 1. The only thing that makes you laugh in the real world is that when strangers and friends are instinctively helping the nature of their friends. <br /> <br /> It's all about avoiding what you can say. I enter at least 10 other movies that I deserve that I visit $$ <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (And only I'm a big fan of Lee)
