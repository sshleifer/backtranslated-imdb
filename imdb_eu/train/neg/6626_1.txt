I watched the movie and I pulled it away because the movie is stupid and boring. I thought that ram gopal varma would justify his work, but unfortunately he failed and the entire film was ruined and "sholay" was damaged. cast and crew was bad. While the whole theater was sleeping, the movie fled to the crowd. Amithab Bachan's performance is a bad thing, I thought the movie would be the biggest hit of the year, but the movie will be the biggest failure of the year, surely. no one did justice to his work, including Ajay Devagan. This film does not deserve any viewer. This movie is going to be a flop. <br /> <br /> "USING THE LAST GENREF CINEMA"
