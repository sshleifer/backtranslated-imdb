The anticipated sequel's premise was very good and I expected a lot after the horrible success of the version. <br /> <br /> Truly sad, this movie is very absurd and inept. The situations are dumb and out of reason and the performance is really huge. <br /> <br /> This time there is no similar version version or violin. Also, Gore is not that abundant and when it happens it's really bad. <br /> <br /> Violence is minimal and it is shameful that there is a great deal of reason for thinking that there is a great deal of violence. I mean, there is a SWAT team that hunts a family of extreme cannabis. Are you sure something different! When I saw the movies I wanted to get my money back. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a clear example that evokes this film and, in every aspect, shows a good quality. <br /> <br /> A mix that released fans like me. That is why the sequence is never welcomed; At least this movie is not so original as it continues in 1985.
