I'm just a second video for a video clip / DVD. <br /> <br /> I gave him the question he had just started with the first film, though it was superficial, shaky and stupid ... and cheerless, disturbed and dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Does anyone think that someone who is guided by a curious ninth-class boy like the special descendants of the school thinks ... terribly and sadly, with a lively narration, only poetry in the middle of adolescence ... and some songs, and ... Not really, the poor would consider the child's suffering ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Enough, especially when it became iron. A serious and insulting clock. And did I mention singing? <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I'm definitely feeling the least forced. I do not recommend it to anyone.
