Believe me, I liked the "Spirit". When the foolish notes of the people, once again, saw the old and hand-made cartoons, last-minute pencil drawings were published twenty years ago, and they also saw even more stupid comments. how old the computers got old, they got my blood ... but then I had to suffer the most painful radio program I had to endure in the "first ten minutes" of the blood. <br /> <br /> Character designs are general, animation (partly due) are only competent, in general, art direction, so completely boring, you wonder how it will happen (we know, "Prince of the Prince Egypt "and" El-Dorado on the way ", that there are talented artists of Dreamworks, and the sophisticated use of CGI is not a case in every case. (Why do they worry?) It's not the only thing to watch, cartoon animation, which is irreparable. <br /> <br /> But it becomes worse ... <br /> <br /> Horses can not speak, but much more anthropomorphic and more convincing are the deer in "Bambi," and it seems to somehow He can speak of horses. He gives himself a preface to the same spirit (it is considered as the actor of the 21st century in a commercial establishment in California), and since then, in his constant narrative, a totally foreigner, he hardly dares to sound. bye He tells us about what we did not know, or the artwork, even if it is inadequate, indicates a feeling that can not be displayed twice. Prologue, by the way: (then) Knowledge of the knowledge we know Spirit; (b) Expresses ideas that do not have the power to express spirits, although he can speak; (c) includes the garbage of the new age: "This story may not be true, but I remember that"; and (d) will give eleven children (I will point out the production, I think it's six years old) that originates from North America with horses, that is to say, the ancestor of domestic horses, zebras. and so on. It originated in North America - but all the continental horse species were gone before the first humans arrived, and Spirit Group Mustangs (supposedly "buffalo here") come from European horses. . <br /> <br /> Preach me angry. <br /> <br /> <br /> When the Spirit speaks, Bryan Adams sings as usual, as if it had an infectious throat. he sings or even sings, what he sings: the balloon of the narrative maudlin, much less, if possible, speaks more like those who help and speak more than Speaking of Spirits (though I was very careful and probably could not distinguish them from being able zen). If Bryan Adams and the hypocrites had only one minute or two to be SHUT UP, the movie could take its true form: half-headed and derivative, but rather bad-looking.
