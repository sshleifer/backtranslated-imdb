Even worse, the series is a serious downturn. The first two seasons were acceptable and we've seen some incredible movies that we've seen since then. Robert Englund's Freddy gives another excellent performance, but the rest of casts can not play. The story is Alice, after surviving in the previous part of the Nightmare series, he finds Freddy Krueger's deadly dream. This time, the murderer kills Alicia's intelligent child's intelligence. His intention is "born again" in the real world. Freddy's only paralyzing person is his mother dead, but is the issue to release his daughter to save his son? Check out the first three, miss the next three then watch the last.
