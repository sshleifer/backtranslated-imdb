There is not a film from the community of the Afro-Caribbean community in the UK's urban life, the last example I can remember in 1980 was the Babylonian path. So, when I heard a great deal of hope. Bullet Boy, a movie that has been shot as a British version of La Haine! Well, La Haine is not! I agree that dialogue and the use of the environment have given the film a serious loss in other British films, but my concern is that this film is predicted to end with sadness. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the incident, the black problem is worsening about black violence in London, but I am worried that the film director currently uses the type of questionnaire that is the same as those that are harmful to the plot. Saul Dibb was a great opportunity for everyone to make a movie that would be entertaining and inspiring, but unfortunately he had missed and created a film, a young black man who only reinforces the only future in London according to violence and tragedy.
