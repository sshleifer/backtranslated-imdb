I also like Dafoe as an actor but I was wasting a few hours of my life watching this movie, but I still do not think I could see it as a whole. Was there a movie movie ?, and at the end, well, I'm glad I never paid for a movie to see this senseless piece of pathetic sense! <br /> <br /> I am not sure about the facts but did Dafoe marry a horrifying actress in this movie in reality, is it an effort to start her career? If he was afraid he failed. <br /> <br /> I publish this film, with the hope that it can actually be seen by someone watching this film, even though a person comments and decides on my comments, I can see the dry paint that I would prefer. advice ...
