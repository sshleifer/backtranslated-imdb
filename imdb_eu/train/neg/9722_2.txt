I really liked this movie ... especially for the main characters! Both are immature, selfish and selfish. They all hurt playing their stupid games. The visual effects were good, but what good are there if there is a story or interesting story that connects to you? Should I be happy that these two psycho-men eventually end their love for each other? <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I thought that "I think it's coming from France # 1" ........ <br /> <br /> * spoiler *> <br /> Regarding the end: USEFUL! They deserve each other! <br /> <br />
