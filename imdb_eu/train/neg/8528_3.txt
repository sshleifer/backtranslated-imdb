The poster on the poster is: "He was 6 years old at birth ... He travels 34 years." Ami is an Israeli-born US diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophin Disease. At the age of 34, at the age of 22, he was not well attended to take care of the doctor, who decided to go to the United States for the 6-year-old doctor. The doctor wanted to show that he was still alive and weighs 39 kilos. Why? Your intention is as good as mine, even if you watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, to move everything that you can do to make a living, the left finger is a pointer, but why is it so much anger for the doctor? Has the disease diagnosed 34 years ago? His doctor told his mother about the history of the doctor, his illness is not long lived. What was it for at the door of old doctors? Why is looking for an old doctor in the United States for a trip to his life? There are many things that can be of interest in Ami's life: how can I get these animations moving with one finger? How can one go during the daily life while it depends on others? How did your doctor's prediction live? How does it manage emotionally as other people look at a strange creature? The movie did not tell us. Instead, the filmmaker got a van and set a trip to make Ami appear at the door of his doctor's elders, to show himself still alive. I thought it was a joke.
