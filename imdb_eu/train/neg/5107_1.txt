It's for this show that is more unusual than the US version. An interested party will get a new kitchen or bedroom and bathroom and he is surprisedly grateful for what they did. The American version of this exhibition is all about reality TV. All home improvements instead of making improvements or making home improvements, the entire house is reconstructed. I do not know if this show is a bad or bad enough welfare system in the US. The attitude of the products that are happening is quite common, especially Sears, and this is not required. Apart from making a family a family in a conflictive area, it would be much better to help the community, spend hundreds of thousands of dollars at home, build something for the community ... perhaps, places that can be borrowed and returned by electrical tools and brikolinos along with construction materials, are beneficial to everyone If they want to. By giving one person, they can have a great resentment among the local communities that live in the same house.
