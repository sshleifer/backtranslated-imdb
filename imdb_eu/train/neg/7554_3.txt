I've never seen 1973, yet still older versions. I'm a fan of Nicholas Cage (by the way, as usual). This movie probably took five minutes to cover the whole plot (when you were having a party at dinner), you can see if you can not finish this flower for the first thirty minutes. probably found this entertaining movie. That is, later, Hollywood seems to have pierced with fears / mysteries / thriller, enough credit for the viewer and not able to write a fresh, intelligent and horrible script, which distributes awesome music. and throw out two little things to jump out and then print the latest local theater. At least, he did not have camera on his hand syndrome.
