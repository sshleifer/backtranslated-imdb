Okay well John Carpenter's "Masters of Horror" was just as good as the 1st season, the opposite. Without a doubt, he proved that a horror master still is "Burning Cigar", but "Pro-Life" is the worst thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is a very stupid, totally tedious and tense atmosphere and surpasses it, although it lasts less than an hour. The script is nonsense, the characters are angry and inadequate and the conclusion is beyond the absurdity. <br /> <br /> And really a DVD (one of them bought for me) for pugs; Have you seen how Carpenter describes movies? He is really proud and speaks for a long time as the best work and praises the script. And the follow-up of the comments, when he came to the final surgery, clearly emphasized, said that he had not left the essential feeling to rectify the mistake and left him. I'm afraid the old master has lost everything. I really hope that I will be wrong. <br /> <br /> I want to leave a positive note and say that the effects of the beast are awful. Speaking technically, this film is a superior image with lighting schemes and additional effects.
