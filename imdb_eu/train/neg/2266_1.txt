As a toilet paper, ringmaster, Jerry Springer, born to make unnecessary filming films to be recycled as a toilet paper, lost my trust in film art. First, it was done. Second, they saw people. Third, some have never voted for the best movie ever seen. As a monkey can make a movie, 100 percent make sure it's millions better. Most movie filmmakers have their own moments (though Godzilla has some special effects) when this movie was nauseated by the theater. The only thing that could be worse than this would be Jerry Springer's star. If I want to see an hour and a half shut up, I'll take it in a dump. If this film is not completely despised, I will pity children of your children and children. However, unlike Springer's beliefs, I clearly do not arrest any sex offenders.
