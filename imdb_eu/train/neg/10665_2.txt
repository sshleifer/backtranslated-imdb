I started moving forward in about three minutes, just stopping at nakedness (why is it always that bad films are good for women?). I finished in ten minutes and was trying to get my money back from the rental store. People who write their films will be punished by MPAA. Come on the writers - the bad guys are always in the car with the bonus control turned on with a remote bomb! That's the way the Ottoman Empire has been made! In order to add an insult to the injury, the "turn" was so formulative that it could come from any action written over the last 25 years. Burt Reynolds was well, but he should focus on real movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a waste of time - Escape! Run away!
