When I'm worried, the silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst ever version. In this version there is no tenderness, no love or spirituality; For everything is nonsense, German and malicious. They reminded me of the Nazis in love; Who cares? <br /> <br /> This silent version of von Stroheim is not a loyal adaptation of the original story. In this regard, John Gilbert and his raw relative, the prince, believes that the big American giant, Mae Murray, who strikes this perplexing actress with modern permissive hairstyles and has thrown me back to an unknown feminist. I like my dreams clear and beautiful, slow down construction; This is not hard and sadistic. And you are going to squeeze those bees, remove them, girl! <br /> <br /> Go to the show live show If you want to be a real idea of ​​Franz's original opulent opera Lehár. If not, wait for TCM to show Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier's sound version. It's much better.
