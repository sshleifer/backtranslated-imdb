Simply, Robert Osborne can be said to be obliged to delight in the TCM library's most attractive films, that is to say, the "virtue" of this film "karmena", when I saw it on cable television. When an old movie on the IMDb gets a classic status, because the classmate's amateur amateur love showcased, I thought it was a fairer review of this movie. <br /> <br /> This is not about your father's' Buy corner. For all my cushions for commercial messages, it still suggests replicating in every imaginable way. For those who have seen the original, the errors will be more obvious. <br /> <br /> Which one remembers one of the toughest learners' minds (humor 'slapstick sad essay'), that is. The film works on the wrong foot and never returns. It is only classified in the lowest sense of the term "musical". He releases instant music numbers, and then Judy sings "I Do not Care", charging around her arms as in a kidnapping. The Christmas song that sings at the store is probably one of its best numbers here. Miss Garland was a great music band, but here it seems incredibly confusing. Role originally had to meet June by Allyson and Judy was unable to meet the oldest parts of Margaret Sullavan. Van Johnson also makes Jimmy Stewart's second best performance. Managers are not getting Stewart / Sullavan or Hanks / Ryan's chemistry. <br /> <br /> Notes (some) are a movie that is familiar, but not music. In fact, it is unclear why the original worked, and he still feels the need to add other interesting interests to Van Johnson's character, which makes things unnecessarily difficult. The reproduction of the original replacement of the infidelity sub-jot is an unbeatable plot of land. It's almost scary to see and feel that maybe one of Three's Company has been a DeLorean and someone with a condenser flow. Keaton is just an excuse for a pratfall. An absolutely romantic scene between high resolution is wrong. After watching two movies, you will understand why they called "Lubitsch Touch" and NOT "Robert Z. Leonard Touch". <br /> <br /> Avoid and reload the original movie or Judy Garland. If you're an iconic movie before, once you enjoy yourself enjoying a huge star on the ground.
