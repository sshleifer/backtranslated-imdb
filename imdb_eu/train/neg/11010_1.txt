This movie is not worth it. Time was wasted. It was a movie and money loss. It was not offensive, but everything was provocative and annoying. My spoiler is what everyone should read. The front is full nudity and tongue is nasty. But not only that, there is no plot line, an actress is horrible, the accent is horrible, the actors are little time and I also have to watch the movie SILVER! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rented was Brian van Holt (who only got fifteen in the second half). I think that in the part of the editors and editors it might be a mistake, but two or three times the same segments were repeated, adding a new sentence. <br /> <br /> A similar movie to this is Eraser Head, maybe there is an alarming film that exists. There is no line line, and it's not fun. It's not fun to be. DO NOT USE OPERATING.
