Scary Movie 3 is not as fun as its predecessors, but still has fun moments. When the journalist Cindy Campbell begins the tour, she wants to find a tough news in the middle of television. Soon it discovers a threat of global attack on invaders, killer videos, crop circles and many more internal threats. In the face of conspiracies of massive proportions, and people who are very strange, Cindy will fight again to bring evil into the world. Plots are not the issue here, because the former were two less plots. This time, signals, rings, re-uploads and 8 miles and many others do not mention it as before. The first one I ever saw was one of the funniest movies. The second one was not good, but quite funny. The third one is nice, but nothing special. Let's say I do not care to see it anymore, but I probably do not want to see it again. The jokes are dubbed and they are fun for Charlie Sheen. Lame is usually worried about Anthony Anderson. He has no doubt why he drew the picture. Anna Faris has a fun show and, besides, she disdaines it. Simon Rex showed some potentials, because it was not so bad. The Regina Room is also a return to Brenda and it's pretty fun. The rest cast were almost a bunch of cameos. Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson were probably the most entertaining scene from all the songs. In the opening sequence called The Ring, and this scene thinks it's one of the most beautiful movies. Denise Richards, Queen Latifah, Camryn Manheim and many more cameos. Directed by David Zucker, this is not an airplane, but not another Boss daughter. It is absurd to study a straight comedy that is the main thing that people want to know is fun. As I said before, if you liked it, you probably would not like it much. In the end, I found a bit of disappointment because it alleviated the degree of PG-13, but it still could be enjoyed. Rating 6.3 / 10
