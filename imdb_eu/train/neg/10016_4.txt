"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of several films about teens who came across supernatural in the 1950s. In this case, teens can not pay and sign up for their performance. Without going anywhere else, they decide on the apparently homely house. As you may have guessed, when you arrive, there are some weird things. Finally, there is a tour. <br /> <br /> You have not seen this movie in other films, but it's nice entertainment. My favorite character was Parrot lacking. Well, let's go write again: a character did not speak at a Quentin Tarantino film, but said a bird did not expect things. Hokum of the movie, but harmless.
