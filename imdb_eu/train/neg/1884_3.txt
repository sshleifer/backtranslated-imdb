A fragmented movie about a pair of Austrian movie theaters. This type of movie was made more often and, above all, better. Stories have nothing to do with each other, in addition to the last pathetic: "people are cruel". Ugly flesh, unpleasant people and a movie that is too long ... Ultra-realistic? Almost not ... boring? In fact. This lovely Franzisca Weiss can not save this too! 3/10
