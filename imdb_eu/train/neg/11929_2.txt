I saw "Eye" before seeing this. I really liked "Eye", one of the best films of Asian horror film. So I got "Bangkok there", because it was the same director and here it was very popular. But the man, his despair ... "Bangkok there" are three stories of love, revenge, ghosts, etc., which are neither terrifying nor disturbing (as it was "Eye") ... nothing. I can not even fill the 10 lines requested for the comment ... <br /> <br /> 100% boring. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 2/10
