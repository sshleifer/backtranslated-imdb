Twenty years ago, when Michael Hawthorne was five years old, his father left his void with his mother with an ax and became suicide. Nowadays, Michael (Gordon Currie) Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends invite Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive. Phillip Rhys) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) spend Halloween at home with her grandparents at Halloween house. He asked them to wear costumes that would seem to be more fearful amongst his friends, and using the Crow American friends (Byron Chief Moon) to portray the ancient Indian celebration with the fear of Woody Morty (Jon Fedele). forever Michael's biggest fear is to be a murderer in his series, but he does something wrong and Morty becomes his father, kills his friends. "Fear: the resurrection" is desperate and amazing. A movie that uses the most interesting concept that takes away the fear of each of the friends before they grow up, but in a nasty script full of clicks. There are too many shows, such as Mrs. Betsy Palmer; Others are very weak, but in general, the performance is good. Unfortunately there is no explanation why it will bring the manicure to life; Even though close friends are surrounded, the team does not feel pain or pain when each one dies. The low rhythm of fifty minutes may be used to build a better state. In the end, Michael Strogoff shows his interest in his father, I have not realized the story. I do not know if the previous reference lasts for 87 minutes in DVD published in Brazil. Special effects are very good for a B movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Noite de Halloween" ("Fear 2: Halloween night")
