First of all, it seems that Jon Bon Jovi is not in a vampire movie. With other characters not so interesting and with a short story, the whole movie can be previewed. If you keep in mind and you're totally a vampire movie fan, you can have fun with some scenes. Do not expect the Tarantino style charm here and it's not the story of Anne Rice. (I hope I've forgot to forget about the whole movie);
