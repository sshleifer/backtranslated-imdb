I saw the movie last night here at home, but first of all I thought it was longer. Secondly, I saw the movie out of things, but I thought that comedy would be a theater comedy like this type of theater. Things are not funny in the movie: the girlfriend who knocks the fianc√©, blows. It has been a long movie: it was time to sleep and wake up when you woke up! They were able to catch up with some of that meeting - as a singer of dancing - I was seeing a show of almost spiritual song! come to Perry, you can do better!
