What a shame! I was aware I was expecting a stranger James Garner to be a treasure and what a way he was! The quality of the production was OK, but the plot was arguably lame and I can honestly say that I am older than one hour and much more pale. The film did not really have good quality and the things that are going on in this way will give Hallmark a bad name. For those who want to know what it was, there is nothing, and in this case it is not good. We deal with some of the most beautiful women, one of the most beloved creatures that are roam in the earth, that is, probably the only married person with a married person alive. After another, he drags a mess, turns the shame of another's, and is proud all the time. Then the movie ends. What a relief! It's not worth seeing, it's worth the time it takes, so be careful aside and get out of that side, you'll be glad you know that this is really bad.
