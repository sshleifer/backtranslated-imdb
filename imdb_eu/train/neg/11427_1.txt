I do not know who is the director of this film, Sue Kramer, but I suspect that A) is lesbian and B) she is somewhat embarrassed to prove that no one is homophobic. <br /> Everyone can imagine: "God, this is horrible. It's not fun. Pedestrian. Full fall." But they do not close their mouths and fear anti-gay or "gay life". (This is probably why Kramer has not thrown gay gay people into the blink of an eye.) However, it's not worth the review. All agents are directed at scrolling each scene, so they do not have any sincerity or credibility. It's full of chubs and there's nothing much fun about this movie, much more fun. <br /> <br /> I hate it and I'm not afraid to say. Sorry, Kramer gave them money to make money for this bomb, they did not impart their impartial judgment.
