An indecisive turkey, a confusing Nazi (!), American and Agatha Christie whodunit spoof with a big and big problem: it's deadly. In addition to the I.Q single-number line and conversation, the most amazing aspect of "Lady ..." is the casting. Gene Wilder (star and co-writer) tries hard: he plays romantic lead (his looks! And his age! And Woody Allen should start a club for comedic humorous comedies). moving, fun and intelligent and intelligent, trying to sings and dancing, and it does not get it! Mel Brooks filmed Looong in the old days. <br /> <br /> I thought a bit of myopic sound, all the people say, Cherry Jones is pretty small and Mikel Strogoff is this. Cumpsty is a compelling stallion! Claire Bloom's quiet secretary is the actress, sexy and sexy actress with a chair as a chair. It is the passion of two major women! Mike Starr has seen EVER as a policeman and is considered to be the main agent that works among the top ten feature films in the last historical film. The worst note in seeing the wonderful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa is wasting and shortage. I expect at least two stars paying home bills (and then firing them to agents) with this flop. It's not surprising when Sukowa came to Germany when she saw Hollywood's store in her store! <br /> <br /> If you want to see a bad movie that is going to be filling a movie through a script, you'll see it. Director, examine this - otherwise turn away! - 1/10
