I saw the "El Otro". I have always taken the hat in front of the choreography of Julio Chavez, as an excellent actor, but this movie is very confusing and slow. I think it would be worse if it was not from Julio. In any case, this is definitely you do not understand if you are not in Argentina and, nevertheless, I would recommend renting this movie if you do not enjoy this movie with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends. ... it is really dull and very slow, and the plot does not make much sense. Most likely, the director wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he does is bored and the audience are surprised by a scene that will surprise you a bit. It gives you some thought, but not in a good way. In general, I do not like this movie.
