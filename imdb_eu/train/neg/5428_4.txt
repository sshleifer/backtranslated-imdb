Another Priyadarshan / Vohra saw another TP than the desire to have, but I saw that this movie was not in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others). He had small hopes for this movie. <br /> <br /> I was glad to see the general question, Rajpal Yadav, except for the one that unlimitedly spreads, lacks some laughs, but these are not slapstick standards. The original joke is like playing the whole movie, I mean I hardly have any talent to make a lot of noise, or even an odd bit of good dhol does a little while? The only steps that can be taken in the beautiful and polite way of their time are that they are great for long periods. <br /> <br /> This brings us to another tool, Dumroo does not need any talent, it does not change, and it may be a bit like a monkey's dance (sounds like Hmm Rajpal Yadav, a good analogy), but not for a long time you will be entertained or not even a tool that dancing like Dhol. <br /> <br /> This movie was like a dhol and dumroo that is playing, sometimes Dhol sometimes played for a dragon, sometimes both together, but above all, he only played Dumroo and danced the monkey. And I was bored 24 years earlier. <br /> <br /> The movie is good at Dhol (good) but after a while, I heard everything Dumroo was annoying (initially funny and then tolerable.), great common parts really make this movie especially "MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA "for some fun clips (if you do not see it on Filmy, it's late afternoon and it's really fun).) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . I have said a lot of time and I repeat, I think, Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor, especially in a multi-star comedy, a wonderful journey. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes were an abortion attempt to impress the father of girls with great fun, for example, the young girl waits for the girl and tries to get away from each other. <br /> <br /> But when it was over, it was there. This movie means that it is a very bad attempt to carry it out with more mysteries, that is, when it was a little girl, it is worth mentioning that the following 45-60 minutes were increasingly torture: "YOU ARE ALIEN A FREE CATEGORY", if you think, at least If you think you should do some essays to make that nice. <br /> <br /> The movie is also very predictable, there is hardly any scene to predict, and you will not be laughed at spontaneously. Here, you see more about what you see and start laughing. <br /> <br /> The film continues in a gradual decline in all films, except for a slip, down or down, and then rapidly descends every step down with the girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Most really bad scenes are over, it's about being a Russian movie comedy. In addition, many jokes were also very good. Forgetful and frustrated repetitions, YOU HAVE ENCOURAGED THE 10-15 LAST AND THE FULL FILM. <br /> <br /> I did not find the mermaid that was considered Tanushree Datta, and its active talent has serious questions, especially because it looks non-appealing, unless it's hot and you can not survive how long you can act. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is too weak, with continuous glance and illumination and working with the camera. <br /> <br /> Except for the songs, the titles were not good, because in the second half they sang songs when I felt the shock of the audience. <br /> <br /> It's just a work that's just like a cast, and very small. hopes <br /> <br /> It's not a bad idea to avoid doing it. <br /> <br /> And if watching television on a free or very cheap basis is necessary or imperative, you will feel disappointed if you pay full multiplex rates. <br /> <br /> -Back, RAJPAL YADAV, LAST 45 MINS and the last 15 minutes especially, bad technically, bad songs. <br /> <br /> +/- s was trying to have more than what it was, not a regular cast (I'm happier), Tanushree Datta. <br /> <br /> + s early good scenes, title song, good plays and cast RY. <br /> Total 4.5 / 10 (I want to be objective here, I do not like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie meets my very low expectations, so I give all the doubts, absolute terms this movie It was not more than 4)
