I do not remember that murder / mystery I saw another movie. A film about a friend who searches for a mysterious death car of his friend, has a full proof of a bad movie: play, a boring story, no suspense, no humor and no drama. I remembered this movie in the PAX movie for designing beautiful television quotes and television footage for this type of TV. TV movies, of course, do not have as much edges or screensavers. But this movie has caused all sour taste. The film makers have lost a great TV show for "Receipe for Murder"; The title offers some suspense. <br /> <br /> So, if you want a good recipe, do not watch the movie. This movie is only for you to starve your TV hunger. F Phase
