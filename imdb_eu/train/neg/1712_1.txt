If Todd Sheets were to go outside, if she accepted that they wanted to break the zombie genre, I would change my score to eight. Try imagining a movie so that each nuances of the scene, line and play are parodied. It is possible to create an alphabet soup so that the letter remains reorganized and still has a good script. The two scenes come to mind in particular. SPOILER ALERT! When Mike and his father and another father walk, I repeat a jam packed with zombies. It's a small ladder, and even if they kill the deceased, nothing happens. When they reach the end, the ex-maritime turns, "God is the horny creature," and they shoot only one. The other is in a military complex. A girl will set a zombie with a suitcase and is immediately surrounded. The camera moves around it approximately fifty seconds, surrounded by zombies with long arms. Then, by chance, he flees from the crowd and joins other people. SPOILER WITHOUT ALERT! These scenes must be believed. However, I enjoy this movie as much as just about any comedy. Kudos to Todd Sheets in his film to get so many people and fight against the album but not for anything else.
