Well, maybe you did not see all the women that fall in love with this movie, but certainly women talk about love and talk about love, men who talk about men and talk about men talking to men. and all of you talk about death and talk and talk, until you scream and speak something you do not need to talk about, paint your bedroom or water like your plants. <br /> <br /> Welcome to the world in DH Lawrence, where he is a psycho pilot and where nobody can reach a production life, because everyone is busy talking about improviser life. D.H. It's like going through the closet with the characters of a Lawrence novel, if you'd find yourself in a party with a group of just like you. When I read "In love with women," I was so desperately wished to boost each of her characters, but I did not expect them to be linked at least to each other. Unfortunately, only one of them dies, not surprisingly, and I will not let you know if you're really wrong about this story or about those people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < to do it Lawrence wins a large part of the psychological trap and drives it to the worst parts, so that it is in love with beds and fields, two men are stitched and we fight against lightning and we have an Alank sculpture. Bates (again, naked again) in a meadow bushes and lawns in the meadow (I'm not joking). Glenda Jackson won an Oscar for Gudrun's acting, in the view of the story of two sisters, and definitely tries to do something harder with that material; Everyone was worthy of an Oscar when he had given him a scene in Russell when he had to endure full dance, instead of dancing in front of a cattle-like wildlife. Oliver Reed has only one expression; The whole thing is written and directed, and it comes out firmly. In fact, it's called "Mommie Dearest," as a non-histeric movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
