The Incredible Melting Man I saw for the second time, and it was more boring than I saw for the first time. I do not know why the classical worship has become so boring. The opening speech is promising, when the raw nurse removes the blood vessel and goes to love her life. After all, everything that happens is that it is a whirlwind of some melancholy and some houses, which will revive as an astronaut of his life. Make-up is pretty good, and the face's blue face is quite realistic. There is a cool scene where a man throws a head in a river, floats until he reaches a waterfall, and rocks and spills open. You do not have to get too wet, the scenes are mostly filmed in darkness and you can not see what happens. No worries, I saw at least Vipco DVD. <br /> <br /> No, Urkabide Unbelievable is not so great. I will mark them by cheesecloth, but that's why. If you want TRUE classic science fiction / horror worship, watch The Deadly Spawn instead!
