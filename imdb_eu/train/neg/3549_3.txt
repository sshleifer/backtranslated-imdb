Do you want to stand up? Come on with this ... <br /> <br /> In the first rounds, there are good comics, but they do not get good quality, they get a snowball. You are any controversial material and OUT! ... and I think that I am much less than the excluded comedians, when I see who are the wrong judges. <br /> <br /> I made the first 4 before my solutions. The half of the finalists + laughed me. Some of them have raised their material elsewhere, something that judges do not seem like a problem. <br /> <br /> It's more entertaining than many others on television, but it's hard to see. what could it be? <br /> <br /> If the producers have renamed the competition "Last Clown Standing", my criticism would lose its validity. Maybe an idea?
