Alone in The Dark is one of the favorite games of all time playing roles. I remember the whole night looking at the computer screen, trying to escape from the palace and when I was really surprised by the monsters surprisingly loading. Now, keep in mind, I'm tired of "computer games" movies. I do not remember Hollywood's unique success in this new genre, although it may be some of the kind of play. And yet, I can not resist the fan of the game. My reason is that the movie looks like the game, if it is, it's okay. <br /> <br /> Man, I would never return for 90 minutes of my life (it seemed 300). If that was the case, I would gladly rebuild my sock drawer. This is not a "so bad" category. Christian Slater would have thought it even more sensible. Now, Tara Reid ... I do not complain about her presence. However, this Chick is to play a leading role in having a sex scene, - I fully understand and help (hey, I'm calm!) - I saw his body in the press conferences. <br /> <br /> There is no word. You will not lose your time. The credibility of the story is included under "I do not have sex with Lewinski". The performance is above the "Street Fighter", and, incidentally, one of the worst movies I've seen, I would recommend it more. <br /> <br /> Kids, I recommend Video game. Better story, acting and much emotion. About the movie, here's a spoiler. Wait for porn version.
