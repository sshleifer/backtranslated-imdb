Gee, what a great movie! ... I said I wanted to become a specialist in the worst films of all decades, and that's why I decided to start this. The choice was pretty good. I went into this adventure to find some lost gems and discover unknown masterpieces, but I did not see anything like that in the pastel color mix. I have not seen a lot of bad films before, but I think it's called "so good," it's probably not so fun! First of all, there are errors. There are incorrect explanations of soil, physical accuracy, and psychological accuracy. The latter, especially the Van Damme's massive agitation, are within this blue spandex. They are also very sharp lines and I do not start talking about one of the most ridiculous moves. There is nothing wrong with everyone involved in a blend of a movie, except in a particular case. Geoffrey Lewis is completely pathetic as stupid as Frank. And to be honest, I was very surprised, because Van Damme made a decent job of playing twins. In my opinion, he helped to achieve different shades and moods in both roles. But the movie was very bad, and it is sad that it was created by an important studio in the movie ... that is now a failure.
