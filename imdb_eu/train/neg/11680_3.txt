This movie had so much potential - a powerful cast, a pretty solid idea and a decent budget. I do not know everything was wrong, but each of these items was wasted. The story was not gone anymore, the characters were nothing short of saying and the result was very boring, useless and empty. I hate. According to other votes, I'm a minority here, and I have to be a monster. However, I thought that this film was horrible. I had a great hope, but I was very disappointed. The disappointment of Jody Foster's character. It's such a nice "repair" of this sort. Jody was sure and sexy, but the character did not do anything, and nowhere was he going. Denzel Washington has always performed the same character - nice but nothing new.
