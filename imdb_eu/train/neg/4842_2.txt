Who has made this movie? It is located in Baghdad in 2004, but all the soldiers are dressed in ACUs and have a universal camouflage pattern. Nobody had clothed in 04 <br /> <br /> Did I see this film outdoors on the outside and I can say that it was a great feeling for the audience about WTF? This movie has no sense, those who do not explain the characters and those who do not laugh at it, would NEVER happen. I know it's a movie, but, of course, I try to figure something realistic. He misses badly, but he is trying. <br /> <br /> Someone is like to come across random ideas, chew them up and swallow them. Then he threw a movie. I would not recommend the movie to anyone. I still do not know how I was sitting. GI Joe was one of those who really thought about you. ALIEND!
