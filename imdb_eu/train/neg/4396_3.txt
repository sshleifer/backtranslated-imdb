My complaints here are the track and material of the film. When you use archives and letters, the film gives you a fresh and interesting insight, the material that is often highlighted is not very interesting (for example, when Goebbels complains about this or that complaint or reluctance of its origin). German birthplace). Also, the movie is browsing c. 1920-1939 and then war over the years. In short, the movie is a bit better than a History Channel documentary, the film director has a little more sensitivity than the History Channel document editor, so it can better organize Goebbels' life details. However, I wanted to.
