I think that many people commented / reviewed their first movie because it's an impressive or horrifying movie on the IMDb - I am writing this one. <br /> <br /> I was excited about the sequel to "Wargames". I thought the origin was pretty good, considering the time and content, I felt it was worth seeing more than once. In 2008, I had a lot of hope with this film. Computers, Gaming, Terror, military abuses have grown so much since the first film, and all of the "Wargames: The Dead Code" featured a great movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has failed at all levels, but I particularly blame the writers and writers about the realm of gaming aspect. "The Dead Code" was a simulated air flight in the 1990s, shaking hands with little people on the ground. Meanwhile, Will Farmer throws 7,000 commands around the button. None of these is the impact on the screen. Finally, by clicking on a "win" screen of the art screen with the mouse, it releases a gas that kills 20,000 virtual people (no one is near gas). Because it slows 5 LEFT in 15 minutes, RIPLEY (a real war machine) says that it is a high level terrorist threat. The government believes that humanity is a deadly threat. They say things like "expert knowledge of bio-terrorism" ... less than one person who reads the first 3 paragraphs of Bio-Terror Wiki entries. Therefore, the excitement of 0.01% of the budget of a subsequent movie and the Bourne title is created. They have 1,000 options to capture it and clear the whole matter. Sometimes they crazy, they're hardly lacking ... but others let him continue to make mastery choices to keep them going. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Well ... I would like to write more ... but I was already lost when I saw 1.5 hours, I prefer playing Broderick and Joshua playing tic-tac-toe for 1.5 hours.
