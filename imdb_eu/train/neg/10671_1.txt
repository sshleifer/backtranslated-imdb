MST 3000 had to do this film. The movie I've ever seen is the worst. First and foremost, scholars do not have a bank account and have no history left in the army since 1993 and are paid for rent. There is no way in which such a person would be able to have a close presidency, without mentioning a high profile. Likewise, the person in charge of POTHUS security would not be so emotional that they would start drinking if they had shot in a baby. This movie sucked. I can not express the end of this film. Every actor was horrible. The truck is also chick in the park. I am this garbage. Waste time
