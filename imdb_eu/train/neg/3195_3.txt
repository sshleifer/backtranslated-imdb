The two previous corrections: I think that Joe Don Baker is a good version of good or even good material and good director ("Cape Fear" version, "Goldeneye", "Walking Tall"). And he also liked Baker's "Mitchell" because he played against an anti-hero. Yes, it was a hilarious cover of MST3K, but Baker's plans were taken - it was not worth it - to make things so lively and entertaining. The film's level and tone were good, and it was the best part. <br /> <br /> It seems the "ultimate justice", but exotic locations and the "cowboy border justice" theme are much weaker than "Mitchell". . And the main reason is that Baker's written nature is an idiot. The film thinks Baker imagines the cremation of the ancient style, a challenge challenging to his opponents in a generous, brilliant drawing contest. And because it is so hard and macho, it has always won, even if it hurts, wounds, overcomes, etc. <br /> <br /> This is a great potential (it worked for Gary Cooper), although the film condemns the state of the movie "B". Baker is, however, very stupid and obsessive, everywhere in bad joke three challenges in a public market, with more than all citizens. He simply could not shake the head of a bad boss (that's why he continued, first of all) and would never realize it. Or it might have been possible for them to fall off and give them up and get some of the secrets that would lead them to the wardrobe point. But no, the bush league has to be a hot dog and a macho blockhead, so a child was taken as a kidnapped by the following abuse! <br /> <br /> Is this a type we must admire? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is like this. Most of the supporters are OK (henchmen), they are quite good (the bad guy and his father, two of Europe's well-known actors), they only work through movements, but they are professional and even more intersecting. they are good However, Baker's character makes shameless and unproductive mistakes that lead at least two innocent people who could be abused without abuse and a couple of small men. <br /> <> In a positive part, 90% of the film is set in Malta or in the Mediterranean, you will see lots of beautiful scenery and pretty and exotic looks. And really, Baker himself is likely to be in the second level and a bit dyspeptic, but it's not so bad ... it certainly does not seem like this movie's critics (including Mike and Bots including their hilarious coverage). . <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is a good video image, but the viewer would not pay any attention.
