The only way to get out of this movie is to bring it to a comedy. In light of this, he delivers it. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. This film does not give depth, and offers a study and more than one dimension on "topics". <br /> <br /> Making a movie about stereotypes and then making each character in the movie a stereotype. It's a very bad strategy - especially the same characters breaking their compact molds and stereotyped predictions. <br /> <br /> Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the film almost visible, and Michael Rappaport makes a good performance, but the script is so huge and the social comment is so dull.
