I hope the "Dream Machine" is the best of Corey Haim and "I hope the best movies of the century" is that it is a threat to the audience. Did not you know I thought it was my opinion? I really hope that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> The Dream Machine represents the first line that Corey Haim would have of the rest of the rest of the route. . Here, Haim, is immersed in the Bernie university, which believes that a cool car will attract her attention to the dream. Luckily, Bernie, a rich woman who wants to go back to rich women, decides that Bernie is rewarding the faithful piano tune with a gift: Porsche Turbo black. However, she does not know the woman, and unhappy Bernie, died when her husband died and her body was hidden in the trunk. Now, in this movie, the body does not seem to be decayed or quite funky, Bernie does not know that. In fact, an ignorant boy has no idea that something suspicious is happening. In particular, a grizzly man continues, he is disappointed to have the body quite unplugged. <br /> <br /> Haim is a very low level of action for many of these theater films (see O Double Kid). Although participation is a romantic comedy, the movie fails to give viewers a bit of interest for at least fifty five minutes for filmmakers to take up an immediate problem (Bernie is in possession). a car and a dead man, and knowing that Porsche will be difficult to find. After that, and thanks to Haim's performance (I also love this boy, but it's not exactly a sacrilege of Bernie and the real immediacy and lack of emergency). It convinces many events and as a result it is not supposed. If you want to injure yourself, the soundtrack does not have such a huge hope and is similar to the obvious songs you could hear from Team America (see 'editing'). <br /> <br /> Corey Haim loyal fans, however, should not be disappointed to see a lot of their boys. However, others understood that Haimen's route was 14 or 15 years old and was probably understood and never recovered, as might have been awaiting mediocrity, as early as the 1990s were looking for b-comedy fluff.
