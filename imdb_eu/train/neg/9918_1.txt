The other British film bends. Real garbage once again offered. I can not understand (and I am British) why it has never made a patriotic nonsense. You are marked by eight years since the end of the second world war! Other comments have been reported here for editing and apparently using footage footage. This is very badly seen. Archive footage is abundant. Aircraft models are like wind kites so many kites for children. The custom-map room sequences were tattooed, as we thought about the whole event in Malta. Guinness must never have the worst performance. The backdrop scenes are breathtaking. Hawkins brings us all in the room of the map. He made excellent films Ealing. It is obvious that this is not one of them. Such corrupted corruption should be far away!
