There is no decent scene. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams offers a great performance at all times. Anyone can start proof. Sebastian also sucks her boyfriend. It does not look like Ryan Phillipe. Like Joshua Jackson. The other two girls are awful too. <br /> <br /> Then the conversation is that. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (Being a Triplet): If you can not overcome it ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <br /> To contradict the whole plot of the original ending. In the first film, it is clear that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons that Sebastian Kathryn wanted so badly, apart from Sarah Michelle Gellar, "said she was the only girl she could not kill." He was disappointed to have liked him to play with him. He never gave up his desire. Then, P.O.S. In this case, she can say she can have a girl with her. What And we do not even see sex. It is implied, stupid, useless and contradictory, but it does not work. <br/> <br /> <br /> And in the first place, Kathryn renounces Sebastian because he has fallen in love and became a loser. Although he wins, he crushed his chances. Then in this excrement, he would lose and fall in love. So does not the "losers" get crowded, only the losers alone? Another thing: as Sebastian is ever in love, what do you call Virgin Girl? <br /> <br /> In the end, the virgin mother suddenly reveals that Kathryn's lover is a bad lesbian. (one dun dun), and, as I said, they are waiting for the sad sadness. Stupid <br /> <br /> There are other contradictions. Has the writer wrote the first movie? A 5-year-old can point his belongings. <br /> <br /> After the trio, Sebastian is sex with virgin blonde, she tricks her innocent minds in the back of a limo, while Kathryn and Virgin Girl Lesbian become evil. Directly Sit on the Twist front, listen, and get a bad smile into the camera. <br /> <br /> The end ... <br /> <br /> The first was the first interesting film that became the hole in Sebastian. It was a little girl to become a bad little girl to become a bad Sebastian girl. Interesting.
