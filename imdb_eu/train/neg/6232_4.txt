"Raw Force" is like the ultra-sharp and perverted version of Love Boat, other Kung Fu fights, demented monk riddles, white slave trade, dynamic zombies and many plays. It's not surprising that this movie was recently published in "Grindhouse Experience 20 film box set". Aside from exploring everything that fans are looking for, they mix together inconsistent and apparently improvised scriptions! The production values ​​are very poor and the technical aspects are pathetic, but it is not possible to describe the amount of free sex and violence. The film opens in a sunny tropical place called Warriors Island, where there is no apparent cause for the troops of savage monks who raise the dead, rather than becoming a Kung Fu fighter. The monks also bought strange slaves with a strange businessman, Hitler, who believes that the female flesh supplies the necessary powers to increase the zombie army. Cruise ship tourists, including three martial arts, a LA police and a brave but dark woman, are attacked by murderers as they are on the Warriors island. However, the ship cleans the island to the ground, and the monks challenge their inhabitants with their zombies. Well, how is it that messes up the horror movies that sound at midnight? Not finished yet, because "Raw Force" also has pirouas, Cameron Mitchell has played a role in the role of Camille Meathe in Camar Keaton (70s). There are malicious burdens, including massacre and decoys, joke hammocks and sweethearted love. The trash bin of this movie will literally leave you literally. The backdrop of evil monks, of course, is unexplained and they do not punish their hated hobbies. Perhaps this is why the movie "To Be Continued" is stopped, instead of "The End". Driving never arrived, the IMDb is not so dark.
