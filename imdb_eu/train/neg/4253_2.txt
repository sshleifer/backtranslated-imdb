Men are one of the worst discoveries of vampires ever thought. How can this hypnotic topic become such a stupid story? Apparently, it's not so difficult ... First of all, any simple condition of vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a sexy touch that suits all these things. Too much light - places! Oh god, why was Judas / Judas in his name? <br /> <br /> Every time it happened, Dracula swallowed it (to keep it in the script, on the disk: weak). There was only one scene that was worth watching at the end of the movie (drakingscene beautiful Dracula and his new conquest). The first one really liked me, Judas's tour was defintely original, but this is just not good, in any way. Fortunately the third one is liked by Vampire-signature, who also likes classic Nosogher's Nosferatu, Coppola's Drakula or even vampire.
