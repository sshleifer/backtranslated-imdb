I must say honestly when I started to watch this movie I started from the second. Just how bad it was !!! It's like watching the color much more confusing. I mean that something happens, in fact, to wait for the whole movie to make sense. At the end of the movie I really sat down asking if they had gone through the movie for the first time that was first missed or maybe even gone through the movie and lost some of the stuck pieces on the plot. together! The main thing that really shuffled about this movie almost ended up being the main girl (in fact, the main girl) was in an alternate reality, what was the hell at this time? He suddenly woke up and sat in a pillow, doctor, or something else that was tied up to a bed, and then tied it more quickly than the wrist he crashed, and he pulled it back and eats a vampire vampire. ! it does not make sense! I am tempted to send email to creators and ask again. I mean to see this junk 2 hours of my life! I'm really interested in filmmakers knowing what they really know! It seems like someone edited all the parts that could make sense, but the movie should be 4 hours long so that this happens! I abandoned the other review I wrote with all the other people, with the title I totally woke up with this movie and that alone. So, I'm grateful, I have not bought the movie, so many times I've seen in the local pound store. You would think that the film was a waste of the waste film, but I sincerely think that spending Â£ 1 in the cinema was too much money! A huge waste of time and good white razor, what I mean, I want to see this movie !!!
