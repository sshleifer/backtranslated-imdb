Certainly it's not horrible, but it's definitely not good. <br /> <br /> Cry, The Beloved Country (1995), directed by Darrell Roodt and wrote with Ronald Harwood (Alan Paton adapted to the 1946 novel). Protagonists James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. <br /> <br /> The pre-apartheid movie is about South Africa, and links the stories of a black man and a white man. Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones), a divine or sympathetic preacher, receives a letter from Johannesburg that he would have to come soon after saying that his son killed a man. James Jarvis (Richard Harris) finds a wealthy farmer whose son, a black fighter, killed by Kumalo's son. They are connected to this. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to the 1951 movie of the same name, because I have not seen it. I did not even see the music called Lost in the Stars in 1974; Both are better than this look. But I saw shouting Freedom; It has a lot of urgent air, such as Cry, The Beloved Country seems like something to say when it comes to something. Very "Wishy-washy". I want to compare it with a novel movie (I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed the novel movie) because the novels and movies are very different, and there is no transfer or comparison in any other way. through the same means. <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie is spilled. Well, I think it was not bad, - more than fifteen - but that was not good at all. The two main characters, two very good actors, draw some wooden shows with some of the most difficult conversations in the history of cinema (but this is a screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, who is also a strangely off-set game. This film, "The Pianist" and "Julia Being, "after writing the supreme" Being, "among other things, the issues and themes of the novel are almost completely lost during the third time in the film, at any time at the movie, it is a small voltage, racial or suspensively, music does not help, the orchestra is worse and pastoral errors are really helpful. With this rejection of the film, on the contrary, it is cinematography that has a lot of good or good shots, but unfortunately it does not help the movie too much. <br /> <br /> The final words of the novel by Alan Paton show the last moments of the movie, it's just a breakdown of the movie that is revealed. I do not know what Nelson Mandela saw in this movie. <br /> <br / > Thank you for your time.
