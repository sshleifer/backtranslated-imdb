Here I do not want to go, but ... the "movie" I've ever seen is the worst thing. The worse than The Avengers. Understanding directing, writing, and dramatic acting are only consistent components. Filmed in a very cheap video, it seems like a high school project, but without emotion. The lighting looks like a Sun-Gun. The sound is better than just a single micro camera, but everything about it is terrifying. The earth begins in strange directions, without foundation or later without resolution, the technological elements are absurd and the edition looks more like ruddy. It's not fun to have fun. It's bad BTW, the ships are deliberately deceived. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate owes me $ 4.00.
