Second movie in the box. Originally the title Bloodsuckers, this movie was quite average. It's boring in some parts, but there are some good effects, but they are not very good. <br /> <br /> The film is held in 2210. Vampires have taken over many parts of the world. The V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) team also has its own spaceship and is led by Churchille, who has captured the vampire, receives a message from the Earth and the group, Quintana, which plays a very hot Natassia Malthe. ), Damian's official rook and Rosa and Roman rebels (Roman Pearl with Wrightfully Accused in Roland). V-SAN later joins the vampire leader Muco, Michael Ironsid from Total Recall. There is no peace plan for mankind with human beings, because it is subject to the world. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is not a waste of time, the DVD player will definitely appear again.
