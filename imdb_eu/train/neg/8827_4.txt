I love slasher movies in the 80's and I remember that when "Silent Night / Deadly Night" came out of our theaters, I was very disappointed, so I was very excited about Fear.net. You Better Watch Out is what they hope for this kind of film. The current effects were released by high-quality special effects, the nature was much longer, but the most ridiculous was dissolved! <br /> <br /> Miss Santa, his father, his mother and later the mafia showcases the lights, not like the lanterns of the 80s, but the real lanterns! - It really tickled my funny bone. However, the scenes that looked at their neighbors children gave me another awful character. I also liked knowing what some of these characters were. I had a little bit to realize that the main character was a beloved bear.
