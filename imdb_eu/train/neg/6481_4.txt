Since the little mermaid was one of Disney's favorite movies, I was curious about her career. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid (one) is a classic animated film with all the highest quality, with great music. Score and direct a general viewer. On the contrary, the Little Mermaid is aimed primarily at 2 children, because it is spontaneous, reflects the child's vision, the music is shorter and less dramatic and the end is little. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid begins when the baby is presented to the side of the Melody family. Without a drama without a direct support, the giant tentacle takes a baby. I laughed, wait a minute is not fun, baby is attacking! Okay, I'm laughing. The crime of Morgan's illness and his spontaneity vanishes away from crime since it happened so quickly. <br /> <br /> Throughout the feature, Melody seems to me a man, and I advocate how most children think. The quality of the tone of the melody, clearly, has come to an end when Morgan's face has not been afraid. <br /> <br /> As for the first movie, Melody has many problems with Ariel, except for the opposite. Ariel Ariela indicates that he is like his father, away from the sea, while King Triton limited Ariel to the surface. Ariel and Melody rebel against both parents. <br /> <br /> Music moves emotionally for the first time. This sequel has a bunch of songs, but there's not so much in the orchestras. It's good for the little ones, because it does not have to surprise the orchestra. <br /> <br /> The first movie was over and it was very strong. The ending ends with a final song and all that is playing in the water. Certainly, it's aimed at children, leaving solemn at the end and turning it on, I'm thinking of this end: "It's a rest!" In the end, this movie is very fun for kids, so we have to have fun.
