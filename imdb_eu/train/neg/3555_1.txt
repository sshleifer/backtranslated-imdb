A few years ago we watched a movie and a horror movie, we thought it was good for John Cassavetes. John Cassavettes was an actress, writer and conductor (when he married Gena Rowlands as an actor) for three Oscar nominations, he wrote and directed low-budget films as an actor. . Until inubus, we did not understand that John Cassavetes's income was made from any movie that was offered to him. What we saw before seeing the movie, we could totally avoid it. But we did not get out. At that time, my friends and I had joked that it was the worst film ever made. Actually, this is not true. I saw a lot of good-night films on Fridays nights in Cinemax (I mean this loudly?) Much worse than Incubus. Every movie that is the star of Brian Bosworth is a movie worse than Incubus. Certainly, Santa Claus conquer Martzianoak is worse than Incubus. However, since I have used the Incubus threshold below, I do not want to fall. When I talk about a movie I've watched, I'll always find an improvement (or even worse) than Incubus. <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
