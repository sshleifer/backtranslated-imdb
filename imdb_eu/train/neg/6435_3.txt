It's hard to believe that anyone would put this film into a context like exorcist. When the exorcists were subtle and terrible, the stigmata were exciting, evil and very formulaic. <br /> <br /> It's been one of the great visual films that I've seen for some time, but it does not work. an insurmountable spiral staggering exhibition. <br /> <br /> When he compared the interest of that film with Exorcist, the visit to the official website increased this interest. The website has many stories about "true" stigmata throughout history. However, the scenes scene is obsessed with the "real" search that becomes a comedian from the beginning, then hard to look to the end. I began to be suspicious when the priests, who were investigating miracles, walked through the beauty salon, where our heroine is going to cut her hair and, of course, crossing the priests. <br /> <br /> Plot: Unbelievers in God. They begin to receive the wounding of Christ (stigmatization) and have enormous difficulties and have enormous difficulties in their ignorance. A priest is sent directly from the Vatican to investigate the case. Does Frank know the Satan or the ship of Jesus Christ? In this film the only miracle is that it ends at the end.
