In a woman under the influence, Mabel is crazy, but I see why he's crazy. My life lived with the family I would be mad at me. All of his family have absolutely no limitations. He is continually shouting to the people around him and telling the best of himself and the most demanding swordsman in the drawer. <br /> <br /> He starts with a nearest person in his life. , her husband, Nick, is a bit like her rocker. He is always crying at how he lives in his house as a way of living and acting stupid. On the other hand, he's been working hard for a long time and does not need help when he needs help. The only person in his life must always be there for him, he never finds himself and, if he is, he feels worse. She has confidence in her support and always goes to her when she thinks she plays badly and does not help her. When he comes home from the hospital, he tells him to say what he does, replacing him with comfort, and saying what he should do. <br /> <br /> His parents are the most important person in his life. His parents are worthless. Mabel is basically directing her life because they are afraid to face themselves and defend themselves. In the end, he even asks his father to take part in him and does not understand, and when he gets it he does nothing. They do nothing to recover Mabel or to keep his madman from doing nothing in his period. The only person trying to do something is Nick's mother. Nick's mother has always been committed by Mommek. She does not want to work with Nick, because the doctor has promised. It seems that everyone is against Mabel and feel they have a commitment to be a good idea, and they will not have to face it anymore. Everyone wants to have their own life and Mabel does not have to do anything except running and feels that he is not feeling really. That's why he was bewildered, and why he was committed, he was a complete fault of his family.
