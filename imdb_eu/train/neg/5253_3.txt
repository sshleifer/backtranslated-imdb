The name of the main character ("Woman") is called "Woman". I do not know whether this was intentionally or not, but we were surely at the same time that German audiences came to us at the Fantastic Film Festival last year. <br /> <br /> But the only joke they made was the movie. He did not want to play, he's a great movie for heaven! Film horrible in more than one meaning. It's hard to believe that such a premise has been useless with unnecessary momentous moments (undoubtedly for the humble heart!)! And it was not necessary to show all the things that are shown. Even though I do not have moral obligations (because the films do not have this type of task or function), there is a debate about what appears here, but this is a minority in the "torture movement". in recent years!
