This movie is completely ... ugh I can not find the word oh wait ... crap! It was like it was when I started to say it, it looks good and then it was so boring. I was sleepy, and it was not too late to show anything about it, because it was full of dirt. Ram Gopal Varma tried his best, but cast could not live with Sholay's original performance. What did he want to do? Have you been like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and won all the awards next year like Black? Ajay and that guy was good, especially when he was playing a second level rumor, because he looked at all of them. What did Amitabh do? He is destroying his dignity by making all these stupid movies. First of all, after Nishabd after Cheeni Kum Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now I mean that he hes gathered his money a little bit and Bollywood moved as far as possible before losing all his respect and I already tell his way to half. . I mean, all this is really good for actors like Shah Rukh Khan, now Amitabh is the last fall. I've never liked it, he thought he was God and I knew that Abhishe would be in that movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save Â£ 17,75 and you want to spend it, listen to something, Heyy Babyy, that's never the funniest and most fun movie!
