I caught this AZN movie through the cable. A good movie, "Green Card" seems like a Japanese. I can not say I've never liked an Asian movie, vice versa. Some of the most horrible horror movies of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I am a great fan of films by John Woo Hong Kong. I do not like lightweight movies like Tampopo or Chung King Express (my two favorites), so I thought I'd like it. Well, I want to drink wrists and my blood, never before seen this bad and bad film again. <br /> <br /> Steven Okazaki, director, thinks he saw water with Quaalude. This film had a personality. And when trying to perform any character, when one or two lines cheat, their performance was forced and very fake. Honestly, I do not think anyone else has ever played before ... The only person who plays real-life was Brenda Aoki ... I'm surprised I've promoted this comedy, I never laughed. Even more surprisingly, CBS's morning news has been called "a breathable comedy breath". There was no refreshing, nor breath of comedy. And the end was very predictable, the previous evaluator must be stupid to think of such things. <br /> <br /> Look forward to watching the movie, a predictable plot and a wooden performance. I truly believe that "Spens of Bensonhurst" is better than playing a movie ... and I've been in the middle of that film!
