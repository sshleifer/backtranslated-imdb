This documentary is a reconstruction of the last years of Betty Page (Paige Richards). The Tennesse press was the queen of the most renowned in history. His most memorable work came in the 1950s and was the "girly flicks" of fetish photographs, slaves and cat fights. In the Star News article, Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter), he had to face what he had to do with Betty's camera. There was no nude in celebrated photographs or "styled movies", but nevertheless ordered Klaw to distribute the dark materials and prevent them from corrupting. It is not surprising that Betty's worship continued at the height of her career. Next to the girl, in black hair, blue eyes and glassy fetish-dressed gowns with decades or decades. After all, it has been said that more photos than Marilyn Monroe had produced and that it is the second, clearest image in the world, by Elvis Presley. Betty Page disappeared and in the last years she would offer her religion. This movie could be much better; but to have a great interest. <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is amazing. Bra, panties, sewing belts and sleeves do not hurt the figure. Also in a cast: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Find out the movie can change your heart rate.
