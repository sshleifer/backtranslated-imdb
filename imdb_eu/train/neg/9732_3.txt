First, Mark Dourif is KOOK. If you're trying to get this movie seriously, I'm sure it will spoil you. If you do not take it seriously, it's really fun to watch. As with other reviewers, I love Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif's love scene. Avoiding the flames that suddenly break the car in the automobile. Another great scenic scene was being stunned and falling around the room that was being watched by John Landis as a huge producer of the show. In fact, I thought the last 15-minute movie was a laugh riot. I do not know where Tobe Hooper did.
