I've been making some progress in this movie a bit, maybe it's too much to be expected. I'd like to see what Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do, and I'd like to see what Dan Reed does, but unfortunately he has not worked for me. <br /> <br /> The problem lies in the fact that the film does not really understand the genre, and therefore does not amaze with drama, horror and thriller elements, because one of them fails to focus and do what is wrong. all professions and no masters. <br /> <br /> The premise (like most revenge films) is simple, the pair fills and goes out, something is wrong and their revenge is made by many direct formulas and directors. as long as it is expert in the field. Unfortunately, in this case, as Dan Reed thought, "it would be wonderful to do some of these revenge in a deeper way, showing all human beings more human aspects and deepening their mental details ..." Wrong! It also seems that there are some essential elements, in this type of films there are, in general, some types of warnings. A do not do this or something that adds strain, but there is nothing like that. Simply it just happens, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting happens and then it ends. <br /> <br /> It is really hard to try to fight the harsh competition in this genre and Dan Reed, I have no managerial skills, but writing a term ... I'd like to stick to the formula for the movie to be filmed next time, as it is clear He will have a good quality film and his hands.
