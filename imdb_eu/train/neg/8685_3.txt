To be honest, Little Bush's expectations were small. I expected a small series of cartoons with fun (but confirmed and over-exhilarating) Bush jokes. Apparently, my expectations should be further reduced. <br /> <br /> The writing was completely pathetic. Cheney-Chicken-Eating joke and some giant little ones aside, it was very boring. <br /> <br /> The animation was as sophisticated as the thirteen-year Flash Project. It's amazing because Macromedia's product is much better. <br /> <br /> I do not like Bush too much, and I enjoy Bush joke with the next one, but this was just an hour and a half with the first shotgun, with some fun and painless moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did much more with That My Bush. <br /> <br /> Please, do yourself a favor, skip the "Lil 'Bush" and copy a copy of "This is my Bush" comma. Thank you to me.
