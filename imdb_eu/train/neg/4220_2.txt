A short review ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Avoid with all costs, a 90-minute deep waste. At the end of the movie I did not know what happened. It's full of cheeks (Stephen Fry (3 minutes), Jack Dee (30 seconds), "Philadelphia" girls) and some well-known people, but it does not make sense. If the story is not lost in the edition I'm not going to ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Take a DVD or go to bed and take a break! <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10 (the cameo and the harassment of a Morris Minor car) <br /> <br />
