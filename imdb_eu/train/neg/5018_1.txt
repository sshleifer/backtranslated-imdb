I rented this movie to see Amber Benson, but when I read the box I thought it was a good story ... but the first problem was that there was not a story ... or it was really a story but it did not make any sense. The second problem was not configured for these characters ... Yes, I got to go to school, but in the first 3 minutes of the movie you were not aware of something else and they did not like it. ... so why did they continue together? Problem 3 ... Although the director made short breaks and tight cameras, it was identical (especially typical suspense music) ... unfortunately he was wrong. An excellent actor like Amber Benson was painful. This time he was trying to get a living ... my only hope was that the money he made here was on his way to producing his movie.
