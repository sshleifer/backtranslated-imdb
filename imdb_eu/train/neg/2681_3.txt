It is a very telling story to make this movie quite as if it were quite interesting, but why is this the end of the movie? <br /> <br /> In fact, what's the point? <br /> </ p> The scenes are so fast that you have not felt emotionally part of the movie and feel the feeling of distancing yourself from understanding the story. <br /> <br /> Cast's performances are uncertain, otherwise credible. <br /> <br /> I lost the conclusion I made in the movie? I think we must wait for the sequel. <br /> <br />
