As someone who has read the book, I can say that Gwyneth Paltrow is less than the big American version of the show. There are several reasons for this. First, Emma is very unpleasant. Yes, it has mistakes, and it's not like it, but the audience would not start to scorn. Second, Mr. Knightly is wrong. The melancholic and melancholic versions of this version are better suited to Brontes or Gaskell than Austen, and to the affect of "dinner". Third, Samantha Morton is a great actor to download the role of Harriet; and why did he look sick? Harriet is a blond and a flower, so that the next scene looks like a consumer has taken. In the fourth, the structure mucked up and cut scenes. At the end, when he decides to love Emma Knightly, it's amazing that this narrative has not been shown and taken in the film. Fifth, what happened, specifically, Mrs. With the accent of Elton? He began as an American actor trying to get rid of his own accent at the beginning, to leave America halfway and eventually return to England. In the end, this is dragged to the end. The book and movie version will end with Emma and Mr. Knightly's wedding. This version is confusing after the announcement of the wedding, without actually showing the event. <br /> <br /> Along with everything, it is an involuntary attempt. Read the book or rent the Paltrow version
