Columbo films have dropped down for many years, and this year they can also come to the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same interpretation of inspiration and this movie is horrible. As usual in this series, crime scene protocols are never heard, so there is always a lack of authenticity. Brenda Vaccaro takes away the scenery and takes on the pantomime's face, and Andrew Stephens is a pretty girl. (His weakness was the template) They never had to bring it back in the nineties of Colombia, with all the wonderful landscapes that left us, better scripts and happy memories with stark characters.
