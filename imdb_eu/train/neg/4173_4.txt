The man I must say when I saw the trailer I was excited. Soldiers of football, vampires who take bad asses, head of the Michael Ironside genre ... In space. I mean I did not expect much art, but it looked like a classic B movie. Without a doubt, he was a television pilot, who later extended his feature film, was not received. I'm just getting started with some short movies, with the ability to make a lower budget action, and the CGI and the places used were good. Now for the bad, Michael Ironside was first barley, and his performance here ... well cursed was not in a good way. But as I said, there was not much, so I can not blame. It was a really stupid thing, it was a PETA type of vampire, but I'm not joking, it's the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen over time, and it's taken seriously. In addition, this film makes one of the most important sins of the film B, satisfies the lesbian scene and does not deliver it. Most people who fall into this movie do nothing. As a pilot, the script does not exist and does not end regularly. Although the main wicked ones come to an end. If it's a Sleaze and a factor of gore, it's Vampire Wars. When I finish, I can say the main crew of the space, they were very good actors, and they could be very well behind these messes and things bigger and better. They do not need to work here.
