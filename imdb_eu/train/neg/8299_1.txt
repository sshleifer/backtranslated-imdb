A Christmas story with a classic holiday and my favorite. So, of course, I felt when I came to this movie in 1994. I opened the day and saw myself ready to enjoy myself. I have come and I have clarified. Prediction in a Christmas story Truth is missing. Red Ryder BB gun is better for more than one Chinese. And it's not very funny. Charles Grodin Good, but Buck stops. Bottom line: 1 star. Do not even talk.
