Well, I can not enjoy this movie for its cultural values. It's an action movie from the movie "Commando" B-movie. However, it is not too lame and stupid to put a movie that serves enough to entertain a good B movie. <br /> <br /> This is the 90s movies, but first of all, the film should recall the action movie of the 80s, all kinds of B-films at all times. These films have always been overcome and never gave much attention to their story or performance. It was amazing things, big muscle heroes and bullets. This movie has all the components but I still do not like this movie as much as I like to see some similar types of movies. It's hard to say really, since story and acting, just as bad as it is in any other genre in the same era. <br /> <br /> Probably the movie is far away. too stilly All sorts of movies have bad moments, but this is a movie. Fights, Dolph Lundgren without T-shirt, characters, story. It's just not very good, because it's a bit of a word. Sometimes the story is not a bit of a sense and what is the main line of the overall movie? His story is in the whole place, and it seems to be a writing movie to fight secrets, guns and such. And these sequences are not really very good. The moments are too short and pretty depressing, really looking at the man who brought us "Commando." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He throws it, apparently with relative ease, how to handle weapons and other weapons and, of course, a girl who plays Tia Carrere. All of this will bring the worst sequence of the movie's history and also the worst sex sequence I've ever seen in a movie. Both are just word abuses and they are very well organized. <br /> <br /> A character is not really done. Good men are policemen, but they do not seem to ever play. They just kill each other without facing anybody's responsibility, and they do not engage in any arrests or report anybody's findings. A great Japanese trade union crime L.A. Even though a street vendor and a beer company try to find a drug factory and a large-scale smuggling drugstore. And think a bit, what is the overall goal of Brandon Lee? The movie could easily be done with him and without the girl. <br /> <br /> Very nonsense, worst and simpler and not quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
