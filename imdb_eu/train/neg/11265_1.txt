There have been some downsides in my life when I am confused and depressed. Rancid was sitting by aluminum, it was one of them. <br /> <br /> Warning signs were there. It was not released (no stars were wanted) and no reviews of magazines. The only reason that was sitting on the film was the hope to stay. <br /> <br /> It was not explained in the film. The narration was stupid. I was encouraged to have filmed a movie, and then to my great despair, it was revealed that it would not slow my joy. I honestly expect everyone involved in the film to hang that cruelty. <br /> <br /> There were some positive aspects, especially unintentional humor. For example, the scene of the main character, because he feels the need to manually ignore unknown reason in the generosity cabinet, will tell the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers on his ears. <br /> <br /> My words can not explain my anger, and I conclude. <br /> <br /> Aluminum ranch: only sadists, astros and regressives want to torture themselves.
