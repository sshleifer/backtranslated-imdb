Only the "Plan B" are the numerical rates, except. Surprisingly, it seemed to me insulted. <br /> <br /> <br /> Jon Cryer plays the role of "Pretty In Pink" and a nice character in this film. Since then I have not had fun. The grid is not even beginning to describe its performance. Ricky (Mark Matheisen) is a muscular actress, blonde and struggling (she is only worried about herself). Talk about a stock character ... ugh. At least three other characters are quite noisy. Lisa Darr and Lance Guest act as a sharp, rigorous and caring couple that is fighting for resemblance. Since they are not queens of drama, their role seems to be boring and not enough on the screen. Sara Mornelle casts the cast, who plays Gina, who loves your sweetheart and looks good. I've seen this character a million times before, but at least its performance exceeds the shortcomings caused by its forecasts. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about this film was the promotion of stereotypic youngsters. They introduced a Russian character to make him mock and talk as he was the only goal. They were portrayed as wild, ignorant, and superficial. They were warmed up by ordinary nonsense by Gay. Gina decides to be a bit gay, because she has no luck with boys. Honestly This was not so bad, when they went to the board when Gina lesbians moved to a Christmas party when their friends dropped out. Her lesbian day had a very short hair (I'm sure all the injuries). Likewise, he was quite annoyed (I'm sure I'm doing the injury), Gina lipstick (!). In the end, the day goes by when a woman begins to unravel when Gina shows her disappointment. Of course, we all know that gay people can not be faithful for much less than a few months or even a year long, right? (Please indicate that statement in sarkasmak. Thank you) for cinema. 2/10
