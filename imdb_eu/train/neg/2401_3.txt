I have seen some of the best young men of my time, but it's a cake. A more horror comedy, "Full Moon High" puts it in the "c" cheese festival. The star quality of this movie is not bad. Just the way he just sends a rolling downhill. Adam Arkin plays Tony, a 50-year-old high school American football player, due to the fact that Transylvania's male lupus bite does not age. The worst piece of the movie was violin. Each one guided them! Ed McMahon plays his ultra conservative father when his bullet ends. Adam Dad reduces Alank and seems to be his main game. Over all these years, Tony seems to be not a proper place to attack, and then he will be able to catch up in his state. More laughs than bloodshed, this film was just the beginning of the 80's, it was a "Teen Wolf" improvement! 1 out of 5 stars.
