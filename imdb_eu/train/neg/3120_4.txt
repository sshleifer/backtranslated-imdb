I really do not expect much from "The Night Listener", and I have never heard that cover until I saw it in the movie. However, the film is very effective when it comes to the suspension and tension. Sometimes it drags a bit, but it really helps to wonder what will happen, and more importantly: when. As the movie progresses, Robin Williams leads a character to "type of cat and mouse" trying to get to know the truth and existence of a 14-year-old boy. It has never been seen personally. The Night Audience is an interesting story that is very ideal and easy to build a suspense throughout the film, which keeps everything false and real. However, it ultimately deviates from the type and has not been able to live. You really can not give a detailed or credible explanation about another character, which may be helpful and interesting.
