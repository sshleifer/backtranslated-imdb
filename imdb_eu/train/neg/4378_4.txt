Given the title and the curious cashier art, I was almost ready for anything. Perhaps my hope was a bit forced because I was left dry. <br /> <br /> A group of film-makers in a sex-movie is finishing a curious house when they lose their home. Fog and the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. Where did you use this before? The difference here is the supreme nature of sex. It is not allowed to show all of the goods (for a long time they were illegal in Japan, what is revealed), the film tries to show the audience how natural sex can be. <br /> <All of the breaks, a mud monster (which I can not notice) will appear and the man starts killing and raping women ... and then die. Some of these places are much, especially when a woman stroke her intestines through her vagina or whispering to other women ... one thing, but otherwise it is quite standard. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie removes them through its designs; Too much is sex to be a close-up horror picture and it's too much to work as a sex film. Means can work, but it must be balanced. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
