I did not like the movie, Joshua, in any way. Maybe I saw another similar theater, under the title Orphans 2 days before, but this movie may not be very good. I will climb the ladder. Of course, the argument of a bad son is not an original, but that does not mean that the film can not be achieved. They may be suspicious and entertaining and incredible, but the construction was slow, boring, unusual and did not really think "was not very good" when everything was over. <br /> <br> /> Finally, Joshua's motivations are revealed. I did not give it that, but the reality is not really achieved its goals despite Vera Farmiga, despite her mother as Abby, disappears during the 3/4 film, all the arrows return home soon. He was responsible for losing his mind when he was committed to the head organization, but the father / husband of Joshua was accused of eliminating his medication, and the organization realized that he was not mentally ill, but that he was medically dosed. So ... will not it come soon? Will not Josue fail? Does her mother live with her and her sister and maybe her father soon? I asked the father because he was left open for the future. <br /> <br /> In the end, I did not care about the characters. The evildoer of Joshua was not terrifying. The language moved slowly and when it was boring. The suspense fell flat all the time. When it was over, I could not believe I crossed the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Only 4/10 Vera Farmiga parents have been very good parents, but if you want to see a movie about "the evil of the child, see the orphans. Now it's a strange concept and it's a movie that created a great movie.
