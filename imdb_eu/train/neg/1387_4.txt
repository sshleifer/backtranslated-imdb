It's hard to think that packing "action" in the movie Jet Li is so boring, but this was transcendental trash. The plot is a mixture of other Hong Kong chopsocky flicks. Martial arts acts are special effects and not human talent. <br /> <br /> It's a story in the comic book, about a super-human soldier who would be killed, because he is an unstable intelligence who takes away one of his army's incompetents and saves them. as a pacifist librarian reconstructs a life. Saved killers Austin Powers will emerge with a quality plot in the world and take away the world of saving Li new life. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a duplicate, which may increase accentuation. 25-centimeter special effects of thin-oak plots and comics. But I also suspect that the 8-year-old youngsters who see Ninja-Turtle will fail.
