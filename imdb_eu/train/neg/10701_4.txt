Happy London puts the treasure in search of treasure, a young woman, secretly, in love with her powerful and independent lover, who sets her political father married. Katharine Hepburn's brilliant early career, which plays a similar airplane to Amelia Earhart, which has implicated herself to be involved. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and the scriptwriter (Zoe Akins, Gilbert Frankauren's book), of course, were assigned to this project for the vision of women, but why are all old clich√©s kept like frozen objects? Billie Burke's wife goes to bed in a similar way, and Hepburn's latest scene is another story. It is a strange object, but not for classic Kate. ** ****
