James Gandolfini is a good actor, so he did something wrong in this role. Affleck is just a light cut that can not, the rest of the cast is truly unforgettable. In the United States I saw this in an empty theater, I soon learned that it was empty for about 10 minutes. Before I finished it, it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when I came back to England, I saw the movie "Paul Ross", a bright report of that yoyo on Sundays. I always rely on Ross to save money on film cards, if it's a good movie, I'll go directly to the website. This movie was supposed to go straight to a live supermarket, Â£ 1.99.
