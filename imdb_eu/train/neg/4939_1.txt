Peeew this stinks! Everyone knows that Geico is based on some commercial insurance; Nobody knows what it is? These announcements were the fun ones for the first time; almost a series of peasants. (A Geico Gecko who speaks - this is another story. Now, it would be an interesting series!) And why did ABC - has informed the press that this is the Geico squire's nature to buy this right? In short, the idea of ​​many men in the modern world is hardly the only one for television; Phil Hartman repeated the Saturday Night Live magazine as The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer over a decade ago. This concept works like this, as a provisional installment. But a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (In the 1960s, "It's Time Time" was used by men of modern-day conceptual weaponry. It lasted for a while.) <br /> <br /> Geico was also a director of advertising, as mentioned recently, "When we were shooting our ads we were very excited, we felt something very special and we had more stories to tell." Wrong. <br /> <br /> In television analysis, the "Me and the Chimp" the worst of all times, the main actress of the monstrous fiasm was introduced into an association with embarrassment after it was over concealed. Without a doubt, our armed men will continue to hide.
