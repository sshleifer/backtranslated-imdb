I was expecting a bad movie and I got a bad movie. But I could not imagine the worst of my fantasy the movie was bad. I do not want to even talk about Blood Surf. It's not about blood surfing, but a great $ crocodile $. They are complaining of false shawl Jaws, but Spielberg was cautious and did not show sharks until the end. Here the crocodile is shown several times and I am the worst crocodile I have ever seen and do not try to hide. If you want to see a good false crocodile Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The director had the opportunity to perform a decent movie / shark movie, but he had to make a bad b-movie monster. He had the chance to make an original movie, but he wanted to make a monster movie. So you understand what the movie is wrong with some good parts? There's really nudity and sex scene from a playboy movie. The operation is not a bad thing, and Kate Fischer looks good. Bad is not allowed to meet her. The actors are not bad either. They had some potential. It was a beautiful place and some surf scenes begin with the movie. The fault is without writers and directors. The interviews are the worst ones I've seen, and the script is very poorly written, and the director has not got any talent ever, and not even a lot of fantasy. <br /> <br /> It was ignored. Even if you want to see beautiful Kate Fischer. It's not worth it. Check the Mermaids to see a naked Kate and observe Lake Placid if you want a good crocodile action. <br /> <br /> 3/10 I have a good mood, and Maureen Larrazabal is naked and Kate looks good. (but it is a bad actor), and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi worked hard on their work.
