Baba - Rajinikanthe will never forget this name in life. This is the movie that caused his fall. It was released with great freedom, but it fell badly and put a serious financial loss for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanthe was forced to pay for personal losses due to losses. After liberation, he tried to get into politics, but he failed. It's a bad movie with an awesome performance, bad quality with makeup and pathetic script. Throughout the movie, Rajinikanthe seems like a person suffering from certain illnesses. Baba saw the first show on the first day I am one of the most unhappy shows. The public got bored, until most of them left the theater. Sorry, I do not recommend anyone.
