I missed watching this episode because I did not think Ana-Lucia and Libby's deaths were really depressive. Then I found it to kill next episodes around Libby! Gah! I can not manage it. <br /> <br /> I liked this show for the first season, but it fell definitively in the second season. Jack and Locke's real little religions seemed annoying to me. The death of Rodriguez and Watros's characters was the last straw! <br /> <br /> This section gives you 4/10, as a result of the end of being seen by this great series created by the law of Alias ​​J.J. Abrams. I hope that in the future its series will be improved.
