In 1966, in the "Blow Up", Antonioni had a true question about his heroine behind the young British protesters. Hippie's questions against a youth movement, Antonioni questioned, intentionally or not, the effectiveness of these organizations. How do you fight if you think that a reason is false? Conversely, the film says that we have to fight and see what we see, in fact, others deceive false images and false truths. Although the Hippie parties were the most demanding parts of "Blow Up", they created a nice texture and, moreover, a movie that was more demanding than a different meaning. The movie was very unnoticed and mature. With "Zabriskie Point" Antonioni blinks with ambiguity and nuances of "Blow Up" and the whole hippie is blown up. The result is a bad metaphor, a stupid idea and a heavy story. How can someone else be able to show their limits and intelligence along their career? <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a beautiful series of close-ups, watching a radical group that discusses the meaning of the revolution. Suddenly, a man (Mark) rises and leaves. He hates the rigid and orderly nature of the revolution. He admits that the revolutionaries are fighting for freedom, but it is a militant connection that effectively gives them freedom. And because Jack Nicholson looks like "Passengers", Mark wants to be free. <br /> <br /> So, Mark buys a gun and goes solitaire. No one takes orders. When the police are rounded to his university campus, he draws a guy and escapes later. He moves to a nearest area, stole a small private plane and goes to the desert. Antononia treats it as a peaceful utopian desert, and contrasts with capitalist wildlife cities, with their barriers and empty appliances. In the desert he sees a sort of Eden garden. <br /> <br /> In the desert, he knows Mark Daria and falls in love soon. Antonioni then gives us a ridiculous sex scene, hundreds of hippies with sand sex. Without limitations of modern life, leafy trees and radical students celebrate their individualism in the sun now. <br /> <br /> The film ends at the death of Mark and ends with fantasy between the majestic and elegant Daria. The houses of wealthy capitalists killed. Antonioni's challenge is to the public. Take guns, picnics and explosives, he says. Remove the walls down the box! <br /> <br /> Of course, the film does not affect the audience. "Zabriskie Point" has been recognized as just another radical self-commercial effort. A kind of radicalization. It's not true and nice to feel. <br /> <br /> Thematic movie is pretty stupid. Antonioni says, above all, that if you do not make the modern world unlucky and you have to escape the cat fats, desert (Mark) or fight against the system (Daria). It's okay. But the artist constantly warns us of these nightmares, they can not, in any way, show their changes efficiently. As the end of "Fight Club", nihilism and violence have not been achieved. In the real world, social change is driven by modest inventors, because it advances advanced technological advances. I mean, what are the freed women over contraceptives? <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Very bad movie. The problem is that Antonioni does not really believe in the rebellion. He is a calm and contemplative man. He embraced the ancient film through theatrical play, which seems to make more of his dress for the adoration of his first "Blow Up" film. That's why the movie "Zabrinskie Point" is very absurd and stupid. It's basically a 50-year-old man: "Look at me, I'm a brave rebel!" <br /> <br /> There are several films to face the audience's "system", but they all fall. into four categories. In the first category you have films like "Network", "Cool Hand Luke", "Cuckoo Nest" and "Spartacus". Everyone shows that fighting against freedom is a failure of all lives, although in each case the "revolutionary spirit" survives. The message can not change, but if you die or fail, the optimal change of ideas has survived the martyrdom. We must basically fail to leave hope behind. <br /> <br /> Then you have films like "Fight Club", "Zabriskie Point" and "Falling Down", instead of exploding. Remove everything Tap Everything is false, so you can also get weapon gun. These films are generated by angry and reactionary feelings, rather than one of the senses. <br /> <br /> Then you have the category "fight over flight". Terrence Malick and Antonioni are masters of this genre. The likes of "The Passenger", "Red Desert" and "Badlands" do not like humans from all over the world, and they make peaceable islands or refugees. Both directors are secret, Malick has destroyed his islands, and Antonioni does not give his or her congratulations. <br /> <br /> Then you have the fourth category. Donnersmarck's "Other people's lives", such as Ashby's "Glory" and Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" films, make artists change and rebellion. In those spiritual worlds, everybody who is bored of being a slave to slave, is a creative imbalance and voluntary freedom that keeps the artist / criminal's will under control. Outside of the flock, you create waves. Your comments, actions and critical eyes, the status quo challenge. That's why Donnersmarck's films include Nazi German cancer writers and artists. Kubrick, Alex, has an artist / criminal fighting Nazi Beans, painting blood and sperm in the village.
