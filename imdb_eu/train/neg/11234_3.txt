This movie is very bad on Friday 13th. The film talks about the murderer Bernie, the training of a camp counselor that kills people around the camp. People kill the outsider's training because the field is on the ground of his father's property, and when the police took his father's land properly, he was killed unexpectedly to kill his mother (another F13th). The inauguration is watching its first victims die. Next, we will enter the same forest family center. Shortly afterwards, he comes up with a curious elderly man who likes to talk about his son. Later, his son Bernie understands it and has locked himself in the back of his caravan after leaving a mental institute. After Bernie's family, she puts her in order to get her things done and then harassment is turned on. <br /> <br /> This movie is only recommended for those who enjoy 80's Slashers 80s.
