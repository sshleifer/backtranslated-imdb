This ambitious film suffers the greatness of writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson. Much better material (Altman's "Nashville", Lumet's "network"), this penetrating elephant is too long to get it anywhere. A couple of deviations on the way (a shameful interlude of music, a terrible plague) are not at all capable. There is also a different level of performance. Especially bad: William H. Macy, whose character and story could easily be extracted easily; Julianne Moore, for his persistent exhaustion. And how many times do you see John C. Reilly's Sad Sack Shtick ("Chicago" and "The Hours" enough)? Does Tom Cruise compare well? His Russian misogynist and mouth was quite funny. Speaking literally, the script was full of "F" bombs, and they did not work in any way. Do not even talk about this awesome soundtrack filled with Aimee Mann's loud and annoying voices. Initially, "One", a lengthy interpretation, an initial number, fascinated me at the beginning of the film. I took it for three hours to write it on the wall and they took me to the hell of that time. A civil servant who has not mentioned in other reviews, the best role of Claudia's unknown Melora Walters, has decided to destroy herself by damaged Coke. His credibility has exceeded all the others. This movie was taken seriously and did not know when it was due to end.
