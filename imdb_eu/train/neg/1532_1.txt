Although well-advised, I really sat down to see the movie. I think that every movie breaks into one piece, and I thought a single movie could not be bad. I corrected. George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick, or Ben Stein did not even save this turkey from sinking like a bunch of bricks. I missed this mood just once for a hate that hates me. That is, Simon's scene is called. The other jokes are wrong, or they are simply empty. And some of them are really seeing a mile mile. This movie does not get a good parody to support Airplane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III), or Scary Movie. A. All were A. funny gags, B. Good conversation and C. all the most important quotes unforgettable. Men In White does not have any of these D's. If you call this movie, it would be a bad explanation. USEFUL CINEMA USEFUL FOR YOU! SOMETHING EXPECTED!
