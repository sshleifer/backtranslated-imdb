John Watson directs Deathstalker, and he plays with Rick Hill, who is such a bodybuilder and famous, if I understand? The land continues: Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get back some evil, and he must go to the lighthouse cave. During his trip he meets dwarfs and monsters, and the settings are very close to Tolkien, and of course Conan the Barbarian. This is a great success in Conan, though it's a stupid movie, it has good merit for the trash and it's good to tolerate garbage lovers and scientists! A couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinated, but Deathstalker shows what she does to show the naked women and Hill muscles. They are victims of non-personality in women and they are very stupid, so this is a macho movie, so maybe feminists do not like them anymore! Fight scenes are not special and pretty dull, and monsters are nothing special. And all the other aspects of the film are also very funny and bad, but what do you expect from such a low budget? This tries to be as great as Conan, but it fails. As I said, this may like fans of turkey cinema, but no one is. This is a bad category, it's very good! <br /> <br /> It's not nearly as close as Deathstalker, and like a turkey movie, it seems to me almost as nice as these other Indians. Of course! If you have a bad movie with your tea cup, try this and have fun, but if you do not understand the "bad enjoyments of the movies", follow him. And if someone does not have too much nuance, follow him too. More than violence is naked here, and as a result of this scene, the movie has a R grade. Otherwise, this could be a safe family of the PG family! <br /> <br /> 4/10
