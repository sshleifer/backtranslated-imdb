Imagine that the true Hitler, a propaganda and a master of the talk, was a kind of portrayal of Carlyle in this movie. <br /> <br /> Nobody would have stayed or disappointed. The guy in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> This is just a part of Hollywood cartoon propaganda, disguised as "true history". <br /> <br /> Everyone who truly believed in this show pityed me. Carlyle and producers have not got any such good things. <br /> <br /> Why did Hitler win so many people, a whole region for his ideas, such as sausage? Why did the people continue to die? The portrait of this loser makes his film incredible. This movie mixes the ancient propaganda of WW2 and the urban myths of MTV about one of the most important people of the last century. Imagine a movie about Churchill, which only shows the 90th minute director. <br /> <br /> This film looks like a shame and I wonder how the actress like Carlyle can dread this dreck.
