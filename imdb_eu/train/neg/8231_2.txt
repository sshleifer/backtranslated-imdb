USING OFFERS ... BUT YOU USE YOUR POSITION! <br /> <br /> Five words in the eyes can be summed up in one word ... Amateur. This movie tries to make it different from the different films of "Blair Witch" ... it does not work ... someone has a cheap video camera, just like a van and ends with feeling. he decided to make a movie. The story is not an explanation, the protagonist does not give a real motivation (and it looks like a lesbian with five girls) and there is no violence ... only the sounds of shouting and crossing. The whole movie takes place inside a van and it means decent landscapes. Five girls do what they really do with the one they give, but in general, they find great actors ... but the material provided is difficult if they can judge ... ALL THE FILES goes through. shouting, embarrassment, and whistling ... it's been said that it's been so hard to say and say the cameras are so bad. This video paints it as a violent film, but in fact, five girls in a terrific horror van ... literally complete the entire movie ... after 5 hours we will finish it. There are still all the cries and five girls still alive ... one finger. The only actress to get up (get ... finger ...) was a hard-hitting actress for the poor and probably lost their voices (and their pride) after a great film. Do not judge the author ... you will be very upset.
