I have a serious problem with this show, sometimes really. The simple list will be enough today, I will go further: superficial characters, laughing and boring humor. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to see the rest, you will only be reviewing and reading to feel high (I do not see anything like this in the show) I will summarize a Canadian teenager frequently: it sucks her friends because she not only does it It's because it destroys it. Good television shows (Arrested Development, Dexter, etc.). Friends TV reality television, "Two And A Half Men" and "The King of Queens" are blamed as a TV director. Now, again, with the review. <br /> <br /> These characters do not have the soul, they are exactly the same in every way (outside the genre and hair color). The same modes react in dreadful situations and are completely safe in their body. Where is the conflict and the next mood? Why does Rachel not move around Monica, as she starts with Rachel's enemy? Why does Joey not commit suicide, no one does it seriously? Now, that is the mutually confused and comfortable. This is the curse of being perfect characters: permanent conflict and personality (forbidden God) becomes impossible. <br /> <br /> The foolishness is the only thing that should have died. The show with oneself is very funny, almost certainly. How can generalization be so broad? The show that says "comedy" calls for someone's laughter BE VERY UNDERSTANDING, it means that the audience will not laugh. Smile destroys humor by avoiding coming out faster. Humor becomes a construction rather than a free entity (see the Office, the detainee developed). <br /> <br /> This leads to the next point: humor is boring. A humorous perfect character has no way (apparently without a laugh) our daily humor due to our fault statement. So it was 17 years old? Immediately acknowledges that what he does is not correct and breaks him. It must be something like conflict, but immediately. Perhaps he or she knows his mother or one of his friends tries to try to get rid of it. It would be great, it would be like a custody battle! So now I have given evidence about my position. Many of my friends love this show because they have not heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development, because many of my friends hate this concept because they began to see Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. <br /> <br /> I've seen very few "my friends" in my life, but I've seen enough enough to see enough, but I think it's totally unwatchable. If you have read it now, thank you, and I hope you see at least one of the shows I have mentioned.
