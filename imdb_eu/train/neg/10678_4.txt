This movie has been seen well: good cast, permanent leaf and open explosion. He dropped down. Why was the manual camera shot? It trembles, judges, participates in the scene and merely mixes the viewer. It is inefficient. If that were not enough, the worst memories of memory will be a drug inspector - if you want to enjoy it. And then it makes the worst sin. After exhausting the viewer with a lot of unlikely and impossible scenarios, they throw their credits without revealing disadvantages - the final money, why was the hell? How do you expect to achieve success without the excitement? Doh! This movie was a great promise and the face began to grow in a mud plant. What an effort is A bad effort by the writer and director.
