The definition of an abomination defined by Webster's dictatorial is "a cause of abuse or disgust". If someone thinks Alone in the Dark with the right word or definition, let me know, that's the best. However, I do not feel, however, this word describes how truly this movie is. <br /> <br /> I went along with two classmates to watch this movie. Person has similar tastes, the other is a guru of action / adventure film. This last type does not have to take into account the size of the soil, if the film has a lot of explosions, it will be happy. <br /> <br /> When we said, we went to the theater to watch it on Friday. Alone in the Dark. In my opinion, the only person we were in the theater. When I started, I immediately learned why. The beginning of any movie starts with the worst and unfortunately it's a bit worse for me. The first scene is a 5 minute scroll text. However, I understand why it was told. The director has had to understand the illiterate only to watch this movie PAYING's thoughts. However, the first scene is the longest scroll text in the history of cinema, but it does not make sense. The same sequence seems to be listening to the movies completely separated. One relates to an ancient civilization and manipulation of a portal, the other is a crazy scientist and has his orphan experiments. If you read this and you're mistaken, you're not alone. <br /> <br /> Then it starts with bass story, acting, effects and camera work. Tara Reid is a horrible actress. In the second, he also has no doubt that you are the curator of the museum. Slater is bad, not convincing, and has no chemical with Reid. <br /> <br /> Earth is probably the worst thing that man has created. They ask about the whole time with classmates with myself and similar tastes: What's this? And what's up? Not only does this waste scroll, but also the sequences told by Slater himself. Are they good? NO. Do they explain something? NO. Do we not think the audience at any moment think about what would happen? Again, no. <br /> <br /> Then we have a random sex scene. We are told that Slater and Reid are together, but they do not act as if they were in charge of others. But then BAM ... sex scene. I do not know again I admit, I do not know, after 30 seconds, after a shameful scene, we shoot 20 of the military and other foreigners. This creates a heavy-metal track and creates brain bleeding, than ever thought. <br /> <br /> And if that was not enough ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no major villain. There is a scientist and there are "strangers". At one point, the scientist controls strange things and places himself on a hill to attack the military chariot. Why? How became the supreme commander of these things? Why are you listening? I do not know again <br /> <br /> The movies are roamed in an evacuated city of Slater and Reid. Why did they demolish the city? Are they alien stuff? Did the military say it? Who knows ... and who cares? I did not have it and you did not. <br /> <br /> <br /> But to finish, a stranger Slater and Reid attack them. Although it appeared to be clear that the strange things before the sunlight will die. And that's right, you guessed it, it's bright and bright in the middle of &% $ day. Perhaps, the foreigners bought a pair of sunglasses, I do not know and I do not like it. <br /> <br /> Now, after finishing the movie, I left the theater, I reached 6 centimeters of 6 meters. I do not see my arms and my afro tremble to see this movie. Even though my gung-ho action / adventure roommates (who just cut one film and paste 2 an hour of explosion into a movie would be the greatest thing that ever would have been) accepted the plot holes were very prominent in this movie. <br /> I give 0.0 / 10 to summarize this CRAP-FEST and I would give it less if possible. <br /> <br /> Actually, the worst film ever made. I would not like this movie about my worst enemy.
