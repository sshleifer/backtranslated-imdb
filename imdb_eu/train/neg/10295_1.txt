There is a lot of pretentious people who say it gives thanks to some beautiful meanings, and ignorant ignorances like me do not get it. That means we must stick to the Hollywood dumps. <br /> <br /> I think that all the artistic works of the book, right from here, think that the director was good. Almost an almost paroxysm that supposes itself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The director of "Ratcatcher" (almost equally shameless) returns with another piece of work in the artistic return; Understanding is difficult and apparently an alienation investigation. The best way to describe this movie is its strange audience.
