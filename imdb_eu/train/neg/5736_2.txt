The worst movie I've ever seen! You can randomly extract 5 people from the streets, and in this movie you can play it better than anyone else. Without losing time. I just like the movies I like just 2, but that's just dirty. Playing (and that's why I'm using it very much) is abysmal, so please tell me, that the top 5 players have made their first movie? Do not waste your time watching. The hostel was a better film. I can not believe that someone has spent money, I hope that the benefit of producers does nothing more than 50,000 dollars - it seems to be a school project, which children have no trace of. Do you also come to the cinema?
