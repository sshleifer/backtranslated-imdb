Although the film was part of the Ivy League, it was shot in the north of Arizona, especially in the Northern Arizona University of Flagstaff in the fall of 1976. I was in the theater department. They are members of the theater department in the film. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the scene is totally entertaining (if you know Arizona geography), the unit of the unit shows the university's bike ride in the stream. We know the NAU'er campus and say about the river (In truth, Oak Creek Canyon) about 35 miles, and all this is a steep slope, it would be literally impossible to ride a bike on the same road!
