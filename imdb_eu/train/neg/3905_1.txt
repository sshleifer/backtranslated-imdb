Forget Plan 9, this is the latest fiasco, dress up a drama, director, scriptwriter, playwright, etc. This movie is not so much better in the novel by Isabel Allende. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (not in Spanish films), and other actors, such as Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons, try hard to overcome this dramatic script. A lot of mistakes (for example, when it's snowing at Christmas in Chile?) And very cruel, with a ton of evil called "magic realism", this is the worst film of all time. It's totally sucking !!!
