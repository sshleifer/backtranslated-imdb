THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S BUT !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is like a "bad acid" trip for children under 5 years old. I would be 4 years old every month. me "Why was this rabbit blood in my mouth" or "why bulldozers bury the rabbits?" (And that was not the worst). We stopped about 1/2 hours but we did damage. Very morbid, oppressive, violent. Fortunately, all the forgotten things have been forgotten. Anyone who decides to place their children on their children should be charged. ... (Let me get on, consciousness is clear).
