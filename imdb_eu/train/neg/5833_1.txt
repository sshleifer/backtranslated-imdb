3 lbs Stanley Tucci is a self-indulgent self-proclaiming producer / mood doctor. Unlike the house, it has absolutely no personality and Unlike Gray Anatomy, brain surgery cases are also not interesting. This program must be implemented in a Master's in Neurlogical Cases - nothing is ever going to be interesting or exciting! Nor does he call his pathetic feud "feud" and adds to the show, nor are these hallucinations. In the lead, dad has been a short acknowledgment of the social life of the shoulders - repeat! boring and amazing <br /> <br /> This show has pants, for a moment we have a lot of medical drama and at the moment it does not have any distinctive character.
