While the premise behind the house of the magical house can be compelling, the execution is very pathetic. I do not know where I have to start with this movie as I had so many problems. I think I will count some of them: <br /> <br /> 1st Session? When Edward Albert, Doug McClure and Susan George (and teeth) see the stars of your movie, do you know that you're in trouble? I do not care much for myself, but they are not nearly A-List names. Susan George may have liked the two films that I liked, but I've never seen the greatest actor ever. And in this movie his performance is shameful. In the remaining two cases, the less they will say it better. 2. Ghosts? Ghosts or spirits or everyone who wants to call you reminded me that they liked the world of monster in Disney World. And they are terrifying. And why were they so clear? Subtility is not the home where the criminal's home is the main feature. <br /> <br /> 3. Plots ?? What can a movie preview be? The result of this movie is a great deal when you come across the top three characters. If you can not see where you can see no more than fifteen minutes, you'll see more movies. <br /> <br /> 4. Pleasant Priest ?? What are some of the Japanese monks that are on the side of the street you buy? One of them knows the history of your home and also asks you to go through the door and ask to help you take away the evil spirits. It is a word that reminds the absurd. <br /> <br /> 5. Anything else ?? It is very difficult to think positive writing for me. I think it's going to be an opening scene and an architectural point of the house. Is that a safe sign of a winner? Reminding about architecture referring to any movie does not mean much about movies. <br /> <br /> I will stay. You should get the idea of ​​what I have already mentioned. And I did not even mention the annoying little girl or the Crab Invention or many other problems. Cautious, that's a great thing.
