Where do they make money for such movies? I mean, there's nothing to do with this film. No known actor, writing is horrible, photography is faint, the story revolves around the bad version of Repo Man and the nickelodeon of Western and incredible interpretation. In every film, someone who sees bad and good, I must confirm that this film is the worst thing I've ever seen since the 50s. I do not like trying to get rid of the efforts of people trying to create an entertainment or, nevertheless, I do not like art, but it does not seem like any movie. The story becomes a bad version of Celtic Soul food, it's a mystical contamination, even though the male succubo works without sex. They need to be scared with the good friends of a country that can not escape. Take it from there, hey, it's the best part. My advice is that, unless you have bad mythology, love writing, convincing play and boring settings, it's better for you to rent this video when you rent it on the shelf.
