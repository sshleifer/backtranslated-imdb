When you are looking at the little man, you will spend a long journey trying to imagine its holes. And this is not a good sign because this movie is a comedy! You think you're laughing !! But do you want to? Probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem with a small man is his concept - his acceptance is very horny (also comedic comedy), so that whistleblowers, jobs and top-notch whispers generally. The thing seems ten times as stupid as it is. <br /> <br /> "But it's a comedy," some of you might scream. It's true, but this slogan is not an excuse for this. Go ahead, think if you see a baby with A GROWN MANS FACE, will not you be the least suspicious? And if Calvin had wanted to hide the diamond, why not put it on a nearby shelf instead of a random handbag? And how is it not recognized by a qualified doctor that an adult male calf? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about the plot, about laughter" it might be cried. Well, what we see, there is hardly any laughter in a small man, and that's just a mute ass on the plot that stands out even more. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see the comedy of the Wayans brothers, letting the plot stop, the white sticks, at least, laughed at them.
