After seeing this, I thought myself; There are many good writers and directors or producers. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is horrible. It's horrible to not make fun, but your teeth break and shake. The film "is wrong" cries out. The immersion is zero. Now, in most cases, it's probably a lot of faults / extravagant errors in the hacker computers, etc. This movie is everywhere. <br /> <br /> The good news of the movie is Emily, a little girl, played by Elijah Bennett. I turn it into a great and at least something worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Please, do it for yourself. Ignore this There is no proper action. Loss of time
