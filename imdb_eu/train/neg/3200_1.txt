It's Joe Don Baker ... Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, Roy Rogers would laugh at the cowboy dress and yellow fool. In any case, it still has a plate, probably living in Texas, and they will leave everything law enforcement. <br /> <br /> This greaser is a representative of the sheriff near the Texas border. It's not surprising that he was once Texas Ranger, but he thought he was supposed to play laws with his own discretion. This includes the shooting of suspects in Mexico, suspects, cheating guns, threatening women, shooters that can be avoided and threatened to endanger the life of a child threatened in the international border. He ordered him to protect him and kill him to get out of prison, etc., etc. The guy LA looks like the police look like saints. <br /> <br /> When they kill their partner, their partner in Italy kills Joe Don's characters and kills one of them. Then, he rolled another one to Mr. Italo by hand, he thinks straightforwardly, Joe Don thinks it will take a great deal of time. In the run-up season, he loses Italian and starts a malt case in that process. This is just that, when Joe Don turns his back on him, it's one of the greatest deaths and destruction. The first one is looking for Malas Palermo (Italian killer). <br /> <br /> This is how part of mobius starts. Our heroine arrested the film, the talks he led the police in Malta, he emerges and creates more problems, arrests him, teaches the police chief ... and so on. If you want to blow yourself up with a blanket gun with Joe Don, and be afraid of it. <br /> <br /> Joe Don proves his usability, not only for the first time he runs away from Palermo, but he continues in the following aboard. which goes down in a single punch. Then he will take Palerm to a woman after dressing a woman. Palermin really will enter the basement because he expects you to steal the cell, but threatened the stripper was not going to leave, because he ordered him to protect himself. His throat is cut immediately (a big surprise) and Joe Don escapes at night. <br /> <br /> And here it was expected that it might be overwhelmed (one more) in the harassment of the boats. But he does not even want the ocean, and he was taken by a poor family of slums on the shore (what did he deserve?) Returns to the city because he was arrested by the police. police ... arrrgghhh! The running police woman releases to go to Palerm. Why he would have thought of something without head, because this great stone that destroys his route surpasses me. The head is just strange. <br /> <br /> Palermo goes to the house where they hide and start a shot. Joe Don shook his dumb and Palermo dies. Afterwards, he adds to the brilliant and brilliant line of the film: "My plate is great. Will you come to me?" Thank you for this immortal line, Mr. Baker This will reduce the analysis of the history of the film in a film, the latest, literate, amazing and wonderful line written by a character. It undoubtedly binds everything else about nature. Bravo
