(Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart and co.) Is an English-language version of the Disney version. <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie to be good. Really, really I am a fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the glittering opinions on this Miyazaki movie, I was eager to see it. But I was surprised, I was surprised because of the quality of this movie. Later on, these films were well-developed plots, three-dimensional characters, and the best movie music ... well ... never. This movie is not approaching. <br /> <br /> Or you can start with positive aspects. Like all Miyazaki films, this is still very imaginative, imposing fantasy / science fiction in a post-apocalyptic world, where insects are the main species. Nausica may have a lot more animation for other films of that time. As beautiful and light as Miyazaki's films, the English voice is quite well done. <br /> <br /> But this movie ... just ... is not good ... The character is cardboard: A sweet muscarine blend, between the evil and evil Tolmets. After seeing each one after 30 seconds, there is everything you've seen. And the one who leaves the plot does not help. <br /> <br /> Then there's music ... Now Hisaichi is involved in my right-wing movie musicians, but Nausica does not do justice. Half of the 80s keyboards are in the overdrive and usually come in and out of it so obvious that it helps them to distract images. I think they composed a lot of music before seeing this photo from Hisaia. <br /> <br /> But wait! There's a great message with this movie, right? Let's keep the environment! It's very bad that you're immersed in this movie. There is a scene where Nausica embraces a tree. No, really. I'm not joking. <br /> <br /> It's a bit sad to talk about what the film is about for me. But for some reason he seems to worship all the other IMDb reviews. And when the character talks about the lengthened sentences with himself, it is mistaken. <br /> <br /> Animate anime, a person who enjoys 80's music and planting a tree. Arbor every day, I would definitely like this movie. Otherwise, you save your money for later movies, because they take a great deal of time.
