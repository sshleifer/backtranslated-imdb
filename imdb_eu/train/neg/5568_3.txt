Dolph Lundgren is looking for a great scene in Boston to find out who was the brother of his brother, who was well aware of the community. However, her brother enjoys kinky sex and is a serial killer. fault Dolph Lundgren is very good in this movie, in fact, according to its performance, the actions that would take Lundgren's reputation to the attention would be forgotten. The material he said did not give anything to work with Lundgren, he leaves Lundg in a dull thriller that is totally foreseen and incomprehensible. Co-Star Danielle Brett is also a good contributor to the film about the chemistry of Lundgren and Bretten, if it were a fair time to study the relationship between these films. However, the movie is missing, the action does not exist, the plot does not have enough exploration (a very boring BS about Lundgren's brother's research on the employer) and the movie is gory and ridiculous. Once again, Lundg's really good (Danielle Brett, like the new outing), but the movie begins with a sequence that is particularly disappointing. Whatever else it is, it shows what is stressed by Lundg as an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 4 (poor 4)
