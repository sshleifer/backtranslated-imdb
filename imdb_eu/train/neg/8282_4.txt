Now, you already have to know about Jessica Simpson's "bomb" movie directly (limited and anemic theater theater). Basically, Mrs. Katie of Simpson travels to a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend, strangely enough to find another woman in bed. Sheve is detained, but a friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, I want to see the movie more often), who leaves her. Katie ends up working through two conventional collaborations (Penelope Ann Miller and always funny Andy Dick) for Katie's (Larry Miller) President. This is a short film, which does not want to be profound. Jessica Simpson has not been a great actor anymore, but she's pretty pretty and not really annoying. The movie is silent, but it is not odd. In a kameo, Penny Marshall is fun (a joke about Milwaukee laughed me), and there's a fun scene with Norwegian priests (do not read too much). So it's not horrible, but easy to skip. It's always safe to watch your safe bet on TV. Again, it's not good, but it's not a profound catastrophe.
