A movie about the murderer is surprisingly sad. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens, and when things happen they do not even create any excitement or interest. <br /> <br /> The two good leads are affecting, Cassetti gets performance in particular, combining Suzco's certainty and stupidity, but the rest of the casts also need what they need. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the writing is bad and the direction and the story is not as interesting as it is, Succo is not a special character, it is not interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> Such films usually create tension or empathy or an outrage which creates nothing but a feeling of regret, when you watch your time.
