I expected that this film was a lot better than I expected. I'm glad I did not see this movie and I did not sit in such a movie theater. Where did this movie begin, the acting in this film was an average, the humor was horrible and the story of this film was not unique. I thought this movie was great, but it was not time to lose it. I think that acting in this movie was a great sign that there were no actors in this movie, but it was not there. I think it could be another actor that was better than Jay Baruchel of Kirk, but the time I saw this movie was very high and I did not feel that it was in this movie. Now Alice Eve made a brilliant actress but there was no chemistry between himself and Jay. All the actors in this movie were not names and they did very little in this film. The humor of this movie was not funny anymore, because some of the films were good, but they told you that they understood anything. He thought it was difficult with Jim Field Smith, who could not decide whether he wanted romance or comedy. I honestly have to follow Burger King ads. I think this movie could have been better if a few writers went to another director. The story of this movie agrees with all the other beautiful girls with good love stories, it is more boring to think it would be better if it were more original, but nothing. I would not recommend honesty to see this movie. I think that you will have more entertainment in the dentist than in this movie. So keep yourself agonized and do not see it.
