One of the worst movie I've ever seen is that the graphics are fun and the pathetic script and the main question is how to get the low brow through the script process. <br /> <br /> I like it. In the midst of dramatic movies, to kill all kinds of movies that are directed towards men, so I can not say anything. I have tried to find something I want to compare, but I can not think of anything with them, maybe the ship's soldiers. 2. In my opinion, the witch cries out to the movie god and I think they will throw my DVD player, but in front of it, the effects are very good. An excellent event and script must be provided. You know the movie is fun in the wrong way, well, people are not one of them killing your soul for a minute.
