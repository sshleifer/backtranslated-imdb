After watching the sun behind men, I expected the evolution of style and technique to match the larger scale of this movie. I tried to make one of the toughest fictional stories about what happened to Japanese atrocities, but that's not it. He acts as a European and European film of the mid-70s. SS Experiment Camp etc. (Perhaps as with the Deported Women in the Special Section). Given, more scope and more people work, but it does not play the same cheap, cheerful, non-hateful actress as the one who is falling into the sound of false high-quality guns. sequence The footage of the documentaries is immense, that these scenes are involved, since they are stealing the most of their true images. Check out the 4-channel 'The Holocaust' (lately (still running), since 1 year 2006), a truly disturbing documentary about warlike diseases (a real good footage of the context). This is a type of treatment worthy of Nanjing's horror, not a waste of exploitation (as well as a better exploitation, inappropriate stockpile use would be fine, but it is not a very good one). Rating: 3 (5 operating as a treatment for 1 theme).
