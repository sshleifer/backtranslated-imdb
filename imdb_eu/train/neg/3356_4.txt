Shirley Jackson's novel The Haunting of Hill House is a great story that puts supernatural phenomena in an old palace. The environment is well-organized and the cold are well-organized. An awesome masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The 1963 'The Haunting' chiller is closely linked to the book, but adding its details to the plot. Fortunately, there are very few, so the fear of the book and the cold are even better on the screen. Black and white photography adds to the movie. Excellent! <br /> <br /> And then Jan de Bont did this. In 1999, The Haunting's remake hit theaters: this is a remake. They had to make a remake of the 1963 movie, which is why it is a mystery, but for now we allow ourselves to study the same movie. <br /> <br /> It starts mainly with most horror films. The set in the Hill House is beautiful and mysterious, and in a few minutes it seems that the movie will appear again. And then, the first fear has come: a loose cord clabcordian oppresses the woman's face (Dr. Marrow's assistant). They're hilarious, and, in fact, I was tired. <br /> <br /> From now on, the movie goes down. The plays seem to be wooden images, as the film progresses, because Owen Wilson is particularly angry (so the channel is just as good as this relief). <br /> <br /> The special effects almost make this film. , that is, it is shameful, most of them very cursed and look very dated. There are many examples of them, so I do not worry about listing. <br /> <br /> So I highly recommend, with others, to see the original chiller, or alternative, buy the Shirley Jackson novel. But please, stay away. And if you decide to watch it, watch on TV (many channels like this movie, not the original one), or rent cheap, but do not buy, everything you do. Do not waste your money! <br /> <br /> Last evaluation: 4/10
