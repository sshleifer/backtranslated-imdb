The Hollywood Hotel was the latest musical music by Busby Berkeley, directed by Warby Bros. He changed his direction of direction or evolved that this film does not have a direct signature or a large quantity of production with thousands of add-ons. During the last years of the 1930s, broad bandwidth styles were the most prestigious throughout the year. Swing Era, also called the Big Band Era, from 1935 to 1944 or between 1939 and 1949. Although not exactly the Swing Era, Benny Goodman is committed to Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles. At the end of the summer of 1935, no doubt, it was one of the initial manifestations when entering into the awareness of the main American youth. When Goodman revealed his musical repertoire of dance music as a musical dance, the young audience became wild. This was the beginning, but since the first methods to spread phenomena, radio, live concerts and oral word, it was necessary to take some time to produce great hits that emerged in the pope. The filmmakers who appeared in the Hollywood hotel, Benny Goodman and His Orchestra and Raymond Paige and His Orchestra, expressed their willingness to go for a musical taste, which only produced one and a half years after the Goodman's Palomar Hall. There are some interesting music moments at the Hollywood hotel, but Benny Goodman and His Orchestra's "Sing, Sing, Sing," are not highly recommended. Otherwise, the most interesting sequences of music are "Hooray for Hollywood" parade and "Let That Be a Lesson to you" production number in the drive-in restaurant production number. An interesting movie is to see and hear Benny Goodman; his orchestra's theater and Dick Powell and Frances Langford singing.
