Somehow, the concept behind the story was an interesting mix of typical types of films in an interesting combination. However, as the point of this movie was not so obvious, it was not worth the shots. I felt like I thought about the mysterious explanation of the illness against the disease. <br /> <br /> Writers have only received topical issues from other films when adapting their writing lines. true characters The actors did not help in matters. No chemical I think they suppose a certain attraction to develop as a key element in these stories. However, writers did not work hard to develop chemistry. Of course, both are attractive, but they seem to be attractive or open to each other. Sabato's character is a hated physician, it's just to play with rules. Think of Jeff Goldblum's "Independence Day". Normally, this type of nature is supposed to show a type of talent or brilliance. It is not a Sabato nature. Happy is Cassandra, with all the abilities of the prophecy of a magic ball of eight. It seems that random random play. <br /> <br /> The scenes of death are comical. The actor was trying more than once to reveal their agony. The symptom looked like a bad one, like the 80's video, Peter Gabriel, I think.
