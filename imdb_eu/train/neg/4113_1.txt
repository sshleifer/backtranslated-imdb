I started watching the movie, regardless. This movie was seated quickly. "Sparkling" bullets, as the "ninja" reporter moves, the bad boys are shooting hundreds and hundreds of bullets and it seems that the audience goes to innocent people, the expected outcome and the bad game has been tremendous. As a girl who finds the reporter in the apartment of her friends and "what you are doing just like you are doing here" ("one,") ", you're nice, @ # $%!" 1.2 seconds ... Very bad ... Save yourself an hour and fifty minutes and go play with your children (or dog)!
