Host / Saw Buzz was a significant b-grade entry, but the expectations for this movie were very low (very low!) And yet, at all levels, it failed. The performance is so bad, not even fun, the line line did not exist and it was incredible to see that I was losing 21 hours and a half! I'm surprised I received a score of 10 stars with 34 people. I can only think of 33 of them Cast and Crew. 34. Is it possible for the mother of the director? - Even though I'm sure it would go higher than 2! The DVD supplement is an "hourly" extension. This asks the question: "Why?" (Maybe it's worth showing!). Avoid at all costs.
