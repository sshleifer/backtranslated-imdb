A large star that fell from the face of the Earth would end up in a small town with drug traffickers and a problem with the body of a federal agent. Join together with some co-operative people to clean up the town. <br /> <br /> The low key, often with shamelessness, is a "comedy" action that does not work anymore. The part of the problem was with Chris Klien as an acting hero. It's not a bad thing, but it's not as incredible as someone who is so hard. Because I was not saying badly, it does not matter about the deck story. The problem is really the combination of the script, which is not really fun and is sometimes artificial, and the pedestrian direction at the port of dizziness. There are no lifestyles that arise. The director is like a list of shots as if it were going through that list. It makes an unforgettable movie. However, the films are occasionally created, at the end of the film's final show. This sequence works, but because the front part of the film has drained most of its power. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend the movie. It is worth the kick if you are a fan of actors or a great fanfare of independent cinema in all its forms, but otherwise, this is nothing wrong.
