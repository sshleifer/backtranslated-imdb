That night I saw things "There is" one of them. Sometimes they are excellent. This was terrifying, but it was not really necessary. <br /> <br /> The movie was very good. How can you fail Charleston Heston and Jack Pallance? Here we are the winner of the Oscars. He had special effects. Even though the tits are very good! And I mean that the whole breast of the well-displayed breast and the beast at one point. But he did not need to compensate for a component - a story! The land was playful. I do not say things about the "sun crisis" sun, but that was bad enough. The other things were: a bad and completely predictable corporation. MAN is just STANK! It does not work well or move around that beautiful spaceship or battle scene scene. I have seen wonderful science-fiction films, with small errors and budgets. Everything is in writing.
