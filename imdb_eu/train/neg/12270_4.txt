This ghost movie by Kiyoshi Kurosawa is pretty wild and at least I feared that jump had caught me guard. But, altogether, the movie is stupid and, with a detective trying to find the killer of the suspect series, he can make a crime. Then she thinks she looks like a beautiful Asian lady, and she's not why (and not the viewer) why. As they commit themselves to other murders, they are even more confused as murderers are easily found, and this ghost hangs for some reason. The plots are completely stupid, the ghostly lady is more fun than anything, especially when suddenly the city flies, like Wonder Woman. And the end is not meaningless, in fact, the whole movie does not make sense, and I can not recommend it. If he did not take it so seriously, I would think it was a black comedy. Beyond the "Bright Future", I have still seen the worst movie directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa.
