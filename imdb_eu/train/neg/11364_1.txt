The first ten minutes of this film about making an international film in Belgium will be fine: in the group you see a real chaos, a nerve breaker, a cool director (Mickey Rourke), the bad news. stars, etc. See everything before, but it's fine. BUT BUT! In the rest, it repeats the movie: ten equal minutes again. No climate, no dramatic development, good performance, bad interpretation and continues. Mickey Rourke takes a couple of minutes to tell his character about his horrible career and a fictional scene. In total, it takes 12 minutes. <br /> <br />
