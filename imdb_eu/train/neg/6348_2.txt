Nonsense completely dissatisfied. The material was dull, dull, dull, and most of the cast did not make any studies in the first films of Allen. And listening to unfunny Will Ferrelle makes imitation of Woody Allen Ferrell refuses even more (though strictly mysterious) side. It seems that Allen was 70 years old when he had to work when he watched the clock in a new century. <br /> <br /> I really tried to take part in the film, but it was impossible; my rumors could not light it up. So when I was sleeping in the afternoon and dying in the afternoon, I got up, leave my wife and daughter in the theater and leave to read the car again (a great book by George Bailey 30 years ago, "Germans.") The day went well, after all, thanks to Woody .
