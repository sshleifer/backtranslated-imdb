As many agree, Originally it is a beautiful artistic artist. The music, graphics and worlds created are the ones that are above the most modern animation works. However, if you are looking for more than that, I suggest you somewhere else. Beauty looks a bit unpredictable, and when the plot and characters really go down, there is nothing special. The action is slow and minimal and people are flat, sometimes crisp and do not act realistically. Here you do not need to mention the holes in the plot and the holes in the plot ... So, in summary, oh my God, I have never seen this beautiful anime any longer; and Oh, my God, it's so nice ... people do not act like this. GIANT had to take a step in the graphics and music of the anime, but even a few steps to unfavorable characterization, and unfortunately there is not much such action ...
