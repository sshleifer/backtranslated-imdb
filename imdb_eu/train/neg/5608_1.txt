It was funny to watch this movie. Many people seemed excited. I also have my opinion. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open to opinions or opinions. It does not matter to me, if it were written in the Bible by Jesus. Whether Mary was a virgin or a similar, other relative origin. It is a salvation for me, the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> When it's an annoying phrase, it does not show the context that is presented as an event. For example, in this movie they showed off after a great sentence: "I brought my enemies who do not want to kill me and kill me in front of me" Jesus (Luke 19:27) What did they do? it's context. Jesus told a story about a nasty king. There is no vibration in Jesus' death. It's love! After mentioning biblical errors, people with hatred (Pseudo-Christians) hate us. Most viewers do not control the information presented, so starting thinking about Jesus = hatred = is not good for me or for anybody else. This is just manipulation. Please use your brain. Do not take what you say in this movie. Our base, when we begin to destroy our civilization, that way Jesus dissolved and brought us this way. You saw the horn that was sitting.
