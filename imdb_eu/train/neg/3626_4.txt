I do not know what the movie Oscars have seen, but they have to see pretty hard-to-see things to see, to reward the best Oscars. I know Gene Kelly was about to play, or I think it would be twice as bad. First of all, I do not think that Leslie Caron will play so much this role. He does not have much talent, he is not a great dancer and does not look good. It's a pity that an actor or an actor might ruin the movie as it is playing, if Leslie Caron was not there, it could be a wonderful movie. The story was intelligent, the management was not bad, and, as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I do not think about everything about Leslie Caron, I think it's a worse part of the movie to criticize him, I mean. Probably a good actress, but I can not notice because I have not seen anything else, but I think it was pretty bad in "Paris in America." So, if you want to see it, go ahead, but I tell you, it's better to watch "Singin 'in the rain."
