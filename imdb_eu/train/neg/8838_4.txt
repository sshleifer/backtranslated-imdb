Are there any similarities with Ray Lawrence's "Jindabyne" and "Lantana" movie? A dead body and its consequences for life already functions. But while he offered "hope" and "Lantana" resolution, "Jindabyne" is not overlooked by unsuspecting audiences, perhaps even deceiving. <br /> <br /> The story - the corpse that moves from a distant river to the discovery of a fisherman - is based on a story by Raymond Carver. Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" became an element of 1993 classic. Lawrence uses this topic to analyze and show relationships in a small Australian state based on stress. The film raises some moral questions "Does the discovery of an unholy man break your good weekend?" and more to the Australians poetic "Will the dead be a difference in an aborigine?" The play, especially Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is recommended. And there are elements of mysticism driven by haunting music, unlike "Hanging Rock" picnic. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it seems like a base for a great movie - let's get it ready, the rhythm is very slow and close to the beginning of murder, thus eliminating the mystery element. So, we are left with the destruction of life and the end.
