Born Again is the first episode of the season. He deals with the theme of reincarnation and he just does not fly. I have never had much reincarnation, and this may be my apathy in this section. He refers to the case of Tooms with a pleasant follow-up from the previous section. But there are positive ones. It is unlucky because it occurs at the beginning of the section. I think a dead boy decides to re-enter the body of a girl who has nothing to do with it. And he waited until the girl turned eight years into a twist. Mulder & Scully is also a terrific interview to spend the episode. If you entered the reincarnation, maybe this section will become your alley. If you are not there, you can know at least what is bradycardia.
