Yes, reason. <br /> <br /> The first time I waited patiently for the movie to start. It was very terribly boring and, above all, the people around the hills were randomly moving without apparent direction. Then the hero enters the picture. He was born in Asia, but when he grew up he became white. Of course, white. The passage of Asia was not very close. He looks like Justin Timberlake. He was very attentive, and the story did not do anything to help the cause. Fake fighting sequences and bad conversations. It lasts for an hour and forty-five minutes, and at last I wanted to eat my face. I've seen this asking people that I'm working with always asking people to ask me well. Now I have an answer. It goes like this: ahem. "No, no good God! That's why I do not do this yourself! I'd recommend another movie, maybe an entertaining one."
