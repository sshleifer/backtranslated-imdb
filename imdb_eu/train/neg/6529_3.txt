This movie is fun and painful at the same time. "Cinema-maker" gave me almost a crisis. According to the saying, "cinemagical" is not an innovative technical procedure. As an accident he "developed" and used it because his "monsters" were so stupid. I do not think coincidence that the writer is Sid "Pink". <br /> <br /> This movie is a laugh, if you're looking for a movie made out of 200,000 dollars per day. It's entertaining; I can say at least about it. It is the most notable one / rat / spider.
