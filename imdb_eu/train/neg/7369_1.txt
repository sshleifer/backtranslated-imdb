I was sorry after "Submerged", that would not be better ... I was right. She needs to find money and she does not look after the last product ... her voice is repeatedly called by an unknown stranger; The edition is fine, especially for amateurs. It's just a movie with a B or C-grade, enough money to hire a couple's camera and a "sound" designer. <br /> <br /> As indicated in the previous poster, the problem appears to indicate that the submission appears. -production (... voice duplication, etc.) Bad, impact on the plot of an SG movie. <br /> <br /> I will never rent another SG film, if it does not ask for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Very bad - Kelly LeBrock ... I like it ... <br /> <br /> --jimbo
