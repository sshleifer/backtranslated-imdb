I watched this movie in the first theater version, justified in a single theater. Believe it or not, watching movies a few decades afterwards, this is still clear in my mind that it is the worst movie of all time; or, at least, the worst thing I would like to allow myself to observe myself. <br /> <br /> The remote operation is under the standard set by students of high school and forced to flee on the street and learn their lines. 5 minutes or less. <br /> <br /> After the unbelievable first, we laughed a bit when each scene hit the new episodes. But after a while, it was a pleasure that was pleasing and really sad.
