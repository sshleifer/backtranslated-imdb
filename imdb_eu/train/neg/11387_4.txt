Medellin is a wonderful place to live, work and study. I was twice, and I never heard anything from the guerrilla, kidnapped by the paramilitary, or something like that. There's "invisible police", but it's not the * Big Brother system. Every day there are enough police who can appear in everyday life, but those who do not have good cause do not cause problems. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is an interesting documentary that basically transforms young people who make up the movie. characters The director of the film watches over the daily routines of the people of La Sierra, and when a "character" dies, there is a real path. It's hard to imagine, however, that three youngsters are members of the Bloque Metro, because terrorists before La Sierra are a group of terrorists before the Colombian government began to restructure the country. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is not a detailed description of the Colombian life; There are, of course, some caution, such as small crimes, but taking into account pickpocketing, such as London, New York or "modern" cities in Tokyo, it does not look like in Colombia. Colombians are eagerly waiting to show that there is more than ever a country in war over the world.
