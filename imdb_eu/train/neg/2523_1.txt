R O B O T J O X. <br /> <br /> Master burned. <br /> <br /> Groteskely horrible. <br /> <br /> There is no end; without closing <br /> <br /> Make the worst film ever worse. <br /> <br /> "Pluto Adventures Nash" represents the worst film of all time. <br /> <br /> I hate the mistake, posting, correcting, correcting and non-hated a thing called "Robot Jox" - and I've just found - what they did in the SECOND BACK !? Sorry with Adma Sandler (Zohar the Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash). The mess of these things only makes bad movies - it's not horrible and grotesque. This is the only movie I ever mentioned: NETFLIX-E COVER - ORA !!! 10,000 people found 10,000 helpful comments.
