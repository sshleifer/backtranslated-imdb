Ed Norton's face hair was such a treat to enjoy this movie. Without revealing the details of the soil - one evening he was listening to a slight beard, but the same evening his beard was gone and there was a mustache. He was shaved with a mustache that was much larger than the mustache. Later, in a dark night, the mustache was gone and the shelter was clean. That was a moment when the stopping stop was not possible. These follow-up disagreements violated me completely from the rest of the film and ruined his credibility. In addition, De Niro reminded me of the long scene of a cowboy in his room at the Taxi Driver. Although it was a tribute, it was too much for the audience.
