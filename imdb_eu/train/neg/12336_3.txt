I give 10 of these five points, all five brands that Hendrix gives a very decent set of last-minute material. Unfortunately camera quality and editing work is awesome! We have several full faces Hendrix, where he could do almost anything, maybe taking a piss? We do not see your hands on the guitar. Have we left behind many shots in Hendrix? It seems that there are three cameras in Hendrix, but everybody's stupid amateurs. The guy in Hendrix is ​​obviously strolling on stage, as if the guitar was just Hendrix distraction. The knight on the back makes more chicks on the square while he's more than documenting the incredible guitar work (sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider). Vietnam, etc. Even though Hendrix had lived another two years, Berkeley is one of those things that he never saw as an official publication that he would never notice. His only treasure is Johnny B Good, but he is in the bad visuals of that great man, and he is under the Woodstock and Wight island.
