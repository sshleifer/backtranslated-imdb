This movie was a great opportunity, and he betrayed me. This is no less than a black and white excuse to get out of the audience, because it's a great "trikes" given by Bogdanavich, who is egotistical (better than TARGETS). Many young people from the movie come out of this movie, such as the teacher's wife, impotence, ugly prostitute (they're very hard-stitched and they stop stopping things, things will not go anywhere) and slow them down. . <br /> <br /> I suppose this movie is fun for all sexual nonsense, it was just annoying to me. I seriously entertained my finger to wash the nails rather than seeing that mess.
