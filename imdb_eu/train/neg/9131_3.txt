I can not believe this I saw last night after 25 years ... <br /> <br /> 6 I saw the movie Fu ... Boris Karloff and all Chris Lees. The last 2 lies, the director Jess directed (and I used the word). At that time, I jumped, remembering, in some way, WHITE BEGINS. <br /> <br /> Well, I saw it. More. Do you know what a worse movie? Really ORIGIN S piece. And that's FIENDISH PLOT. The film is very good. High-performance design, sets, costumes, music, photography, editing, a good cast, a light play ... <br /> <br /> ... and totally, positively, a FILM IN THE FILM STORY! !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the movie is so deceptive ... this could be a bad deal of a decent movie. And then they begin to sing "Happy birthday to Fu" ... and it goes uphill. Burt Kwouk (the master says, "Your face - who knows it") wants to keep Fu's elixir life to get out of the fire, torture, bury it and cut one of its ears. the most exciting thing was that they had fun. Someone could decide how to make a "campy" movie - so horny it would be fun. RIDICULOUS, it's ... DO NOT ... In any way. <br /> <br /> It's very sad, because it's clear that in the first few minutes, someone has done a lot of research on how to get "so much" around the Manchu series. With another script - one could be a really FUNNY, or a serious death - could - they - have a classic in their hands. I would not forget the movies of Jess Franco for fear of this atrocity ... because he wants to explore the masterpiece, vice versa. <br /> <br /> At the time of the 70's. The whole set of classic characters of the 30s was recovered in films that were universally overwhelming. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, The Lone Ranger, Charlie Chan, and Doc Savage. I'm not sure, this can be a lot worse. He had to take a great deal of self-control, not to advance the whole section, especially with Sid Caesar (the chief of the FBI's cousin Al Capone). Not that the ideas in the film are not fun alone ... they often DO NOT SINCE. The police and representation of the King and the queen are like "audition", and we see people "listening" as dance routines, like singing, dancing and a monocycle. How many drug users should take such a sense? <br /> <br /> As I said, shame ... and the real debris of this tale, such as Peter Sellers (who played Fu and Nayland Smith), Burt Kwouk (who was one of Chris Lee Fu film was in its era), Helen Mirren (the police have caught up with the woman and fell in love with her last movie last half hour!). Do I start to doubt whether some of Fu Manchu will "make a good" movie or do not have fans to take it as a soloist with Karloff?
