Based on the premise that stupid things take place in one of the protagonists of one or more of the horror films, the girls in this film will be joining Gold, Silver and Bronze at an Olympic event at Darwin Awards. The dependency of mentally handicapped people would have had a better chance of doing it better, and would cite much less like doing so. <br /> <br /> If you want films with a grainy image, deliberate camera (my 92 year old) grandmother gets a camera for better results), very poor sound and there are no distinctive lines / narratives; then this is your ideal movie. Note that you should also enjoy: without reason we shout women, women weep for no reason. In fact, reason and logic do not appear much in this film. For example: "We need to find Stephanie," "yes, I can not believe I was talking to her, last night ..." "she called last night?" "Yes, he wanted to talk about some day's questions," "WHAT? Why did he not tell me"? Our friend is using the hands of the serial killer and using wonderful weapons, but I have a problem that he did not tell me it was a date. <br /> <br /> Ok, so the quote is small. This does not mean that the budget costs half. 'Score' is interesting because the writer / director herself wrote and performed all the tracks on the film. In fact, the whole quote seems to have been sampled by the sampling track of The Death Dreams, a Swedish death metal group. <br /> <br /> The whole film is the end of all that is disturbing. a sequel.
