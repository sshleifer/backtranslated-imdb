Let's see - If you've rented a STDVD sequel for one of the forgotten 80 outfits, and if you expect it to be better than the predecessors, you're a fool. Wargames: Dead Code joins the long list of unnecessary monitoring DVDs so easily complies with the DVD market. Such films do not require spoilers, as you already know. <br /> <br /> The "plot" for this "movie" is the following: Nerd finds the girl; girl liked nerd; nerd like girl; nerd unexpectedly participates with Top Secret Government computer; nerd and little girl go to another country; nerd and girlfriends harassment of the Government's clothing in another country; nerd and little girls meet an important elderly man who dies in the "movie"; nerd and girls are caught; The secret government is crazy; nerd is contracted with Top Secret Government Computer; nerd plays Top Secret Computer with the first Wiegames movie "nerd days with the same first Computer Secret"; nerd is put <br /> <br /> End. <br /> <br /> The B rating is expected to be operated, script, effects, scores and cinematography. Some familiar faces are here, and if you're not a fan of Colm Feore, you should avoid this. Surely, the movie is not enough to see your stomach eating your toes, so if you're looking for good STDVDs, you're at home. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Mathew Broderick was too much. He participates with a "masterpiece", that is to say, he could not even play a five-second script. But can you blame it?
