I am currently viewing the Sci-Fi channel. It's very awesome, I can not stop watching! I'm a video clip and I feel sad. I feel bad about anyone with this movie. Some of the camera's good works. It's most doubtful. Flick is a good actress. It was a shame about what the director's relatives had to be surrounded. That may be in a single movie! Music was a bit better than the theater. If you go to see this, I hope there is no other choice! The detachment (or the battle) is coming ... I think I'll skip it! Jason
