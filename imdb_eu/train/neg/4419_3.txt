It was a "Catholic" Catholic school of 11 years, but it has not been for thirty-five years, except for marriage and fun, but I thought I would have a shot. And I did it. . . for the first two-thirds of the film. Everything was ordinary: strict parish school teachings, repressed sexuality, etc. But then, suddenly, he meant the movie. You really mean it. Now, I saw pedophilia scandals knocked before me. . . and I would not have suffered so much from the evil and hateful wickedness of the Catholic Church, and I knew the abominations (such as the Catholic trial!) and coverings. <br /> <br /> It has been a while since I rented the video and I have not rented it again with a new view. In my mouth he left a dirty, nasty and ugly taste. . . I wonder what caused all the church agents, because they either hated them or they were peeling to get the check. The anti-Catholic film is horrible for anyone who has a glittering look at Catholic education. What's going on, because there was no better teacher in the 1950s. Anyway, they had to learn to read and write English. They remembered us. (Now, how many children make simple arithmetic in their heads?) It is true that nothing in America is essential to success. Can not read Can not add / remove / multiply / divide? Great You can get the most advanced level you want. And the discipline of Catholic education will be good for you, not your studies, but also for your whole life, depending on the Catholic "mythology" to be learned. > <br /> Such a great job, an evil and corrupt script. I feel bad (and not, it's not "wrong" - I'm confident, Moo better taught the writer and the director. <br /> <br /> I mixed the emotions surrounding the Catholic school, but the participants in this project sat down in the back of the room They had to be bad (that is, stupid), they were voluntarily involved in this film.
