(Several spoilers continue) <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly. Georges Guetary, who also criticized young and French. Not Leslie Caron, sometimes criticized for her green performance. Not even Oscar Levant, I was not often horrified by Dick. <br /> <br /> No, it would definitely be Gene Kelly. His screen is a character with some ambition and persuades him to convince himself as an innocent artist in Paris, who is constantly in charge of the critics, painting with small children and old ladies and painting on the street. That's what SINGINEN IN THE RAIN and other films have been going through to make them more effective and ambitious. Jerry Mulligan, in a sense, is Tommy Albright's cousin in BRIGADOON, Leller has another story, mixed with American Kelly, in love with a strange European place and innocent woman who embodies her virtues. <br /> <br /> Jerry is not so nice, though Tommy will be amazed. Another curious thing about this movie. Jerry is sometimes Milo and Lise is even worse. When he first watches on a club he gets a dirty trick to dance with him. Seated again, he gets more drowsy for his phone number. He hangs it on the next day to put it in his place. And all of this, of course, does not do anything that he wants. When he began to laugh at his perfume store, he's as compelling as his interest in Milos's paintings. Sure it seems to be good and fun, but why should Henri so immerse himself so that he looks like a knight? <br /> <br /> It is acknowledged for the actress. He played with Judy Garland as a role as Lise, that Jerry was silenced by insults and eyes. If he played Cyd Charisse, he admired to himself. But when Leslie Caron plays the first temple, she looks like a shy teenager and feeble, and as a result Jerry looks like nothing else. And why did you choose the other storytellers (even if I personally changed the version of fixing things I preferred) when the love of the two dearest lovers are linked to love with their older love-lovers? Gene Kelly Guetary and Foch are not only the father of Caron's father for years. <br /> <br /> In short, I think that all of this might have improved the comedy relief by giving some Jerry dancers. the type of music that usually appeared on the media ... such as Ray MacDonald's GOOD NEWS or Bobby Van SMALL TOWN GIRL. Not necessarily those that are not necessarily those. Lise could chase someone who could not find it dangerous without him; On the wall of Chaplines, someone who could really be happy in the wall; The humor and ingenuity that would better contrast Oscar-Levant's sarcastic grumpiness. You might also think of ballet less. And maybe he could give a voice that he sang Gershwin. <br /> <br /> All that Gene Kelly can not give me an impression. Like it Most of his films were horrible, but not this (and others). I do not scorn AAIP itself; It has good points, just like the direction of art. And Leslie Caron, although inexperienced, is charming and has really painted her appearance. Georges Guetary does a great job and his "Stairway to Paradise" is my favorite movie. Nina Foch is beautiful and moving, and she has to finish with LIVE ENVIRONMENT. But not Jerry Mulligan. I would not like that.
