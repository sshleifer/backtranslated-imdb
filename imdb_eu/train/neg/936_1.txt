I do not understand people. Why this film is 8.3 !!!!!! ???? I expected this movie, but about half an hour I wanted to leave the theater. In most reviews on this site, people say that it's one of the best films they've watched (or summer, year, etc.). They say it's a great success. WTF !!!!!!!!! ?????? What effect has it been (Bourne can ride motorcycles, fight better than anyone else who fights and fights)? What do you learn Bourne's character in this movie Absolutely f ****** nothing !!!!!!! Well, there's a lot of action, but what's so great about the movie's action? I do not like cinematography and film editing. The shooter with a great influence on the camera has been much used and is fast (I do not feel like it was easy to follow the supremacy and it was not too much) and I was dizzy. I wanted to save my $$$ something else. <br /> <br /> This movie has no plot. This movie is a bullying of 115 minutes. Bourne, you learn anything in the entire 115-minute part of the movie, when he tries to make perfectionist. In this movie, there is no character development, you do not know anything about anyone, and there are many new characters in this division. Some say that this movie has incredible writing and suspensions. !!!!!!!! ??????????? What to write ???? What a suspense ??? There is no suspense. Bourne is so perfect to do everything I do, I do not think I have to worry about. If it's the best 2007 movie year, I can completely watch movies! <br /> <br /> Many people have also said that Matt Damon's performance in this film is one of his best career (if not the best one). What performance? How many lines did he have in this movie ??? Damon has a bit of respect because I have participated in some of my favorite films and has played different types of characters, but a good actor, one of the films that you can almost ignore, is someone who chooses different types of roles. The lord does not play the same role, but someone from Vin Diesel is an example. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie was very disappointing to me. I do not recommend the movie, but I recommend the first two (Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy) and I definitely recommend reading three books (different films).
