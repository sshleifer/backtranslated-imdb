"The Cat's Meow" has a smart conversation and some good performances, some of them have been surprised. Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected in Chaplin (thanks in part to the excellent hair and makeup made by a talented designer); Joanna Lumley is credible as Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst has won with Marion Davies (although it's hard to ever explain why movies use their roles in real life). But these elements do not have a successful sum. It seems that the scriptwriter is a very hard work of some scenes: meetings between Davies and Chaplin are very well developed, but they are not so hard in the big picture. Some small characters do not have to be there and they do not always behave. The basic argument is illogical (for example, why does Thomas Ince think it's a good idea to say something that Hearst does not want to hear?), And the scene of the parties is repetitive and laborious. I'd like to say a trip to Hearst's yacht. Davies Flapper is the standard type of bubble, not really accurate, and the scriptwriters Chaplin and love ideas are impossible. <br /> <br /> In a strange way, Bogdanovich, in the thirties, seemed to be linked to "The Moon of Paper", similar to that of thirty. He said that the excellent costume designer used only black and cream, because the party's guest gave a very artificial look and only played a stereotypical song of the time (for example, "Yes, we do not have bananas"). Hearst emphasizes "Charleston, Charleston!" The actor seems to have been shooting less than ten minutes before the dance lesson. <br /> <br /> The life of silent films can make wonderful movies, I'm sure, but not at this time.
