About 4 years ago, I liked the movie. I would look again and again. But now ... I do not. Actually, I think this movie would be wonderful for Mystery Science Theater 3000. He has many commercial actors (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg) and a bad plot. My favorite Culkin is walking his bike and finds a gang and a gang member said: "Hey, Tyler, where are you going? MOON?" Check out the classic line: "Do you feel your toes?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's better than "The Good Son".
