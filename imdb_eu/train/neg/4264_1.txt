I decided to play this movie hard. It was a great concept with the terrible script. The story just fluttered, and it was disconnected at best. For this story, there were so many elements that did not explain, or forced them out of real thinking. Things like the story of love could be more widespread, and cannons should be better written. The growing main character was more and more in need of training around. Everyone likes a good story that "overlooks a little", which appeared, but the scripting had no errors. Despite the recent pyrotechnic sequence, it was a choreographic one. This was done with a dreadful boredom <br /> <br /> so it could be so good :(
