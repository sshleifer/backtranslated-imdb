All other comments I already said what I would say, it goes here anyway. I thought I was Italian early in Italy. I did not get bored because it was waiting for something to happen. Who gave the song Dr. About Tarr and Feather? Was Alan Parsons? See this in Brentwood 10 pack and the quality of the wait was awesome. Straight lines and things. The movie was a mere mix. Goofy music and clueless characters. The principal had to know for the first time that the doctor was too much trouble for the patients. I thought the "doctor" that directed the "fight" scene would never end. However, they were very good children. It seems to be swearing that these films throw two naked balls that bind you. I gave 2 nekkid given to women. This bird danced my eyes I wanted to get out. Poes probably made 3,000 rpm in the grave, when it came out of it, based on a story.
