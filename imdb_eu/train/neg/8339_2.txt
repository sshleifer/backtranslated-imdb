This film goes through the circles, and the audience does not know where they are. Initially I thought ... mmmmm, it might have been a really cool movie, but it's just dragging and you just do not know what's wrong. The good actress is a good actress and has played a great role, and the psycho-physical is horrible, but after a while, it does not matter what happens, because there is only this movie. Pity really, this could be much better. <br /> <br /> However, the female head and psycho-psychologist would say that he will have a good career, but will they remember it? well known, or because of the regret they've ever made.
