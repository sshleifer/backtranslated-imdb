The story is first seen, but it does not matter if you plan to make the right script. It is clear that the director did not give his work in the script. At the same time, the cameraman stretched out much time with a few angles that do not match the movie's message. It's even more fun, though, if you take a look at the film's website, the director may choose to make an incorrect camera angle. Because the hunter reminds us. But I've never heard the camera's bad angles ;-) It's a star because the story is fine. Pena da Ti West has not spent much time to review her story. The film is more important than planning. If you have a camera, it does not mean that you need to make the movie immediately ... come on. Everybody can make the movie, but it's not as good as it's all. So, some tips about Ti West include: tagging what you want. Use your time to start planning and not shoot, until it's all downloaded in the script. No doubt you have the capability and the desire - so do not abuse your talents.
