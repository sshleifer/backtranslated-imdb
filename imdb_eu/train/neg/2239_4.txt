Work has already been described by other reviewers; So, when I wanted to see this movie, I would add that it was recognized by Gabrielle Drake as her acknowledgment. <br /> <br /> Miss Drake must have the best and most polished examples of "Posh Totty" committed to celluloid. By the time, Jane Asher approaches the only equally magnificent one. What is the role of musician brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) I liked the likes of Gabrielle I admire, the scenes in this movie will not be disappointed. It has a wonderful image and there are no images left here. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is very poor and its time is very cheap. The song that covers the initial credits continues forever and is horrible.
