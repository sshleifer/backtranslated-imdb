Outside the sky, a group of naked female hairstyles (with large plastic shells) live in a huge forest, and every soul that owes its way through is hated. Shortly afterwards, a group of friends are traveling on a trip to innocent children? It's an independent fear of low budget in the UK. Forest of the Damned takes on an interesting premise and releases one of the worst acts, effects and worries that I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The director of Johannes Roberts leaves behind the camera? Homes released are quite compact and are managed with "shock" moments, but in most movies it is technically amateur. Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson from horror icons throw some awesome spectacles and have a bad movie on your right side. <br /> <br /> An essential short film can be fun and there are many. When women's nudity would like girls, but most would find it.
