When Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw filmed a thriller about the 1972 refugee scene (almost the accident scene) by Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger with a hot and hot Hollywood partner. He almost worked for the first time since McQueen was so much in the screen, although the stone was silent and tired, the clock was marked by its poor magnetism. Baldwin is not Steve McQueen's league, but he has his charm and is surely a versatile actor. If so, this is not a showcase of its attributes. Basinger does well and definitely has a good look, but James Woods artificially plays hammers with foolish-minded dummies. Baldwin's partner was kidnapped by another couple's sub-plot under intense 72 and is even worse here. As an action scene, the hat is pretty old and that's a wonder: why the innovative version? ** ****
