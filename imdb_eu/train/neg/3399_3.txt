Birthday Girl does not know what she wants to be - is a comedy, a drama ... I do not know. The movie could be very fun or moving. No one came out. The original premise is to guarantee a script full of interesting scenarios, but it almost does not meet and end. This is shameful if you look at the cast, it is very strong, but it does not shine brightly. Very depressing
