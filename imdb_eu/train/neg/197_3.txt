Although James Arness is a brilliant western, this film has fallen as the worst movie ever made in Alamo. The story was incredibly inaccurate, and they were just fake live guides! The continuity was thrown into four winds. Anyone caught the cannon sequence? The Mexicans were quite silent, of course, to fasten their laces and mud-filled canyons full of mud. Come on! Then Brian Keith's hat is ridiculous! Client must be away or something. Or, just for himself!
