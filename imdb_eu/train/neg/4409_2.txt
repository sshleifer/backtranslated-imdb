A straight routine, which is the western number (which directs the main base of the genre of Andrew V. McLagen, so wonderfully?). Colonel of the Brian Keith army, Dean Martin has a proud robbery, but has not been kidnapped by the Colonel's wife (Blackman of Honor, he never met Pussy Galore in "Goldfinger"). First battles, shooters, robberies and assistants in Denver Pyle ... this is nothing new or original. In all, he speaks with a monotonous bass, Keith gets a bond with a prostitute (after a "Family Affair" television), but otherwise, this low-lease material will lose Keith's talent. It's a bad news for Dino, who does not notice or care. Direct attempts to hack, bad writing, and little mood. * ****
