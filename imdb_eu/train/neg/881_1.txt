Thanks to the home video distribution of the past, the "Independent Independent Series" has brought us Four For Venice, not just horrible but horrible. So it's horrible that I've kept them in the second-hand goods store. <br /> <br /> Nick and Charlotte arrived at an agreement on Tuesday as a husband and wife, due to their schedule. profession Eva and Luis live in pairs, as a waitress of Eva and Luis's artist. Nick indirectly causes Eva to lose server as a server. Luis and Charlotte had a great love on the back of Eva and Nick. Luis betrayed Eve as saying she was going to be lying to London to do something related to her work, but in truth, she will go to Venice to go adultery for a vacation. Eva Nick was kidnapped and dragged by two kids to fight in Venice. Both trips to Venice end up being Nick and Eve, one after another. <br /> <br /> The presentation of the trip from Germany to Venezuela indicates the failure of the comic between Nick and Eva. It also has no trace of nonsense. In the film, Nick tries to seek help in several ways, but it is useless. They would be unfamiliar with what they do not know, or they're just mute. <br /> <br /> The comedy also did not add the necessary scene to extend the story. Some problems that can be solved with sensible problems, even if they make no sense in the film, to solve the problem. They prefer to go to the second round to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, though the beautiful Venetian landscape does not get the film's reputation.
