Come on, what happens with this show at Power Rangers at any time? I've always felt that Japan's show of origin was better than it was in Japan, and it became a horny and absurd excuse in the history of toy merchandising. There is no point in this show. <br /> <br /> Hairstyles, costumes, earrings, etc. In the 90s, two idiots, Bulk and Skull, "duhs", main cast, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack are just ridiculous I mean one thing: give me a break! <br /> <br /> Saban brought this to Japan, and then Disney I bought rights for this show about five years ago. <br /> <br /> Now, the public has to suffer the same Disney channel show. <br /> <br /> I can say again, you gave me a little!
