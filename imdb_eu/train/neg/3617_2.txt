Really, really a bad slasher movie. A psychotic person escapes from asylum. Three years later, he killed a sociology professor at the end of the scene. A six-month later (evidenced by the title card), a new sociologist is at the school. She works with her friends with another sociology professor who works with her and begins with another teacher. All students are bored, though. <br /> <br /> Indicates how long a certain title card has passed. The scenes are quite short and they are cut to other characters to achieve any kind of progression. Many scenes involve the characters walking and talking, or sitting and talking, and they serve little purpose. Over time, many characters always wear the same clothes. Sometimes, when the light of time seems to mean when we see the body a second time, we ask ourselves: how long is this body? And also, at least one of the dead has not lost others. <br /> <br /> The murderer gets a person killed in the chest, kills another in a crotch. , and another by cutting the brow. Is her knife poisoned or something? <br /> <br /> The video cover portfolio has an animator: it's not in the movie. The back cover has a photo of someone with a graduation cap and threatens a group of women in a room. The color of the middle of the photo is a movie, but no one ever wears that outfit, and that scene is not. The murderer is a strict one.
