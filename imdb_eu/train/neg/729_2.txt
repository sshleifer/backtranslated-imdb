Before I heard the show I heard it was very interesting and aesthetically good. What a deception, scripts are so muted, I'm sure the author is the son and grandson of Scoobidoo writers. And to see that SFX and the colors are so extreme, saturated colors are not saturated, since the script is overwritten and shown. This show is like a bad cake, because a child thought they would only sugar and butter, because they are the best ingredients, because they are enough. Unfortunately for this show, the only two components of this show are missing out on gap and credibility.
