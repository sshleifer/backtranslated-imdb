I came back from the film and I was completely impressed. This movie is an absolute foolishness to all human beings. My theater may have had 4 other people. This movie was recommended to me and I could not believe that this person liked it. I can not believe that any man would like it. There were no plots AT LAND AT LAND. It was a joke. How can a movie be about anything? This movie shows why Hollywood's why. I could only look at the "horror movie" industry and spiral giggle. What is a fascination for all filmmakers, "Grudge, Boogeyman," and Ring, Saw in all "horror horror movies." It's all trash. Do not accept this type of protection!
