I can see that little girls enjoy this show, but when they call the family show, it's ridiculous. I'm surprised at how well you remember these years. The show about the widow of three daughters is very shameless and foolish, with her brother's dead brother and a stupid friend of schooling, and during the seasons. All the land lines generally have a stupid lesson. In the middle of each section, someone gets mad and completes each of the parts that make up and end their joke. As for actors, I did not like them. Bob Saget was painless with unfunny father mom responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a joke for a note that is something 30-year-old makes the cartoon voices and plays like a child, and it's horrible. John Stamos was a more sustainable character, but it was so difficult to see it as it was. The show, the oldest girl, was a bad actor and never showed emotion. Stephanie's middle-aged girlfriend was just as annoying as her sister. Michelle's youngest girl showed Olsen's twins as bad actors. You can say when they're off. Too many lines of stories were too many lines, so unrealistically stupid deserves to cringe. This is a "family" show, which has tried to get drunk and love to substitute a good substance and even exceed a need for a family show. This will be remembered for the smallest 80s and 90s. <br /> <br /> My rating: a horrible show. TVG 30 min.
