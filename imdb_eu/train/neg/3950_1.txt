Did not I find out in the 1990s that Devry University (or ITT Tech?) Featured a superb repertoire of technical titles for the film. Well, that was the result of the movie that had to be the movie. My friends and I rented the origin of Boogeyman 1980 on my Netflix, and this movie was on the DVD. Do not waste your time with this film. Wonderful horrible <br /> <br /> The filmmaker adds 2 main characters, a woman and her therapists. The wife sings the first movie about Boogeyman and her victim. More than 50% of this film is on sale at the original film. The rest of the movie is a drone with the narrator with a narrator therapist. These scenes are filming through such a filter so bright characters. Angela Lansbury should be 25 years old. So a summary, horrible. Do not watch the movie.
