Before this film, I saw two films by Andrea Bianchi: Le Notti del Terrore (1981) zombie flick trashy, known as horror fans, by Peter Bark, the unforgettable play of child-child Strik Nude Candy. Your killer It was not the most spectacular movie film, but both were entertained in a very entertaining way (and with many gores and nudity). Massage, however, is dull, dull, dull, though quite radiant and unmistakable in strange places. <br /> <br /> About murders in a story, cast and crew. While the film's horror films are being made, it is confusing and boring: when blood is not emitted and the skin is not shown, the movie is a real struggle (with four attempts) to end up with strangers whose strangers end up amazed by themselves and make a lot of remarks. <br /> <br /> The only ones that are interesting about the film, the producer Lucio Fulci has used several scenes of his death. Get out his mega-horrible movie Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert). And if you've watched the movie, there is little reason why there's no need to disturb Massacre.
