I really do not like this movie. The land was very predictive. A typical American plot, sorry. Guy gets something like a girl at the end. And has a London monorail? London Bank ??? Bank of England is really what it is! - However, I liked Tracy Island and Thunderbirds. And the British were evil? (Apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) What happened? Oh and "Thunderbirds" continued to say things "- but it was never known in the series as 'Thunderbirds', why do they do it? I'd like to see it again for 20 years. I preferred the original series. Sorry!
