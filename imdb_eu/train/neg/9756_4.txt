Despite the title (English), it does not seem to be related to the Devils and much more about a hungry ruler who seeks Philospher's Stone and wants gold lead (and blood of the virgin) to gold. Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have no problem with death because he threatens his position or needs a blood virgin. Basically, his love and an alchemist are doing what he is doing, and it's roughly crazy and insane that his problem seems to be the property of a demon (unfortunately). There are approximately exciting pieces that try to knock each other with great sticks, and the film has at least a good look, but otherwise it is not recommended. At least in gore mode and nothing to be afraid, and the most unusual, for Molina / Naschy cinema, not really unintended humor. So from 10 to 10.
