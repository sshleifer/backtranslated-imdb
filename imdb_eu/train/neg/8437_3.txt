As David Mamet's movie and theater hobby, especially since his first film, House of Games, was also the star of Joe Mantegna, I expected great things from that movie. Instead, I am angry at the surface of the film and the lack of credibility. Rational races must be thrown out, they do not have any feeling or meaning behind, for the hope of establishing a race tension that never happened to me. Identity is completely revised and men become "heroes" without apparent reason. Due to the oaths he underwent as a policeman, he refuses to make a small act that he does not want to harm anyone, and could save his life and still make another very violent and unlawful act, but he still refuses it. action Additionally, a man killed by his family is unbelievable because he is involved as a result of an announcement point along with the writing, and the appearance of the police extends the phenomenon of the phenomenon without reasonable limitations. Needless to say, after waiting for another thriller with David Mamet, I was very disappointed to say the least. 10 to 3.
