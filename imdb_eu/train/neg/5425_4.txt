I got Mirror Mirror, especially since Yvonne De Carlo was there (I thought it was a great American Gothic) but unfortunately it did not play much in this film. Ok, it starts and the rhythm is moving well ... but finally it gets angry and sad. This is not a film that is boring, but the average and nothing spectacular. I did not like "ownership" and there was no honest scene. Moreover, the story "main" was very confusing and the end was no sense. However, I liked the story about the Gothic girl and how she avenged her sorrows. <br /> <br /> I would not particularly recommend Mirror Mirror for horror lovers.
