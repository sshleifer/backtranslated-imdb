This movie was listed under the horror movie genre. I did that, I do not know the genre called genre. I decided to put this category in horror genre nearest to the most horrible. The plays were amateur. You know who would be evil in the first scene. The hero is as ugly as the movie. A lesson to be made in a film that should be taken as an example of the film made by the film students. It's bad The word of man is evil. The criminals catch a sea line and want $ 10 million. They want to make money in the Rose Island in the heart of the Pacific. Once the money was bought, there would be ducks. Is there no getaway? How dumb The female cruise director is former police officer, I am afraid of the seal, kung fu. The horny time is to disassociate the bomb. He says he does what he says and he keeps pulling the thread one by one. Then, all connections are placed by pocket and movies. Is it erroneous? As we saw by this stupidity. You do not like an M-I-L. Make yourself pretentious about renting this movie and like it. I am sure that your husband will tell me the taste is bad and that his son has been married to the family standard below.
