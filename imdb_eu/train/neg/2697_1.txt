Based on the experience of John Singleton at the University of Southern California, he comes from Higher Learning. Film on racial policies that take place in current schools. <br /> <br /> The film is based on three main characters. This story will be based on its founding: Malik Williams, African Affiliate and African. American male. Kristin Conner, a gentle and sheltered white maiden, and Remy, an unknown unknown black man. The three moments that pass through university life are not surpassed, because they fail to announce the lack of training (Malik), naive (Kristin) and unwanted (Remy). > <br /> Good news is that modern American colleges are just like high schools. Universities are not a place to build character, a place to develop potential or improve people's progress, but institutions that are used to collect all kinds of students are in a single-sized environment. It is an experience that most fails for most students. It was a good idea that the film did not build a story about racial politics. <br /> <br /> But that's not it and the movie is diverted. Singleton, it seems, had a rather bad experience in Southern California. Through this film he let everything out. There is no need to bush around here. Singleton can easily see the heroes and the evil of this piece. <br /> <br /> The black characters in the film are here because they are heroes and the whites of the film are seen as nasty, saved. Kristin was raped by a fellow student. <br /> <br /> Who can understand the qualities of this film? When the black gang of the gang came with the help of a white girl, they allegedly raped her after being told? How easily do black faculty members at university get together when they can create skin cells in a dark little room in the violence plan? <br /> <br /> The performances by Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) are insignificant. The third feature of the roles they played in this movie (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore played Malik and Kristin, but were not available). O'Shea Jackson's Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes and Regina King were their awesome roles. And Laurence Fishburne was unfortunately confused as a history teacher. Michael Rappaport has only performed in this film and made his character, the three main characters, that changed most of the film. <br /> <br /> John Singleton wanted to take part in the race and inequality. The life of the American university with this film. And he did it so badly. It was like an escape with a letter flying. It seems a lot more complex than life and people are very similar and they need to know that. Higher Education is proof that he did not understand. Seeing the movie, at this time, it would only dominate the same audience that would have merely confused, disappointed and talked. He did not mean that he would not entertain them.
