I was never able to see Happy Days after I joined the Chachi team, so I knew I was having problems with Scott Baio for the best scene of this movie (access to a skateboard)! Jodie Foster turns her professional performance into her first "adult" role, but this is not a pretext for boring incidents. I have spent two hours in my life, I will never return! It's not a highlight of the character, an unbelievable story, an annoying edition and a terrific film, but I can not take care of it any more. The story of a teens in California in the 1970s, children are living miserable lives and all parents are stupid. Do not waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.
