This may be the worst adaptation of Broadway music music. Music has also been destroyed. Attenborough will know almost anything about theater - almost all the movies and moments are fake. I can tell, however, that it's pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Hairstyle is very dated. I can not understand myself for life (conceptually) by opening the exterior of the movie that is playing "A Chorus Line" outside. Do we think people are listening to stories about people they're listening to "A Chorus Line". Oh no, the show collapses itself. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production, and I heard the albums hundreds of times. Why, oh, why did they do it?
