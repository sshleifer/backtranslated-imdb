Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes, who is related to Bruce), the first killer of the movie, is once again old. He is a Rolling Hills consultant at Camp. While girls are enjoyable and sexually distant, medication and medication work well. However, he steps several steps above the line and Angela kills them - the elimination of bad jokes all the way. <br /> <br /> The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a tight and rough film, but with good points. This is also evil and evil, but he does not have that good point. Land has died, and this does not add any new to this formula. Here there are many murders here (people are burning alive, their heads are cut, throat shots), but all the guru is so fake, it becomes really comical. This is the smallest campsite I've ever seen, and almost everyone is too old for their jobs (especially Higgins). As expected, a woman with no barefoot (here's an unbelievable Valerie Hartman team) and a mandatory girl / boyfriend (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). Springsteen and Higgins are the only exception, the interpretation is lousy, as well as the slasher movie standards. In addition, the cruel indictment of a movie that kills a character with a drowning character! Boring and sick stupid plots, nonsensical nudity and bad gore. Jump.
