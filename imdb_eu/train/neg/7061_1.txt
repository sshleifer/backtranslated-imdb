I still try to find out that there is a point in that movie. <br /> <br /> Maddox is one of the most demanding of "rebel" and "controversial" students. . Students can easily show the word-of-mouth statements and word-frames that can be written in a brochure. Rebel, everybody. <br /> <br /> I think it was too much to ask for a rioting rebellion movie that was not started by a fire alarm. <br /> <br /> It seems to be a battle that seems to be a 'fierce fighting in football fields'. <br /> <br /> The characters seem to have changed their characters bravely. Maddox struggled in soccer (and then got a stab on his face) he is smiling and forgiving the next day. <br /> <br /> It does not reach the true end result of the plot. I feel that the whole thing could be adjusted to half an hour of school. If the majority of the Pseudo-glitch soundtrack were cut.
