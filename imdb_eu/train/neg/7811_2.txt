Here's how you do: believe God and repent your sins. Next things would be to turn things around the next day. <br /> <br /> Until the last fifteen minutes, this film is a bad summary of drunken life. Her mother is dead. His stepmom is b_tch. His father dies. Drink it Is married It has children. Drinks more. His wife crazy. She condemns her children. He is threatened to leave his wife. The late night he wants to condemn himself calls him a reverend. After a summary, we get a subtle message like "Left Behind". <br /> <br /> "He needed a salary". I needed the phrase of the credits to be repeated over and over again, when I did not lose respect for Madsen. <br /> <br /> Madsen puts on his knees and asks for forgiveness to Christ. Once he's done, he walks away and really says he sees the world in a different way. He says that his wife has found God and that is good enough. Dump in four months, the scene and the wife are tired of going to the church. Finish the movie when he walks by the Madsen bar and soliloquies him with Christ and is not happy with alcohol. Last Moment? In the bar (house of the island) leaves a bit of bar waves and a Miami-Vice male will be given a special air jury at camera frames for freezing frames. See why I should say the phrase? "He needed a salary". <br /> <br /> This man is a bad movie. The value of B-Grade 80 production does not help much. The script can be easily an "Touch Angel" section. It could be removed for 30 minutes plus commercials. The play is wood and is never compelling. Although Madsen, the only reason I'm a great fan, and I'm sitting there, makes it clear that this is his first theater job and he does not know his $$ from his backroom with the camera. In 45 minutes, I started to recommend it. This thing was like homework. I wanted to put it alone and I saw half that I wanted to say. That's enough. But no. When I was sitting with Cheerleader Ninjas, I could sit all this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give this one thing is 1 point two: 1) I love Madsen. I know it's not correct. But it's great to "introduce Michael Madsen" title. Tell me 2) Some conversations are so bad classics. At the end of this I stick some quotes to enjoy them. <br /> <br /> That's it. To complete it, this thing must be continued with the rest of the rest of the territories. But yes! Look! Michael Madsen! (See also TILT, EXECUTIVE TARGET, MY BOSS sources, etc.). Now I'll see again the Dog of Berriz and torture Madsen police to get my respect. See, children. <br /> <br /> "This thing will blind me, but I can still drink it" - Madsen's first cheap alcohol <br /> <br /> I did not understand! Everything looks so beautiful! "- After walking away from Madsen by God's confession <br /> <br />" I will go to the middle and then I will cut and cut the Bible "- After becoming Madsen dinner table, he lives in Satan.
