I got a special UK edition of Superman 1 on 4 disc UK for about $ 5. Accessories appear in 1951, Superman and Mole-Men. So I slapped last night on DVD players, and here are my findings. <br /> <br /> Some initial disappointment - I did not check, and I think I labeled intelligence as a Kirk Alyn attempt. . I'm not a fan of Superman George Reeves, and I did not see Kirk Alyn's other clip, but not at all. <br /> <br /> Less than an hour in black and white production. One of the first series of Reeves, one of two TV series, was released when the film was filmed before the first TV series filmed as a film version. In any case, it is a strange option for later reasons. At one time I remember the TV and film productions are limited to two or two locations and one set, so there were no great surprises here. However, for low-budget films, there is little budget. <br /> <br /> The story is about the small village of Silsby: 1,430 inhabitants, which is the deepest oil in the world. 6 thousand). The story begins with the well-being of the well, taking steps to close the well. This metropolitan reporters will arrive at Kent and Lane to inform the pit about the oil company. Clark is sniffing out that drill that emerged 6 kilometers down into a radioactive cavity, comes out of a capped-off odd weird jewelry (tall, small, big head, black dress, and bushy eyebrows). drillshaft, and the popular round mookking start with an amazing expression of his faces. <br /> <br /> Now, deep breath, here is the rest of the image. The little ones scare off their children and, therefore, Jeff Corey (a powerful xenophobic town) raises some friends to kill these "creatures". Superman (with moderate efficiency) will be caught and shot by one of the small boys and taken to the local hospital. Corey's friends burn a shack to hide their friends and kill him, but he runs away and throws his legs. Corey blinks on a lynch mob (although the sheriff has arrested him) to hang out to the hospitalized Mole-Man. Superman leaves the hospital and wounded the chappie that he is going to focus on to return to his children. 4 Total Mole-men are created with a weapon that shoots with Jeff Corey (I call this Aargh! Pistol, its only effect is that Corey looks like "Aargh!" And Superman saves him. Immediately afterwards, Superman saves his behavior The way it changes its way, Mole-manek goes down the axis. End. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is an hour long, it's not really a movement, carefully and continuously - "Mole-Man from 1 to A It goes to B "to ensure that nobody is watching. Mole-Men does not take any sort of way - they do not have a conversation - they will appear, pursue and go back, it seems terribly terrible, but there are no real reactions The monsters of strange mistakes. <br /> <br /> Reeves Clark Kent is very good, a very tough reporter, much more than Phyllis Coates does not care about Lois Lane, but Superman is horrible and horrible. Not only do not see part of (that At least, it dyed your hair black, but slight hairs on some television episodes only improved), the way it plays is wrong in my book. I am sure that "pose" (Superman constantly performs) told me, but someone told him that he had no fists in the change, nor that his fists should be fists. And Superman plays a sharp and tangible instructor - he does not make medications to his head, but he can do it anyway. <br /> <br /> And Superman walks on foot (I say the amount, not really much), and runs. It comes out twice, but does not see on any flight. Oh, bullets are bounced back and uses a telescopic view like Clark, but with no visual effect. Actually, the visual effects will be evident, and few are presented very well. <br /> <br /> I analyze this effort at all times according to the standards: but I believe that, according to these regulations, I think it's quite a lot of effort. Fortunately, the TV series's production standards were bigger, and at least the stories that they had a little more took the stance. <br /> <br /> Something about the debate - I do not see it again.
