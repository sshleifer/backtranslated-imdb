CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino; A crime of Italian drama has been shot in Hamburg, Germany. Easy-forgotten movie. Although cars are a good harassment sequence, this movie seems almost unpowered. A new gift captures a powerful mafia family and finds herself struggling in her life. Mafia kodearen idatzitako legeak eta etikak inorengan konfiantza izaten dute milioika dolar jokoan ari direnean. Brutality and violence are the same. This can not be put up with a real gangster epic. It just looks like the movie remembers memories of America's drive. The famous American actor Telly Savalas also increase the strength of this crime drama. Antonio Sabato is also Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
