The five buses retain their dream dreams each other. Is there more nightmares than this eye? <br /> <br /> Fortunately, five bad films at the price! Each segment is the worst actress, special effects, accessories and music. And should they be terrifying? Hmm .. I think I was horrified in a section of Teletubbies. I swear, as I would have been sitting, I would be tedious to see something that would make something interesting. Do not worry It never does. In fact, I stopped advertising quickly, because they were much more fun than the main feature. And the end is the last copier. Yes, that has never happened. I can say the same for the day I put on my VCR to record these shoes. 2/10
