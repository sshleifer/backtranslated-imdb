KUCH TO HAI under the direction of Flop, made debut in Anurag Basu in this film <br /> <br /> The film was in front of different eras, but it was not a different story and approached HAWAS. It was released a week earlier and happily improved and made a better business <br /> <br /> The movie begins well, Malikaren's fault is very well illustrated at the outset, although Emraan-Malika's scene is too exaggerated / common. /> <br /> Emraan and Malikan scenes are handled and Ashmith is a tale of Emra's great story. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is moving faster and the viewer is still on the edge, but the second is that Emraan's girlfriend's tracking is not absolutely compelling <br /> <br /> It also seems to be part of the police track <br /> <br /> The latest movie is also very expensive <br /> <br /> Anurag Basu's good director is the winning music, all the songs fab's proudly. The camera's work was amazing <br /> <br /> Emraan played a great starring role If that role was awesome and he continued to play these roles and was angry at the movie, Ashmith was excellent at his full-fledged role, he did a nice job and one of his great performances and looked very well Malikak He was brilliantly in his role in the second half but his markup delivery was not branded Unfortunately rarely showed the potential of other films Raj Jhutsi is well
