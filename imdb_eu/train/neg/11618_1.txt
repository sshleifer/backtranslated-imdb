The acting of the film is honestly done, but the movie is so slow and so boring, it stops everything that stops when it gets interesting. I'm glad to see Sam Rockwell, so I've done a lot, the other actors I've mentioned, but man ... it's one of the worst movie I've ever seen. Now this short movie would be good in the form of a short film, but also avoid it. This movie has a lot of filler that makes Twinkie a cake jealous. <br /> <br /> I never ever got movies, but I saw it with my family at home, I went out. Yes, it was boring. Apparently, my comment does not have enough lines to send; So here's more filler. I think I saw that it was inspired by the movie.
