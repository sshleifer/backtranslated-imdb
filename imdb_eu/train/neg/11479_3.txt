This film deserves a bad review. Suppose the virtues of the film praise the enrichment of "sex, violence or noise". Oh, sorry. The same configuration of the film we are seeing with the young Cody girlfriend, she has a love of life and everything she can do to live. He thinks Cody keeps her body disturbed and bloody. And considering the nature of the war, Cody has almost scared almost every day. Together with the rose glasses for those who watch this movie, the violence that defines Cody's character is eliminated from the memory of the viewer. <br /> <br /> It's not a family of Cody, a family like John Rambo, who walks in the country by bicycle. A long walk along the US hometown, a place called Nevada City. There is no mention that Cody is worn out by the worn-out goods. We all know that CO is almost recognizable, since Cody ordered the destruction and destruction of the war. This explains that nobody can realize or take care of it, since Cody's "flat" effect is evident. It's not the performance The extra traumatic disorder is flat. Do not think here, remember his CO ordered him off the field of battle. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this "unexpected" kiss is another review. It was a fall accident, it was not there. What was the "respect" of Cody when he talked about faith faithfully? Now, it was time when the family value was not. A moment that is predicted for the universe of the past as it was posted on YouTube. Of course, a woman who wants to invent faithfulness and Cody's "unmatched" wife, is in the spirit of the Christmas season, all the CHEERING cheat their hearts and lips. <br /> <br /> If we know about love with Faith about the fianc√©es we all know, he takes more than one second to accept his proposal (the second thoughts may wait), he is generous, he loves death, no family contains anything He is really against him, he thinks he is based on marriage commitments and has debated the discussions of both marriages. There is no evil here. <br /> <br /> Asner is a good actress on the hillside interview: "We love you son ..." "You are in our family part" after discovering a literal stranger. Called Cody And the talk about 'brotherhood discourse', especially intended to be applied to non-extraneous outsider virtual. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This movie is a cotton candy betraying the main Christmas solutions. . Most seriously, when he applauds the respect for faith in Cody, he knows how to physically strike someone who speaks fiercely. As we define the family as we know: if the virtual stranger is recognized as a full member of the whole family, we are "loved by all". How much have you done or who have met? NO.
