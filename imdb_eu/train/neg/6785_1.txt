> You have warned that this is a spoiler! > The movie is so bad that I can write enough lines. The excellent directions were well thought out. The actors were very good especially Richard Pryor, I would like to see more about him. Madeline Kahn and Johnny Houseman were classics. It might have been better for Dudley More to bless him. I'd like John Ritter again. In my opinion, this defeat will cause a complete failure of the writer. Perhaps the producer could throw the plug in when she saw what was happening. It is very bad for so much money to get into this boiler with a small change here and there when I think it. They have to pay standard writers rates. To create a chuckle
