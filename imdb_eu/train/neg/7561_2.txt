Undoubtedly, anybody who has not known the origin of the British film "The Wicker Man" in 1973 has left the movie "Poor" and "Peurile". <br /> <br /> Quite a bit of impression by the hand of the original. <br /> <br /> Hiding the fragile realities of fragile interior draws force of law and order in a remote Scottish island, in a ritual barbarism ritual called Summerisle (original). The near-colony of Ammonia in the Maine coast of the United States, called Summersisle, makes it difficult to reconstruct. <br /> <br /> This is pretty dull, what could be the case of a remake of a classic remake. A classic manipulation of a simple intelligence. MORE THAN EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> Knights (or the renewed context of the film) Apply the women ... hang yourself up.
