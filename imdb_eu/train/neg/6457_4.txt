I think I've seen worse movies, but this may be due to the horror movie horror standard. The killer monsters is really bad, basically a green body lotion. While B movies go, it's a lot worse, but do not think that the second star was a bright star, hell. He really had a plot of substance, but he was still quite stupid. Basically, it's just a bad budget horror movie. But at least it's not as bad as titanic, it sucks the movie, it's just that. Blood is really false in this movie. This is a huge complaint about the fear of the bottom of the million gore. The scene of death is really a fake blood, so stupid. At least a nice shower appeared
