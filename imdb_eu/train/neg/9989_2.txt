I was lucky to see Sky Cinema Max's rubbish in a cold winter night. I am not a great fan of horror films, most of which are trash. This is even worse: it's one of the worst pieces I've ever had in my life. Horror movie Yes, that's why there are awful things: play, script and special effects. - Gosh, I laughed to make a short 90-minute short film. Actually, if it were a comic, I would give it 5. Do not think about renting this if you do not want to cheat producers. <br /> <br /> Vote: 10 out of 10 did not vote, they all laughed me all the time ;-)
