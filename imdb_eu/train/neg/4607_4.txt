You can not imagine how I advanced the ants to the king. As Gordon's enthusiast is horrible, I expected the European premiere, wicked face to face. Especially since I loved Dagon - Gordon's last achievement, I loved so much. Ants of the King was strained in my country, and Gordon introduced himself. Unfortunately, I could not go and congratulated him later. King of the Ants is currently one of his no-movie films. Actually, the quality level never exceeded the usual standard TV-thriller. The earthquake schema is a horrible routine and, except for a few scenes, the typical Gordon touch is never known. On top of that, when the script is weak there is more holes than a cheese bucket! It involves a young worker hired to make a murder. So he does not do it and, of course, they do not pay. He will fall in love with the victim's wife, of course. And, of course, he will avenge him. The man deserves the only sequence that goes down in a spirited madness. They are the only ones who remind you that you are watching a movie by Stuart Gordon. The play is below the average, with the low life of McCenna, just like George `Norm Peterson 'Wendt, and Kari Wuhrer is like a creepy one. Very inevitable things are constantly happening and the blurring of the story becomes fast, but make-up effects are not enough to satisfy amateur-fanatics. I have read other comments with King of the Ants, Gordon says it's the best, it's finally a thought and a mature film. Well, if that is the case. I'd rather be immersed and I'll give you another look at Re-Animator. much Well, all the good directors do not flee and finally inspire. Finally he passed Stuart Gordon.
