I watched the whole movie, to wait and wait for something to happen. Perhaps my guilt is to see evil and fear instead of psychology? Is it a curious question of the edict myth: I want to kill my father and mother and to marry my uncle and I will compose a musical theater with her? I did not understand why there were some plots: why was the construction at the top, why was the place where someone had fallen to their liking, because there was no one in it, why the scenes were going to work at Father, why you want to eat a nice kitchen, why do you want boys? He wanted to be baptized and instead of holding back his parents. I see good comments for this movie ... did my taste deteriorate in the 1970s with movies and ancient sci fi fi cies?
