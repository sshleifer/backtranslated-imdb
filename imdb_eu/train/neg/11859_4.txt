Well, it would be better for a mother, a widow, and a seated puppet of this film, than what she would like to be a little bit older about a widow's widow's widow. In the north of Tunis, mother-in-law piddles around the apartment, gets intsy, and decides, even with enthusiasm (just for herself) in a costume and dance local cabaret. Meanwhile, the daughter is taking her dance lesson. The common denominator is Tunisian battery-battery. I saw this movie full of fills on the DVD in x2 and I read subtitles, walk around the streets and walk around ordinary pedestrian paths (wherever they go) and more on foot and on x4 x4. a boring, quiet budget and a low budget, some got some bad reviews.
