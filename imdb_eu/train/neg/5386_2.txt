Being a "star" of this movie does not necessarily provide a sage view, but I knew what was first and what was on the screen. I have seen the original cut in "Incoming students" and I'm very happy. It was fun, sexy, penetrating, the main conditions of a movie record. It must be remembered that it was filmed and released before all the rest ... animal house, pigs, etc. So, in this way, this film really was before its time. For whatever reason, they were given the main distributors who were publishing half of the original movie's movie, and then (I had to "mix" what I needed to edit). The guy, the people with goats ... what's the hell of all? I'm sure T & A But it was gradually slowed down, everything that had happened was slowed down, but overall, it's fun for me ... especially, I can say the worst movie I've ever seen ... I am!
