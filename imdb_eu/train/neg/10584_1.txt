The only restorative quality of this movie was to have comedy just enough. In this movie it seems that everyone gets a porn industry. I've really seen it perform better in a low budget porn. Even though I was really gay I could rent a certain class after this classic scene: Jim: Watch your ass Nick: You see yours (together): I will not leave you behind! <br /> <br /> The first action sequence shows how productive is horrible, but it's really fun: Good guys transformer weapons! In a single scene, they all have false HK MP5 sub-machines. Next scene, replica of the AK-47! And then, finally, they make some weapons that change between scenes with a pair of M-16! I think there was a shortage of guns, there's not enough to go good and bad men. Combat scenes are poorly coordinated and like fake all hell. You must remove a pin / spoon from a grenade as it will explode on its own. Any kind of shoulder throwing that can be mounted on a helicopter can not be done. The weapons you do not throw will suddenly appear again. When a gun is out of the ball, the elimination is still pretty stupid. I do not know how to reload it. The large truck lifts in the first trucks create miscalculations. I truly believe that such films are created. This movie would be ridiculous with nitrous oxide or perhaps drink it.
