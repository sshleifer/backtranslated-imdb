This movie should IMDB allow a vote of 0/10. The performance is horrible, although here some praise, Carpathia character! It seems that the script was written fast. In a scene, the black preacher was left behind, when asked by Buck "dan7" on the computer, "Daniel 7, * CHAPTER 24." he said. It might have led to VERSE 24, but filmmakers did not run away. Perhaps the worst part is that the philosophical position of the film is not really true. While many Christians bet the interpretation of events that ended, this interpretation, in my opinion, is a mistake. To understand these mistakes, read "George Will Ladd" by Jim McKeever and "The Hope Hope, the second and future Biblical biblical research" will be made through a secondary tribulation.
