I think that the PG-13 was damaged! The performance of BRITTANY SNOW was very good and others like IDRIS ELBA were good, but other adolescent promenades did not convince the parties like branches. The murderer was so silent and even stupid. Death was stupid, boring, and not quite. The movie was very boring and was overcome. There was no suspense, I was almost asleep. His new PG-13 remake is bad, its really a horrible movie IMO. The end was so stupid and the incident was very dangerous and boring. The movie is pretty slow. In general, the only thing about the unhappy party is BRITTANY SNOW, and I think that it has been a good performance and IDRIS ELBA, but the film was totally horrible and overwhelming. My opinion is good I gave it to 2/10.
