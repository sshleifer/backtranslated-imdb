I saw the pilot and I saw more than 3 kg and some similarities to the House, M.D .. Tucci's character is superb but socially impossible, it's a house of Laurier's House, but without the haunt of Laurie's House. Meanwhile, the director of Tucci, Dr. Seger, is not one of the most interesting characters, as Cuddy and Wilson are just as good. The character of Indira Varma Adrienne Holland, similar to Dr. Cameron. <br /> <br /> One of the CBS's, of course, has seen the success of House, MD, and said to the staff a similar show, with the hope that he could successfully mimic it. However, it requires a level equal to the same level of suspension and level of suspension as the House, and Tucci and the company are not challenged. <br /> <br /> I did not know that the show was canceled until I read it. Comments on the IMDb, but it's not surprising to me.
