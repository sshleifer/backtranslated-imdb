Okay, 'enjoy' is quite relative, but flexibility is in order to face a film by James Glickenhaus filmmaker. <br /> <br /> McBain is really ridiculous at the top. The movies I have ever seen, with the evil Edge of The Exterminator. Other reviews have made a credible suspension on heroic heroes of the movie, but what about a subsidiary established in Colombia in the Philippines? All supplements are Philippine. Actually, the only remotest Hispanic character Victor Argo is good, "The President" is much disgraced! Yes, yes, Mar√≠a Conchita Alonso is also a rebel leader. There are many beautiful explosions and bodies flying everywhere in the glory of the American American imperialism.
