This movie loses time. It's just about an hour and a half but it's almost 4. I have never seen the movies move so slowly and for no purpose. In addition, it is a "horror" movie that takes a long time. My friend and I laughed when we were terribly frightened. <br /> <br /> <br /> The only thing we want to know is why we took a great movie in many countries. There can not be a great deal of demand. <br /> <br /> Nicole Petty's supermodel model should, in spite of her beauty, have lost so much of her accent in this movie, in the middle of the time British and American in the middle of time.
