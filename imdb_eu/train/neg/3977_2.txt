Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's twin sisters were the same in commas commercial as "Two of a Kind". I never had ever seen, but I had an idea I expected, but it was worse. Basically, sister-in-law Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome to take part in the Summer Program, but after a few vacancies, they are immediately fired to obtain some misfortunes. The owner of Derek Hammond's (Julian Stone) company is working hard and slowly demonstrating useful assets and talented (fashion) artists, and helps a man who helps them to take over. company Also, Leslie Danon Jami, Derek Lee Nixon Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin Dari, Archie Kao Nobu, Valentina Mattolini Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso, Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. This movie is about to come straight to the video. The camera's work is completely imbalanced and does not help to admire the place in Rome. In fact, seeing the background is the only thing that is good, twins are two of the two most annoying sisters, I did not see before me they would be interested in me (they are not theirs), that is. horrible movie junk Pretty bad
