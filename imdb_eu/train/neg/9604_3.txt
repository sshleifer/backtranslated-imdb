Of course, the first thing I saw in this film was not nudity. No nudity or anything to listen to, but there was not much need. Annik Borel plays a frightened woman who believes in the ghost story of her family, that her ancestor resembles that she was the weaker man, and she thinks it's the same as her fate. It really seemed interesting to me. Original Wolf Man wanted to be a totally psychological one, but Universal never let Wolf's true man ever see himself exaggerated. It's really a nonsense who finds the concept of this concept. Unfortunately, this is not the movie you are looking for. <br /> <br /> Instead, the initial man's wolf is not known, so it seems that emotion or rotation does not mean that the movie really has happened. scenario. They do not even fail, adding one or two parts of the film, referring to the reality of being. At first I was excited about reading the movie description. But slowly I noticed that the cover was just as good as it was to show the most important breast characters. <br /> <br /> Annik Borel plays a great psychic role as well as actor, and the actor is really a psychotic role. Because Danniele is not a brave character and just like a donkey, it's just a nutshell and a nasty attack, it requires little skill to play. It's time to break up for a moment, but it quickly breaks the camera's work and light. It is an excellent idea, but secretly run across the film. 3/10
