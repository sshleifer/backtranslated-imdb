*** SPOILER *** Do not read this, if you think of watching the movie, it would be a waste of time. (By the way: the argument is so predictable that you do not make any changes if you read this or not) <br /> <br /> If you ask "Coyote Ugly" or not, do not: no! It's not worth the money of the card or VHS / DVD. The typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick" could be said. The territory itself is also superficial, a ridiculous and critical version of American dream. A young and successful girl from a small town was very successful in New York. Some of the desperate attempts to give depth to the movie fail, for example, the "father's" tragic accident, Violet's boyfriend, etc., "difficulties", etc. McNally (Director) tries to inspire compassion and sadness to the audience, he has not had any chance to succeed because of the bad guides and the superficial influences. Piper Perabo mainly fails to persuade the audience to fear fearing "Jersey". The good thing about "Coyote Ugly" (quite funny) is John Goodman, who represents the slightest hope in this movie. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this film. First, "Gone In 60 Seconds" and now this ... what was the great movie "The Rock" and "Con Air"? That's the truth of Bruckheimer. <br /> <br /> If you look for a good looking skin on the surface, for a quiet afternoon, it's better to see "Charlie's Angels" (it's much fun and entertaining). and self-ironic) instead of this film. <br /> <br /> Two fingers down (from 10 to 3).
