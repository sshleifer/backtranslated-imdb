Today, Bea Arthur died, so he crossed the website of the IMDb and ended it in a show called "Gloria". "All In The Family" was a great show for the first four or five years, and I had a bet I saw it more than once. However, I swear NO that there is a show called "Gloria". Maybe it's a good thing. Perhaps it means that I lived a young adult when I do not see television. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is pathetic as a consequence of the fact that the franchise was "damaged" over the whole family. I have never heard it - and what the previous reviewers value very badly. <br /> <br /> I assessed the show 1 for two reasons: the system allowed me to vote and registered for me. Writers and television authorities should condemn it, because they start a show that does not appear in the air and remembers the memory of one of the biggest shows in television history. <br /> <br /> Shalom, ZWrite
