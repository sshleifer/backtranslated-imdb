The black guy turns into a rich man, and the rich white man embraces hip-hop culture and most of the "fun" moments in this movie are playing for him. My problem does not work and it almost always works. <br /> <br /> Ok, so nobody would expect Lance to think of a body and look like Charles Wellington. It would be a lot to ask. I accept that. But, at the same time, it goes too far in the other direction. Can you imagine singing a rich white man and singing things completely as a hip-hop culture fortress, and only people accept it? And Sontee, who was in love with you as a wealthy man * *, even if he does not care for his money or power? This is totally incredible, though it's not fun. <br /> <br /> I just could not believe I hanged and I could not finish the movie. I added an extra star, but it made me laugh, though it was hard, twice. But I can never get the hip-hop "white guy" everything he has ever seen in any movie that he has never seen. This is no exception.
