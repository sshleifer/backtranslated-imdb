I know nobody matters but I do not care. This movie is historical for some reason. Two seventy science fiction is the union of two heroes of great fiction films. Well, it's great, and it's pretty bad. The great one is really great, in fact, it is the best. The bad thing is really bad, in fact, it's the worst. From now on, of course, it's called "Star Wars," and its star, Mark Hamill, "Luke Skywalker," is the hero of this movie, about a boy who gets his Vette and then goes to Vegas (lead) and a lot of adventure it will eventually recover. (As the car is establishing itself, you can call "Lube Skywalker"). On the way he encounters the golden heart and Kim Milford, in the 70s, finds himself a character in the science-fiction culture "Laserblast", as I mentioned earlier. the worst science fiction film ever made. Milford leads Hamil to steal his car. I realize that nobody is responsible for this meeting of the great science fiction heroes, but I do that. And I must say that the best / worst film of all time. Mark Hamill's acting is in need of force, the plot requires a lot of Jedi training, and the annoyed character of Annie Potts can be an annoying character of all time in any movie I have ever seen. On the weekend, or at night, at night, the movie is a very late movie. It is a movie of several meanders, something to be sought, but not quite discovered but also a goal, such as free-form jazz, that just does not exist. And that does. And what is it is not great, but you can not say it's not fun, because it will feel at an hour and a half, but you will not be fooled. So, shake yourself up, relax and enjoy this gem, without hope, and you can always stay with you.
