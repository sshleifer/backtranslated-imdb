What do you get a bad performance, bad management, awesome staging, awesome lighting, painful edits and awesome effects? You will get Jessica: Ghost Story is filmed on Betacam, that is, but the lighting is to complete that support. This is not the case. There are several CU, where the face of the person is in the shade. One scene, in particular, is the stage of psychiatrists. You ask me a joke. Some scenes were so long, they could be cut in half ... but I think there would not be a movie in a feature film. The main character is very flat. LEAD is a male, so he should have some "heroes" of his nature, but not. He swears and is afraid of the whole movie. I could keep it, but I do not want to waste time. Although the lighting was awful, I had to say that it had a nice camera movement. Very bad lighting was not greeted. DVD skin is nice and it ends there. Just terrible
