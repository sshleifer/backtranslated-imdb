SciFi channel "Debuted" is nowadays and I can say "I'm not a voice". I recorded today, to be able to watch it tonight. I had a great hope, I will now remove the cabinets in search of a long rope, to hang myself. Maybe I've never seen the worst movie ever. I'd like to say something nice to me, "I would have fun with the movie," but this movie is not working with me. I know that you will not post faults here without notice, but I will go "I suck this movie" I said it! They have to show that they must shoot to shoot their students! A nine-year-old niece could make a better movie. The only thing about this movie is sound and / or sound. Oh! I found an oxidized C-clamp in my old toolbox. I will put it on the left hand and I will tighten my pain until the memory of what the eyes see. I simply could not hang on this VHS, but I think I will burn it in fire. I have washed with soap but I'm not afraid to wash it again. Christmas is coming Buy this movie and give it to people you hate. -Mike
