Ronald Colman won the Academy Award for Best Actress as a well-known play, a well-known scenario that completely loses its roles, especially as Shakespeare's Othello. George Cukor, a critically acclaimed film, has a wonderful pedagogue, wrote an impressive group of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, fun here is an awful lot of fun and a backstage business tremendously. Miklós Rózsa won his score for an Oscar, and Shelley Winters had a tough time server (Colman's play breathes when he asks: "What is it? Something?"). Otherwise, this scenario is very obvious, surprisingly strange and very funny. * 1/2 ****
