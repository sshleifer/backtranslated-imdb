Until the last minutes of the movie, they gave me 7 or 8 stars for the movie. However, the end is so terrifying and the first 80% of the "Dutch" film is totally weakened. <br /> <br /> The earthquakes in a submarine and the nuclear missile allows the rocket to be reached. . Captain Gene Hackman is about to launch its first officers, Denzel Washington, to confirm pre-ordered orders. The problem is that captain BTY and 1st officers should start their startup keys at the same time. Hackman is in the process of launching and Washington is firmly endorsed by armed rioters as a result of armed rebellion. In the end, the error has been detected and missiles are not started. Cool However, here's just the truth comes from the sound part. They go back to the ground and go ahead of the review committee, Washington and Hackman (half of those who tried to kill half the movie) who shook hands and all the friends! Huh?! The film is worth the end of it.
