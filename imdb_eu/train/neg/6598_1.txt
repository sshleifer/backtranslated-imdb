This "movie" really likes it. No, wait - an abomination. NO, WAIT - this is undoubtedly the absolute movie THE WORST, made with the most beloved characters created by other actors. <br /> <br /> I thought about "Clouseau Inspector" (!) with Alan Arkin instead of Peter Sellers. It was playful and sacrifice, but if you dare to "remake" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy they are also making money and money. <br /> <br /> Mr. Lord Laurel and Hardy have been killed, respectively, since 1957 and 1965. Why would L & H's good updates start thinking better than Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain. I was hoping to be terrified and embarrassed and I was not disappointed. All those who take part in this pathetic, confusing and fascinate dismay will do everything together with Hollywood and film making. Avoid this filter at all costs - you've been warned.
