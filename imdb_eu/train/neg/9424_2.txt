This was not pleasant to see. Frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and normal (boring) work. He makes his children go to film school, but his son decides to make a humble documentary about the man. The director of a documentary needs to point to the camera and simply shoot, manipulate and comment on the deceptive. The hardness and resentment towards the filmmaker's director is evident. And sad The goal is for Frank to be mute and pathetic, but instead he finds himself as a man that appears in 3 people. <br /> <br /> Basically, it has worn out a campaign campaign that is much more intelligent and cheerful than that. it really is. I do not like cinema director.
