What a despair! I hated Mummy but this one was even worse! It was very painful and unbelievable and I sneezeed at a certain moment and broke all my time. I can not believe the people really like the movie. Nicholas Cage's role was not very convincing. The whole movie was a great walk around the most American buildings. It never touched and the flow of combinations stopped. I paid attention for about 30 minutes. A happy night, however, was completely disappointed. What to drag ... I think too much film to enjoy the national treasure I've seen.
