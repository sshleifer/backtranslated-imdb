Unlike Endemol shows in the current U.S. two games (Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs. 100), this show is pacing too slow on the screen. <br /> <br /> DOND and 1 vs. 100 may have a slow break, because games can change the pace or at the end, at all times. There is a risk in all the actions taken by the player, the rewards are very variable, and it is difficult for players to leave with a large amount of money. Suspense works well. <br /> <br /> Show the money while it is very slow. When a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player is correct, make sure the events happen in the next few minutes. There would be a lot of pace for this show that represents the correct answer to FIRST, and then he must choose a player dancer, if Shat loses time, if the answer is wrong. . Random dances are perfect. It's wasting a lot of time while it's not happening enough ... and players can not leave the game because the warranty will lapse for a long time. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I do not shake Shat, especially if I dine to see the following. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of continual game hobbies, but I had problems for an entire hour. He needs big changes or retirement either.
