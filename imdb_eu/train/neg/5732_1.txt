I'm a bad movie of horror, but it's just a pile of dogs! In my opinion, anyone is calling me this movie or not. If you want to edit special effects, you will go on a bad performance and bad script! There was no suspension and the gore factor was unflattering so fake. I'll take a shelter or a Wolf Creek over that day. My partner was given up around 20 minutes and knows a stinker who knows it. On the other hand, I sat down stupidly in the whole movie, if I could wait and see better. It's not such a luck! I do not call his other movie Torched and I'm now questioning.
