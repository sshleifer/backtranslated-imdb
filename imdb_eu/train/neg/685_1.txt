My wife and I thought that at least the film was worth the act and the director. We were wrong. In fact, we gave up after 45 minutes. Crawford, Young and Tone, but the Americans, with the accents, could not make it past me; It's hard to believe that this is in England, no one speaks of British accents. There is no chemistry between Crawford and others, and for the previous comments, it's fun for Cooper and Crawford to suddenly affirm each other's love. There is no reason to look after the characters, so we pulled it in the middle of the towel. It was difficult for me to say that Hawks was directing it, because none of the cast was taken with a portrait of Hawksian. So save your time, and jump on this.
