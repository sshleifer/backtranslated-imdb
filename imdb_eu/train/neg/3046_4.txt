I saw the first movie when I was about 10 years old. My mother bought Kmart for $ 5 for VHS. For me and my brothers thought it would be a lovely Christmas movie for me. This movie, however, gave me fear. Maybe asking yourself, how about a Santa clause movie frightens anyone? Movie drawing Satan sends his minions around, Pitch, on the ground to kill Santa and make an attempt at destroying Christmas. The truth is, Satan sends a demon to kill Santa Claus infernal. Pitch hangs on Christmas Eve at Christmas, when the sun rains on the day when he raises the sun, but if he does not return to Santa's home, he becomes dusty. I'm not writing badly, the movie is fun and quite fun. The image that the devil and the devil danced in the depths of hell (the beginning of the movie is just awesome).
