I watched this movie Sundance in 2005 and I was amazed how bad it was, based on the description of the catalog, I was glad to see it. Evidently, a two-documentary documentary from the high school life is an "actress", a bad performance, a bad director, a totally insolent and completely busty character. I love good movies about high school, and this is not one of them. The characters are in a single dimension and are consciously "fresh", even if they are outside. You get a general seat for making your friends show up around a sensitive and bad movie, but it's still coming to Sundance. Mystifying.
