Deep Shock plays it as a TV movie: a full-featured commercial actor, a "bad" creator, and a script, full of technical, political and important voice. along with. <br /> <br /> I saw a movie star (I like to see what they considered in the inexpensive video layouts), and I was disappointed. There was no movie in the box. I was expecting the actors because of the type of film (very generic and not thought after a certain point). Music was a symphonic symphonic music. <br /> <br /> I liked the design of computer and technical equipment, along with the mini-design. The movie also worked well, so you can learn how to watch the storyboard on the screen. However, there is no story here, in any way. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 3/3 of the 10 stars IMO. Search and destruction of the boring missions of the North Pole and protection to protect these beings ... a little applause. It is a connection between the love between the two characters that you still do not see. Make this sketch an actress's career in a movie that tries to break into the chair and a video. Do not worry
