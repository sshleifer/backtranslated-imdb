The director Warren Beatty intended to make the famous comic book Chester Gould live in a cartoon action (Beatty directed himself as an anti-war detective) had nostalgia for innocent tastes - Warren Beatty is very rare and common. Unfortunately, the image needs a ham, a moment funny but eventually exhausting. Dick Tracy tries to bring Down the Mistletoe Big Boy Caprice, helping Tess Trueheart in love, but Breathless Mahoney's evil. In the first half hour, the art direction and design that won the Academy Award is wonderful, but since the plot is pre-lit (the script is not completely authentic), things begin to freeze. Al Pacino was shocked to nominate an Oscar nomination for bad boy Caprice, and Madonna (most widely used as ornament) sings Stephen Sondheim's "Sooner or Later (I Get It's My Man)." Originally awarded Best Prize. song. With heart, thanks to Beatty - who was dedicated to his vision - but the image is very cool and is calculated. It's hot. * 1/2 ****
