When someone else realizes that they change the road every time they pick up the new camera angle. As in a single scene, there is a street, which has sidewalks, it is divided into two lanes with a freeway, and it has yellow roads that lead to both roads. I can understand a small budget, but it's just a short film. <br /> <br /> I have also read other reviews and I do not agree that it was a bad movie. If you're a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy, I think you can enjoy this movie. However, if you find work / it's not fun, then I would recommend you to move them away.
