At the beginning of the film, beautiful photography and fox scenes were amazing. However, the story was very slow and boring. And then the little girl starts to domesticate foxes, which leads to tragic events. We live in the forest, and we often see foxes. It is important to know that wild animals turn wild and remotely enjoy themselves. They give a great example to children who are watching the movie, trying to make a wild beast a pet. I do not know what was the point of the story. After the awful events with the main fox, she was still playing with little girls kitties. Have you ever learned lessons? And there is another scene that adds to the predatory animals, foxes, that is, trauma to children who see this movie. What a disappointment was this movie. And what a horrible story tells. The last dialog box was so stupid that my wife and I were crying on the TV! I totally hate this movie and I will not recommend it to anyone!
