Basically, a group of dentists and their daughters relate to their infidelity. The premise is interesting, the performance is good and music, although sometimes violent and not correct, is quite good. <br /> <br /> The problem is the problem. The husband-dentist turns his wife back into an opera before the theater (he has a small role) and then he goes out again to give it something, but he sees it with another man. The rest of the film examines the condemnation of this section, its visual hallucinations and the "macho alter ego" (Denis Leary, his former patient) and the fear of his wife "needs something to do." I will not end it, but I can tell you the movie It goes to any place and ends like a stumbling block. Character motivations are missing: why is fraudulent? The dentist is a good looking father. The movie did not say Who is it with? Do not expect an answer about it. Why does she want to keep everything in this marriage? Who knows What is it useful for those who raise children? Where is this movie? Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as a comic relief) are wasting their good performances if they do not want nonsense if they want American Beauty or their family movie. Radical channel is more interesting. Avoid.
