Bashki should congratulate him on trying to make one of the great works of English fiction. Animations were poor, characters seemed ridiculous, music was terrified, and the movie was the first and half-horned book of Tolkien's masterpiece. I still remember the disappointment and distress in the movie yet for the first time. I now realize that attempting to make a book a movie is to fail in many ways, for the medium, but this movie, whatever the source of the story, is very pathetic. Bashki is much more capable.
