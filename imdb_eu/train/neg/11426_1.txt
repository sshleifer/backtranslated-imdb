Heather Graham could not convince lesbians according to her life. Who do the producers think? Remember that I've seen an ABSOLUTE, ENCRYPTED movie. This movie is very bad, I had to feel forced to register on the IMDb and I had to guarantee the rating of this "movie". <br /> <br /> I'm omg Heather Graham, I have drunk a kiss, when it's over, I'll make the pace I'll make my ROLE around HORI, "WHAT DO WE DO ?!" The silence of Jesus, passed and grown ... and I would like it. stupidity with stupid producers ... and I am, instead of a movie, despite a pathetic excuse for storytelling, it might be more appropriate to channel the plot with an unstable mind. As a character called "Lesbian" ... I finally knew I was gay sex, when I left the next morning, I jumped from the sky in the middle of excitement ... on the street. b * tch, get grip ... <br /> <br /> WHAT JOK A! and keep in mind that there is a lot of mistakes in this melancholic aspect, but I'm very sorry to think more about it. The bottom line, if you're a smart person hate this movie, and if you're not a smart person, you'll love it ... it's just as easy.
