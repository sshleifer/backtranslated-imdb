On Sunday they captured this film in a tube. I thought I saw so badly in the IMDb to see what other people thought. I did not surprise the number of crazy people who enjoyed this feat. However, I was surprised to read the comments I only used to read the categories of Shadows, which were not found among them. I was surprised; I always hate what they look at, who hate a movie is as good as ever. In any case, they condemned this movie, and they told me that they were telling me, and I'm proud to announce that I WOULD BE BECAUSE IN THIS PURPOSE! I know this movie I hate to go in detail, but it would only give more respect to the film than it deserves.
