This movie is awesome. Finally, you realize that you have been stolen for several hours of your life. The "Whirl" end is very well-known. The development of the ending is not one of the last events that conclude. Fifty-minute preparation - Rob Lowe's character explains the premonition that falls on Christmas Eve in ninety-three quarters of "We did not cheat on you." Then Rob Lowe's character is no longer angry! "I will forgive you if I forgive you," it is the pain it achieves. Someone would convince me a few weeks ago when I was dying, and then I said "No, sorry, I was deceived" I would hurt hell. I do not like removing the spoiler, I can see some of them. Please, save yourself and NOT USE THEM.
