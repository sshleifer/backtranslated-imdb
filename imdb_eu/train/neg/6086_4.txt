For some reason, at the beginning of the 1970s and early 80s, the local CBS local office in New York continued to write this film on a Friday or Saturday night, usually 2:00 a.m. or a few hours. This is a good movie of this period of time, it is very difficult to follow and it is quite curious (see another review about a particular story). In any case, after catching several times before cable television (and even before programming all the night before), I continued to catch that curiosity. I did not know how to find it on the DVD when I did not see it for many years. Well, it's only available (from all the searches I have made) a massive print on the budget tag on "Brentwood Video" in 4 films (4 films, two double-disc drives). If anyone wants Alien Worlds, it's usually $ 10, but it's much smaller if you're shopping. Other 3 other films of this series are available in other public domain movies, so you do not have to comment here, but I do not have "Eyes" There is never a "recaptured" version, this print runs 92 minutes, so the IMDb is not correct for 90 minutes. It also works for a duplicate movie in English that is not even uncommon for 92 minutes. It's hard pressed. It seems that the usual practice of budgeting and consciousness is that saving money sometimes does not want to duplicate some scenes if you do not play the importance of the story. It would be a longer version to mix less, who really knows if you do not see it in its original language ... By the way, I have not tried my attempts a day and I am finally off. At the middle of the night seeing this is something that is movie to fit the net ... or maybe they are just my previous experiences, who knows?
