I can not say one of the best films I have ever seen. But again, I can not say the worst thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ok, so it's basically a skateboarding girl, it's good, she wants to go to a costly school. It can not be paid and a Hockey scholarship is required. Hiding her must hide the secret of her friends. <br /> <br /> Personally, I do not like playing actors Katelin. He could not shout to save his life, he only made sounds that sounded like a child that cries out to get his own way. <br /> <br /> Katelin was just a person who was annoying. To try to make people really enjoyable and helpful. They also call the name of two skaters and they say something about their choreographer and says that he has threatened to "draw the line". <br /> <br /> We all know where he would go with him and Spencer. They classically did not like them together, and eventually they were typical to join together. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this is a movie that you want to see if you want a skateboard, but if you do not care, the main Skater is very annoying. It's time to basically kill time.
