Some people do not like animation. Personally, I thought the animation was quite remarkable when the movie was made. I only love old cartoons. With this movie my problems are not animation, but basically, the way it was built. The characters are just ... well, goofy. And for this movie they do not have to be. It seems that all of LOTR have a binding problem (for beginners). Overall, I was annoyed by the overall behavior. My two sisters and I both laughed most of this movie. If many people have seen before seeing them, they will not disappear. I rented it happy and I did not buy it. There are some movies that give me a headache. It was one of them. However, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, even if it's gone. Or bottom, depending on your view.
