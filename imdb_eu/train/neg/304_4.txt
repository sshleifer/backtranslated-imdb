This movie portrays Ruth for women, drinking, playing, and sports with a small baseball. Babe Ruthe was very interesting first time, and this film was not abandoned. Likewise, Lou Gehrig was hardly covered, and the good relationship he knew well, bad or indifferent, was better covered than it was. His life was more than bad. It was an American hero, a lot of baseball players that transformed the icon. I think that I'm directing this movie with a baseball player who is totally ignored. The shame of the makers of this film, due to its exploitation of errors and not its greatness.
