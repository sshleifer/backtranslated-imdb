Werner Herzog's "borrowed" name and the liberal help of Kubrick, Haneke and Noe are evident when Thomas Clay cut off his British film over ordinary rubbish. "Robert Carmichael" (short) poses as a realistic alienation alienation and at the same time criticism of the war in Iraq. The problem of realism is that the characters are so unrealistic and unusual, most of the anti-shocking images of "extreme" filmmakers have no adolescent drug addicts. As a critic of the war in Iraq, a film about youth violence (a classical talented musician - a social context that has damaged a sensitive society) is hardly a child to think about. There are signs of technical competence, but some reviewers have passed this. Kubrick and Noah have shown that the desire to connect with alleged intentions is the worst film of the latest film. People liked "Clockwork Orange" and "Irreversible" because they liked rapes and ravages, but they liked to feel the most hateful of the culture they liked above all. So much Kubrick and not enough Haneke (serious and moral filmmaker) nominates here one of the most moronic films in the years. (I do not oppose the violence against the film. Seriously, it's a tough trick, though - people in the cinema homethethals encouraged Alex as "Clockwork Orange" shows how Kubrick missed a thousand miles away, the intentions of many filmmakers than.)
