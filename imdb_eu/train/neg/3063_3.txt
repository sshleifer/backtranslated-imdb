They are images that glorify a hero. As an example, Bonnie and Clyde bank robberies were glorified, and they really felt sensitivity despite their evil deeds. Why? When both people were depressed, they were desperate to survive. <br /> <br /> This film has no substance. Viggo Mortens' character appears as a folk hero. Why? Goes to Idaho Highway towards the hospital where his wife is knocked down. No one is worried about why he tries to escape. Even worse, when it becomes apparent, it is not a colloquial body of terrorism, while governments try to avoid helping them keep their ends at their ends. a radio station that builds a story with our hero's help. <br /> <br /> The endless one is totally incredible.
