Actually, this does not match Cagliostro Castle. Lupine is not funny or bad or hyperactive. Landscapes and music are inspired and plot is not interesting. <br /> <br /> Fujiko's good nudity (that is, only by version). The scenes helped create boring. CoC had an unlucky stick and the movie set some imaginary pieces. The locations in TSoTG are not very vivid and they are not passionate. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemonek and Jigen also offer no casual entertainment. It seems like the obligation of hiring was being met. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in full frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extra, including a few thresholds. But it's a strange thing. Once inserted, the chapter selection is not displayed on the disc or time-chronicle displayed on the player. Even if you can continue the next scene with the remote number.
