101 The only reason I saw Dalmatians was designing Oscar's song and costume designs. I must admit that I was amazed at this film. After this, Cruella DeVilek (Glen Close plays this role very well) is released from the hospital due to his good behavior. He likes all kinds of animals and blocks all his creatures. From this moment on, we wait until the crisis begins. Soon enough, he tries to make the best fashion world weapon, of course, himself and Dalmatian fine hair. Not only Glen Close, but I found everyone to be stupid, but it's fun for the child's eyes. This is quite reasonable because I believe that it is due to its target market, children under 12 years of age. Leisure and children are pretty good for families, but I have not had much value. * outside *****
