This is the movie I've ever seen in my life. No, really. I'm not joking. Except for all "true stories / historical references", there is no excuse for such a bad performance. It's shame, as others have published, since the costumes and outfits were excellent. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was a typical "Asian" style, although I could not understand it from "modern". A love song when Fernando lay down in bed, when he thought of Mary. I do not know who wrote and sang that beautiful song, but suddenly Norah Jones was transported in the 1500s. <br /> <br /> Phychus Hershey was a realistic blood of the syrup that was more realistic than ketchup. Kwik-n-EZ fight scenes. <br /> <br /> But acting. Oh, so weird. Top lines delivered as a bad game. Gary Stretch wore a potato costume at the 4H County Fair, perhaps more believable. Eventually it was heard just like the one on Little Street in Italy. Sometimes, "Adrian!" I expected him to shout. or "I want a part of myself!". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A favorite line: when the queen tells her lover (after losing her ground) "I'll make a baby." "Child?" He responded. He said "no, jackass, a chair! Duh."
