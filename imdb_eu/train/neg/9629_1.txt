I saw this happily, fortunately, and I wanted it better than it was, but it's really old things that really make film studios over the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple of opponents, yet they are attracted to each other. <br /> <br /> This land line will not surprise you and will surprise you, it's not a movie. <Br /> <br /> Many audience gag and templates. In the middle of the movie, I began to realize that Ben Stiller was not really funny, but it was very difficult. And Jennifer Anniston really is not that nice, but her hair seems great. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman have had to pay a lot of money for this type of ho-hum film average, I expect more from them. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see American Splendor, after seeing a really funny and original movie, and I compared them in my mind, and I would like to see the film director want to force him to sit through these two films. It would include a sense in them, and <br /> <br /> they started making better movies with strangers than the best in the aircraft.
