My wife and I agree that this is a bad movie ever made. Certainly, I saw them by the way between ten. At least "9 Plan" was nice. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "Christine", "The Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie" and her other films. I do not like much "Cujo" (the sounds that I saw so badly in versions as I was, and often I did not tell people what he was saying), or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)." <Br /> <br /> But this mess was a total mistake at all possible. The "creatures" themselves were designed for 9-year-old children. (For no children under 9 years of age). <br /> <br /> The "Liner" also wept and we were not a fun one.
