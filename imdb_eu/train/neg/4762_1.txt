I saw this movie I did not see anything before. The land was horrible because of the lack of information. The movie did not feel "the battle of the spirits". The cast were driven out of nonsense, from time to time my teeth were horrified and shaken. The land was predictable except for the erotic erotic scene of the stomach abdomen (I am not homophobic but my stomach physically ill), although the end was preferred. And you can tell that the detective was in a costume by Jude Law, a fake accent, a terrific dance, everything that was to guard his facial hair, he said was a disguise. I lost the whole movie from life. This movie was the feeling of a puppet show by Jude Law and Michael Caine, as a puppet and house, to see the show as a window, I think it's really boooring.
