I watched Woody Allen's new movie, I am a fan of his work and I will try to see everything he does, although the review of this film has brought me a desperate effort. They were right This is a confusing movie, it can not decide on comedy, romantic fantasy or a drama about the mid-life crisis. Three fails. <br /> <br /> Alice (Mia Farrow) is a restless middle-aged woman who has been married to a wealth of wealth and has a luxurious life with boring husbands and two small children. The land distribution concept is quite everyday, such as cheating Chinese folk as a healer, with its invisible herbs, and the lover's ancient ghost (which flies over Manhattan). If these additives are fantastic for you, something something prosaic like the saxophonist's affair? <br /> <br /> I was never really sure what this meant. They are just a few very entertaining moments of the film, and Pollyanna's touch is completely absurd. <br /> <br /> Rent 'Delitos y Fracasos', an excellent movie that combines comedy. with serious ethics and morale analysis. Or go back to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan".
