This film is used as a death movie for "big twist" in the 1990s. In some circles, known as Kyser Soe Syndrome, M. Night Shayamalan has filmed a hand-made movie, and Ron Howard has used a variant of A BEAUTIFUL MIND. However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles called "Mr. Madonna") The use of soe is much weaker. <br /> <br /> Jason Statham (with a very ambitious head of hair) is Jack Green (known as "Green Lord"). In addition, Gold's may be a masterful punishment master or not. Or perhaps, Mr. Gold is an irritable spirit that can hold the spiritual members. I'm not very sure, but I definitely do not like it. REVOLVER is the overwhelmingly abusive exaggeration I have had for a long time. It is a time structured structure, painful jump pain, constant internal monologues and heavy animation sequences. The "all-in-one kitchen sink" of the correct style makes Quentin Tarantino's work relax. I think that cinemas and film mirrors that I was telling Ritchie to be telling myself that I was just telling stories. <br /> <br /> The film meets the revelation moments, they are supposedly surprising, but they only come from Mr. Green's news. I liked the green, as I always enjoy Stratham, before two steps before others. Here, however, he fights as a leading English teacher of English Literature. His lack of understanding is the lack of limitations on Macha (Ray Liotta) for girls. The landscape is starving as starving, as on his shoulder, Liotta listens to the ring, the tears and the movie at the speed of overtones and printed leopards. <br /> <br /> REVOLVER has not been enriched. Ritchie is another scene of the film and the worst version of SWEPT AWAY can still overcome his worst film.
