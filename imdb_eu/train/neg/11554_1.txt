The film is a shame of the filmmaker. I can not believe it's a comedy mode, it's not fun. The script was not only, but the questionnaire was to be shot by people. Gail O'Grady is a great actor, but beyond ... the remaining 99% ... besides. The rest ... it's much harder ... wow. Here's a comedy rule: DO NOT KNOW YOU. There are many very talented actors who can play drama and comedy in Canada; It's not one of them to use this movie. Canadian nepotism and casting directors help make Canadian films bad. I know this is technically a "US" movie, but the director, actors, location, etc. I looked at Bravo. They wanted to be ashamed of the rights to show this film. Once again, there are many films that do not have short films and they show this gap.
