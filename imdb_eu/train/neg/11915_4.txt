This clear pilot, produced series shows Shiri Appleby as young amused young actress as an amnesty, the incredible power of mankind when the devil is released worldwide. The CGI is matched to a TV job and Appleby is working as an amnosis, but it's hard to swallow it as a superhero. Television's familiar faces Richard Burgi is a tutor of Appleby, but he can not do anything that goes wrong. At first, we see demons fly too much cartoon, a bad sign. On the other hand, the scenes that are being fought with Burgi Appleby are really rewarding. There is a bad copy of some similar scenes from other films, the most prominent REMO WILLIAMS.
