I'm a fan of back movie Batman and TV. I loved the show (old and new) and I love all the movies. But this movie is not like many people expect. In my opinion, there is a big drop. I think the problem had no drama. Batman: The Mask Of The Phantasm and Batman Beyond: The Return Of The Joker has a lot of drama. and Batman and Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero also had drama. I also think that this movie is clear to Batman. The only scene that comes with little darkness is the end of the great battle of Bane. Anyway, Batman is a good movie. But I'd like to rent it.
