Unfortunately, this movie is very bad. Out of Towners was an original and very fun one, of course, a script written by Neil Simon. For some reason, Neil Simons's script is not used in this film, so it falls over time. The audience still did not laugh at me. The director is very slow and boring and when a joke dies, the joke dies, that is, the sex couple in the park. New York lighting announcement announced. We all know that the lights will light up and we can see beautiful Goldies and mugging. The whole movie is like this ... a joke is set and given. Why Goldies's hair does not warp the movie too much. You can also see it in all the closed Goldie (they use a very gentle lens). I recommend you hire with original Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, if you want to laugh.
