An awesome TV show! Komedy Central decided to repeat old events of this program for me. It's wonderful! I talk about the seasons that have passed since the first two years. The first two seasons were golden, and only if they were talking about those seasons, this show won ten stars and eight. The original cast was not good commanders that appeared after the first two seasons. They were, and they are terrific. Comedy is not funny. ALL !!! <br /> <br /> The original work was full of talented comedians, such as Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr and Mary Schorr (or whatever their name was), they had to offer them better since they left the MAD TV. This show is full and it is less worth your channel surfers than Saturday Night Live. Go on Saturday night and enjoy it, and let MAD TV die and it's worth it.
