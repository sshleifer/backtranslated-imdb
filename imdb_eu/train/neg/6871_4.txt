The excellent concept was wrong. Bad play, worse writing ... When I saw the first two episodes, I asked why he got it in both seasons. The characters are unforgettable, the writing is inadequate, the sets are fine. Special effects only make dull - so much time has improved over the same period: where is money for that? The first episode is interesting, then the fall is fast - the whole show is stupid. Now I'm not wrong to write, Sci-Fi fan and "geek" are huge - but this show has not cut. As I said earlier, I was very surprised to get on the second season - after a single season (Jake 2.0) it has been canceled. This show was a bad thing.
