The movie was awful. I was injured watching Almost every action was motivated in the context of the film; The performance was really poor (P.Diddy was the best actor that says something about that movie) and the plot was generally predictable. There were some connections to the Carlito Way, for example, one day dreaming about Carribine, but they were generally weak. In my opinion, the interest of love was wrong but more rigorous, but also controversial. In any case, I did not expect much before I watched the movie and I believe that these expectations are not met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez, because it is really a good actress (Friday Night Lights). Fortunately, but I'm sure that there is not too much movie. Overall, I get a good rating on the movies if I turn on my interest and I will move on and I will give it to this two star. Better luck next. Yes, I enjoyed the Carlito Way.
