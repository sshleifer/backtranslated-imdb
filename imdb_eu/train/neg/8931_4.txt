He who remembers farewell will tell you that I love bad films as much as I love, and I can say, at last, I have seen one of the most mythical mythical historical films: MYRA is almost impossible to confuse. BRECKINRIDGE. The adaptation of the best-selling book by Gore Vidal (later recovering this film later), the MYRA BRECKINRIDGE star team is a real movie that is really fun from the beginning to the end. The complete disaster of sex change operations and Hollywood's X film was at the box office and critics and audiences pulled out of the screen during the release. It is not surprising that the film won the worship status of the legendary state of war between film lovers, and I was very glad to see it for the first time for the first time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Many movies are not consistent, and whole sequences have been edited together, in semi-hazzard mode, with many scenes becoming virtually incomprehensible, as well as using footage footage from the Fox filmmaker, to incorporate it into a regular image, which means that the star of the movie Some of them are footage, such as Judy Garland and Shirley Temple, often portraying scenes of new movies in sexual acts, and the process does not work (thus causing minor upheavals as an actor), such as Temple and Loretta Young they were taken to their unauthorized use of their image). <br /> <br /> Sarne may not be the only blame, however, because the movie's script and quiz have shaken the audience a lot. your head in disbelief. For example, can you imagine that this filthy filmmaker Rex Reed (in the first and last roles of the first movie) may have sex change and will appear as a goddess of Raquel Welch's god! The movie becomes harder when Welchek Myrak tries to shoot a school with her strange uncle (with the legendary John Huston director) when she tries to shoot a school, a fascinating Nullian cell student (Farrah Fawcett) and a bad boy to teach. (Roger Herren) violating the lesson that raises the lesson. Everyone followed? <br /> <br /> And it gets even better (or worse, depending on your view)! I still have to mention the excellent star of the film: XIX. Symbolic Century of the Century's Mae West! Mrs. Mrs. Mrs. West was at the age of 77 in this film (she has been retired for 26 years), and apparently still considered herself a great sex symbol and a very talented male agent (including young). Tom Selleck) throws himself. It seems that this would not be bad enough, the deaf West tone actually makes two newly written songs in the middle of the new film, and I think maybe they'd listen to a permanent brain damage <br /> <br /> Of course, any "good" person with a sense of sense, Anyone who nominates me does not detect it at all, but I would give it MYRA BRECKINRIDGE 10 because he was always entertained by morbidity, although I did not know what would happen in hell. Also, most cast are really hard to try. Raquel has come up with something so misunderstood that makes things so sensible to see the film that is worthy of the movie. Only if he had worked with a good script and a good director, he could have received a respect for some critics. <br /> <br /> The rest is ok too. John Huston (which should be the correct image) is a fun and enjoyable moment with some fun moments, Rex Reed is not bad for all actors, and Farrah Fawcett is pleasing and pleasing to her. Roger Her was also well, but never again appeared in the film (thinking that Raquel Welch's guy could not live down again). And according to the description, as anyone anticipates, Mae West was totally excluded when he agreed to make this movie, but that is what makes fun of those who love bad movies.
