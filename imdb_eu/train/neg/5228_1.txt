The other night I watched the movie. I can not explain how to suck the movie. Writing, voice acting, claymation. Horrible, horrible, horrible Coming 24 hours to watch C-Span. It just works. It literally falls on everywhere it's possible. <br /> <br /> In the same way, the animation of the film is very bad quality. I know it was a movie made by a person, but it might have been thought to be 97 minutes, maybe at least 1 fun side to side. <br /> <br /> This show can be the worst film of all time. Yikes It was really bad. If you're looking for a movie that makes you laugh, clear yourself from this abomination. My advice: do not buy or look at it. The will of yourself
