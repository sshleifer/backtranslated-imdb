I saw the director of "Woman On The Beach" and I could not understand it with good reviews. This movie is much like that, two people trapped in a relationship with little dynamics and less interested in others. Like other films, you want to listen to a simple conversation, walking very little and bewitching characters that are not very interesting. If you like this movie, do not stop my opinion. I like minimalism in films, but I think Tsai Ming-Liangen films are very high. Lee Kang-Sheng's actor is very good at his films. There's nothing here. I mean UU likes it, but I do not want it. Okay
