After seeing the other three versions of the same movie, it is terrifying to me that it is the weakest, especially for Scott's poor performance. His emotions are very bland, cinema is difficult. Alistair Sim imagined better the infinite role. When Scrooge was the most intelligent one, you do not have any compelling meaning when Scott says he talks and he does not believe that he has undergone his metamorphosis. The actors in this movie that are in line with Alistair Sim do not think so. Although the music version (and actually Muppets) is better. Very depressing
