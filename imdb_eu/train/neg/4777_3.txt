Behind this film it was a good idea. Bad was not well written. Sidney Poitier was a good idea as a FBI agent, and he did a great job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, only knows one emotion in his films, anger. Kirstie Alley's character could be excellent, and she also showed some opportunities, but the writer really left us as a helpless woman. That was quite the opposite with the supposed person. However, I do not like Alley's performance. He had to finish the film fifteen minutes beforehand. The director cried out before the last unbelievable action. This will be saved as an example of the Poitier shows in my collection.
