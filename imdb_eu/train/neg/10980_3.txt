A really horrifying movie. At the beginning of the 90s, it appears that a straightforward person wants to show that he is good for a normal and normal homosexual. Until being offensive, LTR suggests a dumb gay, lonely, and sexual immobility to improve monogamy and marital salvation. Wow! Who knew? The accompanying characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes (effervescent buffoon, bitter queen, lone reds, etc.), and the main characters are milchetoast, middle and middlebrow clones with a unique interest. <br /> <br /> With regard to the romantic and ideological struggle against the elderly, there is no need to say much: we have seen everything and we have done much better.
