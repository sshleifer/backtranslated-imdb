It is really sad that he was supposed to work with the highest budget "Halestorm Entertainment". All the participants should put a fine on the landfill, since all celluloid is only for rubbish. It's a serious writing and it's a terrifying joke, but the camera's work and the quality of the movie are the best. The soundtrack is similar to that produced by laptops. The worst part of all I was really sitting on. In my opinion, I just thought that buying a card and seeing myself in the theater is not a "movie".
