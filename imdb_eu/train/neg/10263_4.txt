Yes, The Southern Star has a pretty solid tone that Matt Monro has topped up with. He describes the tone of this bad character and the wrong ones, with George Segal and Ursula Andress confused as a rover in search of a big diamond. Add Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, not less) to look for an ostrich, wildlife footage, and photos made by Raoul Coutard and dull. And even if you do not go through Senegal's jungle.
