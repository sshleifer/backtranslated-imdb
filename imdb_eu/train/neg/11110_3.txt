I'd like to know, I do not often rate movies in grade 5. I was originally very excited to see this movie. I've been blowing up several TV episodes for several months to see this movie REAALLY. So when I saw that last night was available on FearNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and I sat down to see the movie. <br /> <br /> The story seemed quite interesting: some people are talking about unexpected people. underground An obsessed photographer with people is missing. Where will they go? What happens to you? One day, he has seen a connection he has made to his wife, and becomes obsessed with that butcher, following him, yada yada. The movie had an absurdity for you, even if you had a great deal of anticipation. "Oh, no, it's gloomy, I look back", I am bored with cheap agitation. <br /> <br /> Although land was predictable, it was very interesting ... until the end. "It was just fine ... So they are just stupid," says Jack_skellington_freke in the message boards. And I totally agree. And here comes spoilers ... <br /> <br /> See, I was a mad murderer, I expected that cannibalism was an obsessed person. No Keeping certain social secrets alive for centuries. Woo Which is original What is unrealistic? How dull <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come to Lionsgate. You've had amazing movies, but this got sunk.
