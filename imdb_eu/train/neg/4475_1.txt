horrible, horrible! My friend in my room watched this garbage and I was blamed. The book is one of my favorites and it is shameful for some people to never know what it really is, their first impressions are dribble. so many have changed, it is almost impossible. This is a book that unnoticed me, however, because it reads a teleportist, offering enough food for daytime entertainment. Life films are a movie that can be "based on a real story, but they are completely fictional. There is no emotion or depth of the book, no melodrama. If you are looking for a way to read a high school student, I suggest you try another version.
