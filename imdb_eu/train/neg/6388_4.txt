The Brothers Quay, according to conventional thoughts, were forced to make short films. I really liked his first feature film, the Institute Benjamin, but I tried his effort with the Earth Tuner of Earthquakes, I agree, I am not in favor of equalizing the length of the original genius. Piano tuner is, without a doubt, a beautiful movie and often heard. Unfortunately, the boundary is difficult depending on the narrative and the glacial pace. Reading a plot summary seems like a pretty good story. However, the brothers do not compassion for life. One thing that should be avoided in the future: conversation. God, it's horrible here. A big bust.
