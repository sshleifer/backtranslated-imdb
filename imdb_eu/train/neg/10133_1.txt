If you are not the mentally ill or the second toughest rumor, you may be so tired of being a movie that is less than 5 minutes below the horizon. <br /> <br /> Shame - Even for a Seagal movie, the plot is just stupid. I mean not only bad, it's not nearly consistent. <br /> <br /> Playing - Wooden terribly. See them literally in better porn. Ironically, this movie tries to apprehend this audience that is completely dead in 'lesbian love scene'. <br /> <br /> The special effects would not look like a 60-year-old sword and sorcerer film. <br /> <br /> If you do not suffer from insomnia and do not run out of other cures, do not make the same mistake as I did and, as I bought this DVD, you'll be prompted again for half an hour of your life. .
