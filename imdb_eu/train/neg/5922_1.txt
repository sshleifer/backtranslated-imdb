My mother maintains a cassette of this movie as a global threat to any film she loves. It's all about it. <br /> <br /> So it's a real classic. <br /> <br /> Who gave 10/10? Did anyone notice that he saw a good movie and did you vote for it involuntarily? <br /> <br /> Everyone in the movie processor should see a small part of this movie. It must be a stain that will be impossible to reflect on all film festivals in a sacred film.
