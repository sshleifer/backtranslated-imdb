SPOILER ALERT! ! ! Personally, I do not understand why he would not be able to save Pete Williams life. I would like to say, that would be why he was motivated or forced. I am sure that members of the Secret Service were every day for the public and that the writer was a murmur. A member of the Secrets of the Service, which is now clearly motivated. Well, this rental movie will not satisfy you, old and used attacks, average theater, simple things in this movie, just keep waiting. As a Clark Johnson SWAT director I've been doing a much better job this time and I still wonder how producers (for example, Michael Douglas) left this movie.
