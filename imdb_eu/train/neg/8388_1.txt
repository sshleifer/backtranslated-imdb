Experience comes with this stunning heart. I hope you never have something like that. * cough * Razzie prize * cough * <br /> <br /> I did not like it because there was no movie, because it was not foreseeable and inane. While I was seeing it, I felt that I was feeling in a psychological experiment to determine what low standard films could get before people complain. When I asked for my money at the end of the movie, they told me everything, "I did not see any money back." Assistant directors told me that they had been denouncing several people and getting refunds. <br /> <br /> The movie summary is pretty basic. He throws a finger-thief robbing a diamond and exposes babies to get out of the police. However, under a cartoon, there is a repertoire with original, fresh and funny rays. Or not. <br /> <br /> Ask him / her the following: Do you want people to see people who hit the pan? Would you like to joke? Do you know that the dwarf threatens to pose as a baby threatened by the thermometer? Do you want to tear your breed's jokes? Do you think that babies say 'goo goo goo goo goo ga ga ga ga'? Are you sorry <br /> <br /> If you answer "yes" to one of the above, definitely this movie is for you. Although it has been billed in some places, it works like "The Worst Movie in this Decade, probably a movie or 2 are worse ... somewhere." I can not tell you surely. This movie has been rated 2 stars, because we know a revision with a single star reviewing the reviewer's aspects, and then the review would not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This low comedy is aimed at less intelligent audiences and I can not recommend anyone with good conscience. Save your money for fun. <br /> <br /> Respect
