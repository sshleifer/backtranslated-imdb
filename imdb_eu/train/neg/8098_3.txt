This is one of the toughest rewriters I have ever seen. If they want to make a movie with a harsh story, they should avoid avoiding the title of a beautiful book. There is no relationship between Wolfe's book and the title movie. I do not like changes when the story is on the screen. At least the changes would not be damaging to the final product. The last episode of the film is painful. Actors are confusing. The director and / or writers writer has not been able to decide whether to make a cheerful comedy or to preach disbelief for preaching. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie and have not liked it, try the book. If you have watched this movie and liked it, read the book.
