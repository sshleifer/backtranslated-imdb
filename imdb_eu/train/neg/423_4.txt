I do not know why, but I thought it was a new movie after the NPR rumor ... If you are interested in the BBC document and NatGeo projects that have been used on the program programs. ... has been using sappy narrative and dramatic music to take advantage of Earth Day for Disney - there are excellent moments and it's always nice to listen to Darth Vader ....... oops, ... ......... James Earl Jones speaks, but I waited for the movie I swore, taking into account the new camera technology for this film ...... child sanitized for the public. , so you can really see the best footage on youtube for free ... Koyannisquatsi (sic) is the base and I feel this movie is definitely not that.
