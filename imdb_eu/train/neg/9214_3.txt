There are many things that are clear about seeing this film: 1) the play is awful. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so many, but the conflict of parents and children is on the border of soap opera-ish. The other two boys: I am very sterile with the child's prodigy and dreaming dreaming dreamer; 2) The whole movie is a reminder and disappointing; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes are disturbing (directed by Tom Hanks); 4) Initial love is an odd opportunity to introduce ballads ("we are special friends"); 5) curious lines and side plots are not through a tremendous improvement; and 5) this movie is very bad. Expect to be disappointed and probably disturbed.
