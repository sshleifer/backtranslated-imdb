Uta Hagen's "Performing respect" is a manual for many college theater courses. In the book, Hagen presents two key points of view to develop as a character actor: presentation and representation. In the presentation's perspective, the actor carries out the character as honestly as possible, introducing emotional elements of the actor's life. In the representation view, the actor tries to present an effect of emotion through high motion and sound control. <br /> <br /> The activity's representation vision is still fashionable when this trendy Hamlet was made. . The British theater has a long history of this style of acting and Olivier's representation can be said to be the last king of the school. <br /> <br /> It's not time to play or to be similar to this movie. . Almost all the actors of the act pose a current presentation. For the modern eye, Olivier's statement and the stylized running of the bulls are sharp, rigid and sharp. Instead of creating a hamlet instead of a hamlet, Olivier proclaimed a melancholy Dane, he made a self-relevant high-beam, a style of acting that could well take on the backs of the great London theater, but it's also very scarce. modern Hamlet. <br /> <br /> And so, the movie uncainfully with ice cream. Olivier's tendencies to e-nun-ci-eat Some Hamlet lines make a funny mistake: "However, you have to ask for it and you can give it a step ... Smooth-ness!" Instead of crying to meet the father's ghost (just like any other actress), the brightness of the students of Olivier's pupils gives us this impression. <br /> <br /> Ten Fifteen Eileen Herlie is another actress. A good attempt at the queen, despite considerable age differences (at the age of 41, she was 26). The other actors in this film do not have to make any significant significance, as Olivier tries to save himself! camera! to him! everywhere! times! <br /> <br /> Sixty years later, you feel the insecurity of theatrical actors in Shakespeare, who had no confidence in representing Hamlet aggressive. The final analysis: "I would be such a man from Termagant, but Herod Herod: I pray, avoid."
