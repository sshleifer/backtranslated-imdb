Hayden Christianson and Jessica Alba, my favorite actors of this century, are working on the two remakes that are likely to be the remake of Butterfly Effect. Awake is so sad, and it's so interesting for sleep. Terrance Howard has recovered from the awesome Rush of August, and she puts a decent fight on Christianon's death because everything seems to be wrong and after seeing her play, I would gladly. <br/> <br /> Silver surfer rise. It is naturally disastrous and always the same. It was only once that Robert Brightren's CEO was in the hands of Sin City. Jessica Alba is probably not the one who is the poorest of an actor and surely her acting skills are being misguided. If so, it would expose Awake. What would happen to a script that embarrasses the Plan 9 Outer Space? Jessica Alba, Hayden Christenson and Terrence Howard are the first director / screenwriter of the psychological thriller on a male from Joby Harold. It is similar to the ordinary surgical phenomenon known as "aesthetic consciousness", where those who sit at the operating desk know well what is happening around them, although they are totally paralyzed and can not help. When a successful young man (Christenson) is under the knife and unnecessarily anesthesia does not work well, fear begins immediately after his wife is worried (Alba) is waiting for anxiety and can cause drama in the room. <br /> <br /> With the purpose of making board operations for Final Destination, the first efforts of Joby Harold are creating blood thinners. According to the credit sequence, about 700 people suffer from a phenomenon called "anesthetic awareness", the patient continues to be conscious but cross the surgery. An unhappy person is Clayton Beresford Jr (Hayden Christensen), while he feels awake in a heart transplant ... and he feels only one snipe. <br /> <br /> By the time the inventor looks at his tortured. Psyche, Awake fails to inject the real terror in its innovative premieres. Shining simplicity turns into absurd agitation, shakes Christensen and Jessica Alba shifts. Would you be happy to watch it before? <br /> <br /> VERSION: The very best awake is very hard. An unforgettable movie was definitely better looking at paper. As a film it is extremely generic and highly derivative. Awake is not afraid to enter into his premise novel. The final result is pretty bad. Alba and Christian are your worst concerns, because the biggest movie is the fear of the audience. Awake is surely a movie that you sleep.
