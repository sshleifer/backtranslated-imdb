If you get scenes involving Albert Brooks without a shirt ... try not to throw it on a leather stem. <br /> <br /> I like Albert Brooks. I've seen most of them, even if they're not all movies, but I've seen this one the first time. Modern Romance is an interesting look at the theme of love. They are in a series of films that manage films such as Despair of Love or Modern Romance, although the Chilly Scenes of Winter 1979 is very close. Both of them basically focus on psychologically / obsessed obsessed men. <br /> <br /> When the cold theme of the Winter Theme confines the maid's remorse, this movie has more themes with the theme. In love, two people already have a relationship ... and out of relationships ... and again. <br /> <br /> And because it's a movie published in 1981, it's time. styles and such. This is the main reason I like this movie. The basic film rule "If you're sucking at least historical significance," you know the time capsule stuff. <br /> <br /> That's what leads me to the awesome scenes of Albert Brooks's tee shirt. <br /> <br /> The man is hair. Very hair Like a black curly trousers. And, even worse, it feels almost guilty to the victims hairy. It's not a pleasant sight and the scenes without camera continue. At the beginning of the 80s, the hairy man was normal and nothing seemed stunning. But seeing something like that in 2009 is fairly straightforward. Sorry, Albert! At some point, someone said "let's try this scene, but wearing a simple shirt might scare people with you." It's really bad and I'm feeling like Albert Brooks with his bare body with his acting actors. He is likely to have his hair removed from his teeth after a few days. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a good movie. It might have been better if Albert Brooks did not see the shirt I did not see long and persistent minutes, I would definitely swear the conception of this movie.
