I remember 86 years watching this movie, when it first came out and what a horrible movie was. The performance was atrocious, the plot was so flexible or it could flow into a wind of wind. I think I've slept more than once and I was not tired of remembering it. Please avoid getting better at all costs, even with anesthetic that does not remove all of your teeth, that is, it would be more entertaining. It's just a shame I'm not given a zero or a negative score. I have not forgotten my money since everything I get from the video store, as I said, it was hardly surprising that it was hardly surprising that the movies were so bad. I remember going to sit well and I really wanted to go out with a girl I wanted to go out & sitting next to me was the fact that it was still not enough for me to keep awake this movie was bad.
