Without a doubt, the worst film I've wasted is the worst! The plot is, sorry, I said it was a plot? It was a terrifying moment ... I could not think of it! The best effect that was hidden under the covers of the beds ... I did not think anything about it. You know who was the murderer from the beginning. The whole movie was not afraid, in fact, only two bizarre little interesting little sisters were watching, Misty, watching the shower and seeing Toppan Nurse. This movie will only be seen to see an idea about horror movie.
