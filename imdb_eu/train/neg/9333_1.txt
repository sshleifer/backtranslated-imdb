Amazing !!! I do not want to be negative, but this movie has a stupid monkey. What a disaster it is. I can not believe that this movie is bad. The interviews are very strange and unknown issues, sometimes cameras work. Terrible, on the other hand, music like Lawrence Arab soundtrack I watched this movie to see how much worse it could be. The disaster of some of the "actors" on the sides is a complete disaster. I'm sorry but my finger and toes and nothing. my body hanging down, it falls to the ground. Harvey Keitle is an excellent actor, but who knows that participating in a fiasco movie might be part of a financial crisis. . . . . The movie was to be presented to all the students of all the films in order to learn how to not learn a movie
