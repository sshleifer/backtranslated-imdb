This movie is not as good as all the Christ's films I have ever seen. And I'm surprised that in this story, Pilate wants to end Jesus, when the Scriptures (as well as the other films) are different. There is also an important question: the Resurrection .. All other films do not denounce this important part: all of us have faith in this event. As Paul says, "If Christ is not raised from the dead, our faith is useless." In this movie, it was a very spectacular scene for me to see the remains of palms used by Jesus when he entered Jerusalem. <br /> <br /> In the end, and against my Jewish commentary, Jesus was not my myth. And, indeed, it was JEW. There are many documents (religious and secular) that demonstrate the existence of this excellent human being (or, in spite of everything, that God became a human being), he changed humanity. Flavius ​​Josephus, the brightest Jewish commissioner in 1, I recommend reading (given to the historian). Century.
