This is undoubtedly one of the most curious films ever made, even for Fellini. Especially extravagant is SATYRICON. That is, an hour and a half, through a strange nightmare world of nightmares, opulence and sexual challenges. Sutherland Casanova is very curious and unpleasant, and the viewer fails in a series of unrelated yarns that come from high quality autobiography. Art direction and clothing design, however, are remarkable. The Academy lost its name to the former, but the same justice was awarded to the latter by an OSCAR. Also, the uncapped (rarely) scripted, meaningless and almost impossible. Go to the image !! The video is only 150 minutes in the film, about 16 minutes with the original duration. This audience appreciated.
