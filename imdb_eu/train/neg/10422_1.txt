First of all, I am not afraid of it ... Except for my phobias, the movie is totally horrible. This is not suitable for children! My voice disturbed me when I opened my mouth all the time. I could not believe how horrible it was to be a huge murder in horror movies! It is necessary to be so scary and I recommend that G. G. be over 8 years old to see it. But I'm not wrong to write it, I'm sure it was a good movie if I was not humorous. I can not believe that a parent can allow a 4-year-old child to see this. For children, children should not forget the intense and intense gory. I am 4 years old and I was shocked by violence. I do not recommend it
