After several years of living in Japan, this film does not reflect Japanese culture and does not come close to explaining what Geisha has. Unfortunately, a great opportunity has been lost to bring Japanese culture closer to Western audiences and Zen, Samurai, can unleash the origins of the geisha world of the Kyoto world. While some of the coolest moments in the movie show up in the Japanese environment, the Geisha dances were not real. The use of Chinese music was too much. Little but essential detail: the use of incense sticks is never seen anymore. The scenes of Sakura were almost obscenly kitsch! It is interesting that the Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese people.
