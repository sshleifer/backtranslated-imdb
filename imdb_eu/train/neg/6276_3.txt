THE BROKEN After Dark is part of Horrorfest III. Not full of slasher or gore. Many glass and mirrors in France and Sean Ellis writer and director. A successful radiologist Gina McVay (Lena Headly) goes through a strange world, it seems that her life is out of control. While Father's (Richard Jenkins) birthday party goes on, guests are amazed because a mirror ruins the ground, for no reason whatsoever. Things are strange when a street in London is the scene of a woman who is identical with herself driving. Gina goes into the apartment of her doppelganger and takes her picture with her father. It drives away and causes a headache. Then, mysteriously, her boyfriend is not the same; Having specific family and friends is not an easy trust. Is Gina herself? Is it in a parallel world? His nightmares become awesome ... has he broken? <br /> <br /> If you can figure out this ... it will not be easy. The edition can not be narrower. Lighting is doubtful. Other players: Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
