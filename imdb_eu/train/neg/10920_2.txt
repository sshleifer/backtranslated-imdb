That must have been one of the worst movie ever I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I have to agree with another verb, because it said that the special effects were good. I have found bad times: since it was not realistic and it was so false they were far from these stories. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this distraction is the reason I did not fully understand the story. Archaeologists are looking for a "set". They do not have to worry about what sets or what's so special. They do not know why they look for it in California, while the introduction of the movie takes place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you shoot a movie in the desert, take the effort. really go to the desert. Initially, the old ceremony - seems to have shot through a studio instead of a desert. <br /> <br /> The level of action was in a constant film, incidents and ups and downs, without the highest points. The film has made a brief appearance, which is undoubtedly a special feature of the film.
