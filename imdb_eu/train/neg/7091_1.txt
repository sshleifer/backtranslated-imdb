This movie was very fun and I could hardly see what it was. VIDEO is filmed! DO NOT film! From the beginning of the 1970s I have not seen anything similar to that, late-night networks showed films in the 'horror films' that were shown on the weekend ... The video seems like a bad luck, which is wonderful. Some actors shoot their best. Michael Des Barres does well to do what he wants to do to avoid controlling him as a sexual addiction. I can not see seeing it nice. Nastassja Kinski, a therapist, sits almost on the chair with a full-length camera, with no angle of camera changes. I can not blame others for a bad block, but it's incredible in its role. Her little voice works against her. I'm a fan of Nastassja Kinski. Certainly, age is different and exotic, but it's out of it. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paule is in a traumatic way. All the lines it offers are three points of surprise. Someone ordered him to pay all the expenses. Why would Michael Des Barres want to associate with that sex's kiss? But that does not mean much. <br /> <br /> I have been the worst movie I've ever seen this year.
