I thought it was a dry movie ... it was a disappointment not a plot ... it was waiting for something to happen and nothing was dried like a bone ... lots of money ... Robins Williams's longest movie. I hope to wait a few months on the DVD, because it seems like a model of filmmaking that does not work well in the theater, which is like a rent before the end of the year ... You do not want to see or say why I had spent my money! In addition, only 8 people were watching for a new movie ... Friday night was shown at 9:50 a.m. I also thought that there was more excitement or something awake. When the characters talked about the movie, the voices were very low, but you could not say what they said ...
