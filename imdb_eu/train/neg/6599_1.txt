Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a famous actor. Almost the movie that's been running is almost perfect. Now, George had nothing to do with that movie ... but he just said something that T describes to the movie. <br /> <br /> I did not remember his specific words, but he essentially said. Great writing can save a bad mistake, but behavior can not be saved as a bad handwriting. This little observation is never the most true "Laurel and Hardy in all new adventures, love or mummy". <br /> <br /> The rowing of two rows was perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) are not only looking at parts, but they do an excellent job by imitating a real deal (Mannerism and all). This movie must be a permanent testament to his talents. That said, the face of the movie is fading (you guessed it) when writing. <br /> <br /> Apart from opening the conversation between Pinchot and Sartain (it was a very "character") and a short gag that includes a taxi, this movie can be seated. <br /> <br /> ARAZO # 1: too much time and effort on the plot. <br /> <br /> I do not want to. Knowing why the British mummies want to kidnap a pretty lady. I want to see Stan and Ollie (or at least their stand-in). He spent too much of the picture on the explanation of the plot or the explanation of a not very entertaining side character. <br /> <br /> However, if this movie had been jokes, they would still leave that. with us ... <br /> <br /> ... PROBLEM # 2: most jokes would be called "down" slapstick. <br /> <br /> What do I mean by "watering"? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In Slapstick, a character loses an exaggerated way for comedic effects (or Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ... or Laurel and Hardy?). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Watered" in the slapstick (as defined), a character shakes or wounds, and filmmakers play this comic effect. <br /> <br /> Perhaps an illustration would help: <br /> <br /> Looney Tunes shot Daffy Duck by Elmer Fudd. He turns his bill off and puts it back. That's the classic slapstick. <br /> <br /> "Gem" in Ollie suddenly blows with people. They surround you, be careful and continue happily. That's not a slapstick. That's not funny too. That's ... boring ... and this movie is kind of joke. This movie is like bread and butter. Writers and directors take on these bad times and act as they are fun. As given, the example I gave is an extreme case, but I can not shake it much. <br /> <br /> Short Story: The movie does not work because the script fails to pinchot and Sartain's ability to represent Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script strikes out landslides and jokes. Watching this movie basically looks like two superb material without material material. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, incredible sleep support. <br /> <br /> I say this to you. One with a stick and a real deal ("Atoll K" and "Be Big") is empty.
