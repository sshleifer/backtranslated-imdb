I heard this film because I never heard Robert Mitchum participated in the retrospective of the London National Theater. Almost 60 years have been the most enjoyable in the list, with at least seven names - in addition to the high-turnover Mitchum, in the public domain; Charles McGraw is not long before The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, much earlier than Dallas and, undoubtedly, the theater designer is also known as Norman Daughter, Walter Brennan, who has no income, Frank Faylen, the sadistic mommy in The Lost Weekend and a fascinating town, Robert Preston, out of the decade, with Harold Hill's Tom Music and Phyllis Thaxter. Oh, most of them lost time. I did not seem to have looked at the "signing" scene as it was for Robert Wise to be a bullhorn. He made about a dozen films and he still found a style. This story is that our old friend is a warlike outbreak and Mitchum had to think that Hopalong Cassidy oaters would cut off his teeth. There are no new tricks; Mitchum says that Preston's scene is not incredible because of sleeping with Thaxter to get information about plans for her father's cattle breeding. That's the truth, but how did Mitchum know? We have not seen or heard anything to indicate how he found it. Balance should not be said so much.
