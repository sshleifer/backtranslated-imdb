This movie is the story of Eddy as mentioned in the title and a house of the old friends of a sea community. Plots bring it to the friendly team, because Eddy was left behind as a means to face the death of a friend who is somewhat liable. But that is not unimportant, because the choices made in production are very weak and not fully realized. Scripts do not always have to joke, but at least they should help story development. Here is a reminder that something like a line like "coming out" or "love with no heart" reminds us of the time of the audience. Likewise, whenever the writer loses the next loss, he strikes a musical mount of the protagonist in some areas with a mood of indie music. Talk about trying hard. If you are interested in a good movie, those who provide the right quality and substance style will not make this film for you.
