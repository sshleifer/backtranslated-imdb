I came to this great hope film. I knew Greenaway's work and The Tempest and I liked it as an adaptation. The first one I wanted to spend ten minutes, but I thought it would be unfair. There was a statement of a storm, but do you think about a small boy who makes a pepper over a toy boat? What is symbolic? For another ten minutes, I continued with my fingertip with the "shutdown" button, somewhere that would catch my interest. This is not Shakespeare, it's not cinema. It's time and place, but I do not lose time and there's no place in Shakespeare's education. Twenty-five minutes later, I gave up and that was the end. I have read all the comments on this website and the film pretensions are only matched by its accused. "It's a painting ... then put it in a gallery," "it's a ballet ... keep it on stage". Shakespeare can be done intelligently, and theater groups are targeted at audiences, accessible, and this version helps make Shakespeare's and the general population marry.
