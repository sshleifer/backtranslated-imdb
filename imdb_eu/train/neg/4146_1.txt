After watching this, read the summary of the DVD back and then thinking about the real movie ... I was scared. I thought, maybe I was asleep and I dreamed I was a baby syndrome when they walked through an endless forest. People drive around 11 km an hour and do not stop at all, from time to time impossible lesbianism. Where (zombies?) From nowhere (vampires?) Who (seduced)? A citizen totally soul in the way of saving the world. Zones or vampires do not meet. The only fight I remember was to make this pantyhose by Bonnr Giroux. Coo Coo ca FAT! All! Perhaps we were seeing a broad panoramic view of it and it was too lazy to change it to the local separation, but this was really fun ... Therefore, my final thought thesis was more constant, argument, character development, antagonism, subject Gaia and this movie acting in full. Bloodrayne turned Public F *** into an appearance like ING KANE
