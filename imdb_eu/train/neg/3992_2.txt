Spike Lee has featured films by highlighting racism. In many movies, such as "Do The Right thing," most of the white people are wild racists. In this film, interracial marriage is the subject of racial encounters again. <br /> <br /> However, Lee once again shows his anti-Christianity against Christianity. The double standards in the world of cinema are amazing. If Lee or anyone else has produced this opposite bias against another group, Christians? Hey, it's "open season". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, the reverend of this movie, shoots his son and then puts his gun on his vibration. They increase your interest in another purchase, if you have lost. Hey, people, there is another reader here and look what he likes! Lee makes every movie that films such things. <br /> <br /> It shows hatred in front of race relations. Who can condemn a thing similar to racism? However, Lee's film continues as in his other films. Your obvious hatred towards you is not accepted. Sutara only adds fuel. <br /> <br /> Hey, Spike: start "doing well" and leave prejudices in the wardrobe. Better still, "overcome." <br /> <br /> This is a very bad thing, because this subject could have a thought that could make a movie, because it was made with objectivity and intelligence.
