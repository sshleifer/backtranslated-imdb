The premise was intriguing, but sadly this film does not do justice. Casting was pretty good, and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically the direction was much more consistent (too much was released quickly, no effect was made, it did not affect me ... Steven Bochco was waiting to run commercially.), The characters use the screen coke They were only identified (and all other things for Boogie Nights for the development of the characters), and characters were not characters to draw the viewer into the story. An unforgettable movie.
