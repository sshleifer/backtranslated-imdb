"Transylvania 6-5000", a horror parody of the mid-80s is a trivial, but sometimes funny, with very popular titles, and some of the real possibilities in that script. Gossipy sends out two newspapers from a newspaper Tabloid to send out an alleged story of Frankenstein's crazy scientist to send out much of his will. In the short film, there are several gimmicks and adventurous details to find out the left and right side of the right, for a little bit of breakfast for breakfast and eggs and laboratory tests to use cream and sugar on the breakfast table. The healthy movie, however, was not as successful as it was, jokes and excessive parody situations. Roger Corman's "Transylvania Twist" production, after four years, is much more entertaining and much more desirable. The film mainly parodies the Universal Universes at the beginning of the 1930s. That's why it's better to make sure you've seen all the tiny references. When his origin enters the laboratory, Frankenstein indicates that a character acts as a bad and evil scientist. Likewise, it has been revealed that the type of Messiah is worried about the condition of monsters with more than one kind of Damien's exile. Michael Richards, the curious guy who plays with Seinfeld's Kramer, is a psychotic majorder who appears and disappears at the best birthplace. I'm sure John Turturro's "Mr. Deeds" character was inspired by Richards's role.
