If I could not sleep and sleep at 3:30 in the morning, I can sleep when I decided to sleep while I needed to sleep. This movie was on HBO and I saw it. What's wrong! <br /> <br /> Here is the plot (potential spoilers, even if you're in charge): a neurotic man who has a dependency on sweets (Josh Kornbluth) works for some ridiculous companies. Suddenly, it's "unauthorized", that is, it seems to be the favorite phrase for this movie. But when he finds safe work and safe earnings, Josh decides that he does not want any kind of stupid one. He is in dire trouble in a number of small tasks, and I despise his incessant laziness and ambition. Within a certain amount of time, the impossibility of posting several letters to "very important" is ridiculous, but they are just stupid. Josh knows a lawyer and deceives a woman and creates them in bed (of course, Josh's fantasy in real life, such things would never happen). It's a series of other things, but now it's sad and futile now. <br /> <br /> Even though this movie is billed as a comedy, I laughed twice only; The first time it was Josh Kornbluthen's initial film (the initial reaction was horrifying) and the second when he was in bed with an attractive woman (yes, no). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most daunting person I've ever seen in my life. I think that a handsome, weighty and handsome man, who thinks I am a sex, is a beautiful woman to believe. I do not like Joshen's character. He is calm and motivated and I do not miss the attempts of humor. Skip, though it depends on your life.
