I got this as a turkey film and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> In fact, in some other cases, in other films, it is clear that they had to work hard to continue acting so much. Unexpectedly, the playmaking is performed. <br /> <br /> Plot: We could say it is generous that the screenwriter started with a plot, but he made every effort to forget it. The plot was faster when a Chinese attacked a computer <br /> <br /> Scrip - it was now an abomination of nature. It failed without any rhyme or reason. Most of the line of characters were pathetically comfortable. The script has made it hard for a character to not be memorable. I've seen other films interesting and memorable in other films. <br /> <br /> Special effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! Short buses were special <br /> <br /> Management - Copy your favorite director style to your own capabilities, otherwise you will only make mistakes like that. <br /> <br /> It's good that your friends / family has given you 10 stars for this movie
