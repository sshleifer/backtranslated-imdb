Boy oh boy, oh, golly gee, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie was the illusion of using "invisibility" on the mother's screen. They seem to have been filmed in a cheaper video, and it seems totally unreal, and even less, it's so funny, when you love the movie ... <br /> <br /> I do not finish this movie I love it. "Steadicam" attempts were very pathetic. I mean, if they have a small budget movie, it's okay. Still with a low budget you can make a great movie. But, a BAD movie and budget and small effects. This gives a bad combination. In this case, this condemned combination created the filthy movie "Invisible Mom". If you have children, and if your children do not like them, they may be awake.
