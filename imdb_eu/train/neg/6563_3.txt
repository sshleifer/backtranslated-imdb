Bugs Bunny unexpectedly arrives to the South Pole while trying to make Florida during the holidays. Where there is a little penquin that wants to keep a skim. Short essays and penguins are just wonderful, but in the end it's a bit light in the laughter section. Skimae is not really a good Bugs role, and I've seen much better cartoon Bugs Bunny, along with other strange plays. So I can not recommend this awareness. However, it is very nice in unseen form. This drawing is in the "Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1" record number 3 <br /> <br /> My Rating: C
