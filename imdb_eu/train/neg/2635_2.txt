I wanted to prepare lots of spring / summer action fluff movies, but, in general, most of them are fair profits (that is, special and interesting effects, with comic equivalents). Steve Buscemi, etc.). But this movie had no such thing. We got a cheap emotion for a few minutes of the Eva Longoria coffin (Maxim magazine is cheaper than a movie). Land, shame, background story, character development, continuity, etc. There is a shame, I would like to add it to the features, but clearly, I have already forgotten most of the book. <br /> <br /> When I was in the theater, I was crushed by watching it on DVD during the afternoon's 24th season. Save your money for that, people. Do you really really do not like the fragmentation of Eva Longoria really.
