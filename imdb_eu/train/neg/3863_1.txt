Wow I can say at this time. Who writes this? Who creates things? What welcoming actors will you agree on such things? My god I do not know how I made it through this movie, but I think that that day I enjoyed 8 cups of coffee that it was essential when it was awake. Sir! The most exciting and predictable piece of cinema I have ever seen ... and for the record, I never guess "witness" again. <br /> <br /> I first saw it. When I bought the movie DVD (MISTAKE # 1). I mean ... hi, hi! Julia Stiles. I like it. It's green I'll see it as soon as I get home (Error # 2). I tried to look at it every five minutes asking if I was not finishing any endless garbage, I really did. But I was successful. It was one of the worst things I ever saw. I mean ... what would happen to what he would imagine would be what would happen again in real life? That was quite boring when his father was "parents" ten years ago. 'Jokes' - and CREATE me, they ask me a lot to call them - they are stupid, the characters are trivial and have been forgotten, the story is completely foreseeable ... THE NARABILITY OF THE FILM. HISTORY Records! I thought something was wrong when I thought I had not heard the movie. The DVD may be correct. <br /> <br /> For anyone who is watching this, I have a tip. NO! THE LOVE OF GOD ... No! I am ashamed in my DVD collection and I can not take it ... Nobody, and I mean NOBODY wants to buy it for me! And I'm talking about second-hand and third-party thrift shops, they get mud out of your shoes and stick them to the store window. This is how CRAP needs to know.
