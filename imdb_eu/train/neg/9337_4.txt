Until that coffee is unveiled before a movie that raises his name with his greatest wealth of coffee, Coffy affects himself and is never really a vengeance. Indeed, if the movie was a cup of coffee, it would be weak and juicy, mixed with a few discomforts and without a flavourful taste. Sporadically, he goes to his place, but otherwise there will be no hot action drama. <br /> <br /> Plot-wise, Coffy is a nurse who takes the law and takes justice. pushing drugs, madam-pimpin ', mafia-bundle joins her younger sister in a depraved state patient. The socio-political horror of young black people in Latin American cities is evident in Coffy, and Coffy thinks he thinks something of a kind against racist corruption and white establishment. American minorities. Unfortunately, the right messages are the poor quality and the focus of the movie. Coffy's ideas are very important, they are just not just ones. <br /> <br /> One of the great points of Coffy The presence of the Blaxploitation icon is Pam Grier. Grier enjoys herself and performs an attractive heroine action, while handicrafts creep down into action against violence against violence (how do you think of a house full of mushrooms? Push the car to the front door!). It's just pity, sometimes with the story, to maximize sexual exploitation as much time as possible. A small budget can not be helped but Coffy does not have to lock it out. As a result of the quality of their quality, they also suffer from moments of obscurity and fairness due to entertainment and illusion. <br /> <br /> The result is completely worked and wood. We get the hip heroin but it's not a hip movie. Pena da Coffy has her moments and is considered as a fundamental film in Blaxploitation craze; It's just rising over a medium-sized number.
