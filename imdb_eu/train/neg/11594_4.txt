Like Freddy's Revenge, this comedy takes a strange idea and it's not too long to make a story. Basically, in No. 4, Alice is pregnant and her baby is upset by Freddy and gives her an exit from her friends. This has the least deaths of all the series and the wise cracks are quite bad; So fans of horror or comedic enthusiasts are happy. <br /> <br /> I do not say about it. The height is interesting for Alice and Dan to return the characters for four years, but it's not worth seeing a movie. Uninspriring and unenjoy, it is surely the only worst series in the series to save competitors.
