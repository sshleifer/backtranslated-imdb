I watched the first live music for Denver Center For The Performing Arts and it was totally mind-blowing, Stunning and fantastic plot and tracking interviews I really liked most of the music I've ever seen on stage. It's interesting that you never saw Zachen's face. He was always in darkness, but his presence was strong and he led the whole production direction. When I heard that movie was going on, I was breathing in wait, but I felt that I deceived the feeling I felt so bad when I saw it in the movie version. The movie is missing a fascinating mood that is set in live production and never comes close to each character. Personally, I would like to see the live version again and if it was revived, I would recommend it without seeing it. It will be one of the most memorable experiences.
