God, I feel so badly "Cartoons" from America. <br /> <br /> Since animation has become popular, US animators produce a 5-year draw. drawing style (Kappa Mikey) or some Japanese animation corruption. (Usually mixing classic characters) It's not surprising that anime is playing American cartoons! <br /> <br /> They do not try anymore! <br /> <br /> Oh, last night I heard what I heard; I live in the UK and when I first came to the show in 2005, well, I never knew that it was about the current UK shows.
