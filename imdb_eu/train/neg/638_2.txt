Good Earth is perhaps the most boring movie I've ever seen in my life. The plot is slow and missing. The operation is a comic frontier. While I love Paul Muni, I can now say that I have seen a movie that makes no real difference to justice. The only grace I have found together with this film is the production value. Using hundreds of extracts in the entire film generates a very compelling and interesting environment. In addition, the beautiful effects of thousands of lawns are easily sold and at that time revolutionary. In addition to the value of production, I can say a bit about other things that are good or entertaining about this movie.
