I can not help but start describing this film as poorer. Do not be bad, I did not expect much at the beginning. Please, a PG-13 slasher movie is pre-designed ummm ... it's missing slashing, so no one should be surprised by gore. But I really went where I was going but the incapacity and topic that appears in all the other aspects of this film. <br /> <br /> It's just a protagonist, it's totally useless, because you're a bad guy. And here's a refund for books ... IT'S NECESSARY - that's the basic rule-breaking basic rule - the development of the characters. At the end of this movie, you think the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally think about her butt. <br /> <br /> On top of that, we will never give them a never-ending killer (and definitely so scary). I do not know what Dora Explorer is saying, I'm saying that I am more evil than this Doraemon <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < ), what could be left to 2 hour screen time? <br /> <br /> The cabinets, that's it. <br /> <br /> Many wardrobes: large wardrobes, small wardrobes, mirror cabinets, cabinets in Narniara, so many cabinets do not want to wear for another year. In fact, the movie should only be called "CLOSET", and it was a great horror coater of the DVD case. In the back, the audience could have photos taken and Roger and Ebert made a quote - what is fps @! What did we ask to see our time! "
