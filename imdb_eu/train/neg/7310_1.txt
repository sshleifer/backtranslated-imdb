** SPOILERS at the bottom! ** <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever is the biggest International Year of the Year. I saw that. This movie is CLEAN! Not so bad with the movie, you can not help it, but really be amazed. This movie had so much power, but eventually he did nothing. The characters were as good as mute ones; You ask yourself the whole movie: "why should you do that?" or "what do you do that?" ... they are logical and foolish. We do not make a budget, so you really do not give a rat ...% about its rhythm ... you can only laugh at stupidity. <br /> <br /> - For example, "Brown" (slut) ... did he need to stay with Paulekin (Rider Strong)? There was no point ... it was nearly like almost all of the filmmakers needing an excuse for viruses! UGH. <br /> <br /> - Does anyone really come into the woods and drink water in a cabin without first looking? <br /> <br /> - Why did not Bert launch ill illness from the beginning? The movie was like that ... but they were killed. <br /> <br /> - Why did they need so much time to decide to leave the cabin, even if they needed to walk? "No, I should wait to get caught in two infected people (one gesture of a death) to finally end up walking. <br /> <br /> - What exactly Paul tried to do to fish is the reason the body of the chasm falls into the contaminated reservoir and infected with the virus ? Pure STUPIDITY! <br /> <br /> It was not sensible a friend, much less with these idiots. I do not think the end of a movie will be worse. At first, kids asked the gun about what the gun meant and he replied " it's for black. "At the end of the movie, three young black boys (dressed in clothes bags, one of them in a minimal horn) enter the store ... to find out about how to use the baskets to make hunting, then give them pounds and hands-on powers and joke around them as if it were their home. <br /> <br /> Okay, WHAT IS HELL HORIA?!?!?! How can the taste be, what were the filmmakers in the THINKING movie? I was black. i was offered as a result of the initial 'Nigger' comment. He was unconcerned and meaningless. My question to the filmmakers: what was it that ended with Black Children? What would you have forgotten about the previous first comment of racism? Blackening things with the audience, making a joke? Well, mostly, I have not found a funny pathetic attempt at humor. The whole movie was a joke ... PATHETIC attempt did not have to be given at the time of day. Did Peter Jackson really think that this movie was good? Which film looked HE? <br /> <br /> ZERO * **** out of stars ... If I have a lower score I would give it. Please, look at the IMDb's friends, do not waste your life 1/2 hour watching this abomination of a "movie". I watched the worst film.
