I am here again at your local commercial establishment (of course, because the high school children hang up there !!!!!) to show how horrible it is "BENDY POO: PROM COURIER" !!!!! To prove that this is a bad joke of a DCOM ... <br /> <br /> ... we will take these four sumo fighters and we will enter this photo booth. How ... comfortable !!!!! <br /> <br /> Hai! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh !!!!! <br /> <br /> It's horrible ????? It's so bad, Disney Channel keeps the money away again, with 10 second exciting and exciting second-hand promotions, asking the audience: "HOW IT'S HOW IT'S HOW IT IS?" And then, suddenly, when that happens, as usual, this is not a higher level of television than usual, but it's only once seen !!!!! Oh no !!!!! All the time !!!!! Also, this movie is about secondary education and things, and believe me, I will NOT do what else there is ... <br /> <br /> Say it ... smile !!!! ! (SNAP!) <br /> <br /> Avoid this with all costs. 0/10
