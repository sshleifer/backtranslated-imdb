This movement is slow, bad, cold, dark and without plot or hope. The same European formula that they want to contribute to subsidize, we have never seen before, but the critics believe that it is an "important point". <br /> <br /> The big difference in thinking between the US and Europe is more than just showing anything more than anything else about employment. In this movie, a few years ago, men are still wounded and believe that the government is working. In the United States, we know someone needs to go and someone creates value. <br /> <br /> Spain never looked back!
