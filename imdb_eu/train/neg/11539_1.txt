This is the biggest charge I've seen for a long time. I hated a movie for the last time "28 days later" and "Magnolia". There is no doubt about this movie, unless Gillian Anderson turns off the roadside to the side of the sex / rape scene, and every phrase in the conversation should be used at least twice a day. It's a very cheap performance and a small budget. My friend and I spent half an hour shutting the movie off. We tried to give it a chance, but nothing could be saved. DO NOT USE IT !!!
