What did the producer / director Stanley Kramer see, Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's strangest script? Did they specify some pieces? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in a troubled story? <br /> <br /> And why did Candice Bergen give him incredible performance, he admitted that he was grateful? <br /> <br /> It was the same as the Domino principle, which was similar to The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate, and the drawing fails with a very wide margin. Incorrect mistakes by Stanley Kramer.
