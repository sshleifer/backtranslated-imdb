The biggest pile of steam that I have seen in truly successful children's programming is the most ugly and general of this show. While Johnny's main character imagines a common child, he is not liked or even more sustainable. The jokes are lame, excessive (ie, "Whoa! It is not coming see" gag. Let's go, this was not fun for the first time. It's not nice) and it does not have the original type of inspiration or type. And finally, it's just a mere look. Children do not feel very critical to artistic talent, but they still prefer eye candy. I can not see the show, in any way, the style of art ... it's gross. It's true. Just simple crummy. <br /> <br /> I just can not swear so much time. I think that nostalgia may be a bit irrational and I will not wait for my expectations again ... I've really lost the old cartoon. Give him a Dexter lab, Powerpuff Girls ... just this crap. I think that it is mere thought. <br /> <br /> Simply tell, this time you do not ask for this show. I think real cartoons can also be enjoyed by older children. And that is not cut.
