This movie was different, because I did not see typical gay stereotypes that I did not see. However, this does not change a storyline. I am sure that there are many gay men depicted on the screen, because black gay characters are rarely seen and characters are not fully developed. But how hard it would be for a writer to write a story, beginning, middle and ending. Or how was a story. There seems to be no point in that movie, and although there is a low budget movie, there is no excuse for story or plot yet.
