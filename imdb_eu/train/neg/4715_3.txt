I recently saw an attempt to find humorous Johnny Test. I failed, terribly. Cartoon Network often has the tendency to showcase audiences, but Johnny Test's "entertainment" is the smallest form. Writing is very predictable, and run-gag is not much of a gag. Children will love it, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> Now, this is not saying it's all bad. The original initial theme was really attractive, but for some reason it took its skeleton and, figuratively, it broke with an aluminum bat bat. It's a pity, it really was one of the best things. <br /> <br /> Some people can be very interesting in theory. With a little work, the characters work well together, but they are very dimensional. So again, that is, it's easy for kids to follow. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is also fast. The episodes are very busy, with little time left for quick typing. It's a real shame because the show has a lot of interesting concepts. Conversely, however, the fast pace prevents kids from losing their interest, and that is precisely what all recipients are. <br /> <br /> In general, the show looks good on paper, but it's not just fun or interesting. I like the show, but I'm not capable. There is not so much potential to do. Children will enjoy it, but that's why.
