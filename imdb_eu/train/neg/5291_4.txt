STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal past, has had problems with alcohol and now he is creating a drug habit, that is, paranoid and domestic violence, trying to keep his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke) home from her family and trying to get out of the way. Meanwhile, his mother Janet (Laila Morse) son of Ray, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles), and aware of his escalating drug habit that sends off rails. While the film makes a different life, it brings together desperate characters. <br /> <br /> Britons seem to like to be unhappy and watch movies that make them entertain. Nil by Mouth has highlighted that. It's a story of a broken family that has destroyed crime, poverty, salmon and medication, Jeremy Kyle's three-course meal. Basically, it is a story of a male self-destructive, who, in addition to the three generations, copy one another, though they are trying to keep a family away and keep women together, even though they are strong enough. If you get something on the off-set, you'll see at first glamorous look that is not promising and it definitely does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> It's true that people talk about performances, and the main stars of Winstone and Burke play a great role. We see that Winstone loses his wife, after losing more paranoia than the cushion, talking to him while talking on the phone and releasing a typical arsenal that was not allowed to watch his word. Also, at a private moment, we see Burke lose his skills in a stair, after entering the night's full effect. <br /> <br /> This is not a plot yet. That is why the real life of these vain lives that go forward from one day to the next. It has been a lot acclaimed (including Baftas!), But it was very sad to me and for me. I do not want to criticize that, that's why I met off-set, but unfortunately I found this. **
