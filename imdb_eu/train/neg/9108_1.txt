Prequel is called a replay of the best versions of Dangerous Liasons. Plots are the same as most of the script. I loved the book, I love the first movie, but I will not even bite the movie 3. The whole fanciful suggestion between the two previous main characters in the previous one was completely predictable and original, and ... I could not stress that the movie was a bad thing. If you do not want to take my word, you just see what you mean and what you mean. If you read the review, 'If you liked the first one, you would like the second one', that is, YOUR OWN CINEMA! Plots are not good though. The first movie took so many lines, it's hard to tell what movie you're watching.
