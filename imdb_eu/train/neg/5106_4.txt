ALIEN LOVE is a very strange movie. I do not mean that Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman is a movie of esoteric style. This means that sworn, sex, true T & A, a bad script and a very retro feeling. It's just ten years before you could imagine someone like John Hughes, though, of course, it would cut off T & A <br /> <br /> Rethinking the bad script, if one of the problems has a few characters. Any type of motivation, especially Amanda. Why get Connie at the bar? To know a stranger? Do you see what I mean by the retro? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and many other films from the mid-80s defined similar plots and were more conventional than those of the present ones. The story continues with poorly defined, non-annoying and non-logical paths <br /> <br /> That said, I was not visible to the ALIEN DIMENSION and not just the visible T & A. Science-fiction sex comedy is much better than FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY.
