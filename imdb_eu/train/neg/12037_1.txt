This series is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. Awesome influence, awful effects, awful writing, you're scared. Stories Robin Hood's story is very far away. Robin Hood seems to be using the name to attract the audience. Also, it might be called Mr Bland Acting's New Adventures. <br /> <br /> If someone had commented to me if they were in front of the imagination, you would like this show. It's a massive approach to the TV series. A visual support like this should turn your imagination on, so you do not need to force your imagination. That would be the case in the Simpsons section when they try to clear Homer's religious propaganda film and start talking about someone or somebody. "If the movie is boring, I will complete my story." <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, absolute human waste.
