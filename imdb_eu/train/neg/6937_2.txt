The last issue of adman-turnieman's theme for the debut (ad) venture is a topic of debate about the very old topic of almost any cultural standard. However, Desi Auds's exploration (and exploitation) is very short for the "pepper, spice and sugar" b / g scores, conversations, dances, plays, etc., the usual mix of masala. not much inside. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 8 and 9 times. The movie is repeated again (after the chef). But there are bugs, not a story! Hah, it's not surprising. Someone has forgotten a script. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Cheeni Jyada (more) puts an excessive performance. Will it really stop sometime? How old are you for 60 years, if it's a bit disheveled? A timeless intelligence, but surely what is not so little body? And the only one? Sorry, soul ?! Good-by-side with Paresh Rawal, who plays a sensible role in the film.
