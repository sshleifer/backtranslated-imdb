I love the frequently-called "Masters of Horror" series frequently. Horror fans are constantly fed up. Projects like this (and a similar "Greenlight Project" that gave us "Festivals" - like it or in a balanced way) are wonderful bubbles of thought, like the minds of the managers, who like to be afraid of developing horror and developing maturation foods. <br /> <br /> He really started with a kool idea and "... where I will go with the world !!!!". <br /> <br /> I do not know how to ruin the damaged ones, but "SPOILER AHEAD" Suddenly ... no, this light that crossed the night sky ... we have a long time. Foreign foreigners (is it ... HUH?) brain drilling for men and ... well, but I know ... well ... the worst curse of the storybook - if it's not prosperous and promising. <br /> Storytelling's mention ... Your building needs to overcome profits. Not vice versa. Storytelling 101. <br /> <br /> Spoiler End - Large Oops!
