The first film by Howling II (1985) was 180. The first film was foreign and awful. The latter were sharp and cursive. The production value of these is quite bad and theatrical vision is obvious. In the first part, the old man wants to know what happened to his brother's brother. The first movie "scene" was badly re-created. A serious and plain eye, helping his elder wife (Romania) brother (Reb Brown) help raise awareness of the murder / transformation / death of his sister. Christopher Lee appears and disappears now and then as two scholars. Sybil Danning and its two main assets are Stirba, the Romanian headmaster of Romania. He also suffers from bad morning faces, ewww! <br /> <br /> Bad movie. There's nothing good about this Stinker. In my opinion, Philippe Mora directs this photo because it is a good movie. The film is so dark that you need to see a flashlight (not the content, but the movie itself). To round the movie, you'll get a bad "punk" performance of a damn "Babel". Perhaps, if they save extra money, instead of imitation, they can get real sales to change the channel.
