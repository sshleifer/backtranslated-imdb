Now I have to admit that I was never a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. In my opinion, "it does not respect". I saw this only because I wanted to see her, and I expected something I expected: stupid stories, without humor. A ridiculous land ravaged by rough worms, rough jokes, and a developer (Dangerfield), I just caught my attention to the construction of a Utah ski resort. <br /> <br /> Dangerfield was the star of a movie devotion, including Andrew Dice Clay and John Byner (although I do not know how much his name was still around). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> 2/10
