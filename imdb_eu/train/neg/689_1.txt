What is this? Without a doubt, this is the biggest waste of film, settings and camera ever. I know you can not set your expectations in the 80s, but this is too stupid to be true. I had a $ 0.89 movie and I still want to get money back. Do you guys remember who I remember? <br /> <br /> Who is the violent murderer in this movie and what are his motivations ??? Well, really, you can not take care of it any less. And why should you do it? The landlords did not care. They did not try to create a little tension. The director (Stephen Carpenter, much easier than finding a money with such a name), Kindred (1986) also made it very enjoyable and, lately, he made Soul Survivors. It was also a lawn, but at least it was Eliza Dushku. This garbage has the premiere of Daphne Zuniga !!! (Who?) Yes, that's it, Melrose Place Chick. His memorable person has died for about 15 minutes. after initial credits He is the second person who dies. The first victims die directly in the first minute, but it seems that nobody mentions or loses, then who cares? The rest of the actors ... are not worth the actors, they are very uninteresting. You are expecting to die fast and painful death ... and not just their characters <br /> <br /> My modest opinion = 0/10
