As a lesbian, I am always looking for gay and lesbian movies. However, with this type of criminals - it would be enough to see any public. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something to happen - anything! - a story to be developed or just to make a sense of this. It never happened. They were nothing but absurd scenes, they had nothing to do with anything. The movie failed to give the person a story or depth. <br /> <br /> After hours and more of this nonsense, I've turned it off. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it. your time about that nonsense. <br /> <br /> 1 star - and it's not worth it as well.
