Vampires Vs. Zombies were not the original title. Really ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lesbian semi-evil vampires and two cars hit: Bob the Lesbian Gypsie-Witch and her dog, randomly the woman with special powers and the Catholic School, special appearances. Girl Short Skirt Zombie Choir. <br /> <br /> In addition, box: Be careful: it will only end, writers and directors will only endorse or anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Really, I love bad movies. . I love vampires. I love zombies. Hell, I enjoy lesbians too. This movie combines all three with a vague and confusing plot (or not), a terrifying conversation (I mean, BAD BAD), and anything that has nothing to do with random STUFF and PEOPLE (or I do not ... know what's going on in the world. Oh, and I can not forget the 'Zombies' greenheads in latex gloves (yes, the filmmakers were so cheap, but they could not cover the hands of their Zombies with oatmeal and paint.) In any case, the result was a very bad movie If they were called, too. <br /> <br /> Was not it supposed to end? Vampire was really a nurse and the other girl really was a sick person? Where were Vampires Vs. Zombies? Hell, where were all vampires ... really You can not call girl vampires. Whatever. <br /> <br /> Never rent or buy this movie. If you're really curious ... well, I understand. Seriously, as well as fans of BAD movies they can not defend this one. It must be in the lower part.
