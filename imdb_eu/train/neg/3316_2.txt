The first Ewan McGregor I saw outside of Star Wars was the movie. Ever since then, Ewan McGregor has been a great fan, but I can not still forgive the existence of the film. <br /> <br /> My sister Jane Austen was a great fan and that's why I have it. They had different classics and Emma was one of them. I always thought the radio, stupid and boring. However, after seeing this great interpretation, I had to say that Emma was the most elegant and charming original. Ewan McGregor hardly finds a goal in this movie after cutting and cutting Frank Churchill's part. Gweneth Paltrow is already ridiculous with the hilarious character and the rest of the movie is not stunning and stupid. <br /> <br /> My recommendation for anyone interested in the theater in my period ... see the originals. If you're a fan of Ewan McGregor ... believe me, if you jump on this movie, you do not need five minutes of collective lack of bad hat and bad hair.
