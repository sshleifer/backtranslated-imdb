Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a serious detective problem. The murderer of the series, Patrick Channing, (Jeff Kober), who has captured psychic personality by Tess (Tracy Griffith), has resurrected with The First Power (Satan has given it to the petrol station after). weak bodies In some ways, someone who connects ties with Tesser (... who understands one's self), leaves Channing or many women will die their bloody hands. Margarita (Arlen Elizabeth) will ask for help at the Catholic Church of the First Potential to try to tell their elders, but Channing has denied access to a weapon that stops. Channing's heart releasing her evil world. He will, however, take on and help Russell, because Channing needs all the help he has kidnapped by Tess, preparing for a ritual / ceremony for Satan. <br /> <br /> In the film, Mykelti Williamson, as an assistant actress, is always a member of the role of Russell ... you know what will happen to her. As in the movies of this type, all of Russell's dying are being killed, but Channing's death is only one killer killed by a dessert other than a dessert. <br /> <br /> Pure hidden secret ... door to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith try to give it to me, but in such films they do not have a chance. The coffees, often very heavy, are usually always effective, really deliver, and give only a bad goofy that throws in the air a rotten joke.
