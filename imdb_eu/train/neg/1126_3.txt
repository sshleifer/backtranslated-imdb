I thought that this thought could be of interest, and it might have been an interesting story, because it was not as interesting as it was. It's hard to follow, weird editing, untranslated stories, cheer up the characters, all of them a dreadful waste of time. I just did not enter and I did not like the characters that happened to them - Ian Holm did not even save this movie. If you do not need insomnia to heal, I would skip. 3/10, which is generous.
