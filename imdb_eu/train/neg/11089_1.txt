The movie is pretty good, but it's not a real story. <br /> <br /> Rubin "Hurray" Carter was a liar, a murder and never was found. The State of New Jersey did not go for a third time for 20 years. Carter gave an offer in 1976: "Let's make a lie test and let it go." He did not take it. This movie should never be done, but it speaks money. Many people spend their lives in jail unjustly and blacker than white ones. Why choose a fake story? <br /> <br /> Jens
