In the plot of descent, if it is actually called a plot, there are two notable events. An initial at the end. Together these events are totally 5% of the film. All (and I mean all) of everything is, above all, the unwanted effort to complete the minutes of the director. I like worrying film, I like dark movies and I do not cause sour scenery - but if I say 60-year-old scenes are fierce / dark (literally), there is no other thing to do with the story. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actors here is totally lost. No, it's not naked, even though I saw it in version NC-17. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the "Descent" for two hours and then take it again, you probably have some interesting dreams.
