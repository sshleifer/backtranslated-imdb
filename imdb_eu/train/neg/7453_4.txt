Wonderful actors <br /> <br /> Incorrect writing and direction is not very good. My main problem was not to take care of those people. Do not kill the victims. Settings were pretty bad. The character of Dennis Quaid was so badly written that I did not care when the end came. He returned to his baby. Great! I wanted to get my money back.
