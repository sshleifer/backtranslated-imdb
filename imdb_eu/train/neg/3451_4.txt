Frank Sinatra was the perfect western actor. He was a great actor, from Here to Eternity and The Man with The Golden arm, but he has not been a physicist of a western hero, you have been identified as a city man. The work of Johnny Concho was a great deal of effort, but the movie was not in the box office, but it was not his fault. The two factors blame me: a) The story was very unusual, especially as the heroine of the movie Sinatra plays. People expected a certain pattern in a similar genre, moving away from the movie should be very good. b) the story is not convinced, it is hard to believe that a whole town wants to do what Sinatra wants to do because he is afraid of his brother. Also, when a man shows a special wallet that will open at the same time when he does not need to draw a gun, it is surprising that if he does not get it, why did not they take all the guns? I think that this movie has not been withdrawn, because it deserves to see any movie made with Sinatra, and still there are still shortcomings.
