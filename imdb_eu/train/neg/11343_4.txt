Viewed from 1/2/2003 - 10-4 (Dir-Jim Kammerud and Brian Smith): Drab and unexpected, sensational tracking, not surprising, the 101-animated "Dalmatians" of the original classic. Yes, the movie was finished on the first, but the problem is similar to the original. One of the great things about origin was the stimulation of the story, that is, it does not. Animation is incredibly impressive for Disney and everything we've got is the same story again. When Disney let us get bored with monitoring and rewriting, etc. Etc. Certainly, when you buy a rental rate that we are not surely rented or purchased.
