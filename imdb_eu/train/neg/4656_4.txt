A remarkable and irreparable remake of a famous old English filmmaker. Although he is very damaged, it can be a total disaster (that is to say, it is not), it never raises any tension and claims its origin from television. Richard Burton walks asleep with his role, and the appearance of Sophia Loren (in this film) shows no great passion. (**)
