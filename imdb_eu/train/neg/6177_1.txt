This is a real irony: Joe Besser was a comedian of encounters, far away from Stooges in other situations. He had a specific record very funny and fast. Moe and Larry and Shemp, who had known for many years, or at least liked their work. So what happened when the troops entered Earth as "a third road?" Of course, nothing. In these short films of "Stooge tard", most of them fight against each other or Joe against two others, and this is not the exact Stooge protocol. "One for everyone, for everyone, for him all", to refer to Curly from "Unstoppable Knights". Laurel & Hardy, Abbott and Costello, the band Marx Brothers, about the comic band, try to take advantage of or take part in each other, when chips go down, they stick together and help each other. Especially this does not happen. It's almost like seeing a dog, someone who tries to break it, or is evil and evil, and not for comic effects. One might think that the scene that goes on here is something that imitates the life of art. Perhaps, therefore, Besser did not have long been with Moe and Larry. Check out the history of other teams and I'm told I'm wrong.
