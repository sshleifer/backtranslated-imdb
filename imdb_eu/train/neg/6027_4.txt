I grew up in a Baptist and I know the story that is trying to tell this movie, although I do not believe in the story. I'll give films as good as the average week-long movie. Slowly interesting, medium acting, a bit slow, a script is predictable, music is sappy and a bit melodramatic. And all who remain behind must be the cleanest of Christ, ever. It is not the only word of any curse. But I laughed aloud when the actor, who plays the director of the United States, said "nuclear" as "nu-cu-ler," like Bush. Is there a customary Christian code of honor that Bush asks God to call, that all Christians should cover their ignorance when writing this word in the wrong way, as it does? LOL! I had a difficult time after a very difficult time. After the "Nu-cu-ler" event, the movie began to feel like a propaganda and packaging manipulation. I was looking for something brave. Actually, I was looking for something I thought, but I did not find it here. If you are looking for strange entertainment, stop here: it's good to kill a rain afternoon. If you are looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
