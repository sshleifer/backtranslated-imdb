After reading another review, I thought the movie would be really good. I enjoy movies "B", but this can not be the case. The photography, surely, is a decent part of the movie. The editing he wanted much left. He was very rough and nasty. The one who chose music and sound did a great job. The music was horrible, especially when setting the atmosphere or scene. If the performance was better, he could shoot the movie. Unfortunately, I've seen better porn movies. To see the movie "B" vampire, check out 'Blood Ties'. You will be much more entertained.
