I was lying on bed, cold, flu or whatever. I think it might take some time for me to watch some horror movies that my mother bought. I have never received this film! When I saw it, I wanted to feel sick and even get rid of it. Afterwords (of course, when I improved), I made a study of Dennis L.Rader and found out that it was like a true Dennis movie. I hope no one ever watches the movie, but you will feel like I never feel like eating or feeling before. I think it would be a better time to watch Santa Claus 3. At least, we've had better reviews about that movie.
