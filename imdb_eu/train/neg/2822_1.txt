This OMG is one of the worst movie ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies as a film student. I do not know why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Did he need money? I loved AJ and when I saw everything I saw, I saw another. SOO was wrong! not bad, bad. It had a small one or two moments, but it was quite bad to lose 101 minutes. I can not say that AJ looks good and it did not work well. Earth is predictable if you do not expect to tell Romeo and Juliet again, then it's not. Very depressing Maybe this could be your movie, otherwise I do not recommend it.
