I keep this short as a movie, it does not deserve a full review. <br /> <br /> Setting it up can make the movie really unique. Another "28 days later" or "Blair Witch Project" could have been another. <br /> <br /> I was really excited about the first 20 minutes of the movie or a really good directer with cinematography and suspense. although I do not think he wanted to regain the authenticity of an underground London vacuum. <br /> <br /> The characters were left. In this movie, our "heroin" is a mere gap and it does not matter if you die. As many people said, I was encouraged by homeless people and black men, they gave me a sad and (intention of writers), for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < , but when it was revealed I was very disappointed. I do not harm, but I can say that my 10-year-old sister would surely fight a fight match. <br /> <br /> All this is just a minimal horror movie. Hollywood's simple formula. This movie had a great potential but did not succeed. <br /> <br /> Simply the movie was to emphasize this fall, the characters in this movie had at least five times finished and killed the main villain. .
