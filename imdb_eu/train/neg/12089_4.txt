I rented the rental of "The Piano Teacher" video without knowing anything other than that written in the video box. I definitely did it because the films that make up the Cannes prizes tend to be very good or bad. Unfortunately, this is in the last category. I said the road was about a quarter, loudly saying: "This movie is boring." I said to the middle of the roads: "Where did I see it before?" I was in three quarters of marks. <br /> <br /> Despite his literary origins, this film is a newer version of Robert Altman (1969) and better "This cold day. Park." Although the details were clearly different, the works of Altman were graphically targeted and although there were fewer character research, both films are the same ones. In this production there is nothing "new". All of these aspects have been done before: a character is under control, with increasingly self-disciplines (Abel Ferraria in 1992, "Bad Lieuten"); "evil" and condemned "love" in the scene of death (David Cronenbergen "M. Butterfly" 1993); Rare strange sex scene (David Lynchen "Blue Velvet" 1986); and so on. That's why I'm so confused about why movies are so "shocking," "they're sloppy", etc. This very derivative film seems to have made the sole purpose of feeling uncomfortable to the audience, and some have made it clear. . However, I have given this reaction largely without seeing the movie inexperienced. You see enough movies and you've seen everything in the end. And although I have seen expurgated versions of "R-rated", the additional scenes would definitely change the overall opinion of "The Piano Teacher". merit The camera is very good and the lighting is excellent. Isabelle Huppert's good performance also helps to save time. This is what Hanek's first films have seen, and I would like to see more, I think I would have the same opinion about Ferrara: an interesting director, but hardly any other genius. Rating: 4/10.
