This movie has just been visited by our Russian television channel. Well ... The percentage of Russian public assets is disappointed. We wanted to see the true achievements of the achievements in this film. But the authors came up with something else ... :( Smart and beautiful countries are the smart people we live in. We are proud of all our dreams of space, real achievements in this field and in science. So, I would like to ask authors: Where is our LUNOHOD? And where, hell, our MIR station? Oh? I am sure that LUNOHOD events had happened much earlier in Armstrong's "Wandering on the Moon." And the science flaws - I do not have enough time and space here!
