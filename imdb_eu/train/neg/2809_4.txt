When I look back at Ohio University in my college days, I will always remember some events, with good memories. The channel 23 is a channel of OU local access and something much more in the last years. This led to some rumors about DIY movies and then scanned them directly, in a version of Macbeth, they apparently learned the eighth. <br /> <br /> However, the king was, in my opinion, the Midnight Skater in 23 ways. The first time I saw it before 2:00 a.m. I should learn. Or sleep. Or watch regular TV. But no, pussies is all that. We saw my roommate and Midnight Skater, and when it was over, I did not think any of them thought that the movie had happened. But surely, a few nights later, and this movie, in fact, was that we had to think that it existed. <br /> <br /> I went ahead and I could not see what it was terrifying, but what kind of life it is worth doing. Land has no connection, a horrible performance, what is the soul, but when it comes to gods, with others, it is impossible to have fun. Chuck Pahalniuk is like the first time you hear "Guts". You hear, you get bored and shook, but five minutes later, everything you want and want is to encourage someone else to experience a horror experiment. <br /> <br /> A long story, Midnight Skater, for all its epic mistakes, makes it a very enjoyable night. Also, I'm desperately in topic for the Midnight Skater. Kudos writes and sings. Sweet God I love that song.
