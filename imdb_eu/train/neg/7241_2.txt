... You can not exactly throw it out because it's old; And if you had charity, the great disorder that one might say would not blame her. However, in these situations it is difficult to get angry at dragging at the same time. So, it's called "The Pallbearer", an attempt to do something "different" with a romantic comedy, because it is primarily hamstrung because the place is wrong; In other words, show your grandparents' funeral skills to "breakdancing" skills. <br /> <br /> To expand the metaphor (perhaps lie!); Like old lady, it starts to feel like a movie set up, that's not far away. Surely, this specific "death" is long, and we will gradually reduce our empathy reservations, but we realize that the procedures come within a single direction: downhill. The long attempts to make his "humor" can be seen by far, far more serious than death's imperative! <br /> <br /> Once again, the image of 'drag heels' is back, the main character, this action of Tom is repeated over the course of his life. In fact, if they are "pathetic" levels, then sweating will be good before another famous role in Schwimmer. If there is any doubt, more than one character in Ross needs to align the sympathy of audiences, it is undoubtedly hard to ask, as well as Schwimmer's comic interpreter, but it can be a fault with him as he has become "echoing" in his initial situations. <br /> <br /> How can ever his most famous portrait escape if the character chooses scripts that are almost "interchangeable", even if these situations are not? A man with a high school high is oppressed by someone who has not seen it in years. Sound familiar ...? Paltrow is not clear if the role of "Rachel" is clear, but if all this goes beyond the old land, it would be a pity if today's significant DIFFERENCES were so unheard of. Unfortunately, the romantic element is so worn and the "back" is so inadequate as it seems to be the best way to describe the best film ...! 2/10.
