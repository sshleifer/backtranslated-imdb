Except for the sound, there are no budget quotes from the previous ones, an independent horror movie (really). Makeup effects and gore are very good and the main actor has been effective, even though the main actor needs some workouts that should be attractive. <br /> <br /> The main problem with Frightworld is the length of about 108 minutes. Slasher is a half-long mid-hour performance, about ten minutes away from the first fifty minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of visual vision and excitement in some places. favor However, if they are compared to poor sound, the movie is hard to see. <br /> <br /> This could be definitely entertaining if the movie "serial killer dead dead from the dead" is not even a sharp editing editor, it acts as a dirt-free dye in today's form.
