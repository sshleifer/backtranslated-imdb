I recently watched this movie on a DVD, and I said I was not surprised. I know it's a taboo for independent films, but this one feels a bit of entertainment. <br /> <br /> The premise was interesting, but its execution was short. I thought "well, they just came in, the story will soon come together". Before I know it, the movie was over and the story was never received. I can not say the plays are very impressive. It was very bad. The Star Wars preview is not a bad trilogy, but bad, though. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the duration is, I assume two hours (because it is a safe estimate). In any case, at the end of the movie, I deserved the will of the will I did not stop feeling the feeling, and I was not halfway. <br /> <br /> Again I was not impressed. and eventually I was bored of my head. I'm not one of the boys who require fast action and explosion in a short film, so do not start with me, because it's a reason to not like it.
