Penn takes time to develop their characters, and we care about these. However, there are some real problems that arise in this story, the behavior of the evil brother is not seen by real motivation, and the time line gets worse. It is believed that, created in 1963, music is at the end of the 60s / early 70s. References and interviews are from the 70s to 80s. The potential of a powerful Klimax is presented and Penn allows it to exit. But with all the difficulties it is worth the clock, but it's not great.
