Fully stupid, an unwarranted "warlike image", especially to showcase the spectacular Eve Meyer. It's not the bad idea, but the embarrassment of everyone. Hard "script", an elementary school dance parade that was not an inept "action" scene, with Louis Clyde Stoumen, usually a director of the documentary director. It seems he does not know whether he is comedied or not. In the war or, at the beginning of the 1960s, however, the travel guide of Eve Meye's great body and, in general, the harmful air and disability, a philosophical treatise. Eve Meyer deserves to see her stuff, but that's enough.
