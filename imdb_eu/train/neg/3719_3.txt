Imagine getting back to the deadly killer mask and finding Barbara Cartland there ... that's what happens with this movie. <br /> <br /> An open-up appeared, but soon it's a thriller (or even less). an imaginary love story), and the only reason for this story is clear: to fill a gap in the feminine market by creating a new "bad-understood, bad" (Andrei) recipe. beauty whimsy '(Paula). <br /> <br /> Instead of losing some time to create an original premise, the filmmakers earned money directly: this is a bad young man, for example, that is a curious beauty. He follows a chain of unbelievable love and unspoken love and philosophical / poetic beliefs from then on. The "poet" of Andrei ("the same name") admits to the perception of the characteristics of a Byronic hero, but also what is written, who is and who and what is, is still difficult to believe. - or take care of it. <br /> <br /> To work a Byronic hero / antihero, the story requires subtlety, style and innovation - they are completely absent here. This is not the current Phantom of modern Opera, what happens when a weak and rather stupid woman (with loose jersey) a bad man, after a few days, seems to be as dangerous as the Bunny sneakers. <br /> The movies could be saved, if they were good: the female director is worried about looking at sexy and 'other worlds'; and bad Dougray Scott seems to have become a drug addict. This is not his best job. JÃ¼rgen Prochnow was interested in 'Vashon' and Andrew Lee Potts as a young photographer / boy. The best movie was given to her sister and kept her brother.
