I remember for the first time I saw this movie when I was at the sixth level. Before I saw this, I heard Broadway's original recording, and I really loved it! But when I saw this, it seemed to me, what the hell ?! This movie is missing a lot of music songs! Who decided all this! <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of Gene Kelly, but it's probably the worst music ever made! The film was like a group of Hollywood than the Scottish Highlands. And who has decided to cut all the songs of Meg? <br /> <br /> When they saw this movie, Lerner and Lowe are sure to ask: "Who has decided to make our masterpiece in the world?" Well, they were right to say that they were right, madmen, that Hollywood had said great music in this real movie. <br /> <br /> Kelly singing and performing carefully, you have overcome it with flying colors, but you are in a movie that lacks many texts. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, if you want a good movie based on Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this is not! <br /> <br /> 3/10
