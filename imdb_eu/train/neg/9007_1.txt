This movie is a wonderful part of what I've ever seen. I literally got a sharp pain in my head literally. CGI was terrifying and the story was in vain. Dean Cain's character, Mr-Super-Intuitive-I-can-figure-out, does not seem to work well on his helicopter. The main problem was a partial screen with camera work. I felt Brady Bunch or something I saw, he was not alone in different people in boxes, close and in different views of the same thing. I can not imagine that the actors really needed money when they were shooting this movie was not worth it.
