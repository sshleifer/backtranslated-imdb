We saw the movie team with us really upset. Our favorite character We wanted to forget that it was not (not writers or producers can do something like that). Writing was inadequate, the script was similar. We're really angry: 1. When both boys realized Natalie's account, they did not just let this stupid competition (and eventually a degrading one), but they were just magical competitors, they were not really. she wanted Natalia 2. Although it is not possible to choose between two men before the meeting, Natalie decides that suddenly one of the boys really loves and now she is willing to marry her? (And there was no better prediction, it was a guy, as the writers had just flung a hitch, and just had to take it to the correct point in the film). 3. Blair speaks about ways he does not want children, and suddenly means that his husband claims to be children.
