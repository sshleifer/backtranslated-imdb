The worst film I've ever seen with Robert De Niror is The Fan slasher flicks exercise. It tries to become a genre using the shameful plot of a psychotic fan. (Spoiler) Do we suppose that an idiotic spotter, a baseball player in a baseball hotel with no security or camera? The film is nonsense while the baseball hookes trying to tense our hearts stopping with silent and thoughtful. I do not know what all the agents thought of when they entered this race. This is as great as this. Stay away if you want to think about your movies
