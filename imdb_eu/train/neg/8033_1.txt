In the university room, the guy attacks someone. She knows her girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) and wants to commit suicide. He institutionalized it. A year later, Hank has a new boyfriend named Joseph Lawrence and along with Spring Spring along with Hank and four other giants in a beautiful Florida condo. Of course, the killer will appear (no reason) and it starts to die again. <br /> <br /> Lousy slasher thriller - a non-stop horror movie example for textbooks. For beginners, the great part of this film is not fulfilling the filming of these six stupid ones, being "fun" (more entertaining than the audience), drinking, stupid, etc. Also, here is no nudity. I do not say that a horror movie needs nudity, but it would help to encourage everything. Deaths are not really showing (you hear them), they are just a little bloody and there is no runner. There is a real stick - but that's not the end. <br /> <br /> With a few exceptions, the theater is sucked. Dorie Barton is as daunting as the female singer and Tom Jay Jones Oz. Chad Allen presents Brad as TERRIBLE. Lawrence is really very good - giving it all this beautiful and hunky and crap. Jeff Conaway will appear in a small role that makes a small task. <br /> <br /> Those who overcome logic are abundant; After a friend's death, they found out that girls are talking about sex in both cases; Baston does not see the death of friends, is it fun and what is Lawrence doing? At the end of its nature it does not disappear! Sad, stupid, rude, naked - jump to this.
