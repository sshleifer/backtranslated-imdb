Bobby is a terrible child, he smiles a lot and wants sex. That's why he buys a van to help with this quest. The play is a mud, it is a pathetic comedy and the script is not a frightening topic and a cheap excitement. The authors of the film, of course, wanted to get some malignancy from other films of that era, but it was very short. Bobby plays banana with leather, which is supposed to add the value of the comedy. <br /> <br /> I found the film's respectable feature. If you like DeVito, this is another classic role for DeVito - but it's just an assistant actor and not for the value of the song.
