I have seen this movie several times in short film festivals, and I always think that I saw a movie trailer! <br /> <br /> It's very well-produced and directed for the school movie, but the story ... well, it needed something else to make it bigger and more interesting. He needed a little closer to the character named Tim Watcher. It's something missing in some shorts. The script is always superficial. <br /> <br /> But still ... I like this movie ... <br /> <br /> Parab√©ns! (Congratulations!)
