This movie was horrible. I first read the plot summary and I saw it well, so I saw it. The play was TERRIBLE. The actress was just like the camera was shy. everything seemed false. I feel bad for Edward Furlong, Thermator 2 was my favorite a few years ago ... I've seen at least 20 times ... <br /> <br /> The draw was also empty. writers surely slept when creating lines. <br /> <br /> Plus, it's kind of a bad movie. To see just how much worries you can keep watching, later on you will tell others what it might not be like to be a movie. <br /> <br /> I think everyone has to watch it Hortaz, then we can appreciate other best films, REAL.
