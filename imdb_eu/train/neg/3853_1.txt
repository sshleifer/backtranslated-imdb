I think that Jason Lees has a great potential, but this was an inadequate vehicle trying to starve. The earth is awesome, it's a great comedy. I laughed twice, I think it's a relief, as if looking back, the jokes were pretty lame. I was afraid of Fletch's future and I had to comfort myself with no mistake, that Lee was not. <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot, but I still recommend taking pictures of this website instead of this movie.
