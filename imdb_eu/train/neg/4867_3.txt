All we need! Another remake of Hollywood film, along with Eddie Murphy, started the second time again THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996)! This shows why we're running out of special ideas to make a quality movie, ladies and gentlemen! It has signs of hope for a pleasant and pleasing image of humans that can act and speak. Unfortunately, things may be worse. Bathing jokes and sex references instantly kills this "family" piece. Although the parents and children's trailer advertisement were seen on The Family Channel. In the cinema room there was a great deal of dissatisfaction and disgust. It is said to be a time of sadness before the end of the millennium, but it is enjoyed, as time goes by, things can only be achieved for less time. It went further with the new DR. Dolittle. It is completely empty, feeling very flat. I also hate Chris Rock's voice !!! We need high-voiced voices rather than over-crowded people. I agree with my local newspaper in the worst five movies in 1998. Again, the original version was not good either. The next Murphy project can be PATTON, if it were not careful!
