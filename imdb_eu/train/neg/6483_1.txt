It was not good. The characters were undeveloped and the only identities (or their shortcomings) were the only identity from the previous film. I seriously thought that the opening scene was Ariel's when the nightmare was how absurd she was. They were serious. He reminded me of all the annoying characters of the Disney Channel, because all of them are hyperactive and ties the story without confusing action without a shame story. <br /> <br /> The most disgusting were not reminded by horrible songs. It's not surprising. The original Ariel was a stunning and powerful voice and all the song was hard and fun. Remember and sing. But the songs in this movie were not very creative; As they are talking in the voice of the abominable songs, it's pretty weak, it's as if it were disappointing. I do not want to feel like you usually get in a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> It's not as if they wanted to make this movie, they did not make much effort. . . This movie requires a new story, it reminds the songs and requires more warmth and enthusiasm unless it's annoying "Look at me! Look at me! I'm very angry!" Disney's mindset of this generation. : '(
