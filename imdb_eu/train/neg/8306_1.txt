ET's obsession with Dannielynn Smith is unlikely. Leave the child alone. Continuously with great care, probably psychotic, depressed or worse will grow. Think Diana's princess and how she wants privacy. The poor girl, rich, now wants to stay alone Ashley Olson. It's not surprising that Greta Garb's has become a peephole and say "I want to be alone." How many ET does this little girl disconnect? Is not it better to inform you? I bet many people who do not care about what their birthday dolls and balloons have been. By the way, I have never heard Anna Nichole win any of these courts over will and inheritance. Who pays Larry, Howard and Dannielynn? Can ET be?
