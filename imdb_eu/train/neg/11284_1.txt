I'm trying to build quite a lot of criticism from the movie critics, but I can not believe it's going to get past the script stage. The conversation is horrible, the performance is very dodgy, the accent is just horrible, and the direction and pacing is best scrappy. <br /> <br /> I did not remember a movie that I saw was pretty bad for the last time. Joseph Fiennes, as if it were pretty, might start his career early. <br /> <br /> The island of Dr. Moreau was not worse than this garbage.
