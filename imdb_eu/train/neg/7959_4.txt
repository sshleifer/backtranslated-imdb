Andy Lau is in a new police station. Daniel Wu plays with Nick as a policeman and is located next to a drug group (Lau). The film starts to see the police trying to get rid of abuse. Then we got into the druggist and daughter of Nick and her daughter and her daughter. I closed the movie for 45 minutes and put them in the news. Well, play and watch it is wonderful, as I have seen for a long time, the movie is not involved. It's not a bad thing, that's why you really do not care. I mean, it really did not matter to me. I started to really forget about something I worked on in a subtitled movie, I did not care so much. He could hate the movie, but this film is not something that I would not have put any kind of inconvenience in any way. Come to the box called Scarface, what did he die? This should be avoided.
