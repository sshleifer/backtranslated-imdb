Film awesome! He has been against some of the real stinks designated for the Golden Globe. The first Renaissance Renaissance artist came up with a famous story and made no recognition. My complaint has not been deduced from facts; If the story were good, that would be very good. But it's just curious: in all accounts the true story of this artist could be much better, so why did this four-dimensional atmosphere come? I think there is not much naked people in the version. Finally, it is summed up with a summary of the artist's life; For two hours we could keep ourselves from feeling the rest of our films.
