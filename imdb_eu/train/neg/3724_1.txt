I saw this movie twice, my family, through a pentecostal church in Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. I was 6 years old, my brother 4; even when my brother was 8. I felt this movie my brother and I were terrified and I saw the world as having seen us mistrust. It was not just a movie, but a philosophy of "Christianity" with so much "brand of the beast" and rapture. This film, the church, and not the promotion of unwanted education, causes serious paranoia towards the future. Over the years, I lived through the illusions of church affection and I was afraid of being forgotten by Christ. I'm 40 years old now. He spent years advising. Once I explained to a psychiatrist this movie and the church and family belief system. I bind myself to a delicate blend. I started believing really, he reminded me of my brother, that this cultural philosophy had happened. When I'm not afraid of the future, I found the fear of the members of the church. I have taken this experience to accomplish an objective, as a Psychologist who approaches my childhood trauma.
