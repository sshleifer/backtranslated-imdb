In the future of 2001, Freddy made his last survivor of Elm Street. However, any fear of avoiding humor and the occurrence of celebrations is missing (come ... Roseanne? Tom Arnold ?? ?? ?? ?? WTF?), Which is related to the second part, the devil's rage has never been the worst ever. This wow was a piece of crap. Also, the great legendary Alice Cooper did not get away from the smell of this movie. And when did hell Freddy never had a daughter? The whole movie is permanently delayed in a very full, form and understandable way. Rachel Talalay, you're a high school of heaven, little girl. <br /> <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> Extra DVD: Bios toss and crew; Go to the 3D sequences and go to Jump to Nightmare options (more additions to the movie can be found on the seventh album of the Nightmare Collection DVD) <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom content: curiosities; Screenplay: and web link
