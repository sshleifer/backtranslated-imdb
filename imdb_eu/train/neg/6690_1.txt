I was sitting on the floor with my friends with low expectations. My expectations were not low enough. I could not honestly tell you what the movie was, and if it were a comedy, the mood was completely lost. The land does not exist and the performance was horrible. My friends and I have been able to see it for about 30 to 40 minutes before we can deactivate it and immediately ask the video store to be uploaded again. I do not recommend this film to anyone, if you do not try to watch the worst film all the time. Actually, I do not know that this movie lasted for more than a day at theaters, and I can not even understand what he wants to see, not only an interesting title but also a lack of his famous actress. This review is not a joke and, in fact, I think it's the worst movie ever made. It is definitely the worst film ever to feel.
