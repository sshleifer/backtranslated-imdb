Okay, let me you guys ... it's HORRIBLE! <br /> <br /> If Roger Kumble had the first cruel invention of this work, why did he work hard? I'm sorry, but this movie is stupid, in fact, it could have been improved if its series were ever to be realistic ... this movie is crock! A lot of bad activities * NOTE Shower scene * "Kissing Cousins" ?????? What kind of line is it? "When the scarves are wet" ?????????? We can say DUH-M! This movie is an effort, I'll give it to you, but it was a fool! They tried to make fun of home-grown officials ... Indeed, there were no toys! It was pathetic. So, all of them made the following: Undoubtedly as an original. It's as if they were going to look different or something! I really like it when I see what it's like on a board that happens occasionally. For those who like you ... Ok, what were you thinking about? Can we choose this movie with a great performance and with the wonderful Sarah Michelle Gellar? The movie is gold if Sarah Michelle Gellar is there, DUH! But Amy Adams has not been guilty of this film. Oh, well, since then Sebastain has a heart? UGH!
