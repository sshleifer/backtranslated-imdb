One of the other commentators mentioned that they were practically there. I did not want to be with my wife, I wanted to stay, I would leave. It's too bad I think it could be a good movie. But that's one of the worst scripts I've ever seen. It starts from nothing and does not go anywhere (I would say it is nowhere fast, but it's not slow anyway ... slow). Sometimes something interesting or touching is that there are some tips underlying a character, but we all get it. There is not a single win or revelation in the whole movie. I do not have to have a wonderful plot ... I do not like much of my next indie buff who looks at my good research character. But these characters are nothing. During the entire duration of the movie, it does not matter what happens to one of them. Actually, when you start dying, you expect, at least death could be more interesting because of their incomprehensible behavior, which is so strange and surprising that you think it would be compelling, but it is not. As black people and black skaters are acting instead, you immediately know what it is like: a great talented actress, curious actress, eyebrows investigate and raise a strange conversation. All this for two hours, rugged hours. Scary.
