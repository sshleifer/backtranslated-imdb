The actress in the film B super sexya has another bizarre part as the star of "Goodfellas", Ray Liota's girlfriend at the box office in this bomb. Marion plays, he's got a single line of conversation, really a conversation. She cries out "Joe!" Ray's character, as Pia Zadora is in breach, is mixed with a plastic sleeve sprinkler in the garden. This movie is very bad, although it is sometimes fun and hilarious. Mystery Science Theater would love 3000 pairs! Check out the ending hysterical scene, which Pia has with a nerve and makes all the shapes that she makes, trying to prove the wrong character of Pia. Pia plays Hollywood's Hollywood scriptwriter. As Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? Yes, no. Pia can not write, let alone write! Pia is completely and completely in this role of miscast. But who cares? The real star Glory Annen is hot and cool, in this small part of the opinion of this cat! Rock on Glory!
