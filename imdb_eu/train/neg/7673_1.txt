I do not know where to start. Tara Reid must stop before filming another movie. Stephen Dorff seems to have received his motivation from Val Kilmer. Slater sleeps. Direction, edition, sound (do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a gun?), Costumes (muscles with bottles of clothing), and there are no plots. I am surprised that no one who has attached to the project has stopped and said, "Hey guys, that's just no sense, let's do it again." Without a doubt, the route of Slater will be rebound from this disaster. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I ever watched manually.
