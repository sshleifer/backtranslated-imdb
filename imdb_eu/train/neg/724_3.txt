The concept of Sarafina seems to sound good, excluding music. It tries to combine African music with joy, the black people who had to endure fear in a story that describes the condition and atmosphere during which the film was set. The contradictions of each two elements are very bright and the film never justifies rapid changes between fear and fear. If it were just a drama that reflects these conditions, it can be a good movie, but the scenes of school-educated children do not speak well after songs. <br /> <br /> In addition to bad prayers, interpretation is not the best; Goldberg gives a mediocre performance, just like the rest of the pieces. Overall, disappointing. <br /> <br /> 3/10
