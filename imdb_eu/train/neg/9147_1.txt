I do not know what land, or beyond, Sam Mraovich might have thought a worthwhile project to do. Ben & Arthur is one of the worst movies ever made. In fact, I do not see why I would not have # 1 below 100. Although I have not seen, for example, SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2 (at the moment of this publication # 5). Guess that the film is much better than weakening the wound, Baby Geniuses 2 professionally, at least Baby Geniuses 2. On the contrary, everything, and I mean everything, is completely untouched in this film. <br /> <br /> The movie is about to face the hatred of Christian Right's alleged hatred and hatred. And I emphasize "intention". Not only does the goal completely and completely fail, it also leaves ugly. Instead of creating a giant and realistic portrait of a fight against a society against these couples, it creates laborious stereotypes of each party involved. Ben and Arthur, a pair of homosexuals, two cardinals, starving and desperately romantic portraits of Romance, who are related to marriages when they change laws. This meets Ben's opposition to Victor's brother, like all Christians (as we believed in this movie), loud, nonsensical, stupid, and violent. Ben and Arthur try to kill the associations that came together with them to get out of the ministry. Like real life. And if you think it's terrifying (that's it), you do not see everything. <br /> <br /> Actors (?) Here the utter destruction of the remains of credibility in this movie is telling a story about YouTube's homemade video. But Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brando's characters would not be able to keep this clunker, because still the whole interview with the movie's still inane and laughter. Every scene has at least one bad budget or loss. For example, in a scene, Victor's brother or his nephew tries to complain about his brother's homosexuality. But instead of portraying this idea clearly, he deflects a stupid, completely confusing line of rumors: "You know what I will never be with any nephew or nephew, I agree so F *** ED UP!" <br /> <br /> The total lack of production values ​​is still clearer. Yes, I know this is not a Dark Knight, but also amateur movies to know the basics of special effects and editing. For example, six point colored red cakes will not be enough. People do not come across the telphone. And objects are not falling when it's filming! <br /> <br /> Do not waste money in Ben & Arthur. I do not care 7, 17, or 107. I still do not like being a cheerful, straight-hearted, indecent or not. I do not care that you are "curious". I do not care what pathetic reasons you should be tempted to buy this thigh stack. Keep away, far away. The only free quality of the movie is its ability to use it as a Frisbee.
