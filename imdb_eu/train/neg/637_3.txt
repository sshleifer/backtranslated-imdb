Good Earth is not a big movie in any way, it's the usual way. Maybe it was different in the 1930s, but who wanted to see a farmer's life. I'm not very interested. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muniek do a great job, but the movie is too long. By the first action I would say the end of this movie. In short, Wang Lung (Muni) is like a small farmer who does not want to be like his father. Both are in love with their wives as in their bed of death. The film is going from generation to generation with 360 films. Also, this film does not have any good character or fun moments, it was a confusing thing to survive as a peasant during the crisis.
