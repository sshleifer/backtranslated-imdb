B-Movie I expected the French musician. In the end, Dhéry, Blanche, DeFunès were the superconsiders of the low-budget French francophones. And it's colorful! But I have a fever in this unbelievable 30 hours of pure medication. Music numbers are horrible, and the comedy is completely boring and stupid. And the songs? What songs? Bad numbers are just one succession, one after another. The nudity of women is very rare about this. At that moment I did not know. In fact, there are a few numbers to show topless women. It adds up too much! And young Michel Serrault, who will be the future actor of French cinema, will find a bit of music in his first film. Good luck!
