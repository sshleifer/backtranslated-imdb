This movie has been showing up over the phone lately, so there is no excuse. <br /> <br /> There's no excuse for 2 such women fighting with Luke Wilson or the "villian" in the movie. The actors are very nice, and this is the only reason to see this movie. I think it's "funny" that Luke's friend is the most balanced and stupid, but that's what we do. <br /> <br /> The head of women could never ever talk. Men in the movie have more than 5 minutes. What they get is a murmur, they cry and they are fighting, and they are over 2 boys who were on Friday on the 13th. Dead * @ $ #
