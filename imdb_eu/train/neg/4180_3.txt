I received this movie to replace the smallest daily TV show and go for thirsty women. As for the above, better daytime television is better ... even if I do not know how much. <br /> <br /> It has its own points but the first 20-30 minutes are good. He points out and concludes that watching a movie made for television is not enough time. In short, a terrific type of Sci Fi channel. <br /> <br /> He has points like futile dirty, such as "Blade Runner" ... of course, this is not "Blade Runner." "What the captain looks like, Robert Forster is the actress, like a person who can be around. <br /> <br /> But sadly," Andromeda "feels badly where the muscle is recovering. The crew have a" poor copy "of the intelligent artilleryman. They have a mystical vampire, Sexual Willow increases, and the new captain Jan-Michael Vincent can be like "Danger Island" in "Banana Splits." He uniforms his uniform, he has little right. Together with their version of power, they are part of a ship that looks like "Eureka Maru", they are fighting a "class" that occupies the universe and is divided into different tribes or sects. Evolutionary quality ... "Andromeda "Like Nietzsche. <br /> <br /> It might be a recovery feature with Michael Ironside, but after a while, he thinks he gets involved, as a hoot! It's probably fun He did, but he did not contribute much in the movie. <br /> <br /> That's "ok". It's ok to watch every DVD without turning off; If they see ads, they will probably change the channel. It may be seen one time .......... but a few hours later, ask what it was to see it. <br /> <br /> For me, he was a femme fatale. ... when he was fighting.
