I did not think it was possible, but I found the film worse than 'Body Melt'. This movie is really bad! Which is worse for the Australian movie ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br It continues, that is, it's hard to believe. When there is a bad starter (a white tomato sauce that is white topped with tomato sauce white?) <br /> <br /> And why alter accents? New York bad from template, prissy English, then pure Aussie! And the whole cast happens! <br /> <br /> This film also underlines that it has won a film festival (I think it was the Utah Film Festival). That must be a lie, because he does not consider anyone to name something (maybe Golden Rasberries, but I think it's too bad) <br /> <br /> Let's go boys! This movie must be number 1 at the bottom 100! It's already ten times bad for the movies in it. <br /> <br /> Spread the "good" films made for filmmakers to prove that there is reason to see the movies. 0/10
