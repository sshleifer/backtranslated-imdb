I swore the hate. There was no sex scenic graphics, because Artemisia Gentileschi's image deteriorated. This film does not have much to do with itself and its art. She shows a job she has done (Judith Beheading Holofernese), but shows that she has witnessed a trial as a result of the rape trial when she did not paint her first Judith after a year's trial. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you understood that film, probably Tassi was not a noble character. She was RAPED by Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not want to accept false rape charges while he was tortured. According to transcriptions of rape, he never liked to know Artemisia (even though with sex) repeatedly "True". <br /> <br /> I encourage everyone to leave. and find out about the true Artemisi and see what it really is. Do not know all your knowledge about this fictional movie. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia has an interesting story behind its art and stunning works of art. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie, but find out the true story of Artemisia.
