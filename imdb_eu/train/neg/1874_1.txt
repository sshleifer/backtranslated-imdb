Hal Hartley has been a passionate fan since I saw the short term "Surviving Desire", and then it was still totally unmoored that his "Henry Fool" is brilliant. 10 years later this sequel is not only useless, shameful. <br /> <br /> After a loud and fast start, the "Fay Grim" pseudo-intellectualism, bored flat and finally justified. disgrace - nihilism And that's just the plot. <br /> <br /> Most of the new faces are frivolous and poorly developed as a movie: a particularly strange character takes half the time spent by the evil Henry Fool himself. And it's the only scene in the movie! Jeff Goldblume's Fulbright agent, apparently, is a bright character (Hartley is also sure to be punished). How is it left then? ** SPOILER ** Dying through the bombing of cars, it is easily the most violent film of Hartley, and the word is completely wrong in a movie that is wrong. <br /> <br /> As for other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or Grim?), to mention Fay ... well, I'm not destroying their fates, because he works for that movie (he's not his If he confronts himself with another hateful angle that must be attentive, Hartley returns Auteur because he has a terrific blend of student discomfort.) <br /> <br /> This piece is a complete catastrophe, a terrifying disorder is not enough well enough to enjoy its rejection. Instead, the hipster that is usually funny in his director breaks the "real world", the poorer and the more absurd, but it's hardly a bit ugly or pretty good. Hartley keeps track of the memories of these people and the wonderful world that they originally created for them. <br /> <br /> I have rarely been in such an incident in the cinema and I am counting "leaving Las Vegas", at least when we developed cool new characters, we loved them before destroying their loved ones, excluding loved ones. <br /> <br /> Shame, indeed.
