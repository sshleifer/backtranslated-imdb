This must be the worst film ever I want to see. For the first 15 minutes, there was no interest in the film's interest. At that time I was on holiday, and I needed a lot of time to offer a fun movie. This movie was on sale in the condo - it had to be purchased from $ 1 or something. <br /> <br /> If you like Adam Sandler, this is not like any other movie. This started with a bad premise and then it was worse. There is nothing remote fun too. <br /> <br /> I have seen many movies, including some of those who did not care. But if you decide to lose your time in this movie, do not say I did not warn you.
