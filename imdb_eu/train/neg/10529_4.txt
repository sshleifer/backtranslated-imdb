View 1 on 12/6/2009 - From 10 to 4 (Dir-Walter Lang): From the point of view of the character's development, music is inadequate, because I think Rodgers and Hammerstein have appeared for a long time. Yul Brynner, sometimes, is a good-looking comic portrayal of King Siam, and sometimes a decent comedian, but the movie does not really make a good job of presenting situations and settings. I can not think of the script and, possibly, some of the reasons why we do not understand the character and their situation. I know it might be a bit too much to ask for music and music to enjoy songs, but this is not a highlight for me as well. The basic story is about an English woman who comes to Siam, to teach children about European upscale things. Later we learned that the King is actually the greatest student. The most recent wife of the king is a lover that Rita Moreno (Latin Arabic - come!) And other complications are prohibited, but it's not really brilliant. Deborah Kerr, as Annie's main character, is fine, but she's not convincing. The king learns some things for his presence, and then the movie disappears. This is actually a small story with small songs and dances, but it's not really an excellent viewer experience.
