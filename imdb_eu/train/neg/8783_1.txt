I do not think that the whole nonsense of a movie that I have ever lived was so proud that I was going through my whole life. It does not make any sense. None of them are light or well-designed. If they do not have a real suspense, they use a full police operation that works repeatedly, when you build music, open the character door or throw a curtain, and then there is nothing. That's all I could do, but I counted it three times. There is no apparent reason, characters, half-formed story lines ... the characters are not well-developed in ALL. it was over ... bad. bad, bad, bad, all this film, every ingredient, is horrible. and I'm just here to warn you.
