I never saw a pot - the boiler. "A Time to Kill," a supposed thriller of "Silence of the Lambs", even though "In the Heat of Night" reversed the reverse, "Strangers on a train" failed to fail. above all, it was largely successful. That is, giving emotions. The plot is condensed from a larger book, while the development of land is obvious and implausible, while the direction is rhythm and the same is lacking. For management, it has to be given an important way and fails here fails too. Connery is clearly slowed down in her old age, which is hardly in charge of the US accent, and seems to be too old to be Hope Lange's father and her children's father. Even though his father-in-law seems younger than him. Laurence Fishburne is hardly a chance to live her role and that she is confused by the beginning as a guy or a good man. One time someone said the flashbacks would not lie, here, they confuse. The rest of the reproductions of the stereotypical role only has an authorized standardized mean of just one average. It also manages the climate of the mind, leaving me in the background, I did not like the front edge of the seat. Hollywood movie and safe.
