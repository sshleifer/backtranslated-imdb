I caught the night at Showtime and it seemed amazing to me that such an interesting movie premise was so terribly terrifying. Who is your DADDY? Brandon Davis appoints a senior high school senior Chris Hughes, a geek inheriting from his biologist's inheritance of pornographic parents. Although the premise sounds so funny, the director of Andy Fickman forewards the mere direction of the director, a clicking and predictive script, and also live streaming standards. Charlie Talbert is usually a wonderful performance as a stunning friend. Ali Landry is the only good part of this leak and unfunny dud. 1/10
