: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I was very upset that Love Joy Living That forever. I had to wait a long time, and finally I had the opportunity to return to Thursday night Thursday night. "Love" I love the first three films, but this one was not so. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there was not much way to go, and editing was very poor - from out of context to many scenes. I also think that Kathy's childhood death has just happened and that Clark just looks to fit her. It seemed like no one of the actors really wanted. They lacked emotion. It seems that Missie and Willie were no interaction. <br /> <br /> I think that the writer's books should go a bit more. All the films made to date are being removed from Janette Oke's writings. I mean, in the film, I never mentioned mine and Clark guessed the two boys and that's why they did not mention two things. And I think that Missie and Willies can hear and hear reactions to Kathy's death. <br /> <br /> I'd have to get out of the four films to date Love Love Revolution Joy. it's my favorite. I hope the following four films continue with a part of the book and Clarks is in those characters, I hope he has a larger part and I hope his part is not so soft. Also, I hope Scottie and Cookie and maybe Marty are more, but who knows what screenwriters will have in the next store.
