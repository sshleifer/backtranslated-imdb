I will be short ... This movie is insolent, except for the filmmaker. Because of the criticism of the tourism sector, it seems to be "treated" to a real dance scene. Land is ridiculous except for BAD, the biggest fan of horror, it will not go away. And for the love of God, let's say this movie is a story of innocence or even a story of female power, which is clearly unclear (lesbian love, what hell?). That is, far away, the worst film in Edinburgh festival (however, I saw that), someone even fell in the middle of the movie, probably because they did not take it anymore. This seems to be very critical, but I do not really find a feature of this film, maybe it's just like a comedy. In short, this movie locates in a class A medication.
