I'm not mad at Pallbearer, it's not bad, but it's very slow at that time. As the film continues, it's more interesting, but it's nothing great. I really like David Schwimmer and I think it's good here. I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but I do not like it sometimes and it's okay. Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like to wear it, you can enjoy it.
