A magnificent miniature television series made by a 45-year-old woman trying to despair as a 16-year invention. It's no excuse - Ali A MacGraw's AIT DAY is the character, when Pearl Harbor attacks open before the start of surprise. This series of television is a true example of the title of this message and one of the most cited examples in this topic. <br /> <br /> That alone does this out of reach, even if it's one of them. The 'global' series of the Second World War has never produced. If you have a stomach - or a decent ability to start it fast - you can enjoy it at the end of Robert Mitchum, with great performance. <br /> <br /> I was surprised at some comments about the love story (it failed). Did you watch the movie closed? Or they will never be surprised by the old boomers, "their selective memories" and "selective vision". I'm Boomer myself; So I do not think I'm a young punk. 45 BILA LOOK 45. Promote. Face yourself Age well damnita <br /> <br /> The winds of war ... can be so good. The more we talk about this miniature series today, 25 years later, ACTUAL ingenue has been an important and critical role? Right now, with a constant and old-fashioned distraction, only the most beautiful aspects of Winds of War are excluded.
