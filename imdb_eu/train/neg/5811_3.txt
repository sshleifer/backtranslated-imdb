I have not seen this movie a bit, but I would still like to comment, especially because it does not feel like a burning memory in my memory cells. The original THE GETAWAY did not start a reward, but at least it had the distinctions 1) A Sam Peckinpah movie, 2) Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson, and Slim Pickens, 3) It was noteworthy that it was a rather painless way to blow away at an hour. and half time. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, the 1994 version comes with a bit more than just the piece of Alec Baldwin's red heat and his wife divorced Kim Basinger. McQueen and his wife Allie McBride made their movie version instantly distributed and Baldwins could create an image in their wedding council, arguing for that stupid idea. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin is not what Cooler King is ever and never will say, and this remake is so much annoyed that the reason for Baldwin's participation is a reason. Challenge to our Steve McQueen. Like another, the 1972 Peckinpah movie was a satirical piece to sort out the parody of the action / adventure genre of hatred. On the other hand, Baldwin, Bassinger and the company are trying to create serious shades, trying to get rid of the bad slimy character villains of Michael Madsen and James Woods. Fast and tiring in the basic level with fast words. A sight was more than enough, not just because it was something new to offer, something that was artificially done. Peckinpah's movie was really small and entertaining little entertainment. This version is too short for little or nothing. There is no artistic need of its existence, and some of the uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make it difficult to enjoy movies. <br /> <br /> So, I do not know, it surely helped one of these films. The start of the waves of the high budget waves was created around an actress / actress marked by the name of the waves of the remake, which is, of course, a good thing. I would always prefer a filmmaker to try to get a new idea of ​​at least one movie and try to see something original. I wanted to get this movie through eyebrows, and it's been revealed since he's been released from the next fifteen years, Mr. Baldwin has become very popular in Hollywood as one of the biggest bulwarks. Thank you God for putting "Team America" ​​in his place. <br /> <br /> 3/10
