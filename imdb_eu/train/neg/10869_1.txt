My friend gave me this video and I was very excited to see him, but I began to think about the slow voice of James Hetfield in ten minutes and the slow motion of Lars driven by his drum, "Why am I seeing this? Question that goes through your heads Will it continue for 5 years? 10 minutes after tapping the game. I returned the ribbon on the same day, as you suspect, as I do not buy or see. <br /> <br /> Just my opinion! <br /> <br /> <br />
