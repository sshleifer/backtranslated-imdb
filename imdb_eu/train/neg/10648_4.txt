The end of Weissmuller Tarzan's films is quite weak. There are certain things that this film prohibits. <br /> <br /> First of all, Tarzan passes through a large part of the films wearing sandal sandals. In my opinion, as it is portrayed in Tarzan shoes, sandals or boots, it deprives the nature of the anti-civilization and the jungle. <br /> <br /> Secondly, character Benjik, as mentioned in a previous post, completely destroys the movie comic paper. For me, its nature is not necessary in the plot of the movie. Likewise, while Weissmuller cuts an obvious figure as Tarzan, it is obvious that he did not do his best. In Jungle Jim's film versions, although his physics improved somewhat from this film. <br /> <br /> The Octopus fight is a great idea, but I think it was when it was possible to make it in the Weissmuller film. its peak Likewise, the battle for only 30 seconds would be much more exciting, as if it were drawn in 90 seconds and more than 2 minutes by the huge battle of Crocodiles between Tarzan and his men. Brenda Joyce is just as good as Jane and Linda Christian Mara, she has not recovered Weissmuller's latest film, a bad end to the character race.
