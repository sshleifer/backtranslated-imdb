It was one of the worst movie ever I've ever seen. I still do not know seriously, or just satire. One of those films that can think of a stupid fool. Arrrrgh. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is really good. But he absorbed it otherwise. I saw more than 10 years ago, but it still hurts and it does not stop stopping in my head. <br /> <br /> The last line of the movie really summarizes how stupid they are. I will not ruin your intention, if you want to try to misunderstand this movie. But nikya * will give you a moment at the end, with a few. If you do not have anything better and you'd like to laugh, it might be worth it. Also, if you're forced to go to a party that does not really like you, recommend watching this movie together, and you will probably only be able to see it later. The price to be paid is fair, I think.
