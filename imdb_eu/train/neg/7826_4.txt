Special effects? Good <br /> <br /> Script? Amazing. No earthquakes No depth. It has no meaning. This movie was a stupid hero Superman, he became an archetypical hero. In the original film, America represented America as part of the Cold War. Here, he just imagined Hulk. <br /> <br /> Surely the actors were okay. Kevin Spacey had a great chance, among other things. <br /> <br /> There's still no problem in this film yet. I can not see how it comes out to get something out of this movie, Superman, and it's a great heroine for everyday heroes, but also when it comes to people's minds. This is a real wasted money considering how many directions to get out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: Lex Luthor could be a global corporation, political mastery, totalitarianism, and again and again bad. and go ahead Hackman's incarnation was just another goofball. <br /> <br /> And Superman? What was this movie? It's just another image of the savior. <br /> <br /> Wait until the dollar theater, if you see.
