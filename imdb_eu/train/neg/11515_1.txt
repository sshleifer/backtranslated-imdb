and forget about it. Completely If you really want to see Madonna's performance, rent "Evidence Body", at least that's part of Willem Defoe. <br /> <br /> In this movie, while the sets are beautiful, you want to silence the conversation. . You have not lost anything. Bruce Greenwood is wasted, Jeanne Tripplehorn is her own and Madonna is so scary, it becomes fun. Why I should have picked up the original movie in this mess, I never know; They thought they thought it was "flattering." Madonna, as an actor, is definitely NOT NOW. <br /> <br /> If you rent your original movie since 1979, you can enjoy it and its actors will really play it. 1/10.
