Oh dear! I started to know what I expected. I could not believe what I see. Sometimes I thought it was a comedy. I loved the way of capturing the leadership of the head of the government's leadership, hoping that he will be caught and expected to flee with the rocket. Only if it was easy. Finally, I discovered the worst film from "Plan 9 From Outer Space".
