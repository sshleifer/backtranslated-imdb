Filmography: Excellent, nice camera angles (I did not remember a late movie I saw, good close-ups, until this). With mild cameras, horrible scenes could be avoided. NY is a good image. I like the angles from the top down, especially (another touch). <br /> <br /> Music: Not spectacular. The songs are not remembered in your mind after watching the movie. It might be, I expect the same quality as "Anniyan". A disappointment. <br /> <br /> Actors: Kamal should move away from action signals slowly. His age and belly really appear. Also, it should avoid some closed romantic sequences to continue forward. It was very wrong to see a mature / old star trying to play as a 20-year-old hero. Love can be expressed at any age; Since we are older, you can still express yourself with love from a distance (without touching a woman too). For example, the love that Rajinikanthe describes in Chandrmukhi. <br /> <br /> Jyota in the film appears in the tribute. I do not know why he accepted that. Well, that's not my problem, I think. <br /> <br /> Others have only a small presence. <br /> <br /> Direction: Gautelo hopes to (or measure) another. "Kakka Kakka" movie. He was disappointed. It was a long time since the movie was released due to various issues. There's little scene There are also things that come out of celebrities. <br /> <br /> In general: a good movie. Too many graphics DEFINITIVE for adults who expect children (and "entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thx
