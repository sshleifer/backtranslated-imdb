Movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining. That's why Whoopi Goldberg films. But whoopi and dinosaurs? <br /> <br /> After 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex", I reached a single conclusion: this movie is evil. Evil, evil, evil and evil to the audience. This bad thing is not accidental; This is equivalent to equivalent to a torture chamber. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, Whoopi does not act on good films (see if I think I'm lying "Fatal Beauty"), but the filmmakers' watchdog is hard here again. <br /> <br /> Have you seen a couple of millions of friends a week? Well, here are a million and one, my friend. <br /> <br /> Do not like the animated dinosaurs that show Spielberg TV around them. Bad, here's another one and the police too! <br /> <br /> Do you follow cars, shooters, a wonderful interview, a futuristic FX bored and one of the high-profile people (Goldberg, Mueller-) Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a movie that is offline? Great tax filing? You have a sequel to deserve it. Seriously. <br /> <br /> <br /> It has no star, not one. And if they make a sequel to "Theodore Rex", Hollywood recommends a great deal of food for dinosaur cats. <br /> <br /> Now, I would pay for it.
