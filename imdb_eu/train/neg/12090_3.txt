Although I'm potentially angry at this movie, though I see it through intrigue, I definitely thought that how the scene structure plays a great deal was that it was a terrific sight for most audiences. The story of the mother's "dash at your father's day" commentary on the script has made it more difficult to get the sense of these characters. <br /> <br /> He won first place at Cannes in 2001. it's a shock. Perhaps the Frenchmen were hungry at the black cinema, and they were as disappointed as this sadistic movie. I have understood long scenes as a device to make the viewer look as uncomfortable as possible, but I did not go too far with the impossibility of connecting with the main character, and the story was completely distant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> I loved movies like "Trainspotting" or "Dream for Requiem" - they were much more disturbing but at least they allowed them to edit and walk on the audience. This teacher saw slow and painful silence after the scene, the scene became so redundant that it was boring and at the same time I liked the movie at every turn.
