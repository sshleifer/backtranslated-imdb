7EVENTY 5IVE plots let college kids who play college cruel games unexpectedly (they are not horror enthusiasts). 7EVENTY 5IVE PARTNERS, on the other hand, is a promise of a horror film, which is much bigger than writing. <br /> <br /> What could have been fun, if it were a bit like a giant story of a giant and stupid tale, its filmmakers believe that "a rich and noisy movie that would be enjoyed by viewers, who make the most of the length of the film."
