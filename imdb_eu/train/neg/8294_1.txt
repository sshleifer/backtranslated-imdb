It seems that something is poetic when it is prescribed. You will swear, in this horrible movie, but the audience suffer from pain in the teeth. If you want to see a movie full of baby screams, you want to see full children, children, long babies, long looks, wives and a worried husband: here it is for you. Teary, longer, it stands as an example of a scream: why? Is there a saving grace? Yes it is there The Nabucco scene is short, with a good song. Save your money, or if it's a TV or cable, save time. You can read a book or make an omelette.
