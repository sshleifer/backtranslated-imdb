I found a DVD of "I Dream Of Jeanie" at $ 1.00 on Wal-Mart. When I saw that Stephen Foster's "story" was a musician and an educator, I had to see it. I did not know what he was doing on the cover for years, it was a restoration of the "Sewanee River" in 1939. Sometimes, the portrayal of Bill Shirley's composer is painful, sometimes horny. Men have NO testosterone and it's a very bad way! It's hard to imagine Stephen Foster was trying to sing the music editor himself ... without paying them! Apart from the hilarious idea, the 20-minute segment of Ray Middleton and the black face of "Christy Minstrels" were hardly a matter of seeing Stephen Foster's songs, at least. I can not believe anyone who considers this film to resurrect in the present era. It's shame and must be forgotten. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs will never be forgotten ... The portrait of Eileen Christy's Jeanie was, without a doubt, the highest point in Hollywood's lowest point of history.
