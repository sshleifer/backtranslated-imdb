This movie was probably the biggest waste of my life. It was a pathetic act. Jordan Hinson could not show the wrong emotions. At the beginning of the movie, it was recommended. Instead, he lowered his head, lowered his lower lip. Crying weeping crying without lying. I was almost angry that they had to leave the girls who wanted to be the actress. Others also had a great impact. It was annoying. The skaters were also insulted. Jordan took a month to train and was thrown out as an Olympic team. In real effort, real skaters are working on their own. A great excuse for a movie and an attempt to join hockey and skating. Do not waste your life. It does not even deserve a star.
