I expected a similar movie from Deuce Bigalow. However, the misfortunes persisted forever. It is one of those films that enjoys the sad location of the PG-13 while not suitable for children. The jokes are not just short swingers or jokes, they are raw, lewd, and they cross different actions, not only in bad taste, but also in morality and moral justice. Many scenes seem to have been cut off to a grade PG-13 ... very bad ... it's likely that splashing as a R-rated movie is fun if it's fun. (Is it probably announced). do not recommend this movie. It's time to waste ... and I'm a movie lover and I'm almost ready to give it all. In 45 minutes, the movie was supposed to be a drop ... and the boys were ready for it. The end is curious, but it does not restore the rest of the wall / tourist trap. 1/2 star (I was glad to see it as a freebie ... for this city they would have given me the chance to recover the money)
