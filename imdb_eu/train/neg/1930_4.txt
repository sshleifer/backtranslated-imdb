Some have praised _Atlantis: _The_Lost_Empire_ Disney as an adventure for adults. I do not think - not least for adults. <br /> <br /> This script suggests at the start of a live action movie, that is, as a type of basket that someone can not handle. The "crack-worker" of many of the old-fashioned films of the old adventure has been successful (think _The Dirty Dozen_a), but _Atlantis_ is one of the worst movie of this motto. The characters are weak. Every partner's back in the background seems to be in stock and awkward. MD / Medicine Man, his father always wanted a mechanic murder, at least if we did not see them, the mixes and pairs we saw earlier. The story by Vinny-assisted director by Don Novello (Guido Sarducci) was completely persuasive about the flower shops. <br /> <br /> The main character, Milo Thatch, was an obsession with young Atlantis. Michael J. Fox has said, it has a depth. The grandfather who was looking for Milo Atlantis continues to be the one who lifted it. In the early scene on the knee, Milo is much younger, with his grandfather putting his helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And while the characters were very thin, the best part about the Atlantic was the voice. talent Maybe the Milo depth is not thicker than Fox's charm. Commander Rourke, James Garner, does not lose anything. Although Rourke's narrow military style, Garner shows his ability to breathe life into his own, because he just delivers. Garner's voice interpretation is the highest point. I'm sorry that Leonard Nimoy's killing king is mandatory. Additionally, as Vinny Santorini's demolition expert, Don Novello emphasized for a fun and good line - but I always liked Father Guido Sarducci. <br /> <br /> It was also a well-done animation computer. BUDGET animation, that is. The character animation was not bad at Disney by minimalism from Don Bluth's door. The character's animation did nothing, since flat characters already seem flat. Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is no wonder. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say they are fake. I am not sure of that. The useful plot with the right treatment can become something new. Shakespeare often went from famous stories and land, and was only known for the painting of the coat of arms. So treatment is the thing. And _Atlantis_ obviously does not lack. <br /> <br /> I can not enter all logical spaces without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. Land bridges end up like grooves and the end does not make sense. To add it, the script and animation are covered with an annoying mess. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> 1. Initially, when Milo was transliterating symbols or symbols of the Celtic symbols, and when he had to read the "coast of Ireland", he had to read the "coast of Iceland" we will start The scriptwriters should know the British as "Ireland", which they should take to Eire or Eire, and completely disband the ancient terms of the Latin Hibernians. But more than that, Vikings must know the conspiracy to call Iceland the greener island and the most beautiful island in Greenland. <br /> <br /> If the impersonation of the "letter" was incorrect, writers asked for a Runic version of English and a post-Roman script. Since then, Atlantis sank in her underground cave. And without Milo's more spectacular technology than Milo, the inscription was much less reliable. <br /> <br /> 2. Shepard Magazine could not be written before sinking Atlantis, or it should not be known between the cave or the crystal between the "King's eye". It was written after sinking, but Milo did not even have the technology, how did someone get in Leviathan? So how could you know more after this? And why should it be written in Atlantis? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clarity, or the astral journey can explain these things. However, clarity and astral travel do not need to be written in the Shepard Atlante. So it's a bit of automatic writing. As an Atlantis left-lender can read, the spirits of the crystal send it when they send messages. This would have more meaning. But it could also be explained in the film: Milo could find what he called the power of his life - he dreams, and so on. This was to be explored in the film. 3/3 <br /> <br /> 3. The Atlantis should be able to understand modern languages. The Indo-European people know that they do not know in Europe, they will know that the "c" hard or "days" of the French are "sh" (no less!). <br /> <br /> 4. The current Atlanteans were alive before the cataclysm, apparently *, but now they could not read what they used or similar machinery. <br /> <br /> 5. Mass Illiteracy emphasizes a fundamental flaw in the film. KRISTINA has not happened to this culture anymore. He is suspended in the air until he can save Milo. While fighting for life is not a constant struggle, no-one writes poetry and wants to write novels, and maybe it's a combination of downsizing in the school system in Atlantis and lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall. illiteracy <br /> <br /> 5. Kida can be ruled out by reading the machine or not knowing how to work, when it is considered so young when Cataclysm of Stupidity is introduced - But any of them ** HARDLY ** is his father's Deification !! Kashakim's stupidity almost completely erased the existence of his people. He killed a series of Cataclysm, stopped progressing (there was not a lot of death here, but he had a massive slip on culture and progress). If someone could not kill everyone until they could take a crystal, they did not cook the lava in the first place. <br /> <br /> A blue balloon power should break the image of Kashakim when he tried to connect his father's image with the GREAT Kings of Atlantis circle. <br /> <br /> 6. Milo, even though he was the only one to read in Atlantis, looked at Rourke and others in a book of being creatures and found a page on a crystal - he knew a crystal and was not astrologically stylized or "Find some phases in the" sun diagram. <br /> <br /> 7. Milo's grandfather would tell Rourkeri about it, he still does not explain how Rourkek could read Milo's part as a part of the book. He dropped the page in Rourker's hands, but found that Milo had no sign of broken pages on the book, even though the viewer was "not doing something right". If the word "crystals" were canceled by Milo's warning, Milo would not try to steal it, Milo would have nothing to think about. It's just about the precedence. <br /> <br /> 8. The "double cross" of the crew did not change the nature. We learned from Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie Rourke since the beginning. However, the flat "heart change" falls. It was a change, and it was motivated. To get started, nothing hard to do with the characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> A little lava flows out above the dome, instead of substituting the other field that we see. It's liquid; It does not emit above the protective dome, until all the fields below are filled. <br /> <br /> 10. It only makes sense to adapt to the political crisis, and it does not make sense. With the backward source, Atlantis is no longer a weak power, which needs coddling. They shoot huge robot guards and blue lightning, of course, they are less afraid of fear. Technology is better than ours and, definitely, XX. At the beginning of the century In the end, Milo needs to read the Atlantis, what? The whole idea is to leave his quiet little culture, demanding only, and not sending it to hypertension. <br /> <br /> ** RETURN BACK ** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps, I would like to point out that the Lost World Plots and the beginning of the century's settings are a tribute. pulps The errors found with the film are in agreement with that idea. But I do not know why I pay to see thin characters and holes as many centimeters of novels. However, the stories of the pulp make up "mature flesh can not sell". We have gradually become more sophisticated and we have to grow our crumbs. The lost Arche Champion have not sucked themselves out of sensibility and avoided so much evil. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10: the movie is nice, but as I think about the plot, it's never too much.
