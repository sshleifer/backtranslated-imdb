This version will be available on your DVD at your local store store. Print is not great, nor sound, but if you need $ 1.00 and up to 90 or just a minute, it's worth your money (that's not a lot of money). Anna Neagle is so shameful as Nanette. Their charm can be any day, they are not visible in this movie. There are many beautiful actors in this film (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material is a small tale. However, it is interesting to take advantage of the weakest writing by interpreters. Music numbers (really there are two) is horrible. It is clear that he was not forced into the richness of the original musicality "No, No, Nanette" in the studio. What's worth it, the DVD can be $ 1.00. It's worth it to see that you've seen.
