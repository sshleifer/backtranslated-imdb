I read about that movie in a magazine and I knew it. A woman who sees one day in her car. Well, I thought, that might be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but it's not. First, the title. Broken Broken ... what? What's upset? The ... oh, wait ... I get it, the title is "broken"! WOW, light! Unfortunately, this is almost the only thing. <br /> <br /> The premise is not so bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland has done much better in 'Mirrors'. A cross between Body Snatchers and Mirrors Invasion, and that's just a bad one. A better title would be 'Boring', because it extracts all the scenes. Or, perhaps, "The Confusing" does not explain anything, not narration, or even story, a fuzzy idea about malicious copies but fears and scenes used for death, but nothing less tangible. It's just wrong. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the performance and the special effects are quite good, but again it is not a difficult task. <br /> <br /> Having watched the movie twice, I still do not feel happy, a bit mixed up, not EA Poe or Stephen King. Make yourself one side and do not miss this. There's just better thriller.
