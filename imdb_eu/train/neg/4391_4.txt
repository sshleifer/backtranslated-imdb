Harry Harrison, a young scientist, continues his scientific research on his mother's self to regenerate. However, her mother's pain and her doctors want to get rid of the serum. When she finds out, the accident takes place to lose a Harry arm. So, it tests serums and what events is a genetically modified arm that is keen on your own. <br /> <br /> Oh, we've seen so many times, but that's what makes this a very police force and a pretty rubbish dumpster, Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed's performance in the icons. Actually, it's not a bad film at Fangoria movies; There are just a few better ones, respectively. The "link to the server" is just a distinctive style. It is curious and unpleasant nature to resemble the splatter "Re-animator", and even slapstick it as "Evil Dead 2" something stuck. <br /> <br /> The comic story is really whacked with a black humor, but it can become melodramatic and a bit dry in the key factor. Surprises rise, especially the final result of the film. It is very well accepted, as it could be copied with something more accessible. For a low-budget production, FX make-up is stiff and very curious, but some grotesque moments make you smile. Although the sexual tension brush relieves the story, thanks to the performance of the mother as Elke Sommer. Oliver Reed feels sorely bad and very well. They both diverted the pair of hateful guys. Billy Morrisette is amazing in a performance that Harry plays as soon as he plays. Damon Santostefano directs a short film and a horrible horror scene with orchestra orchestras.
