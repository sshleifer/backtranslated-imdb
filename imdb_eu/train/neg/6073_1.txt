* NEWS AWARDS IN THIS TEACHER * This movie was horrible. I'm a great fan of baseball, so I thought, and I was very disappointed. He started well When I saw the bad influence of young DeNiro, I hoped that the whole movie would become a better dad. In any case, initially DeNiro seemed to be the protagonist. Bobby was the only one to believe, and he was watching over his adorable son, that is, he was motivated to feel bad for himself. He wanted to help him talk with Bobby Primo, who died absolutely at Primo's death ... Discuss this song, "I WANT TO MAKE YOU!" at random moments without moment. <br /> <br /> Later, when DeNiro dropped when Bobby's son drowned, I waited for him to recover the movie ... He could forgive himself when he saved his son, Primo Bobby. But, of course, it is much more than the depth of the film, because he takes care of it because he gets a CREDIT of murder, which makes Bobby's son, car, and dog, and to be kidnapped. Bobby has to make a home run and announced that DeNiro is a true "fan" while showing a snapshot of the knife. <br /> <br /> Now, finally, we will reach the realistic scene ... we are spreading like hell and we are expected to think that this game is not called. Then the DeNiro magician has somehow appeared in the field at a speed suit and he calls Bobby home, knocks his knife out and all goes out to the collar. There seems to be no officers on the field (but the police are on the way), DeNiro is placed on the tomb and Bobby gives a knife to death when he shoots. But do not worry, this happy and pleasant movie has a happy ending because he finds his son. <br /> <br /> This is not a sports movie. It's NOT about a fan. As I know, the bomber's psychopaths do not threaten, rob and steal their fans. The worst film I will ever see in my life. It was a shallow ground, it absorbed the soundtrack, it was not a movie. I swear I do not have time to make this movie a pretentious movie.
