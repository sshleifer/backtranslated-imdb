Warning: This review has a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. It's almost amazing. I said notice, "almost". A lot of random scenes gathered together in a solid essay of a story. The protagonists (who are NOT called "heroes") are looking for innocent people who are looking for food and steal them for similar reasons. In addition, there is also a ton of homoeroticism. (SPOILER: It seems to be fashionable (that includes other topless and not including all other reviews) starts to die, but it does recover the miracle, adding another 70-minute torture.) I can not shake this animal. Abuse has taken place several times over this abominative filmmaker. If you are in a MST3 Mood, you may see it, but you can often forget it. Rent original Conan DVD.
