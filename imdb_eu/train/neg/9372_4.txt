This is a typical Horror Horror film: it is technically complex, if they have numbers, a cookie cutter plot and some excessive abuses. The most interesting part of this film is Rondo Hatton, a man of his disease as a "monster" of his disease. He was a sad man who exploited himself, but he surely paid the money well. Hatton is less impressive than the studio, I feared more often, or even more disgusted. Martin Koslack is a mad artist and is very funny in this aspect. I really like Koslack to see any one; For some reason, man likes me. The only part of the movie that was entertained with me is the nonsense about the world of art. Here we show the evil critics of art that break the artist's ability. This is the male "hero" of the movie, which paints the "artist" ... get this ... the girl's peeling. In any case, the work of our heroine is being revised along with the absurd sculpture of villains. In addition, the funny movie is the most wicked critic, because, in some ways, he despises the art of the hero's pin "is not such a woman," that is, because our heroines respond to the guarantee that the critics fail. . In the end, heroins (all their critics of art) are somewhat subtle about domesticity, the domesticity of the main man ... completely anti-feminist and ridiculous witness. In general, this film is a central image with some fun elements.
