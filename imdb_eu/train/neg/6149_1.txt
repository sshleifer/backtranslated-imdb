I'll give you some days with Ron Howard before swearing his work. Unfortunately, with Lucas so long ago, Howard has now captured many of Lucas's features. Otherwise, how do you explain the challenge of its disasters? His useful film, of course, was 'Willow'. Everything else, including this one, is superfluous. <br /> <br /> Some disasters. <br /> <br /> It can not be a vision of semi-intelligent people like Peter Weir. No, how poor Howard is stuck in his skills in Spielberg, he will be forgotten. <br /> <br /> Here is the old suggestion: "Conquering love, even the disease." Very bad Howard Lynch got a full subtitle with more skill. Fish, even though it's better than Disney. Ron will also analyze the possibilities presented by imaginary reality. <br /> <br /> Howard's comments are horrible. Do not even rent a DVD. <br /> <br /> Last analysis = = Cinematographic
