It's more silent than the original (but it's possible, I can say, as well as the IMDb instructions). CONNECTION OF THE FRENCHSES attempted to absorb Europe's effects at least to complicate the common vision of the American police detective, although the attempt was made by Friedkin's ambivalence, as a result of Americans and the general indirection. The newly boom (relative) of the 1960's (especially the nouvelle vague) achieved great influence on European cinema in Hollywood. This gave the media a powerful and complexity and, in the best of them (for example, BONNIE AND CLYDE, at the beginning of the Scorcese), a new subversion of the received practice. It was part of the original CONNECTION movement, with its distant complicated style and anti-detective image. TWO old Hollywood's right side is to recover America's values. <br /> <br /> This America vs. France movie is very difficult to imagine. For example, TWO is in the same way as the French police in the 70s. The French, of course, stressed the magnitude of the American cinema being excluded at home, and this, in other words, is a claim against the presumption of the Welsh. This can be seen in two movie models. CONNECTION has French gangster invaders of New York, stifling French style with American thriller; This destroys the detection image and brings it to a complete solution to the plot. <br /> <br /> THE SECOND U.S. Americans will return to France, thanks to the values ​​set by the American thrillers. Detective power is reaffirmed and regular resolution is obtained. This is dramatized by Doyle's relationship with the French-inspired Barthelmy Inspector, which has the effect of shaking it down before being controlled by the plot. Since the beginning, the importance of Doyle has taken place every other day. Although CONNECTION is over, the hero is considered. In the United States, however, it is located in a foreign country, and the impossibility of controlling the language or customs can not overcome the plot. It also misunderstood the police's signals, the informant of a criminal goes wrong and dies. <br /> <br /> The power of a detective is a matter of seeing and interpreting his power, but Doyle is watching the movie, controlling it, an object, a body (literally, it says that after the spell of Charnier). ) to see and interpret. CONNECTION carried out the action, following the criminals, forcing the plot; here is passive, linked to a bed, locked in a cell, dependency, dependent. <br /> <br /> The loss of the phallic power symbolizes the loss of his weapon before his gun, and the film continues the oppressor. traditional edible route In the heroine sequences, an old lady who looks like her son feels comfortable. His drugged state is like going back to his belly because he has stolen the pressure of adults. Its clock strengthens the duration of this creditor's position, which is twice as significant for the timing and precision of the man. <br /> <br /> Oedipus was the first detective to avoid his fate, Doyle must deny that false mother. who is to undo his unified identity and kill his father (Charnier) in order to accept the accepted role of society. The psychoanalytic theory was very popular among scholars in the 70s (a Frenchman was instituted by Jacques Lacan), but it is rare to see that film quite literally full. <br /> <br /> If all the Doyle's minimization events are not in the style of the movie. Friedkin goes away from his hero, denying empathy or motivation of the character, focusing on the plot mechanics. Here, Doyle is a typical Hollywood hero. Instead of losing dark and dark shots, the viewer is understandable and understandable with traditional devices - vision plans, proximity, flat links, etc. <br /> <br /> TWO are about all. fall and the rise of Popeye Doyle. In this case, according to the plot, it is the usual Hackman showiness. That's why cold turkeys do not get boring. We look forward to sharing it instead of making it cool. This experience is getting smaller. The scenes are also a rugged American state. <br /> <br /> So, while CONNEXTION attempted to imitate the complex thrillers of Jean Pierre Melviller, TWO makes the opposite. Melville's LE SAMOURAI filmed a full-fledged film and went on the gangs and disintegrated. TWO begins the inevitable character that begins, partly through the language's inability, whose dominance begins when the language begins to emerge. <br /> <br /> In the film, their language and languages ​​are important in solving and undermining the detective, but as he regains his power (when his gun returned and the catastrophic event occurred). Vulnerability, where the tower block is located by Charnier), the setting of Marseilles becomes irrelevant and takes mythical resistance anywhere. Compare the endings of two films: Ambiguity and disappointment, another absolute certainty. <br /> <br /> <br />
