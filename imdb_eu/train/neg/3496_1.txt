I remem- ber that parents had no idea that Saturday Night Live was 15 years old. Also, they did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things. As I am approaching, I still remember and understand a lot of things my children love. But this is pathetic. I can not say that Sarah has seen me, except for a few phenomena. They were sensible. I do not see anything special. But this show is below what I expected from them. It's like writing a writing pot. So I just saw the first episode. I turned it off in the middle of the road. Something else is better. 5-year-old jokes for adults in a supposedly adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult does not move you. I just believe that what the financially damaged comedian really did. The only thing I can say is that the jokes are bad here, there are other shows to keep from that embarrassment.
