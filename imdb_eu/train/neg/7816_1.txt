It does not matter that Superman's comic books are incredible naive and their purpose is ten years. It's important that "Superman Returns" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, dear reader to you, how much do you think Superman will defeat Kevin Spacey? Anyone? As I thought. There is no havoc here. So, today, we need to get some important issues. <br /> <br /> First, this movie seems to be commercial (Superman / Clark Kent's bar scene is the only scene that suits Budweiser). Imagine Superman's trade, one and a half hours long. Please, this is no serious "Amadeus" or "The Departed". You really feel that this movie is too long. And the special effects are not so special in themselves. <br /> <br /> Second, the scenes are stupid. Sometimes even though the comic is something acceptable, it's just a stupid movie. And that is the case in this case. Of course, conversations are shame. I can not believe someone to write money. How often do we have foods that make fake foods? How often will laws of physics be violated? (Jesus, Superman is a matter of force, but also material resistance). How many times will Kent deceive Lois Lane? How many times do Hollywood producers look for a story in a rough comic? It's not a difficult story to do, why have a bad initial story? It just works. Boys, get up. Try it harder, please. Or just follow this passion forever, who cares. I feel the WGA definitely strikes. Without any harm. I do not expect people to pay money, but they give you the quality of the product. In this case there is no quality. (You can ask at this time: is it so bad? Yes, that's it.) <br /> <br /> Thirdly, acting is weak, which is quite surprising because it directs Bryan Singer (Usual Suspects). Kevin Spacey is having fun, but it's only one. The viewer does not move away from the joke. The thing is to turn the comic hero into a true personality, with clear motivations, but also doubts, fears, and some depths. In this case, nobody has done this, and the characters are not really interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, the whole effort of the creators makes this movie parody. The second unit attracts so bad attention, but there is no interest in the screen. They try harder (if they try), it's fun (but you can not laugh). <br /> <br /> The final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This film is a feminine and feminine movie. Do not waste your time and do not lose money too. To read at home, read a book.
