Ummm, please forgive me, but have not been missing more than half of the characters? In the original novel, he is a man imprisoned in Valjia for 19 years, stole several robberies from a robbery and then tried to escape. Convulsive freedom violates and Javert police inspector continues continuously. There are many characters that did not exist during this period. Notable are Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Then Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolras. The only character in the same name is Javert. I was confused and frustrated throughout the film, trying to see how Victor Hugo's novel was linked to this era.
