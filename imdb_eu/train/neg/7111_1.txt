- A young couple's husband's wife enters the house of the month. Before the new wife, someone starts feeling at ease. He sees skulls around the house. But when she is looking for her husband, she can not find anything. Does anyone want to go back to the nursing home? Or is the ghost of the deceased's wife trying to get out of her new wife? <br /> <br /> - The first time I saw The Screaming Skull, without the help of the MST3K team. And, probably, it will be the last time I see it. Can not say in vain? I'm not sad to talk - I'm watching grass that grows grass. There's nothing great about the movie. The screen could be empty and I would take it out for entertainment. The characters are a monotonous conversation that they play with each other. Screaming Skull would market it as an assistant flower. <br /> <br /> - The actors do not care much. Most lines are often delivered to the school's recreational belief. I did not look at it, but I would be surprised to see the value of any movie related to this movie. I do not even enter the screenplay for the actors to work. Let's say the characters give some of the most stupid lines ever made in cinema. <br /> <br /> - You have been warned! Or avoid this at all costs or at least search the MST3K version.
