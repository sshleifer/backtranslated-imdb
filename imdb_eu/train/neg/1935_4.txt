Chinese Ghost Story III is a completely useless two-story fantasy movie. The film directs the spelling of special effects, but fails on any other front. All actors are very absurd. You should still have a diaper as your remote fun. Land is predictable, and sometimes development is hard and often slow. At the end, the film takes on old-fashioned Godzilla films, including, in addition to the special effects of life, and the Godzilla head (well, the other) ghost. Perhaps when I wait outside, I would smile. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see what fantastic fantasies should endure, because in this case someone thinks they can take extra money. Successful formula They will not be able to do it again: money is dead as a dead cow.
