Rajinikanth was born again after being able to use the magical power he had used seven times. <br /> <br /> There are some problems with the viewer of this movie in the eyes of the audience: Rajinikanth 50 is still at home with parents; She thinks she is a "boy" credible (Vaseekaramaana paiyan); Rajinikanth immediately speaks of his films thanks to his preaching; The worst thing is that women who work hard at home; However, we believe that it is not the theist; Although well read, he will lose six of his seven powers in the icons stupid; I can still follow the image. <br /> <br /> There are god men, there are gods, and there is no Rajinikanth. The directory has difficulties in accessing one of these categories in Rajinikanth. In the beginning, Rajinikanth Rajinikanth is just what the heroes of Tamil make - condemn both evil and oldest, but dares the best girl in the movie. Rajinikanthe is doing well and Rajinikanth's style is a bit of a commodity style - it's the novelty "baba count". This movie is unbearable for those few initial minutes to be just a preface for a bad book to be written. The preview is also marked with compulsory and obvious comedies. <br /> <br /> The director does not explain the purpose of the hero; We will see that the hero has several obstacles (politicians, as usual), but we can not see the hero's root, we do not know what the ultimate goal of the hero. In the end, when everybody wants to be a leader, the hero will give his sermons another, and he walks away to become hermitages. The director does not offer solutions in the supreme scene. <br /> <br /> A. R. Rehman's score is really interesting. Whether it blinks or does not take responsibility for fully investing in this movie - who can blame her. There is a scene where Rajinikanthe enters the van of a sketch and then knocks his knife and starts his baba count. Music is a good moment and adds more strain. The songs are all middle-class, and nobody would worry about the songs of these films after a few years. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest level you can assign to the IMDb. This movie has all the elements that justify the place in its classification.
