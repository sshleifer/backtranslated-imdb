Well, how can we imagine that "Lordi Motion Picture" was a "mutual" promotion? I mean, I realized that when the "dinosaur" costume appeared and the singer was glad when I was "Hard Rock Hallelujah", I even hate it. "Dark Floors" is about a young autistic girl, when she is in a process to get her father's hell out of hospital, along with people in a lifts, for a moment ... on her floor it is surprising to know that nobody is around. The hospital is empty ... It seems that there are so many monsters that do not look like it ... They run across the corridors and stairs, all the members of the heavy metal band meet up with their strange and awesome spectacle. -Rock costumes ... There's nothing really memorable here, except for fake plays, gore / nudity, and a shamelessly shameless promotion, "KISS Meet Phantom of the Park" reminds me. Yes, what do I remember? I did not want ... I'd recommend to avoid Ghost House all these films as mushrooms and listen to Lord, since it's a band of trickery in Gwar!
