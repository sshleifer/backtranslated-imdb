Correct premise Very unrealistic Since I learned from this movie, it might not be a good idea to get out of the cabin at a weekend, without controlling control, after all. I love Bill automatically how to escape and without damaging the hill! Unfortunately, the same thing can not be said about the weather. Oh, and the police did not seem to ever find the owner of the car or the catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Many dragons with no scene (they still have nightmares from that scene). Bad host and generosity hand. I confess to "what" the mysterious thing to see behind the door, but when it appeared I laughed. HA HA HA HA !! The girl was really hard to be revived. Personally, I would like a new body after such an amazing experience!
