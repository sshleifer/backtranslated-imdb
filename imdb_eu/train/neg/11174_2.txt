Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Tea Leoni? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My mouth was watered. In this cable I could see this whole movie. In 30 minutes I was awake. I took 60 minutes and pressed the recording button and I slept. The next morning it was over. It would not have been a problem. What is the idea of ​​a ruined cast and an interesting story "Life in the Day ...", cure it if your insomnia is yours and watch this movie. I guarantee at least an hour and a half of constant sleep. Awesome conversation. Continuous continuity. The camera's work was done with the Super 8 handset and it looked better. <br /> <br /> This movie was a disaster.
