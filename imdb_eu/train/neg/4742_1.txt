Wow That was probably the worst DCOM. I saw the first half hour and laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy similarly, she has met friends who have decided to be a popular girlfriend and a Homecoming Queen. He thinks he must keep the world as a warrior, and Shin gives his support to his martial arts. Shin teaches the abilities of a serpent, tiger, etc., and has to learn to save worldly techniques. <br /> <br /> This film is great for children who want to learn about the martial arts and Chinese culture. But the interpretation and casting were awful. <br /> <br /> Brenda Song is a comedian actress and I can not see playing a serious role. She laughed at Shin's crying. Shin could not act in any way, and everything was incredible. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch this movie and think about something like that, and it was the thing I came with with Power Rangers. This movie is so fake and stunts that Power Ranger-skiing was so pleasing and stupid. The characters were not pleasant, and I could not see them. Disney really needs some time to make the movies decent. High School Musical is the only movie worthy of Disney Channel, including Jumping Ship, Friendship color, Go Figure, Reading and crying, and stuck in neighborhoods. <br /> <br /> If you like Action-adventure and jokes.
