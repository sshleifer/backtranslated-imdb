I went to a projection of this movie and, while making fun of me, there were great flaws. First of all, they are the humorous customs of a true divorce, trying to find love of LA. The filmmaker's love life and the history of professional life fall into disgusting, narcissistic, and imbalanced. Jokes are getting dressed up faster, and suddenly you do not like humans as you progress. It is ridiculous that the director is present at the same time as a very annoying and wrong nature and we are afraid that he will be worried.
