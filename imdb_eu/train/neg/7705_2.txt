(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I should figure it out. DVD did not even show time and time. I thought that Wild Card was the worst anime movie I've ever seen. This is much worse. It does not make sense.

That Musta got a C mail <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 1/10 Entertainment: 6/10 (until I have not finished finding it). endless <br /> <br /> unthinkable: 0/10
