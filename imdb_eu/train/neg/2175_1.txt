Carlos Mencia is constantly shouting "B! Ch!" among females "N ** ger!" It's like screams. in black, except worse. Remember that word B, unlike the word N, is the only pejorative term associated with violence every day. "B ** ch!" The last thing the women hear is that they are raped, beaten or killed before. This guy perpetuates violence by hating the language of violence. As a man who is trying to cover women with bashing, he will dress like heterosexual. And all the rumors of national whites made allegations of fascists, but while their stupid gigantic women wavered, they protested that they hated women. Tee hee hee Bet Mencia does not speak freely of them, Go, Carlos ?? Do you want women to speak freely as you want them to speak and in a second word, or do you think "free conversations" are just men's for women?
