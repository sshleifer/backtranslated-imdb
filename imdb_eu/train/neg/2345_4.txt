I saw the wind written by Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone - Robert Stack was horrible ... it was incredibly horrible ... he thought it was a charming jet race, he just came up with a joke. The plot was stupid and abominable and there were no chemicals carrying 3 "romantic" ones. Somehow, Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Although her boring external character was boring - The elder sister of Think The Splendor is the most wicked, bitter and charismatic. The director Douglas Sirk fills the cast through a dialogue with his needs through a forced interview and the final result was lost 99 minutes. Get Smart was the actor who played the lead role
