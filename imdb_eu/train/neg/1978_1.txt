It's a pathetic word. Poor performance, pathetic script, conversation cheezy and hip hop music and fashion ... what happened to that guy? The director of this movie is playing badly. Someone would have time and effort to rethink the whole thing, maybe having an opportunity. The studio is bet that they are still trying. <br /> <br /> The best Stacey Dash was in this movie ... The Asian bigpot was not bad. These too many guys took the whole movie. If there was one of them, I would destroy the copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen yet, even if you have no idea, do not waste your time ... you will regret later.
