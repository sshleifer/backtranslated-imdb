A scene from "Terminator Woman" is pretty well thought out: Karen Sheperd and another woman try to escape from the evil camp. Karen goes to the front of an armed guard, who directs his gun, but fights for a few seconds and challenges him. She throws Karen's balls, takes the gun and escapes! Once again, when a movie is directed by a martial artist and is written / produced by another member of his family, you do not have to wait too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble get an enjoyable delight at the beginning, and the movie may be better if you pay more attention to the love-hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes they are separated, slowing down the crawling of the movies, and occasionally the fight scene, promoting things, excitement. In the end, Trimble will fight Qissi in a cave and Sheperd womano-a-womano will fight against Ashley Hayden in speed, but the battle breaks its flow and reduces its value. In a positive sense, he thanked Karen for the whole film to show Karen's spectacular split! (* 1/2)
