It's not often that I see a big movie like this. I kept looking, because this template was only intended to be taken seriously for every minute. Well, as serious as this genre demands. <br /> <br /> The play was shy and the situation had a dread and trace. If we had created a movie in 1920 (for example) and we would have thought that it would have been hidden and hidden in that direction (street). As it has happened, this film was created in 2000 and I still do not have to watch the silent time that has little charm like this. <br /> <br /> Certainly not for the serious movie. /> <br /> [Not worth the score]
