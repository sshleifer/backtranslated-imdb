I did not say the movie was bad, but it was not good. I expected something good, but Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better. This was totally old. At every stage of this film, I wanted to take a tour and what did I get? The girl smokes and wins her aunt's love. <br /> <br /> In spite of being activated, they need to be authorized for all the movements they carry out. They are so shy after so many meetings. I expected that my aunt was much more brutal than that. All he cursed the cradle. <br /> <br /> Hey, we also have children, but we do not see them and we always have tears in our eyes. This movie is a dream. A happy family, a cruel woman, a good law and a man who loves death. In HAHK, Anupam Kher, the father of the poor wife, and vice versa. And somehow I knew that it would be the movie Mohnish Behl. However, I think I've lost time. I give it 2/10.
