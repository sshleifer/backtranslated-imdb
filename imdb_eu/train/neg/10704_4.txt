Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and the police stop Jack (Crackerjack). <br /> <br /> It is a B-action movie taken from other films and it's pretty good enough, a terrific plot (as always, in these films) and three fine stars. Thomas Ian Griffith Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer were terrorists. If you do not want B-action stupid movies, this is not for you.
