When I saw the movie, I loved it 11 years ago. I think directing and cinematography are excellent as well as music. But I've got more trouble with the script over time. I am dissapearing and believing in Emma Thompson's original writing; Marianne turned his side-character, a sharp second, too old, Elinor was too serious; In the film, "much different moments" are given, and they often appear to show Thompson. he. <br /> <br /> I understand how to cut several books in the book, but without leaving the scene in the book Willoughby. In the case of somebody who has long been reddened and loved before the book, they are always things that are always digested. <br /> <br /> As for actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. It's not the best script in the world, but it still works well without much emotion. Alan Rickman is great, maybe a bit old, but with a beautiful role. And Elizabeth Spriggs, is as wonderful as ever.
