Okay, I saw the original French version. But I can not imagine it better with subtitles. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the movie I've seen for a long time is boring. There is virtually no treatment for this film. That's why I can not understand all the positive reviews. In a sense they could be realistic, but some real stories can not be written. Tarkovsky's Solaris is very slow, but allows introspection, for example, the atmosphere of the movie. But in this case, the movie is presented with a huge dialogue that can be said about all the characters. I did not identify or care for anything. I thought a lot of scenes: "When did they close"? The performance was pretty bad. It is not in a clear and excessive way. But it seems that the actors do not care for their characters, and they seem to want to be everywhere else. This could be due to the conversation dialogue that could give you. Also, the entire film flow was very mechanical. Scene from one to the other. It seems that the movie was written (wrong) but it is never correct. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that does not emit an emotional response from one scene. There is no surprise, no fear, no budget, no sadness, no introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest in interest.
