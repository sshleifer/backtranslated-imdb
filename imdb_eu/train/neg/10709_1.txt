I can not think much about this movie. <br /> <br /> This was a horrible movie ... I can not tell what he saw me. Who knows how to start, I do not know how to scratch the little quality. <br /> <br /> An impossible and absurd soil moved to a nonsense. My whole body was tense during the duration of the film, I did not wait until this great thing was over and it ended. At the end of the movie, I felt open. <br /> <br /> The edition was bad, the performance was sub-par, and the story was weak. Francoise Robinson was named an American American, although it resembles American heritage. <br /> <br /> If this movie is stupid, it should be laughably stupid, at least. It was not. It was pathetic.
