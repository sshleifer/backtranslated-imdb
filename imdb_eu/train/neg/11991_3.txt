- Bad thing: this movie is a real shit. For a good stunts I thought it was so fake that it was "Twilight Zone". Flashbacks are quite unknown. He thinks that part of a movie that is thinking of getting out of a movie window will make life better. I want to know the director of the casting and if it was high, the play, the adults were also horrible. He also absorbed the scene of the movie. This movie killed the book. The book was excellent. I do not recommend this film. Not for educational purposes too. <br /> <br /> - Good things: I do not know what I can really say. There are parts of the suspense, but they quickly cut actors and dramas. <br /> <br /> - My verdict: do not see.
