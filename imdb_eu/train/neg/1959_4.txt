Tooth Fairy is a deformed old friend about the ghost of an old man, a reward for children to get home, with her loose tooth and later life. In the first few minutes you start the fairy tale of the 1949 teeth and then change to the present day. It's sold out on horror plot with strong actors. They could do without Hammond brothers and other scenes, but overall the gore scenes were bloody but fast, which had a lesser effect. Eye candy are pretty good for both sexes. The camera's work is good. The conversation is fair, but cheesy. I expected empty movies, small budgets, with few spare factors. I was surprised by the quality of the film.
