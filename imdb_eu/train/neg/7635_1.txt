Variety's review is totally in favor, the film never looks so funny, lively or creative, it seems to justify its premise. It is mixed with narration and the lighting is very problematic. If the character is directed by character characters, poor lighting is not acting and, sometimes, it is difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors. Many South Africans will not be able to follow the English word in the film and will lose local humor in that process. I watched the movies last year at Cape Town World Cinema. The comments and reactions in the film were impossible and it was welcomed by the film of the painful past. Unfortunately Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the brightest lights in the new South African Wave, but some of the most prominent films on our apartheid history are the best in the history of the 110th annual Festival. It's not surprising that after two weeks of disappearing movies in Cape Town cinemas, and in most cinemas in Durban and Gauteng. There is a limited appeal among South African audiences.
