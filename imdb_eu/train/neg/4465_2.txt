Amenabar and Balaguero's worst hits, as a horror movie in Spain, emerged as an ill-fated world of horror movies. The result is in movies like El segundo nombre, a badly-written TV production, but it's even worse. I did not read Ramsey Campbell's book, but I'm sure The Doll Who's Door Mother did not notice much about this awesome product. Avoid at any cost if you do not look for a quiet night in a new movie theater. 2/10
