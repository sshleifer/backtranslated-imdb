"It's similar to that big mechanical toy," he said at the beginning, a comment by a character "Jaws". Well, the "Blood Surf" beast wants to be as compelling as the shark of the "Jaws" series. In other words, the digital effects of this film are TERRIBLE. Playing and correcting is not much better; It looks more like a horror movie than a deodorant or chewing gum. The attitude of people who have worked in this film is not only contempt for the genre, but also for the public. We're just saying that this movie was "liked", just as filmmakers encourage more dogs, because it destroys the horror genre. (* 1/2)
