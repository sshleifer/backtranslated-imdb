By reviewing this movie as a weekend warrior, in July, August and September 1971, I can only take my experiences in this place in Fort Polk (Louisiana). Take High Ground as I did not remember basic training. <br /> <br /> But remember that this post korea was sucking at that time, but it was a conventional war as we met. Vietnam was not a war in the jungle war. In it the secretary continued to finish everything. The draft of that era was not welcome, but it was still accepted as a defense of that country. The film is about one of its cycles of training and is about the male in the stomach to train. In the past decade you will find the usual way of getting around all the war movies. <br /> <br /> I'm going to get some good things. MGM told us that his army was now integrated, because William Hazard was a black collecting group selected. The spirit of the time was changing. <br /> <br /> But I will tell you that a collection like Russ Tamblyn would be healed from his intelligent mouth the first day. Richard Widmark would not risk his death or would turn him into Jerome Courtland's confidence in a weapon. And in no case would he not be worried about the demise of Robert Arthur. Parliamentary has left an agreement with him. <br /> <br /> Of course, Fort Shakes and El Paso and around Texas and Texas have filmed Take the High Ground with authenticity. But watch out for an army as a hiring movie, and you can surely understand why the government cooperated with the government every day. <br /> <br /> I remind you that you can pick up small whistling drills. You were not worried that your case was just about 95% of all the time. But there is no way that Karl Malden would open the lead in front of some of the preparations that were open to him. They would both realize that they would weaken the authority, something that something military would not know about. <br /> <br /> I would like to say something better about Take The High Ground, because I'd definitely like to have his talents thrown out. The talented director Richard Brooks, as well as the stupid issue of Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, before an Oscar before High Noon. The film was nominated for Best Screenplay and Best Screenplay by Millard Kaufman. Kaufman's imagination was to be lively.
