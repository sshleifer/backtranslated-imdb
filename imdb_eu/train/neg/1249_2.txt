What despair, above all, the budget, the available technical resources and the talented colleagues. Science fiction / drama is not a fundamental rule for audiences to create an unexpected suspension. POA 2001 creates disbelief at the beginning, as we were bleeding, but later, Mr. Burton forgets that his filmmakers forget that they work their own brain. Helena Bonham Carter's Chinese libertarian, with no blockage of humans, ease of escape, special cavalry skills (astronaut and primitive human primitive group), massive and direct human rebellion is incredibly incredible. Mark Wahlberg is never afraid of any project, reversing fear, danger or future sense around the world. Compare the original, because the naked babe of Chuck Heston captured metaphorically the rounds of events for his unprotected and surprising. Uniform Wahlberg maintains his humility, but also a sense of apparent management and control, in a situation where he is born, and we are never wondering about his welfare. Unlike Heston, he will never be in danger. Tim Burton had to use some f / x quotes to make the script works. In fact, after this smaller fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood producers have never been worried about the threads to the scriptwriters and the directors. Walk A well-prepared monkey could do it as well as the Apes Plan of 2001. I will bet that the display of repetitions of that bet will not exist. It could be a new franchise, and a wonderful new step in the imagination. Another option is lost.
