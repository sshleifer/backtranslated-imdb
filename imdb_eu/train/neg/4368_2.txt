Alpha has been on the DVD market, and Boris Karloff's fans (very much like those) have just been put. It's not a horror movie, but it's a drama that is a scientist who has agreed to die for a wealthy Boris woman to get her wealth. When the deceased victim changes his will and leaves his spouse, all deceased is dissolved. <br /> <br /> Karloff finds it quite enjoyable to be selfish and selfish, and some performances are mistakenly ridiculous (especially the elderly Mona Goya, as a woman who is totally immersed in her tone). <br /> <br /> But follow very carefully.
