In the first glance, impression flaxploitation seems to be flexible and has moments in that direction. However, the basic idea is far stronger than expected and is a respectable effort to represent the racial problems of World War II. Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor, and Billy Dee Williams have won the Best Subcontractors Award. Stephen Boyd, however, stays with his mustache that could turn the tree into hateful stars. <br /> <br /> The small budget, of course, is not consistent in production values. The locations are large, the effects and weak actions. Imagine half the dying "soldier Ryan", because Vin Diesel's Caparzo (although not similar) can not handle the effects, but Hanks, Damon and Burns flip each other. In a jeep and five Germans shot at the top. However, the rumor, which heroic soldiers do not respect for their achievement, which are black and that is done by Boyd's racist captain, is credible, as well as the sequences written by Turman in his own beliefs. soldiers were able to fight instead of throwing lines. <br /> <br /> In short, the "Black Brigade / Carter Army" is not quite successful. But the failure is respectable, not a bad joke. It can be renewed as a very good film, and yet it is an interesting effort.
