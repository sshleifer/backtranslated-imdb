I'm a great fan of Stooges, but Curley is the only one that is the only quality feature of this film. Before starting drinking for a long time, he's a classic car (and Larry is not bad either). Moe is a direct part of the character (especially) and this film would be called "The Curley and Larry Movie". Stooges is not a very good film (I think), but as the comments mentioned here, how sad this movie really was. He was good casting, well-directed, filmed and edited, but some storyline lines were stooges about the antics and music numbers (which I think were good then). Do yourself yourself in this movie, if you really think it's better to cut meadow than grass, and get rid of rubbish (which is controversial) to wait for Curley / Larry scene and sleep or find something in the kitchen. the rest
