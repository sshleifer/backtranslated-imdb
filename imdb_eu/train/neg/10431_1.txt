I loved the first season. The quality of the game fell slightly in the second season, but it had an excellent center (Pegasus!). The third season was quite new and original and it was fine. The fourth season began to decline rapidly, since they never gave an explanation, when we needed them. What the hell was Cylon flat? Why were two Cylon factions? What was the fleet that directed Angel-Kara ships destroying Earth 1? Which past five Cylon had past, and how did they last, or were they not over again? Answer everywhere, no answer. <br /> <br /> And then comes to the end. Earth-2 (our Earth) in the past. Well, okay But to destroy the fleet? Leave technology and renounce any city life and spread thousands of people to the bottom of the planet? This is not anti-science only, anti-reason and anti-life. Then, the philosophy of the show seems to be human permanently in nature from Romanticism to the A.I. a devastating capitalist society that devises devastating. it ruins everything. Without an eye, without a future of humanity, without hope, science is a fictional antithesis. And do not be angry with angels too! The worst religion hat! Last disappointment! <br /> <br /> "Everything that happens and will happen again" should link everything with the previous series relationship, not just as we know Earth. When the new show is consistent with the old one, it would be a definitive genius blow. Fucking shit <br /> <br /> 10/10.
