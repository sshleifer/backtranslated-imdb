All logic runs from the train window in this horror movie underground London underground, and Franka Potente (Run Lola Run) is usually trusted, Franka plays a businesswoman who catches her from a party at the office. He is sleeping in a subway station, he wakes up and is only locked and "someone" or "something" continues to run away with the assassin's intentions. <br /> <br /> Plots holes and credibility are abundant and at the moment there are very few really eminent / scary, but many are boring. <br /> <br /> An inadequate film that must be sworn in must always be locked in the ground and everyone has gone. <br /> <br /> Only the best improvement in the popular actor Ken Campbell, better than this? This is also included in "Erasmus Microman".
