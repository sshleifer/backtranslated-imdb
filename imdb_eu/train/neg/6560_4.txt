"Shadrach" was not my favorite type of film. I found too much feeling and was less than the theater. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good, but other actors were not credible. I also do not think Paul's parents would go away and leave with Dabney, especially when they had a homemaker. Their social classes were incredibly disenchanted. Dabney's life seemed to be excessive. There was a scene when Andie MacDowell stopped her with a car at the beginning of the movie. Who was it? His son What was the stage to show? Why is the scene included? He had nothing to do with the rest of the film and was not mentioned again. It seemed to him free and there was no connection with the story. There were many contradictions for me. Shadrac's story was nice, but I was not sure how good and generous portraying Dabneys would be.
