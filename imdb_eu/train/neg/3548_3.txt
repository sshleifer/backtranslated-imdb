For those who like malicious characters and cunning movies, this is for you! The atmosphere in New York is a terrific atmosphere, almost as a hope, in front of a large number of people with little sense of morality, this movie is real. <br /> <br /> Because he won the Academy Award because he was astonishing at that time, Hollywood wanted to celebrate his freedom because he wanted to show all the moral codes he had abandoned. The filmmakers were similar to an old six year old child, there was an unlimited amount of local candy stores. So, Hollywood is likely to be appealing to theatrical viewers (probably the first time), rape, prostitution, homosexuality, nudity, homeless, homeless, and other sounds and fascinating sounds. <br /> <br /> I am also sure to satisfy the main audiences. Well, he got that level. The audience was surprised at what they were saying and listening to, and the Academy, proud of himself as being able to show off dirt and earn money, could not honor his gold on that rubbish. <br /> <br /> Fortunate years ago, since it was very young, this movie also seemed fascinate to me. However, in the 90's I saw the taste in my mouth again, I had never seen it again. <br /> <br /> The effect was good, but what? Playing in different movies is good. He never said that Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight could not act. Hoffman was particularly good when he forgot about people in his younger days. He was like Johnny Depp of that time, he played boys like "Ratso Rizzo" and later "Rain Man". Yes, "Ratso" is a character that you will never forget, and "Joe Buck" (Voight) is one of those that you want to forget, but the story is so sordid that it surpasses the good performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is not "art", and it's not worth a lot of its prizes; In 1969, he promoted a single envelope in 1969, which is why he remembers film in the hearts of people and critics. Two blind and ultra-hot hours, rich religious backgrounds, are horrific scars (Andy Warhol also plays, it's not surprising), and in general shameless people. <br /> <br /> I like the song "Everybody's Talking" Harry Nilsson was famous but it was fake because Fred Neil had heard and heard the song before, before Nilsson ... and few people like Neil (that is to say, his loss). And - as we have mentioned - the name "Ratso Rizzo" remains with you! <br /> <br /> The film is a milestone, but I'm afraid of the negative sense: Hollywood was Hollywood "functional". Since the toilet has dropped and it has been kept in the sewers.
