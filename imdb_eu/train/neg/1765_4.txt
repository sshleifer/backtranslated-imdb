OK - helicopter shots are great, and the director has used some of Barcelona's most important places. Otherwise, the value of production was awakened in the first minutes and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was so charming and fun to watch, Abel Folk was the deepest and most effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He got the chance to use his martial arts training properly, and he was a serious jumping-racer. The rest cast was wood, especially on paper. So if you're nostalgic about Spain - it's a picture postcard with a photo of the action and El Greco is a healthy dose. Otherwise, skip.
