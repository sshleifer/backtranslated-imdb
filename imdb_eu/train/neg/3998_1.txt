Do you say "all shock, no plot"? There was not so much to explore in this direction in this film. There was no room near the deaths. * Why was the wicked? What's the way Why is the "by-hour" countdown? Then there were no unexplored things suggested; For example, * we saw a camera in the airwind, and he mentioned. However, when the rumor rose, there was no camera. <br /> <br /> What happens when all the ghosts look like "digital" and do things "wink" before static noise on the ground? Hmmm ... When you put all these things together, 1408 looks like a large-sized home appliance. No follow-up. <br /> <br /> Oh ... by the way ... electronics do not work 1408. Well, except television ... the phone does not signal, but the wireless internet works fine. How many more can you add? Sorry, this movie is just a shock after shock. All this has been done before. Mirror clutter Things out of space Painting change. Hemorrhagic intestines. "Oh, it was just a dream ... it was not". And, if the room was "wicked", why would you tell us about the death of our eldest daughter, if it was constantly caught? It just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is no background information about "Write the first book". "It was merely blurry about the father's information," and so on. Talking about fatherhood, what happened to the father? "You'll be in my place". <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is really painful. 100% adrenaline was a blow factor with no new or innovative effects, and certainly the background story, character development, etc. <br /> <br /> My overall impression is the whole movie "Cheap"; Much more with a set and a couple of locations, and there was nothing more than just a movie effect, recycle, cheesy, "see-ahead" effects on the film.
