... He has chosen this one. First, the movie was not horrible, it was Hollywood. The worst case - this is a must-have non-movie scenario: Willis's mission was to save the doctor, but he assured that his "people" was outside the mission. He would have put him to the first murderer and take refugees to the border without him. He did not endanger his package for refugees. That's not how it works. But, as I have emphasized, it's Hollywood, we need drama. That's why we make films, reality is not so difficult. However, I thought Willis and the good doctor were good chemistry. That said, there are well-fought scenes in the movie. It's not a waste of time, it's worth the "Dreams of the Sun" dvd rental. Look in a rainy day and you'll be glad.
