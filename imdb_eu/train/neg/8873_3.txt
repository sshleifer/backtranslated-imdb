Did anyone stop the movie they produced? Now let the former navy officer pursue a group of cadet school, so it should be a family comedy?

This could be the clock in the most amazing moment, but I found Damon Wayans to insult his voice with no credibility. Does it speak in real life? If he does that, he has my sympathy, but he will not get my money by watching his movies
