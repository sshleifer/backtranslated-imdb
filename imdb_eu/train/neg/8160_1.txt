and not in a fun way. it's bad It's amazing that people put positive things here. The story is sucked, the performance is bad, it's not scary, the special effects are not special ... oh! he pulls the slate out of his hands! oh gee - the mirror has become water! 50's hair, clothes and makeup are not exactly accurate, and a man has gotten rid of hair on his back to play in a bachelor's degree. That is, later, in the streets of the elms, it's like a nightmare. I like to watch some horror movies as good as anyone, but there are a lot of bad options to choose from.
