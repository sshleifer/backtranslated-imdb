There are 2 good things to say about "fantasies" (above mentioned reviewers): <br /> <br /> a) Bo Derek's stunning and inspiring beauty. This movie has been filmed by Catherine Zeta Jones, who is running for her money, which is very encouraging. Its nudity is short and discreet, but it's enough to look at your face. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another Greek island setting, sun and transparent waters. Therefore, there is no story, the conversation is abysmal and sometimes it is unfortunately funny ("You're touched by your wife!"), And Peter Hoot's character is a bit jerk. Bo increases the character of his character, but as well as working again in the conversation, it is wrong to blame the actor ("Damir" is said to be a great irritation in almost every phrase). Oh, and if the movie is set on a Greek island, there's hardly any need to hear a Greek word. It seems there everyone, children and the elderly, speak English all the time. (*)
