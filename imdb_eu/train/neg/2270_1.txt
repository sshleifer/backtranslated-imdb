The only thing that has been avoided by vomiting after watching this movie is just the actress, and not the show that usually appears on TV. That's why TV fans do not like the main reason for the movie, but it's not the only reason. This movie has a great value for recreation as a way to get the roots. He gets closer to the deep depths of bad films and then gets worse. I describe this movie I will not describe more time; It's enough to say that they had seen the camera for the first time, the poor people who had to endure.
