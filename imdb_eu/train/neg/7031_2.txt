When watching this movie, Vampyres watched me, I thought I had to pick up this guy (Larroz), I apologized for being in a hidden / satanic movie at the bottom. With sex and single sex (with actors and ugly actors, this is a pretext of sleaze, the only established factor was the setting and the only atmosphere, avoiding this, too much abuse, it is not worth the effort to find, this is what it is. I await other Vampyres films, Oh, and the goat scene has been very boring, I understand that's what the hype carries.
