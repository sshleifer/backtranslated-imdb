In Denmark, in 1969, a drama sentimental school established "We Shall Overcome" offers a pathetic domain in the United States culture domain. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), obsessed with the power of flowers, naive 13-year-old, hanging in his ear hangs with a violent master Lindum-Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Lindum-Svendsen, the school director, depicted as a tyrant fascistoid, controls the local community. Lindum-Svends has gone so far, and with his father, with his recovery against headaches (surely, there is not enough drama), and Svale music teacher is stereotyped too ('Hi, call me Freddie'). Frits defends justice. <br /> <br /> What do you say? It's so annoying that it's an exaggeration (method), and so full of misfortunes, as a "family" image, that grotesque that fills up a movie excuses to convince non-Scandinavian audiences unhurriedly. Sorry, a pretty Danish reader, so I missed your sentimental trips ... But, definitely, NOTHING is "becoming a boy in the fight against the system." The boy is never a man, but his terrible eyes are still big eyes. If you name a church in a small village, if the cartoon character "system" dictates a dictator, I feel that something is missing me. <br /> <br /> If you enter your family photos, see Happy Feet instead ...
