As if wearing a shirt. Without a doubt, it is definitely the worst film ever. Pure torture Zero out of ten. The other scene is long, boring, arduous, daring, conscious, theater, and increasingly. It is intended to be dreams and impressionists, the soul discarded it. <br /> <br /> Twins naked, my father and son intertwine each other with each other lovingly. The "Homo-erotic" is clearly the point. Okay, and what? <br /> <br /> The son repeatedly repeated the "Holy Life" line, "Crucify the love of the Father, the dear son, he is crucified." Along with God and his son, the parallelism of Christ is heavy, unimportant and compassionate, as here. <br /> <br /> Some references refer to the subject of Russian filiation: "Mother and Son" (1997); "Return" (Andrei Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "Father and son"; and, of course, Dostoyevsky, "brothers Karamazov." <br /> <br /> The credits given in English indicate the purpose of international distribution, the excuse that Russian can not be used to understand this mess. <br /> <br /> This Sokuroven "Russian Ark" (2003) is as strong or compelling as the last "Ark" of Sokuroven. <br /> <br /> Like his "Mother and Son", it is equally powerful and offensive. Some of the scenes are filmed by mirrors, but not so interesting. The film is almost monochromatic, shot from the beginning shot by glass filters, which makes it so rough. A side focus adds not only to feeling confused. <br /> <br /> An annoying soundtrack on the drone, it never stops, like ribbon loops. An old radio plays constantly on the back. Russian melancholic romanticism is constantly evolving as "themes based on Tchaikovsky". The presence of a "sound designer" (Sergei Moshkov) means, of course, that revolutionary little sounds, static radio, noises, distortions and others are "designed". <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that someone (Sergei Potepolov) has actually written. It seems as arbitrary as traffic as if the bored actors had improvised it, nowhere to get involved. <br /> <br /> Modern art has finally been able to express this thing as a result of this; the idea of ​​the idea, as an empty shell, but not a shell, but the idea of ​​a shell. Is not it possible to ask for better definition of decadence?
