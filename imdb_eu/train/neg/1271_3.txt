This movie could last for 15 minutes, if it were not for all the conflict between son and father. Predictive Both male "stars" need a good face! Do you want cheese with this "joke"? Two chuckles ... and headache. I understand why he has left his mother for 47 years after his brother ... I do not know how long he survived! The first 5 minutes I wanted to turn off the movie, I never paid $ 3.99. The movie did not work well and it was long. I continued to watch the clock that could fly faster ... It's not. The script had so many repetitions that the writer had to make it easy to fill the space. In a positive note ... the landscape was beautiful, being my favorite season. The car, Ford was also quite pretty. This movie gets D's value
