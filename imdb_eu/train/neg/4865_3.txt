I can not just enjoy this movie. But then, I loved Babe, a town pig and I spoiled, in all great ways, well-made animal films. The animals were not pleasant. Chris Rock's Guinea pig was totally angry, but what I expected was Chris Rock. I think I've been smiling sometimes or twice in some nice lines, but that's it.
