I can not believe that this movie was ever created. I think the director wants to become artistic points, but that is worse. Shallows seem to have applied too much eye makeup. Zombies are only in a few minutes movie. In the end, maybe five or six zombies are a total, it certainly is not a nation. The best part of the film, if any, is undoubtedly credit, because the painful experience has finally ended. If you want to confirm comments from other users, the priestly thrones are strange and they do not make any sense in the film. Also, a snake and a scene does not make sense is a Romanian scene. He never explains.
