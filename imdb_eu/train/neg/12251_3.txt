Oh, CGI. Blessing when used correctly. Those who do a sin do not use it. Unfortunately, it's not so badly used in this Jaws rip-off. <br /> <br /> Well, anyone who has read a number of my publications has probably noticed two things. 1: I like little budget horror movies. And 2: if you're a pretty little boy in a low-budget movie, I point out. So let's just let's do this right now. I do not like a little budget horror film. The play, in most cases, is horrible, a dangerous effect, and the script plays Battlefield Earth competitors as the worst thing this year. As for the resident's boyfriend Dax Miller (Bog), he has won the prize. The boy is hot! And, surprisingly, it's not just a dirty body, nice eyes and slow buttocks ... really act (well, as much as this bad movie). When we send homework, let's continue. <br /> <br /> In the version of Cliff Notes, here is the story (do not worry, I'll try to do anything) ... <br /> <br /> A group of movies travels to a remote island with surfing with sharks to shoot a documentary about two surfers. There is a large crocodile saltwater that is hidden around the island. Croc shows that Mayhem is created and people eat it. Final credits for translation. <br /> <br /> As I said before, this film has quite a few bumps. He started well, but soon he became stupid and stupid. One of the main characters becomes a meal (quite fun), and our other heroes give victims a victim's expense. Likewise, this crockery is at the top of the earth and aquatic food chain, what about sharks? If this thing can be eaten from a 40-foot boat, I do not think that there will be any skull shark. FX is one of the worst I've ever seen. CGI is horrible, and even more have got shocked by animatronic crocs. Attention, filmmakers. National Geographic. Discovery Store. Croc Hunter. They look like crocodiles. Of course, you do not mention one of them at the end of the movie as seen by the monstrosity. And what is a pirate / medication druggist? Did you need another reason to get rid of the top of a woman? <br /> <br /> It's funny how we get little sub-genres of the movie. With Alligator and its tracking, Lake Placid, Crocodile and now Blood Surf, it seems that "big-crocodile / large alligator" movies get their category in Blockbuster. Alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I thought Tobe Hooper's crocodile was good. Blood Surf, sucked. <br /> <br /> My grade: D-
