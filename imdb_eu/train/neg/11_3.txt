If you see this information on Corey Large on IMDb, it is producing a movie called "Reload" (June 2008), a character named Sebastian Cole. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, what a great movie has ever achieved ... and the second, Sebastian is not killed at the end of "Loaded"? <br /> <br /> I saw this when I saw it in the morning when I was fighting against Insomnia, and so I went in while it came out. I am sure that the plot has lost some points, but overall it seemed very weak. Large movies (for me) was one of the strongest parts of the movie. Also, I am surprised by the comments on beautiful girls, because I thought the actress Brooke was nice, but it was not sensible.
