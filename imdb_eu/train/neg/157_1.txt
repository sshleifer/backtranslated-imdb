Ok, first of all, the video seems to have shot in the 80's. When published in 2001, I was surprised to find out. Secondly, the plot was in the whole place. If it was a preview or a short introduction, the story would be better. I also value fantasy, but this movie was too much. It was beautiful and badly shot. The scenes did not go well and they were strange figures. It was difficult to follow, and maybe it was a translation, but it was hard to understand. I love Chinese epic films, but if you're looking for a fantasy Chinese fantasy movie, I'd recommend the promise (amazing vision, interesting plot and good character). Be very disappointed.
