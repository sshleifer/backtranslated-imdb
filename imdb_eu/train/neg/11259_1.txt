I gave it to this film 1. I can not understand Ettore Scola, one of the greatest Italian film directors, such a movie, so stupid and ridiculous! All the stories of people involved in the film are not essential, boring, and not interesting. Too boring The only things that I have saved in this film are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. I hope that Scola will change the subject and style that will change her next film.
