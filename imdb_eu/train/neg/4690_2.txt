This British film is horrible, and it's hard to believe that it's in Glenn Ford, even though it is quite sleepy. It's a good idea for a bomb in a train ... but, as a result, the train ends with the most parked movie! It is not action, motion, just a static train. The area parked with the train is evacuated, so there will be no danger to anyone. In fact, this film can be used in a cinema class to show how to make a suspense film. The real suspension is to disclose the things you do not know about the people, which is unknown to the director. SPOILER: The train really has two bombs, but we think it's the only one. After undoing the first bomb, there seems to be no reason to see more films. At the last minute, he shows both criminals with no apparent motive for his actions. Also, we are not surely going to get the bombs, so we do not even have a classic ticking sequence. With 10 minutes or more, Glenn Ford's wife will continue to think of French, and then asks where she is. The character is so annoying that it does not matter if we reconcile with it or not, so that when done, there is nothing emotional. Most of the other characters are unidentified and have no problems or problems. It's just 72 minutes, but it's too long because it's boring and sad. Do not waste your time.
