I love Batman series and I really expect it for that. But they wanted to do too much. <br /> <br /> Why were Adam West's story and Burt Ward trying to get a batmobile up for me? I do not see paths that look like Burt or Adan now ... 35 years since they appeared in Batman and Robin, but I wanted to see it dressed in costume and "fight" with the "jokes". I'd rather see the old stars commented. Batmobile's side story was stupid. <br /> <br /> Regarding the flashback, I think it was too short and too much. In my opinion, it was just a quick overview. I would like more backgrounds. They showed me about Penguin and Joker for about a minute, to tell me the same thing. Joker had a stick under the makeup and had to burn the penguins, although he hated and was a former smoker. That was 2. <br /> <br /> I'd like to read the book. He has shown a lot more. Why were 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman or 3 Mister Freezes? Where was Gordon Commissioner, Cheif OH, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, etc. The list goes on. As I said, those who were there were not there. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. And really nice.
