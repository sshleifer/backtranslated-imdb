Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> There are really few "really bad" movies, and Zombi 3 is not bad, unfortunately, it's undeniable. bad in so many ways, as it could be necessary to describe the entire language <br /> <br /> More than one, it is a movie included in Lucio Fulci, despite its standards, that it has absolutely no coherence, sense or reason. . However, we can not blame Fulci for not actually directing himself, but Bruno Mattei does not help Fulci to get the sense of style in the film. Mattei seems to have brought a small movie, but an amazing ineptitude. <br /> <br /> So, I am ashamed to say how many Zombi 3 does not have in every valuable minute. In terms of thin characters, weak stories and the ability to make movies, Zombi 3 takes the boat but it is more fun than Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> "Action" begins "Death 1". The gas is stolen from a military base and damaged by a fleet. Who is the robber, why did he steal it, and why did the US military believe that creating cannibalistic legions of living dead would be a good idea? All these questions and more are not answered in Zombi 3. <br /> <br /> After hiding in a hotel, the infected thief crazy when they attack a green plasticine that grows on his face. who decides that nonsensical weapons are the best way to throw away the corpse, which will lead to the atmospheric "Death 1" ... zombie birds! Who attacks people and turns zombies into people !!! (If the zombies are cannibals, why do not zombies attack other birds?) <br /> <br /> Then we will discover our "heroes", the triumphant GI trio and the training of girls. Others are also with them, but they are not important, no one is important here. Anyone can remember your face, leave the name or reason to look after it. They are finally hiding in the same hotel as a robber ("a week ago this place was living, it was alive now!") But it's not a run away from the dead. <br /> <br /> By doing this, you can absorb the point completely or turn off the wrong thing. The script is so huge that the world's greatest performances could not be saved; So the worst thing is - and not just the characters of humans, the zombie is a very low time here. There is no way of how zombies behave - they have been thought of in style in time, others charge fists or iron, without even mentioning all the zombies that can still be spoken (for the film, which is THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DIRECTION). They wipe their wings on the chest (over their heads), and they also get rid of the good left hook. How can you punch a zombie ??? !!!!! Actually, the action of the 80s is hardly underlined because it looks like a part of V ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < those who are poor. sweating will go through and it will get scared of his life. They also hide in shrubs, garages, shacks, roofs, water, and pregnant women. At one point, a zombie continues a woman on the stairs. Kill and eat No! To enter the water, these zombies and the nonsense of humor! <br /> <br /> There is a lot of gore. White bodies are exchanged, wounds are green pus, and there are a lot of flesh eating and faces are mushed. There is nothing matching the original eye piercing, but the wrong ingredients your bag will not let you down. <br /> <br /> All of this, and I do not even mention music, that is, an incomprehensible head of the zombie-hegemony, that the scientist really is doing what is really bad, or the last joke ... Zonbi's original radio- In a simple twist on the resort, Zombi 3 gives us a zombie DJ! "He went to his side!" The cry of our fugitives, before continuing to fight against the dead, unfortunately never came. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 is rough, world losses would not be destroyed by each form and all the registries of existence have been erased, but somehow I have said that when I saw my life richer. <br /> <br /> Did I say it was richer? Approximately 88 minutes ...
