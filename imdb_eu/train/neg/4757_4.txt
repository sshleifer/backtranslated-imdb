I've seen Sleuth (1972) with the two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier long ago. Michael Caine is back, but now she loves her husband and Jude Law. The story is still the same and it is a wonderful play. <br /> <br /> I always had a movie to watch a play. This is not a remake of a classic, I do not like it. When I watched the movie, I adapted a movie to watch a movie and not just a theater that I still should feel. The director Kenneth Brannigan made wonderful films in the past, but this time he lost. Another reason was the appearance of the movie. The design was modern, elegant and uncomfortable and cold. I have never felt a person living in the house. The picture was not bad, but the lightning was awful. Sometimes it was dark blue, dark and green, which was not eye-catching. <br /> <br /> The effect was really good. Michael Caine and Jude Law give their best. I'd really like to see these two stages playing together. But I must admit that I have never been a fan of Jude Law. The weakest part was in the middle. I remember, originally, that this part was very mysterious and very wonderful. I saw it twice and I always slept in the middle. The end section is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not horrible, but it seems that a critic is more than the viewer. Sleuth (1972) is a much more entertaining than masterpiece and Sleuth (2007).
