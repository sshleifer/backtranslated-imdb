Wow I have recently felt the need to comment on the movies, but this is a must for beatdown. Let's get started from the beginning. First of all, writer and director Susan Montford, Kim Basinger, places him in a tired old victim with a compulsory miscarriage and suburban sadness. Let's say right now that the content of this dull movie is almost completely annoying. The pathetic attempt at Symbolism in Montford reaches Christmas trees without stars without stars. <br /> <br /> With a Christmas night offering a dark and disturbing night, Della is angry at someone else's commercial night-time shopping cart. He decides to do something about it, so he misses the car in the car's windshield. The next fifteen minutes of the film will be Della, going through the shopping center. When he finally arrives at his car, the rumors face the warning, the police kill him and run and catch him and he flees and they have more behind, and again and again. Everything is completely predictable and implausible. Thugs are not scary or threatening, and they all come together as usual. <br /> <br /> This is one of these films, in which all actions depend on the nature of the characters. You can think of stupid ones. They just do not want to kill girls so they're just waiting for me to knock myself with the tires iron. And once, only once, in this movie, is it the last leader to die? What do you care about when they are perceived individually when they are completely identical? A large part of the film is just about walking through the woods of Lukas Haas, "Della !!!" And Joy Division is insulting the soundtrack of this nasty movie. <br /> <br /> A part of the computer keyboard that really executed Della, exhausted and hurt, when he cried out in the sky, "Where are you, God?" Where is it when the movie was about to be a god? Due to cinematography and lighting, I give 2 and not as bad as 'BTK Killer', the latest brand to evaluate any horrible movie. Cheers!
