If I got into a movie like this, I did not want to entertain anything I expected to die ... I got even less what I got. He is in a Santa Claus suit. Frightening, stairs up and cuts herself. The story begins 33 years later and Harry Stalling is a normal habit of your day ... because it's obsessed with Santa. After delighting the boss, he fools, wearing dresses like Santa and does not begin to die the believer and his prince. A quarter of the pioneers will get to him and, as they will, he will take his vans off the cliff ... to the moon. I have not seen the best ending, but it was the original. <br /> <br /> The movie was slow and boring, except for apeshyt in the face of Harry's lack of quality people. There were almost no gore and even the "sex" scene was tuned to them. <br /> <br /> Very boring ... 10 out of 10
