AntiTrust Rachael could be Leigh Cook's great career, but the director cut off his best scenes. They were in the scenes, it's just a zombie. The plot of "Get Carter" is included in a similar plot, but it is better managed by the "Get Carter" sub-plot (I'm guilty of the director) The director's Hitchcock tribute was wonderful. (The scene is: Ryan Philippe thinks he may not be able to realize the trusted character of Tim Robbin, I think he's paying homage to Hitchcock, at least, it shows DVD scenes cut out, the director thinks he should have confidence and trust. listen to public tests.
