I never thought I had shot a shot when I watched Tarzan before watching the movie. Unfortunately, I must say I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 and overweight. I did not imagine that Tarzan looked like it. And although it was not a tea cup, Tarzan never gave his usual gesture. Also, Tarzan was missing out on the trees - he jumped from the vine to the vineyard. <br /> <br /> Well, so much for hope. However, Jane was there - Cheeta monkey was there. There was a pretty guitar there. There were evil and good and love ... very harmful and predictable. Nothing is bad, you understand, but nothing good. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie to present in Tarzan: 4/10
