* Can someone say COMEDIA ?? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedian (Thomas Haden Church) that feels so weak (with it!), and the whole thing is so bold! <br /> <br /> * They made a comic book live, what was a horrible nightmare cartoon and was not it fun? Plan like bathroom scene; His cinematic imagination was so good, but nothing more ... except PAIN! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ?? The stone with his daughter ??! <br /> <br /> * In fact, they did this job and only made money, but when that crime was made, money would be so much that Art was so deceived by us so much that it was taking away from us and all entertainment did not have any entertainment ! <br /> <br /> * Well, I'd say it would be the best product and Brando. Gold Years with a REAL Star. <br /> <br /> <br /> * Sheen's family here. Note that! <br /> <br /> * Loving anyone who enjoyed this movie or -God Forbid- admiring it! Then, you must go directly to the therapy when you become more dangerous and hurt others before! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) is definitely a genius, but it's not a movie! And he did not have the intention of staying here after being sure! But the main problem is that nobody else has ever tried or wanted to try to be a little or no good. (Sorry for crying now! Film torture is incredible!). <br /> <br /> * There is a scene (Brando) (Mira Sorvino) with footwear! That was realistic! Maybe he was thinking of himself being punished for himself! <br /> <br /> * A million time: this may be better (or worse!). The script, until the train agitation, was pleasant and I just imagined that they would run away like another (Smokey and Bandit), but (Brando) as a sheriff. In fact, it has been much more compassionate than any of those chimeras! <br /> <br /> * Why did not this masterpiece receive the Razzie Prize? Do you want the movie to be smaller than you think? I do not think so ! Razzie is in a position to win over his responsibility <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < * Martin Sheen is also a guest star here. ! and why is that? Well I'm sorry for Martin Sheen, because the comic film is nothing more than what I hate. <br /> <br /> * It's not a comic, no ... it's horrible! I've hated horror movies, especially those comic books! <br /> <br /> * Put the good thing about it? Hmmm! Well, this was with Marlon Brando's other monster movie (that's, Moreau Island 1996) (Casablanca)! <br /> <br /> PS: You still want to know what they are or who they are, in fact, bad, ugly and very ugly in this movie ... Just pray your final prayers and go see ... God Help Help You !
