This movie was terribly hard to say. I'm much better off after seeing "High School Musical". The whole movie was full of "The Simple Life", but it was not a reality show. <br /> <br /> The effect was not good. Amanda Michalka had her moments when she was horrible. On the other hand, Alyson Michalka was bad. Chris Gallinger, the love affair of Amanda, played a Frenchman, but had a great accent. One good thing about this movie was Michael Trevino, who was absolutely adorable, interested in Alyson's love. Something to bear in mind, if the movie was presented before "High School Musical", it would probably not be bad. But there was no difference. <br /> <br /> Generally, I give 2.
