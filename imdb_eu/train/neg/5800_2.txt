As a horror movie fan, I see all the major novelties of this genre, especially my original film products. And I can say that "fear power" (or "Vedma" is its Russian title) among which is the weakest film. First and foremost, there is no fear that a small child, so slow and predictable, that there is no real fear. Actually, everywhere is bad: from the goof line (I do not know why Russian producers / directors decided to transform classic storytelling into a crazy and ridiculous story of today's America). The previous reviewer is not a bit of emotion) and the work of the most horrifying and noisy actors. In Russia, Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova, who are very popular, are, among others, wooden dolls or something similar, and they do not seem to want to play, but they only spoke in English. And finally, I do not understand why they filmed this movie with English actors? I think his turn was wrong. At least the American or English actors could cast out some of the most important pieces to convince. I can say "about the smallest country of Estonia", the Estonian one shot and looks the same. The positive moments I found in "fear of power" are visual effects. They are not excellent, but good for the Russian movie. And music is fine, at least not irritating. That's why I give it two stars. In general, if you want to watch a good horror movie? Do not waste your time and money. If you are looking for something that is a Russian fear, I would recommend you find a copy of "Viy or The Spirit of Evil". It's really a great movie based on "Power of Fear", but much better.
