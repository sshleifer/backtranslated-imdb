Why i am Why would they be able to make an interesting plot under the murder? At least I can warn other people, it's worth it. <br /> <br /> I had to see a horrible film at the university's course. Otherwise, I looked at the background synopsis of one thing and cleared it. It was a slow movie, a little character developed by PAINFULLY, centered around an idea that can break a big black white man with a cool LA-style tokens. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the feeling of superficial dizziness of LA stereotyped - watch the movie. Please note that this film does not reflect the "LA life", which is why it is a wonderful product that ARISE poses.
