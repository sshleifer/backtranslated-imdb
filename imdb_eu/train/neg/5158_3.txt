Sometimes doing something strange and contemporary is not always working for us all. Although the concept and concept of the film concept is very interesting, I will accept that the story is not compatible with the implementation of these ideas. This movie was very hidden and unstoppable, though Robin Williams also saved this garbage. Obviously Barry Levinson's dream fell, but you should warn the rest of the world.
