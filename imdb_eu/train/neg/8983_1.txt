Ulises is a professor of literature that arrives at the seaside town. There, Martina loves the most beautiful girl in the city. The tragic death of Ulises will end the tragic love that will end up on the sea. A few years later, Martina is married to Sierra, the richest and happiest man in town is surrounded by money. One day, the onset of Ulises will increase his passion and the consequences will not work. The plot is quite absurd and one of the actors does not make sense. In addition, three-quarters of the film are sexually-acted, although well shot, they are quite laborious, because they want to see more development of the story. Bigas Luna's movie is just a bad movie, no sex, no arguments and stupid characters everywhere.
