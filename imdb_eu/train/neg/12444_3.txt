Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in space clothing for girls. <br /> <br /> I love 50 sci-fis, even if we love 50's sci-fi, but this movie is really bad. And not in MST3K mode. <br /> <br /> A couple of bozos is almost impossible to make the best impression of Abott and Costello's "hip-cat". <br /> <br /> Chessecake can usually save you cursed science. Fi, like "Cat Women On The Moon", but it can not be in this case. This movie requires a dumb button and a quick forward. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I have been able to watch Gloria and Dolores out of the spacecraft for about an hour.
