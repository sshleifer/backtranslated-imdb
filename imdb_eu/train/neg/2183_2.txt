This film was a very bad science-fiction movie, as a horror or comedy. The whole thing is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It looks like the movie (and this is definitely cheap), the actors do not know what is being played and the script clearly shows that it was taken together with shooting. It is clear that the closet monster added that the intense head was not terrifying, though it was pretty nice and thought they needed something more spectacular; They have failed here too (a huge composition at the end of the 50's, it's very funny). <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows why the director of the film, Joseph Green, directs it, and has never been the writer; It was very bad in both. The same thing for the actor, the boss and the sponsor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < not kill the brain "is its short duration.
