Last year I saw the movie in Media Class and I must say I really hate it. I was 10 years old (and 15 years old), so it might be something. But this year, in English, the 11th year, Animal Farm, George Orwell also had to read. Aside from the Book Revolution, my opinion is a terrifying book, and I hate it. <br /> <br /> But 1984, I think it was the worst movie ever, and I think George Orwell is one of the worst people on this planet. To forgive everyone who loves his work, but unfortunately not. The film's themes were well-visualized, but the whole movie and the incidents that happened within it were not my standards. This is my opinion, and I'm sure many others liked the movie.
