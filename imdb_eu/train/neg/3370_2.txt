Old movie The first Stanwyck's son caught the pain completely, and then his husband catches his pain in a stupid manner. The effort to save him, Stanwyck finds himself miserable once again and he meets a convicted escapist. It has the possibility of killing, but it fails. In the end, her husband is saved, and Stanwyck narrates the mystical message of the story through his narration. Everything is right up to the end of the mute. <br /> <br /> I never could have thought how a non-sexy woman, like Stanwyck, was the main female director of Glamor's ever original Hollywood movie; Is your nose so beautiful? So photogenic? The movie is a short mercy for about an hour. As the director thought it was rough, he thought he was keeping short shit.
