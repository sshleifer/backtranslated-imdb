Films lacking in style, I mean the original style. everything that looks like action, first films, songs, dialogs, etc. Yes, there were originals, initially a car number number UP **** and a few seconds later. He begins to fall to a hill with MH ****. That was what happened in the movie, there were several goofs in the movie :) Good stuff in the movie? Yes, for luck lovers, there are bikinis in Kareena. Akshay lovers, his interviews and action stunts. That's it. anything else So watch at your own risk and do not blame the director or actors. The director is already madness and an actress.
