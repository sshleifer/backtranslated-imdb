In the end I took on the look of this experimental Lynch, after waiting for so long ... and unfortunately it's not worth it! Even though I was a fan of Lynch, I found it very boring ... <br /> <br /> Nothing happens, there are long, long, long and painful steps where nothing happens, there's nothing short talk and monotonous He said, and everything ends the viewer does not know, or cares, what the hell was, what happened before and after what happened. <br /> <br /> There was a mention of Mulholland Drive - the blonde girl and the girl were very Diane and Rita - and there were some missions about the significant event with a missed highway, but it can not be clearly spoken. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is very interesting and very sad, nothing happens, it is very unforgettable and I think it will be deleted from my computer and I have forgotten to see it. Sorry David!
