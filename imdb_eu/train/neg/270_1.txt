Now I'm seeing a pink (Serbi television station) and I must say that's it. No difficulty, no performance, I mean too many effects, who made the series? <br /> <br /> Student's attempt was stupid to make more money for the success of the film. ADOS. The movie was founded in 1994. But the series? <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can see the lines in the characters' speech as stupid. Do I mean, to someone who really owed money to write someone else, did they do the reverse? This is not SciFi. <br /> <br /> It was a movie bomb, it sucked the series.
