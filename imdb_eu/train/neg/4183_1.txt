"Oh So Gourgous", Natassia Malthe, if it were not, I would not think this B-movie is worth my Tivo record sector! At what low wages the alleged space port in the repository has been filmed "Tracking People!" It's the basic principle of the real movie! At night, supposed space port and daytime (night and day station?) A warehouse! ??!? People please! The only thing I would recommend about this movie is in the wardrobe. constantly, revealing the clothes that keep Natassia in tight form! They also had to dress in this bomb, of course, to enter the day she was shooting each day! Sci-Fi channels would be better to show SpaceBalls. At least humor would be to watch something incredible. P.S. Michael Ironside, please enter your agent ASAP! You're much better than an actor, and even to that level of film.
