Did I have been happy with this movie in the local video library - a comedy in the movie Cary Grant, director Stanley Don, did not like me so far? It's a bit like a movie that asks me two questions: when all the participants (including some well-known names) were aware of a turkey, and what is one of the worst things in it? What I was thinking about before yet, but the second one is my voting storytelling, sometimes lack-writing, writing tone, consistent and developed characterization and lack of relationship between characters. Criticism must be very different, but it is understandable that the actors are fighting with these things and also seem unknown. Often their lines can hardly be achieved. Cary Grant tries to portray her usual charming and urban character, but sometimes she feels uncomfortable and giving up. I must say, however, when I was pleased to suggest that his character would be an original language of Jayne Mansfield, I will look like Suzy Parker. What do you like about the movie? - For me, above all, I am scorned by Parker's beauty and with the dignity of Grace Kelly. Generally, the movie looks good. The characters of the sea are very uniform, even in uniforms: Fu Manchu, black terrifying tunic, must be surprising at their luxurious hotel suites. Although Grant can not look elegant. When he returns to credit, Raymond Walston makes his praiseworthy work with his character, and for me he was interested in listening to the Hogan Heroes before Werner Klemperer spoke German without accent!
