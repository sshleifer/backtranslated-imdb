'Sky Captain', the jepelin on the base of the Jude Law, presents a good metaphor for describing this movie as truly horrible. First of all, let me leave it straight away, it seems that Paramount will never make any money. It could be a potential worship hit, but it's so remarkable for what he did not achieve. I see the study pitch now. "Let's combine German Expressionism in 1920 with the modern adventure in the 40s with a modern action movie and computer animation to dominate every scene! Wow, that's not a success!" Skycaptain overwhelms its overwhelming audience. There are too many fake explosions, too many dogfight convinces too many scenes, and the characters are a real little moment two-dimensional but nothing real. After all, why would you get an air float that can have more than three to five or more? Also, it could be an innovative film, combined with computer-generated images and human actors in a stylized and intriguing field, will become flop because it does not meet the most important conditions of any movie that uses CGI. Simply, graphics are surprisingly poor. From car mobility to aircraft physics, everything seems to be low. Here I do not feel like anybody. A child does not ride a car like a maglev train (except Mercedes S500). And for those who increase your protest for your voice, weeping "This is a stylized movie, it's not like reality". Lord of the Rings has established the rule of integrating the real actors of CGI. Starship Troopers has set the standard for science fiction film Iron. Rocketeer worked hard in the Hollywood movie portfolio of the 1920s and joined him again. Burton Batman created a unique image of New York City / Gotham to be repeated. Sky Captain is so short, it's hard to cite me in the same sentence. Also, the performance is so bad that it makes me a positive illness. So you do not. I've spent $ 9 worth to watch this movie and get my review. I hope everyone can not do the same mistake I made.
