It's strange how rare a strange two-hour life feels by sitting on those four and dull rumors. If a story is as personal as Sally Potter, do you not want to show a little passion? His performance was completely disconnected and I did not feel the chemistry between Sally and Pablo, and the tango scenes that were to be danced to the character of dance were very impressive and painful. Of course, revealing a personal history of that film can be tough, and that's why it would be wiser if Sally Potter's best actor allowed him to refrain from assigning his task to his supervisor.
