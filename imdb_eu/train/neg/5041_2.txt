Purple Butterfly's Ye Lou movie introduces a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against Shanghai's Japanese forces. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) are their former lovers at the sides of the conflict, after a coincidence. <br /> <br /> I agree with the Paris reviewer. The film replaces the semi-historical conflict and a plot, giving the audience a single motivation to care for the characters or their reasons. This sudden change does not matter, just as justified and void. I usually do not like dark movies, but the lack of light, the camcorder's bones and vibrant tremors, as well as making movies, usually do bad movies and what interests you. I also agree with the viewer. The film of Georgia has a "chaotic edition and a claustrophobic cinematography" movie, but I do not think it helps the movie. Behind the movie XX. It's one of the strongest events of the century, and I do not believe that you can do any justice in editing as Michael Bay's editing film. Too much melodramatic moment is not added as its relation. <br /> <br /> The actors are completely melancholic. Zhang Ziyi once again reveals that doing full-length movies with the same film makes all that's best for his films and, in general, is angry. However, he has added at least one role to this role, including Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton's The Terminator in the worst scenes of love, <br /> <br /> very disappointing films, especially how Suzhou He's director comes Seeing. 2/10
