My family and I watched Underdog the night before. And it's as bad as Underdog (I love my four year old kids), Hot Rod gives him an Oscar-like material. The only thing that could save this movie was that he had retired from Evel himself, so he could frustrate his face to make this movie. I confess, however, that the soundtrack is good. I did not know if the movie was set in the 80's, but with the majority of European musicians? Who knows If I did, I would go over it. And continue at home and watch the local television test model. Or that you can continue to see it, they will enjoy the people under the influence.
