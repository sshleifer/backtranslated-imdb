As a historian of particular interest in this particular historical story, I felt very badly in the movie. The given approval, costumes and staging were very real, but Hollywood's portrait of "Big Little Horn" was very boring in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The troops that go for a walk or walk, the old film crew must be unprecedented. in the history of cinema Since then I heard the music from the back, I knew I had to make it look like a nutshell filling scene. Of course, the producers invested a lot of "staging" and decided that they were worth the money. <br /> <br /> Despite being a prominent actor, their conversation was again boring and the characters were never developed. When Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster finished a scene, I was angry again. The lines outlined were so weak and absurd, I could hardly believe the two great portraits of Lawrence Arab and Alcatraz's man, respectively. <br /> <br /> Epic is worse, but this is not much better.
