I watched the first screening of this movie in New York and I, with my friends and the whole audience, was very disappointed. The movie was not so bad; the serpent was as alive as a victim of the bunch. Samual L. Jackson was most surprisingly tired, and snake effects were mud. One of the sci-fi film films reminded me of one of the films, except the fleshy movie, it was not fun or not. Everything seemed rude, flat and very open. I think that Anakonda is more fun I'm shocked. It's easy to understand that SOAP realizes that it is a piece of s * and that it plays with it, but if the movie fails, it's a script with suspense fears. It's the worst kind of flexible film: it's joy.
