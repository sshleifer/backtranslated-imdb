It's been the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> There is not much in common with other American Pie films, the story is clear, flat and not completely fun. <br /> <br /> The girls are nice, but watching films for a little bit of time would be much more than just watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie seems like a bad sex. Announcement for over 12-year audiences. <br /> <br /> I had never visited an American university, but I would doubt that anyone who made it can scarcely laugh at any scene. <br /> <br /> Save your time, do something else.
