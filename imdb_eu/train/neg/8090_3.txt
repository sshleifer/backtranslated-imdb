In a way I am a fan of Miyazaki's work. "In a way" I say, because most of his films are included in two categories: excellent and boring. Unfortunately, this film goes into the final category. <br /> <br /> This film has the same basic problems as Miyazaki's "Howl's Moving Castle". An interesting premise is established, but it is immediately reduced immediately to achieve some of the best facts that explain this explanation. <br /> <br /> The first movie in the movie shows this post. -It's the story of Appocalyptic World, and it seems that it is really a very interesting story. Since then, things go down the hill. The central parts of the film are, above all, slimmer with vehement propaganda and endangered by the kind of impenetrable spirituality that destroys Japanese film animations. > In general, it feels that someone else has gone through other pages on the screen before moving on to the animations. There is still something left for us (although the version unfortunately I saw was a copy of the N-generation, which is a myth that explains when Nausica flows beneath her bottom), but that does not make sense and eventually confused me.
