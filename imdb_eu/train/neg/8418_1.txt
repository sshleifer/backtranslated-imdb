There are both great shows here. Unfortunately, it seems that what he is doing is not in the context of a movie that he thinks. For the first 45-60 minutes, all the music is realistic. Suddenly, about an hour, the characters who spoke to each other began to sing together. If you want to confuse it for more, nowadays there are about 15 minutes of interviewed. It seems that leaving this idea and going to other things, for example, with a number that begins with a jazz club. Batteries and two electric guitars suddenly become fully orchestral pieces with a massive invisible string section. Above all the musical qualities used, composers do not write in music, presumably to write a portrait style. The first two pieces in the 50s while the Motown sound is imitating, the rest of the movie is just a Broadway music show. Then, a bad imitation of the Jackson family and Eddie Murphy with Little Richard with James Brown is a mere drunkenness of a group that makes Lionel Richie's bad morfing. When he started focusing on Stevie Wonder, I could not laugh aloud. Clearly, that is, I feel little about earth and I feel like I've lost two hours to see the movie.
