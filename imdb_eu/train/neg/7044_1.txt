How sad we saw it with a beautiful excuse for a short film with beautiful and talented Tina Louise. Tina was still a good and attractive look, but she seems to be terrified of some reason. I can understand his fear; This tertiary smoker would fear people somehow. I am also a fan of Adam West. Again, as with Tina, Adam looks good and has a man's age. This is a good performance, but the script is so bad because it's hard to hear the interview. <br /> <br /> Classic movie classic Brando biker, The Wild Ones; An unlawful biker team is out of control in a small town. Bikers seem like a group of motley, and I'm sure they will not update my sister. The play is hard and woody, and the plot is as old as sand. Watching Hellriders is hell!
