This is not a boring movie, the viewers would stay in the seated chair by the same character Miles Berkowitz. It's a simple story: after ten years of divorce and ten years after the Dutchman make a career, the author plays for love in front of the camera. The first question is all about what is true: what was written, what happened? Answers either, "yes" or "no" portrays M.Berkowitz as the lowest human beeing. If you are looking for self-fiction about such love, I suggest you read some independent books: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> <br /> Next, I felt very disappointed to hear. against my people in France so much. I usually know that people are proud of French (that can be true) and I say that people, and probably French (and the whole world) have a lot of gossip against America, but why do they hate it so much? I do not think this movie would like this alone.
