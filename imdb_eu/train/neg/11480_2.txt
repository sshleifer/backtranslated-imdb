I saw this while my girlfriend was trampling on the canals. <br /> <br /> We were expecting a happy two happy Christmas movie, but we were very disappointed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < When the girl is impressed, it's horrible. The actor, and no one was not laughing. <br /> <br /> Then, with the ability to cheat the soft and blonde girl, dot dot and her boyfriend, what catch! and live with his parents in life in the ambition and count more points. <br /> <br /> So, basically, it's a thrill story that depicts a man who deceives a man and deceives his boyfriend. It's as simple as predicting it, and it's really a waste of time, because you do not see anything to gain, because you only see some strange laughter, because all this is so crisp. <br /> <br /> I love saying that his dad only drinks French fries, not French wines, and everyone laughs, this is a curious attitude to this movie, as if my girlfriend's dad shook me I would tell her, but not our army. The veteran, not the lord, let all of us carry it out. <br /> <br /> The first film would be the movie, if John Rambo was burned as the world's top rider.
