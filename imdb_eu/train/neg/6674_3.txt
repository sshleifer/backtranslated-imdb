I would like to acknowledge that this film was directed by Eduardo SÃ¡nchez, because he directed the incredibly popular and successful Blair Witch Project. It's also an alien movie of this type, and something like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers was heard, critics hated one of these films, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, I felt sadly that I change the loss of time, so I will summarize it. Premises are always waiting, and Altered is no different. The story of a group of men who had the most unusual encounter when they were the youngest, and like others, others will be like a nutcase. Alien attack stories have always drilled rumors, so I'm not going to get into details, but this purchase is inconvenient, and you'll get something you want to forget. <br /> <br /> What would happen? can you take revenge? That is, you need to successfully capture and survive. What will you do? For this group, the amortization time is wonderful, or so they thought. And the movie begins to become snoozefest, with bad conversations and non-inspirational, and even worse performance. Although there are few budgets, there are no liberating factors, the strength of the story, or cast's help, their characters are very interesting. It is a standard cardboard standard for a standard cameraman, along with low-cost tactics used. <br /> <br /> What a good make-up. We have made great efforts to do some things that I have not mentioned, because only a few elements of this film are sustainable. In addition, the usual special effects, odd blood and gory moments, you have never seen. <br /> <br /> Check this out as just the last resort. Compared to the other monster movie in the country - The party, this is not so funny and it takes its name seriously. Depending on your suggestion, you have warned.
