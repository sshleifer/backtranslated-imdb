I have read other comments and I have to agree with those who did not finish. I thought it would go well ... to the finish line. Fool was running and then splat. I do not clarify what happened in the last minutes of the movie. As soon as the money ended, they created a good ending as they improvised. First of all, when they erased a mysterious thing, they talked about 51 (that is, thinking about the aliens) with a guy. I thought the actors and actors were doing well that the script was sour. However, if you watch the movie, it will end up being disappointed.
