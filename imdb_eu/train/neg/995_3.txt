A girl has been raped by Rosario Dawson and then begins to darken until darkness takes hold of revenge. It's clear that Dawson's role was to showcase her role-playing cheaters and make it clear that she is making a Hollywood movie that is independent and decisive in films, although Dawson looks good. Pardon me, I just could not find it. This was not a mistake, I felt like I did not know where it was. Yes, I know it's on the screen, but I was split for two hours, I was not left with any impression. The script of this I guess at the end of the blame, but a lot of what happened on the screen seems like no sense. People seemed to be more than a real attitude, and it seems that what happened was not included. Sorry for being disgusted, but nothing in this film, except the end (I would like to talk about it, but I would not have it), and the image of Rosario Dawson was just like an image. . What can I say, this can be done with you, it may not be time for me to return. Only for fans of Rosario Dawson, even though you warn for this NC17. (And Rosario, please, you're a better actor, write better scripts)
