This movie was just great, just put it. It was so bad that he was registered with the IMDb to warn him of his dangers. <br /> <br /> I am an experimental horror film expert. "Redneck Zombies", "Women of the Psychotic Women", "Slumber Party Massacre II" and many others. I know my schlock. And I know that this movie is sucking. <br /> <br /> Four-way film is frightened by the screen on either side of the screen. When they are not running, sequential lines are being poured into emotions or motivations. When the actors begin to accept them, the direction is directed. There were several low-angle shots; Leif Jonker had a tripod of 3 meters high. Thousands of times he used what he called "Leif Maneuver": that is, moving away from an amateur-like object. Apparently, the movie team could not get up early enough to get out of the sun, get out of the sun ... and vice versa. When they're lazy, you're really impressed with the last scene. It seemed like you shot the last five minutes before ninety-five minutes. <br /> <br /> If you want a bad (bad) movie, rent "Riki-Oh" or basic. "Dead Alive". If you're a Schlock buff and are looking for a challenge, give "Darkness" go. <br /> <br /> Quote movie '<br /> <br /> Vampire: Time is dead!
