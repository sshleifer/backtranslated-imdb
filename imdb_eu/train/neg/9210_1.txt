I have forgotten this movie until now. This was the worst and worst attempt to demonize my past dreaming. The message seems: "Do not make use of teenage imagination, play games can be serious, people will be crazy and hurt". I can only imagine the non-chemical writers of this piece thought that the D & D style games are rhythms that are bad or worship is foreign.
