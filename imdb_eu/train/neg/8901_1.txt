I will make this short and sweet ... this movie sucked !!!!!! <br /> <br /> I saw the first part today and I thought it was one of the biggest movies, it was given to 9. 10 stars. So, I thought parts 2 and 3 could be good seasons, I was wrong. This movie got bored and death was so different from me, it was still in the plot and that's it. It was like a bit of a bit outtakes. <br /> <br /> I love Walken, but I felt here. I was so happy in Glenn Danzig's film, but do not miss the blinking. There were not actors and people I did not like, for example, a whole lot like Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it was fresh air to see Ethan Embry. It's one of the funniest people on Earth. <br /> <br /> This movie will be a bit less than the first one, so do not overlook it as it owes you, as if it were a fan of episodes 1. I will wait a few days before seeing Part 3 and I pray that it is better than nothing. <br /> <br /> <br /> The final scene was one of the most beautiful things that never happened to lightning the movie. Go ahead or go if you can not get in the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars - it was awesome!
