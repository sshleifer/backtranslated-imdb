I sent this to the shelf a few times, looking for a lot of huge seminars (something small) on the front and asking if I would lose something. At night, it was on one of the cinemas, and I tuned it. I did not ask anything. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have only seen the first 30 minutes. Perhaps the movie becomes a comedy gold after that. Due to the slow pace and rhythm of the first 30 seconds, I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie "I do not know how to start my movie" starts with the classic. , a long and tiring monologue about what he does not want to sue. It's not fun It's not a fun remake too. Others have commented on the "San Francisco" bit; Well, he said a little joke the first time. Then he crushed it on the ground, smiling with the camera, like the funniest thing ever written. Get yourself In fact, I think the movie really liked the movie with the camera. Do not know your audience. Similar knowledge is very similar. <br /> <br /> Thereafter, basically, it has a horrible nonsense that speaks weakly about his voluptuous life. I did not know that he was a Jew; Jewish comedians are infidelity to call "Jewish humor". It's just humorous. The Jews do not mean to play comedy. A WASP, Spalding Gray, makes the work of self-analysis humor better than that guy, so obviously it's not about ethnicity. <br /> <br /> If I saw that one of the pieces worked, perhaps I might be around. But the school continues to list the names of women who work for five minutes, and does not create a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is an attempt to capitalize. About the reputation of "Office Space". Do not let yourself become a marketing victim. Do not say "Haiku Tunnel".
