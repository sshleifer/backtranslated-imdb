I'm glad people like it but I hate this movie. It was a good idea about a story, but it was over. He was badly written, wrong and badly done. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting land points, but they jumped faster; The writers needed to know what to keep and expand on these bits. He was kidnapped because he was kidnapped, and he was lost. Instead of "what's wrong?", They'll tell you 5 seconds later. <br /> <br /> This movie has no suspense, and I was bored from the beginning to the end. I wanted to finish it. <br /> <br /> Go to the unfortunate or leased plan, if you guess the end, you want to suspend or twist it.
