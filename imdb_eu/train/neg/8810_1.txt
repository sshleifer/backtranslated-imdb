This movie is one of those I'm going to regret over investing more than 90 minutes of my life. The premise is really interesting - basically it's a zombie movie (let's not let them split their hair) Unfortunately, they do not deliver credible story within that framework. The almost monotonous life of central characters can almost overwhelm the realism of the movie, but the entertainment value sucks everything directly If they had increased their efforts to maintain the audience's responsibility, it would be much safer to take the community comment home.
