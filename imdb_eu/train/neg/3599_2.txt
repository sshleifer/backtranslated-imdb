Actually ... I was surprised if someone gave me great marks. <br /> <br /> Let's see ... Tori Spelling is not an excellent actor ... and this movie proves "its talent" only. The movie's drawing was weak ... I sucked the dork created by this concept with some perverted bets. If it's a good thing about this movie, I would say that this is Tommy's daughter, that she is the daughter ... and then the heads of men in Soap-Opera-ish seem attractive to her. But he does not allow his dramatic ability to help. * Why do you require a IMDb of at least 10 lines? How many more ways can you say "Suck this film"?
