This movie is horrible. The script is bad, it is a mediocre script, and even the sex scene does not work. The excitement and intrigue of the original movie is totally lacking. This movie was shot in a dark, monochromatic style ("World of the Worlds"), because of the beauty of that original movie. Greg Morrisey's terrific character shows a facial expression throughout the film. The turns and turns of the original plot are unfortunately missing here; Existing few are simply anticlimactic. Sharon Stone is the most prominent feature of Catherine Tramell, as this series has continued, but it is not enough to solve the rest. The only thing to do with the "Basic Instinct 3" would be to agree to Michael Douglas.
