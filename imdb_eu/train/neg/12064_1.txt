I've seen one of the hottest horror films that I've ever seen, as it's completely divine, John Carradine has a very limited time. All the characters are boring, and the story is horrible, plus I can see them in the last two kilometers. Unbelievable setting and awesome homes would definitely be helpful if it were not boring, and there is not a single character for the root, plus I expect it's way under 100, because it's worth it. In my opinion. When John Carradin finally reveals himself, the scene is pretty good, but it's already too late, and the other screen was in flashback time, and the only truly gory of the movie is when a character gets his face. Bee was so mischievous as it was terribly ugly. I got into a series of horror DVDs called Retro Grave and I think everyone can, and I would happily put it into another group, otherwise I'd get it out of the window I bought. This has been one of the most boring films of horror I have ever seen, because God is horrible, John Carradin has limited time on the screen and I am not saying that it's plague! You do not want to go through torture. Management is absolutely awesome! Carl Monson is absolutely awesome! This work, making the appearance of all things cheap, making a great atmosphere and preventing the film from being kept in a boring rhythm. It's a very bad act. John Carradine's scene is good, but then the other scene of the flashback is hardly another. (Carradine Ruled !!). Feliz Anders Laura sharply shrugs here because she does not persuade her. Ivy Bethune is fine, and it's a little bit awful, but also excessive, she had a terrible smile at the end. The rest, I did not pay enough attention, I got a lot of trouble but they were very bad. In general, do not avoid it, it's not worth it! 5 BOMB
