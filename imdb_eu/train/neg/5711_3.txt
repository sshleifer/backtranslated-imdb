The National Treasury is too much invaluable and excessive as they come. Nicholas Cage is not a compelling hero in any action, and this movie is not "Indiana Jones." The people who compared this movie to the classic Indian trilogy, have fallen its roquero seriously. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine what the movie is shooting the type of recipient. Perhaps I would like a pre-audience, but it seemed fun to me. I can not imagine, too, that adults or young people find that this movie is excellent. It's just right. It's just okay. <br /> <br /> The National Treasure is not imagined and inspired, borrowing in the "Da Vinci Code". I would recommend that I release this movie in 2006 and send me nonsense. I would give the whole idea of ​​the Declaration of Independence and Washington DC and Philadelphia so easily steal it. With it (never hurried), being "bad" and "unexpected actions" are absurd while fighting. Especially I loved the seat when the expression is bent in its pipe, when it is located in the middle of a busy road, while it sucks the car, it does not hurt. Oh brother! <br /> <br /> This section of "Brady Bunch" reminded me that they went to the amusement park and Brady lost his architectural plans. This part of Brady Bunch was not much better than this movie! <br /> <br /> No one thinks that the idea of ​​a great treasure trove in a secret US ruin is not at all strange. Literally, there were not found thousands of "unbelievable" items in this treasure treasure. Yes Yes !! Ridiculous !! <br /> <br /> Even worse, Cage thinks and determines what "hard" thoughts are for these ancient inventions !!! Oh ... humanity! <br /> <br /> Cage, Voight and other "National Treasure" actors are sticky, woody and flat. However, when you are working with this gruesome conversation, it is difficult for the actor to make a mistake for 100%. <br /> <br /> National Treasure is a good movie to watch once. I can not recommend it beyond this and I certainly would not buy it on top of a terrific great game of a bad man. <br /> <br /> Rent to see first ...
