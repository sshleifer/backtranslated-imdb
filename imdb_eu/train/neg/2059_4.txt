The call is witnessed by a murder and the murderer becomes the next target. The director Brian De Palma really has a retired here: his camera goes around the corners of a museum (it takes a little time on a monkey's painting), and focuses on the fragmentary part of the art, almost in its plot (once again split screen) where two characters They are watching televised transsexual television programs and their (first) ending in a thrilling theater event. "Dressed To Kill" is especially tiring, because it wants to swallow so much and it does not give anything noticeable. Most of the activity (except Keith Gordon's young) is mediocre and (second) the end is the source of "Carrie" by De Palma, without mentioning "Psycho". The dirty act is like Hitchcock, no homage. Stylishly coldly elegant, the final results are in the middle. ** ****
