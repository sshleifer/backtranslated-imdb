Normally, I do not think Hollywood productions can be called filmmakers, which is why I call 'movies'. An elephant manure, however, does not want to call the movie, so the headline quotes. <br /> <br /> Where will I start? 1. If this is not the beginning of a geriatric questionnaire, it is surely a summary. Stefanie Powers assumes that he plays at less than half his age, he thinks he's been 18, and in these two years FORO BI !!!! <br /> <br /> Portraying the stupid and stupid portraits of Paris and France. In it, for example, the grumpy, genuine grocery store, the queen queen of the models, the queen of the models, the fairy mother, etc. We see it Respect for Da Vinci Code (well-determined by commercial reviewers). <br /> <br /> 3. It's very hilarious and absolutely horny, it's not a nudity at a time and nudity in a place that is so common, especially all the attention to it <br /> <br /> 4. Awesome details !!! <br /> <br /> 5. Nana Mouskouri lift music !!! <br /> <br /> I could go ahead, but I think that's enough. I only had half an hour to watch this observation and then I made observations talking about Internet and friends about mathematical equations ... I mean ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to join my list. :): P: D
