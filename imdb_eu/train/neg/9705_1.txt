I watched the film as a baby when it was published in the theater and it was so bad that it became a mold for a family joke. If the classification is zero, it would get this film. The dinosaur was horrible. The story was ridiculous. The operation is not really going to be called to act. The only reason I remember the name of the movie is so good because my family still really speaks.
