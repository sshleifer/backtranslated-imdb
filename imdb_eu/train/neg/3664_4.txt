Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) travels to Tibet, and yeti bites and makes him a rude man. After accidentally attacked his wife and his lover, he accidentally killed him. Later, he was revived by a PhD scientist, Ilona Ermann, who has been using control experiments on control. Daninsky later discovered a subterranean asylum in the wilderness of pure medical experiments. <br /> <br /> After listening to the death of Nasky's colleague, Jon Kitley, I was able to watch the movie that I collected through my collection. In my rumors I did not find three copies of "Wolf of the Wolfman". The videoclip video quality is doubtful, the sound is mumbled in semi-mode, and sometimes cinematography is like a slapstick style.

I think this is true, but you do not know that in the movie. Plots are sometimes confusing and there is no indication that it is a sequel.
