This movie is so bad. When the car is running at 30 mph when it is supposed to go through 100 ... change the lever lever (Park!), The nurse that drives for almost two hours with the phone with the shoulder ... can not 2 damn you fuck this phone? There is nothing worthwhile in this. I would be ashamed to see it in such a movie!
