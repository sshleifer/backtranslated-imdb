When I was a kid, my parents took me to the theater to see the inside. It was one of the many films I watched with my parents, but that was the only one we came up with. Since then, I have never seen any interiors until recently, and I could not live for life. The pretentious, weighty and boring trip of the 70s and the wine of the 70s. Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors, but interiors are the worst part of his career. In Ingmar Berman's unmistakable style, Allen gives us life to know the life of psychological harm caused by divorce, delay, career, love, love, halitosis. The movie is not necessarily comic, not music, and is immersed in dark dancing. This style of film can be defined as naturally expressionist, using the improvising method of dialogue, "illegal expression of meaning and truth". But Woody Allen is not Ingmar Bergman. The movie is slow and dull. However, beyond that, I have not had any connection to a character. Instead, I only felt contempt for the martyrdom disorder, scrooge, nicotine, martyrdom disorder, in the constant evolution of personality. In the back of a cosmopolitan power and Brie in a peaceful intelligence, the story begins as a star in the room. Everyone speaks of affected languages ​​and high cigar languages. Everyone is "lost" and "struggling", finding a disappointed direction or understanding, or whatever, and continues to disapprove of them all. There is never a resolution, it's just about a constant ongoing refuge. It's just a psychological drama that is beyond the ability to connect to the audience. Woody Allen let himself be immersed in characters. That's why I found this movie stronger and spiritually emptying. I see what he wanted, but he tries to send his message through Prozac's prose and film techniques, from the point of importance. I recommend that you feel happy and you need something to remind yourself of death. Otherwise, let's say the movie never happened.
