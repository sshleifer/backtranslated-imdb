After years of listening to this movie about raves, I finally decided to rent and watch. To begin with, I am happy to let you know that it was free from the library. This movement was slow, boring, realistic and plots make no sense. After 2 hours, I would be ready for the waters of that town in Texas, and I took the group of these characters out of their misfortunes. I know the taste is subjective, but I believe, I do not understand all the hype I heard about this movie. Dallas gave this movie a good deal of life in Texas. Only renting incorrect movies would give the reviewers a good opinion about how much money they can afford to pay for their studios.
