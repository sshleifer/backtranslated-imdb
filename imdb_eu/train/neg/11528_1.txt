He writes about "nice" about him, he must have been a friend of those guys. This is a bad thing, even if the backyard is struggling. In fact, this is not really the backyard fighting really, some guys are blowing in a trampoline. Each boy has a lump of 45 lbs and there is no ounce of entertainment. They are just some bored children, although it's possible, bad names give bad pools. If you want to see some entertaining fighting wars, pick up a nice Pleasant Backyard Wrestling. It has the 2 best names named BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. These guys are good. Actually, they have been trained as a "real" professional fighter. They got real and improved. I recommend watching these 2 guys. MDogg's madness. So do not waste your time or your crappy money on this DVD, there are videos on the "better" back yard.
