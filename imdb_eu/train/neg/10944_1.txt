Now, I've seen a lot of bad movies. I like bad movies. Particularly bad action films. I have seen all the films of Jean-Claude Van Damme (and I have enjoyed), as well as his own clone, both in both twins and three where he is a cyborg. I am a real owner of a truck that plays a fashion designer and fights. (Hey, if it's not anywhere else, it has a huge butt and you almost always watch it. You can pause and dump your DVD!) That's why you can confidently say that I'm so bad about the movie. Plan 9 looks like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The plot is bad. Script is bad They are bad parties. Fights are bad Stunts are bad. FX are wrong. The play is spectacular, the earth is over time, surely, presenting the worst performer of the cast, including Lorenzo Lamas, and this really does. And I would be willing to bet that everyone involved in this movie is wrong in bed. SPECIAL Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> It is not necessarily fun, so it's not a complete loss. However, I recommend that I only see that this movie is born or very, very stoned. I could sit by myself, because I had to get something out of the cleaner to clean the cat from urine. <br /> <br /> He did not help much, but he was better than anything. Ron Palillo truck as a gay arsonist.
