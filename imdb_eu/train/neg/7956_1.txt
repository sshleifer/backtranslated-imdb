This movie must be a lower number 100. The performance is so huge, when my son and I saw it, we almost got physical illness. And the story is worse. I had the opportunity to continue, but the truth I really wanted was a review that was added to frankbob, because nobody else still had problems. Do not waste your time, money, energy or anything else in this movie. Thank God we saw on television, so we did not spend anything. If we were to, I would have to write the guilty of this innocent, and I would be forced to do it in a general direction. Finally, I would like to say that I always liked looking at the Carrie Fisher event. But I feel sad that they do not deserve to see in this movie. Do not worry about Carrie's opinion.
