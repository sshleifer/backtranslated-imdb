This must be the worst film of the 90s. When my friend and I were watching this movie (because it was targeted for being a recipient), we sat down and watched the first hour of an hour and a half in May that our floor was touching the ground. In the rest of the time, the theater started talking to each other, and in general, crying among the people of Crisis, they were really excited to pay for a movie they had paid for. He thought it was a great idea in the paper, but there was no idea in the film about what happened. Criminals suits I can not see how it is seen before that. Save yourself an hour and a bit of your life .........
