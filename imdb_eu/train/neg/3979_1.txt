Okay, I have 2 of the worst excuses, the fatal movie I've ever seen. Olsen's twin children, along with all the other films, with the exception of the New York minute, did not have a story, no story, bad performance and bad filming too !!!!!!!!! In that case, you have not guessed GORRI MARY KATE AND ASHLEY !!!!!! I saw this as the only reason I was bored and there was not something else. I wonder if two twins are never stereotyped by the same movies, where they have an incredible adventure in an exotic location and keep them up during that day, with the help of two pretty boys who accuse them. It would be the same if they were the least capable of being 4 or both. The plots in this story were so absurd and empty. even if a child can see a mistake. Individuals can be separated and movies are made individually or may have other stories. Those who liked this movie had no problem, no stupid, really artificial or did not see a good movie. or maybe they are very intelligent and have only bad cinema choices. In a way I would not recommend the movie to make a good experience with the worst movie Nemesis ... The good thing is 4 is splitting ribs with some horny cool essay. If it's horny to see laughter. basically give 0 or less.
