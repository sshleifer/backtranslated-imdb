This movie distinguishes it from the "amazing human" documentary, with courage, but, in spite of all this, the desire to get out of the audience. In a scene, the camera closes in a giant 50-meter flick because a teenager tightens pus and liquid. In another case, the camera is half-bursting in the gastrointestinal tract of food and stomach, the parts of the pasta salad fall into the esophagus and enter the goop. In the last round tour, the cameraphone takes on the sting of the audience ... through a hairless hairless hair. Unfortunately, I do not do that. See if you need this film, but: bring your vomit bag, and do not pre-salt pasta.
