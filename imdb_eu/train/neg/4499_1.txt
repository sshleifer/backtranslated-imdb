Karen Allen's nude and I'm still out of any movie I'm still bored, odd! <br /> <br /> Karen is stuck in Paris, and soon Frenchman who is sexually becomes a beautiful friend. Certainly, he is married ("But, why, why should the problem be?") The encounter between cultures can be interesting (just do not think) sad. I went out. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the film got much better after leaving it; but LOT should be much better in favor of an initial corruption. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you find yourself, run, do not walk, for the exit. Save your time and energy. Surely you will save money. It's a pity that the production house did not save money.
