Oh, man, never gets in touch with the movie! If he was afraid of a rewrite of the Slasher genre, make it as cheaper as possible and at the same time cautious (pc-friendly, nudity does not mean slasher movie is a classic element) Cut. Each rhyme is restructured without self-awareness and performance. Oh, fear of acting defines the word. I would better know that I would leave the German translation of the title directly.
