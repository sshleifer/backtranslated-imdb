It's been rarely missed outrageously missed. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and John Turturro, all jumped to save only one script that pops into Hollywood jokes. It was probably the tossing of Martin Scorsese's name, but the final results are less than the sum of the pieces. Because it seems like a nightmare that has been badly mistaken, every scene seems to resemble the next one. "Search and destroy" is just an abstract, stylish nonsense and a self-service station, and the whole movie is sad .......... MERK
