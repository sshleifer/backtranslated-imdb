The whole mess of a movie was directed by Bill Rebane, who was responsible for the classic anti-classical Monster a-Go Go. When I arrived at the end of the cold, it was an incredible conclusion that this film was worse than that of the 60s. Story is it such? Three eccentric rocks invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play some macabre games. Everyone who has survived and survive has won 1,000,000 dollars. The plot is a very simple one, but Rebane still somehow manages to understand the incomprehensible procedures. Things happen. The characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes sense. And then it ends. Weirdly Would you like to say exactly what happened? I think you will draw your own conclusions. The production values ​​and performance are related to a standard pornographic film. Actually, Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) was not so good. Compelling is so terribly terrifying. Unfortunately, the same thing can not be said about this massacre, it's just a revolving basement underground.
