Superman II - Richard Donner Cut should be a dream fan. In the end, the footage that only existed on the printed page would only survive. A director could not complete his vision to recover his vision. It's like a win-win situation. And then, you begin to see this footage and you realize that this "esoteric dream" is a real nightmare and a nightmare. It is very possible that the films that may have a thrill for each one of us who has competed with the perfect version over the years, could eventually be seen as a project. It's just a few times. <br /> <br /> You know things are shaking on the screen, the first strange text that looks like a graphic home-made computer graphic. However, we start to see the new footage (Superman - The Movie trial replacement) and the first doubt is fading. Hey, this is pretty clean! Things are fine for a few moments, until STM sees the footage that is mixed with new effects for this project and does not convince. And from this point on, it never never leaves. It's probably not right to judge a movie because of visual ill effects, but this was probably the correct tracking of the movie "You Believe A Man Can Fly", it is difficult to believe anyone who appears on the screen here. The best effects are from original production. <br /> <br /> Cut another topic again with this. There is not much sense. The only reason that really works is that we have seen the Superman II theater version, it's a sensible movie. Lester's Superman II fills the holes in this assembly. Part of the fact that Donner could not reach full filming, the other part of the project could be to use Lester with the least possible materials. Finally, Superman IV is a footage that works closely and consistently. <br /> <br /> After seeing this, Lester was faithful and comfortable using Donner's material, Michael Thau and he thinks. The team has been a great supporter of Lester. The best performers of The Donner Cut have received a full version of Superman II released. This includes the sequence of the moon and dinner sequence, not ironically, either filmed by Donner. Lester has been re-edited in any other way, now Lester is not known as ham-fingernails. While Lester claimed that Donner's material was, Lester was thrown here under the bus. <br /> <br /> So is this annotation good? Well, Marlon Brando is there, and that's the point to see it clean. In fact, seeing any material filmed by Donner is clear, everything that Superman shot along with The Movie. But this only emphasizes the problems of this note. One of the major scenes (actually scenes with Lois leap and Marlon Brando) would be better for the scenes to be made up in a deleted section. Instead, they are shoes in senseless narratives, with lesser performance (many of the famous scenes are used) inadequate changes and wrong decisions. <br /> <br /> See the planet's day scene. Why are we looking back at Jackie Cooper with Lois and Clark? Finally, why would Lois enter his dark apartment instead of entering a dark bathroom that will light up the next light by Jackie Cooper? I was confused from the beginning, because I expected to see Lois. Full assembly options like this are doubtful. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the battle are a mess, not a geography among cuts. It's just a random act. Of course, Lester's main actions were filmed with scenes and his material is only used as the next bridge or replacement for Donner. Lester's footage would have to be used more, but they surely felt proud to accept it. <br /> <br /> Malachi also extends military missiles. As stated elsewhere, the Donne Cut missile is named "XK 10", we all know that "XK 101" is a blind STM. The producers of this congress, when they tried to pay homage to original films, fell to less than five minutes and this defect represents the quality of total production. For all the alleged cares that have been put in place, the final product is of a quality air quality. <br /> <br /> It really will be easier to digest the problem if Warner does not do it. The distribution to be distributed here in the state. Previously, we expect the payment of a bonus bonus for the selected scene "Play All". It really deserves a unique look to see the legendary scenes that have been cut off, but after this initial show, I hope that this is a great magnet of dust and something else. I know that after continuing to see this, I had a new respect for the version of Lester. It's not perfect at all, but Lester's scripts that appear in screenplay show up here. He has been making a movie that has been entertaining for many years and will continue, again, this new operation will be remembered as the footnote of this film history.
