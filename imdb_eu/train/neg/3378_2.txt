During the release of this movie, I saw Chorus Line on stage 4 times, and I advanced the rumors of long production of a story film. My wife and I had been online in the opening hours before opening the library. He was not disappointed, he was a stomach kick. <br /> <br /> First of all, the story "how was it" moved away, including scene that was not limited to theater fronts. Limitations are a great part of the significance and impact of the story. <br /> <br /> Second and third together (specify your request): one of the original songs, a very dynamic dance number, was deleted; there was a song that was NOT a production stage. Say what? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> I admire that the only reason I have given 2 stars to this movie is the talented and talented performers. I've seen Chorus Line on stage 6 times and I do not like it before 6 months before I saw it. Excellent writing, with wonderful music and heart-wrenching stories. If you want to see a music that includes an excellent soundtrack "Ganadutegi", I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the Chorus Line story, watch it on stage.
