I do not think you get that much worse. Put together bad actors, fake bodies and three stupid stories and what do you get? B rate for a movie no excuse. <br /> <br /> The first story immediately shows the quality of the video is bad and theatricality is really pathetic, especially when you put it as a 25-year-old grandmother. Normally Grandmothers are slightly out of their ears. Besides, the man is well, but the woman is pretty ugly. "You look great!" NO! In this I said the man's lupine was the best among all, but it was not yet horrible because of bad outfit. The face of the woman was later good enough for Halloween, but it was not for a man's movie. <br /> <br /> The more stories you're going to get worse. There are two lesbians next, because it is totally delayed. The whole "I want to be a bush" too "How can I do this with me!" It could have been said stupid. Now you are asked to pass it! Men's wolf will not even talk ... a rat! <br /> <br /> Thirdly, there is no point ... this story and a complete change of fifty five minutes complete an additional narrative. he still was not interesting. Boring! <br /> <br /> Music, yes, bad ... who could not hear a few pieces was also a fool. Animal effects were roots or pigs that were stupid. Could they not use lions sounds? Not guessed, good films use it. Well, you like the B-rate enjoyment. Since I got this movie, I'm a fan of a pale man and I've ever seen any movie from these genres, but I've just seen them. If you prefer good, do not waste your money. I urge you!
