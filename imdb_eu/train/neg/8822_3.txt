Considering this as a personal state of mind, "Christmas Evil" turns into an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller, on holiday times, among slashers on holiday issues. For me, personally, I was not tempted to choose this last one, but I did not want to do any research, at the beginning of the 80s, I anticipated a harsh and precarious aspect for men in Santa Clause. Wrong! The film is about a block called Harry Stadling; Obsessed at Christmas, he works at a toy factory and believes that he is responsible for deciding on gifts and deserving penalties on Christmas Eve tonight. Harry's issues started when Santa began to witness? In her dad costume, of course, ?? love her mother's naked legs at a tender age. After that, he became a social exclusion, because of his younger brother, for more than a day. I fully understand why some fans appreciate a horror movie, but it really has to be boring? There are several feature films and seemingly never-ending films. I can not forgive pardon and excessive blood flow, but this film does not greatly benefit the plots that cause unexpected or unexpected atmosphere (I have to acknowledge the last outstanding exception). In the same way, I would take the concept seriously if the protagonist of the foolish people were paying special attention to the bad girls! He does not play badly in adults and only die. How do you expect that the Christmas thriller will be controversial and treacherous as a miserable murder of Santa Santa's infancy? THIS would be a classic "Christmas Evil", now it's just an unforgettable and wonderful piece of garbage.
