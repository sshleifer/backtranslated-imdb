I must say that before the 'monster' is revealed. He was not really saying that he was entering that category, he thought it was rather annoying, but funny things! And I think the grandmother can escape from that, but anyway. I really went into these movies, although the main character had an addiction to drunkenness and heroism. Scenes that run away from trains, but the image of the door is awful, and when the guard was killed, he put the 'monsters' on his screen. <br /> <br /> But when the monster was revealed, it became an average horror with limited emotions or emotions. Get bored gradually, and I wanted to close it. Most people told me that they intended to engage in homeless people, especially the guy, he gave me some ridiculous laughs here and there. I think that this movie could be really unique, what a horrible fear of today! Just boring and well worth the money. <br /> <br /> If you look for a cheap mirror here and there, or a mindless gore fest (that is, it's limited, it's hardly a truth), but there are good films on horror shows.
