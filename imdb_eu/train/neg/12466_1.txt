I could not wait for the DVD after listening a lot about this movie. What a despair! This has become one of the most confusing films I've ever seen. There were several characters that seemed like others who could not keep track of the story. I could not understand George Clooney did not participate in the movie theater award at least, at least in the first half of the film. My wife and I gave up the misery for an hour and the DVD stopped. The quick overhaul may come to an end to find out if it is better, but after so much of the mix it was decided that there were few improvements. A colleague told me that there is a lot of "together" in the latest film or film. I was glad to miss another hour, wait. I made the DVD the next day.
