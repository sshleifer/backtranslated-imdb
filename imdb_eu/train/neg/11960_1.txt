I retired from Asian horror movie I liked a lot, after seeing the garbage story of fantasy. However, I have recently been exploiting the exploitation, which is why I decided to give it another chance. My Visitor Q 'My first port of Takashi Miike was highly valued. I saw the listening and I do not like it much, I value it as one of the best modern Asian horror films. So I entered sensible hopes; and, unfortunately, they only found boredom. I think this movie is really fast and I just overcome it, but it seemed to me that it was just a collection of violent and evil scenes, with little or no consistency between them. Any comparisons with Luis Bunuel and David Lynch fail me; All that Miik has done is to make a movie; Every fan of the fans set up cunning fans, he was disappointed to find a kind of meaning. My headaches lasted about 10 minutes (after a father had sex with her husband for some reason in sex), and did not wait until the movie was over; It seems at least twenty-four hours later. Do not be misunderstood, I'm not against anti-war violence and I'm actually looking for the most active films; But this may be violent, but it's not boring and boring and I do not get pennies for a ship. Takashi Miike may have many fans, but I'm not one of them; and definitely, I hope the last time I will be in touch with the latest movie.
