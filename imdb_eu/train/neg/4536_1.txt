This film is not a religious trait that promotes classical Hinduism and New Age Occultism, wearing Western imagery, to those who do not know the basic comparisons of religions. The basic tenants of Hinduism have elements of reincarnation. (Some characters appear in this one and in the sixteenth century as well). God is without strength. Animal life and plants are the same. (This is pantheism). Redfield has attempted to mix eastern mysticism with western Christianity. Those who do not ask for the truth of their syncreticism can not disturb or confuse them, but this movie is an excuse in the last reality. Since the announcement from Berkeley Barb said $ 10.00, it will show you how your religion will begin. As the famous prophet has said, "Use Luke's strength."
