This movie could be a success if it was written and produced for the purpose of creating a classical cult worship of classic movies. Have you ever sat down, that the movie you ever saw was so wonderful and wonderful as its mistakes? Well, this is it. Every one of the performers will be nominated for the best acting performances. It would be difficult to find another movie, with this production budget, which is so low in value. The whole thing from the beginning scenes, the logic is different. The conversation is completely incredible and logical. On the other hand, the behavior and overall history of the film itself. It's really thoughtful, when a jester in a meeting room spent money on the trash they took. Wow
