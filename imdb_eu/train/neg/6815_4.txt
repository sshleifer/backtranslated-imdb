The eight Jean Rollin films I also see are the safest one; An intriguing plot seems to be very weak at the beginning, even if it lasts for 84 minutes, but somehow it says that the compromise is surprisingly surprising! A vampire woman (prescribed under the title) is held captive in a remote castle and only creates a "party" that is a victim of a victim (apparently a member of a suicide club). sure everything that could lead to it, does the writer's director end up having an evil human being? really father of the white facial kinky dad ?? He described it as a futile change (?!)! The atmosphere of dreadful rhythms and dreams (wearing wreathers and masks of animals hidden by the girl of the boys), of course, both the setting for the filmmaker (type {anti}) and the "Euro-Cult" style, the beauty nubiles visible. Personally, the nice thing that is visually appealing but intellectually empty is to see the famous actors Bernard Musson (who appeared in the last three days in the movies Luis Bunuel) to see the well-known actors.
