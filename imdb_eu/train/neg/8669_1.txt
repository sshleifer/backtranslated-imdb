First, I loved Ray Bradbury's novel. It is a fear that goes into the skin and it will come in later. It was one of his best books, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I expected that this film would be OK. He had many options, like Jason Robards and Jonath Pryce. And Bradbury also wrote a writing. And above all, PAM GRIER has it! <br /> <br /> How can it fail? <br /> <br /> Inside there are spoilers. <br /> <br /> First, he dumbed. A large part of the horror of the book has been lost because Bradbury has had to stay with the least violence. All the pictures in the book ... disappeared. Everything you did right ... you went. <br /> <br /> And then it's acting. As in the 80s, as many Disney movies cast as Disney, the children of this movie can not act. And this made me a lot more, and they did not look at anyone 13 but 9 or 10. Their strong friendships were not corrected. He was more familiar with it. <br /> <br /> It would be thought by Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce. Halloway and Mr. But they just look like here. Everything you want to do is pay a mortgage or something. This is too much to be one of their best performances. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was a wonderful witch, but the dustwoman herself did not work out. He has less illness and has no presence in the book. <br /> <br /> Everything that was left out of the book. Ballon night persecution, Jim's house marking, Mr. The real death of Darkness, what happened to Mr. Coogan, the fortune teller, the real death of the witch and oh. much more. <br /> <br /> And special effects were bad in the 80's. Riding a thing over overcrowded horses was not really amazing, and this strange green fog had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> I can rip this movie with the original novel, but it's boiling blood. Ignore this movie, but read the book. Bradbury is a classic.
