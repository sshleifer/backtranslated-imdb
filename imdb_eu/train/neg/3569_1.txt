Wow! This movie could only be terribly terrifying to inspire similar "Showgirls". Where do I want to start? An awesome song on the subject? What is Pia Zadora's lyrics in the film? Although set in Los Angeles, called "space for boiler space", each man (and woman!) Is overcoming themselves with Pia Zador, using any necessary means? Or that all the people in the movie do not seem like it, because they're a headless fool (Pia) or another sleazeball (others) that is obvious? Because this flick wrote a real "scriptwriter" series, it shows an unbelievable lack of understanding of the film industry (Does God admire it and give it to GREAT CREATION?) <br /> <br /> But (unfortunately) it's fun, though. You'll only have the "breakdown" scene giggling, and the climatic view "after that I'm not going to have to honor his ****" after seeing "Prizes" (as Pia) In the basement, I'm really expecting the level we are doing based on experiences like Pia. I truly hope our dear Pia, when he won the "Golden Globe," do my day. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the bad camp and if you're a fan of a bad guy, try this weird movie.
