This movie sucked! They took something out of childhood and raped a part of the house! This movie was very bad to go home and I wanted to hold the "Dukes" dvd and wept in a corner. It was a huge kick! There were no "dukes," Stiffler and Jackass drove a car. When Boss Hogg was evil? When was Rosco the guy? They never were! Boss Hogg was a lover and Rosco was a fool. When did Jesse pot? He never did! Now I'm not writing badly, I'm very liberal and there is nothing wrong with a bad one, but there was no place in this movie! One good thing about this movie was the first trailers and recent credits. Money was a waste of time and air. Avoid all costs !!!!!!!!
