Good pain! While I keep between Manos: "Fate of Hands" is the worst piece of mental torture, and Hobgoblins closed. This ... this ... in all things the viewer insults them. <br /> <br /> At least films like Space Mutiny and Future War will be able to enjoy mst3, that is, to fight overcome. I was literally lying on the bed with anguish. This thing got scared to me - only! <br /> <br /> Even though you have been a fan of MST3K and have seen every experiment, think twice. <br /> <br /> It's bad.
