Before publishing this movie a few months before I published it on all types of print media, so I waited patiently for its publication, to see what the hype was all about. After finishing, I had to ask my roommate to watch the movie last minute and a half to occupy the video player. It basically fails because it is a movie based character based on innocent characters. Amanda Peet exceptionally (Amanda Peet is not the only one that can not be released) you can not have any of them. The film focuses on a conversation with sophomoric, moronic and raw. Eric's character is a little bit funny, a portrait of a married couple in a hidden friend is dead. The last tour designed to laugh at the three main characters inspires Peet's resentment the same type of resentment. In the end, if you only rent it, if you feel humor or have a dark feeling.
