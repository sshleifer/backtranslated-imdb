I do not know why the fans do it and I do not know why I gave it the score. This is absurd. There are a lot of giants where credibility is interrupted, rolling a picture and leaving it with him everywhere before leaving, and what we have seen what an official police officer has just seen. But this has very little, and there is nothing that has long sequences, and it does not make any sound to listen to the soundtrack while playing it, as well as the Italian standards. It's not a giant, this is the horror ideas completely mash Klaus Kinski has been a performance of his 'most often blat' performances. I think he appeared, he did a day's work and left D'Amato to meet others. Ewa is pretty, of course, but it's not enough, and in the end, we've seen much of her championship. all over the place, since we have lost all the interest and enthusiasm of that unpleasantness all the time. Maybe I did not have the right mood!
