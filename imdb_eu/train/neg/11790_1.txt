Deep SH ... it's more! Emails draw more than one movie. Think about "Mr. Incredible Limpet" "Leviathan". Very rigid <br /> <br /> There is no nature or relationship. So the so-called "romantic" scene is very crisp and predictable. An interesting idea, but a poorly written script and LOUSY special effects is required to do this!
