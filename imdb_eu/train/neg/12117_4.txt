You can tell yourself, "Don Johnson as Elvis, is it possible? Is it possible? I think it's a great opportunity, but maybe it should be open. Maybe I'm surprised. Maybe he can throw it out." <br /> <br /> NOT! <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But Elvis is terrifying. It's very short, mouth mouth, it's too weak ... well you've already thought about it. Add a black hokey wig and stuffed with hands and mascara and that's a shameless shame. <br /> <br /> I can say it's best because Johnson's performance is decent, and it seems like it's. Far away, after a while, you no longer think of Elvis mode. Instead, you see it as another horrible pop star. Then, at that level, the movie becomes visible. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Zimbalist is not as tall as Queen Queen of beauty Linda Thompson. But it is attractive to itself and has the honesty, elegance and intelligence we expect from all its tasks. In his performance, intelligence may be too much. You must have a type of drug with an abusive rope stick. <br /> <br /> There's nothing new about this story; We've heard several times. If you are looking for new information or views, you have not found it. It is told as a love story: there is no fee: Linda Elvis and Elvis drug.
