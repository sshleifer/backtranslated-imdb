Topless (and without background) girls, kung-fu cooks, slave traders, German evil cameraman with mustache and sword-wielding zombies. <br /> <br /> And of course, Camille Keaton Breasts, who is the best known visualization in the classic feminist exploitation I Spit on Your Grave. We must also mention the Shepard treasure gems that play The Cooler's latest movie. <br /> <br /> We have a lot of blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts topless dancers in a bar. Whorehouse, and a ship of some martial artists went to some zombie islands. Death killer dies or something like that dies. <br /> <br /> The heads and wrinkles easily and easily come out because the passengers are well lubricated. the ship owner <br /> <br /> Then, the disaster attacks destruction and goes to the island of the area where monks let young girls die killing young girls to restore their lives. <br /> </ p> <p> Just when you think everything was fine, there are piracies in the water. Yum Yum German great fat to have dinner. <br /> <br /> Just for the next zombie party.
