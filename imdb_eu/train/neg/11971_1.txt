It's always worth seeing a movie made with Bruce Willis, but this works better. I saw this on TV, so I did not have to take any money. I'm lucky. <br /> <br /> The earth slowly develops very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes or roughly incredible, it will be increasingly unbelievable at the end. It is very doubtful if a good soldier such as Lieutenant Waters disobeyed direct orders. And yet, if the rest of the squadron wants it. I know they put them directly at risk, and they know if they will die if they continue, but that's our Lt, so let's say (remembering the direct commands, remember). <br /> However, there are pretty scenes in this movie. They saved a town, where the rebels killed the whole population. Well, they save a dozen farmers, the rest killed. A strange part of this, the rebels took the trucks that were behind them. They go forward on foot. Maybe the roads are not safe, but there is no explanation. However. I think the movie has got the point I got. <br /> <br /> What happened to the brain of the movie, and it is so incredible that a group of 7 soldiers could kill many rebels. They are injured or killed. Near the end, they lose some friends. And that's because they need to fight with an army of nearly 500 or more. Did you believe that? <br /> <br /> They fight so much against the army, hundreds of them kill themselves, and they only release themselves. And they have rounds and rolls. Never run out Grenades and clay pits, an M60 gun as well as an RPG. Where do things come from? About or what? They also got a laptop that shows the activity of rebel enemies. And this laptop has a day-to-day battery. Really Who thinks it's pure <br /> <br /> I think that if your brain is completely switched off and if you assume that rebels are stupid, this movie gives you a high score. Otherwise, skip this. It saves you time.
