It is very difficult to make an impartial trial about such a movie, because it was so young for me. It's definitely the worst kind of exploitation film. I was unhappy to watch this movie for the first time in my youth, I will never forget it. I never thought it was a horrible movie. Then I saw again this year and I was terrified again. <br /> <br /> I'm not telling any one or another to say what it should not do, but something I took. The rape was a great sign in this movie. I love lowbrow movies but this one is simply nasty. Rent instead of Rus Myer.
