I read Chris_mrant_grant commentary from the United States. <br /> <br /> He wrote: "A 1924 Fantasy Documentary. This first geography of today's Iraq was a powerful 20th century geography." We want to thank Chris and the Bakhtiari Iranians, the people of Zagros Mountains and the people who are interested in it and have watched the Grass movie, fighting A Nation's life. These habits you've seen on the film lasted for centuries and lasted for a long time. I am from Iran. I'm Bakhtiari. <br /> <br /> Chris, I am sorry for you in Bakhtiari region of Zardkuh region, but it's not in Iraq, as you mentioned in the Iraq comment. Iran and Iraq are two different and different countries. Taking Iranians out of Iran is almost like an American just like to take a Mexican. Thanks, <br /> <br /> Ziba
