Power Rangers, an amazing show of the 90s, is still confusing young children with bad moods and awesome settings. <br /> <br /> This show was not an entertainment, it was an excuse to show violence for children. Fight against children, to solve their differences. <br /> <br /> The toys showed how to promote a violent television program. <br /> <br /> I've never been able to discover the ultimate goal of this absolutely riotous show. <br /> <br /> In this way, one of the most mysterious children of all ages remains.
