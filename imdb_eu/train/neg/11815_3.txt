The bad little operetta made in a Valentino stage with a prototype Eddy-McDonald is so bad that it turns into a five-minute exercise. It is absurd to go, because this shortness opens up with the military of two men with the kindness of an officer's son. In a matter of minutes, he goes to Morocco, where he lives twice the Red Shark; A leader of an Arab tribe who prefers more than fighting. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare have lightweight opera (with a small performance) and a decent bass, but it's acting. So you get a feeling of poorly prepared scene to do little things. <br /> <br /> This reluctance was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers. They may have room for more events and even more appearances, despite some entertaining values, but running this rush is not more than just an insults to a waiting audience.
