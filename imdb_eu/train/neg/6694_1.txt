I really expected that I had seen Kari from other things in this movie and I think that I have little talent. Unfortunately, this is a case study that is not required for these script. Absolutely defined characters with no likeability and no plot. Is a road / friend / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? The filmmakers have no idea, and we do not.
