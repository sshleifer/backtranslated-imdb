I thought that I would go and see the terrifying movie and I was scattered throughout the movie. I thought it was a joke in the scene that made human beings a wolf. Today's computer games are cheer up to ten times better. The low budget is a good comment. Wolf (1994) I would recommend Jack Nicholson to a good man in the movie. They should be good special effects (human beings to transform the man's wolf). If you do not want to be good, I do not recommend watching this movie. This movie is a joke.
