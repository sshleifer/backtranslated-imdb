There is no doubt that these films make cadets training: Chick Davis Major (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer created to create a new type of soldier from his cadets. But it is not so rigid and unjust. Indeed, his opinion also changed the value of the military workforce. It's tough when it's there, but sometimes it's a clear mix of coaches and pastors, which has improved roles in other movies. Its nature is the basis of action that rotates everything. O'Brien looks like a natural task, and she plays fashionably. They help this movie: the performance of O'Brien and the ending of spectacular special effects.
