Strange, almost all reviewers are very positive about this movie. Because it's 1975 and it's Chamberlain and Curtis and is it for that reason forgiving pardon and children's stories? <br /> <br /> Maybe there are some people feeling because they read the book about this movie? (I do not read the book, but I do not think it's a problem, filmmakers never think that the readers have read the book). <br /> <br /> Or is it wasted, because I am concerned about the English-speaking actors trying to act like their French counterparts?
