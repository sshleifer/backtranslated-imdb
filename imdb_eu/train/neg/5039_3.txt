Rex Reed repeatedly said that filming ("Julia and Julia") was shot through a grenade juice. He reminded me of the bulb when I was sprinkled with Butterfly. He appeared to have shot through Gaza. <br /> <br /> The story was boring and it was not helpful if the scenes were the focus of most of the actors on the scene, or if they only focused on it. time <br /> <br /> In addition, everyone had the same look, so it was difficult to distinguish between the characters. I call the "Poet's Killing Society" Syndrome. <br /> <br /> There was no one to take care of anybody, so that there was no great interest, and the historical light film was not in a very interesting time period. <br /> <br /> Totally disappointed.
