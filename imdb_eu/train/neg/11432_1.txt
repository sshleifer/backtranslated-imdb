Yesterday I watched the movie and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh, basically, had to wear this unbelievable generosity for five hours (or, in any case, it was long). From the beginning, each of the elements of this film is incredible. This movie ridiculed me several times, but we did not believe that we were feeling scattered about the incident that the director / writer really hopes to publish the film together. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the problem Gray (Graham) and privacy. Things are interesting with his brother when he suddenly realizes that they are going to go too far. <br /> <br /> Interesting and interesting. However, instead of converting this story into something compelling and enjoyable, the director never thinks Gray makes any sense in these jokes. In addition to LGBT being an individual, this film suggests that all heterosexuals believe in the future process. (I'm scared by the hope of the writer.) If it was not a good chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (that is, it was compulsory), I would give it 3 negative stars.
