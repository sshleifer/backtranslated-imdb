Scoring one. An average thriller; De Niro recommends going to the psyche. In the end, this is an example of this genre, that is, without exaggeration, almost inviolable, immune pain. I did not like the origin of the 60's, and this version is not a big improvement. I do not know why Scores lost time in a remake. Again, considering recent bad films (I'm talking about his sad Buddhist film and those whose favorite actress Di Caprio has had), this is not the opposite. And because Spielberg wanted to remake ... it could be worse.
