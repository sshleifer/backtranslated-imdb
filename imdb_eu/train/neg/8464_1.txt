I can face very bad science / fiction and horror movies: I do 4 or 5 years of observation, so I've seen bad things, but I treat them. I've seen many SciFi Channel movies so much that I do not expect - a talk that is not usually a promising non-movie. I hope it's eternal hope, I think - or hope of victory as it says more than experience. Unfortunately, from the beginning I was a dog and I know, but like a saddle, I continued to think about the flame, something that would be interesting. It does not. All actors give a decent performance - by giving the script, I do not know how to keep the correct faces. Hungry melt is something that happens with hunger parasitic creatures, slowly, at the same time, human beings take a body. A bad plastic surgeon works with the enemy, giving him an outward appearance of humans ... do not worry about what happens. Slug people do not know where they come from, they think they might think they could do a stranded landwalk, but ... somehow they know the slug kingdoms - the slug prince has it. He has helped grow up with a human being, he knows that he loves to love himself as a queen meat ... oh, do I need? Please, I ask you, do not miss out on seeing this 2 hour of your life ... it would be better ... think the worst and most pleasant way to spend two hours ... better than that.
