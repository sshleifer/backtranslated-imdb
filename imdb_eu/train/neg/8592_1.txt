The previous book and the movie director of "true" Star Wars trilogy could also be taxed ... Lucas is not a film maker. <br /> <br /> A good man in the darkness needs a good actor ... Christensen is not that actress. <br /> <br /> The first 60-80 minutes are still boring with other lighter swords, but there is still no corner left for the main characters you already know to survive from the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) is very functional here and it's about being the best Jar Jar Binks silent idea! <br /> <br /> No movie chooses only when the Chancellor Jedi throws it and the lava falls has a great sequence.
