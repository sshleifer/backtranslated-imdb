I was delighted to find the final credits, because Detroit PDA was grateful for their participation. There is also a line that speaks of the police chief (and the boy can say he can not play). The reason for the game is that the police are first filming and then ask questions. It's not a PR, I think a policeman would like. In addition, this is your standard police and robberies dressed in the 70s, with a race angle. Alex Rocco is not pleased with the role of a policeman who does not go along with the wife of the elderly illness. It's hanging in the locker room. Hari Rhodes is a pair of clothes worn by his closet and follows behind the suspect wearing a septum. The film makes sense to move to the last dirt (why do the people guilty of a robbery take over the entire police force?). Not only do we see a shoot, but four bad ones, we'll see four. Then the thought ends with the thought of what would happen to be guessing, but only he thought how stupid he was. When Arthur Marks was looking at the "Friday Foster" and "Bucktown" braindead, I would not ask.
