Julia Roberts, of course, tries to confuse Pretty Woman with her sad sad thriller, but it is hard to imagine a powerful and credible performance (and as Oscars won) based on the back of this Erin Brokovich garbage. And do not worry about it, it's just a vehicle for Julia Roberts, but unfortunately, his performance is not much less about it. <br /> <br /> The plot has all the late-night marks. for the cable, and have no idea whatsoever of offering an overview of the dark world of domestic abuse so that the characters are not sufficiently careful. <br /> <br /> In the end, depressing and unpleasant, if not named by the name Roberts, I would surely have broken down, meritfully.
