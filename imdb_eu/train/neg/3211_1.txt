And it goes into the "extremely bad" category, that is to say, the students would rent a drunk movie. It was at the Film Festival and I remember a wave of political laughter that was first released. Other critics will better describe the fecal character of this film, and I felt the poor man in the production company to feel very bad to measure the audience's reaction. The student was the equivalent of a drunk audio-visual, and after making a movie from "anime" of anime, I thought it was "blue sky", the viewer was in a dark mood, and then the movie went out and in seconds, everyone walked on the island. I will score the worst point; <br /> <br /> Script: The funniest part of this movie, and the worst part, has a linear and predictable road. Rubbish, but wild. <br /> <br /> Animation: You can put them wrong and collect, you can put extravagant origins and gradually put on the heroine's costumes (I know!), then be careful. A monstrous "monster" from LADY DEATH from the Swedish farm! <br /> <br /> Characters: so it is painful in its unique dimension, there is a brief history behind it (with the lines that break through the conversation) and the small light reflected on the motivation of some of the main characters. <br /> <br /> So, in short, if you put on a captive audience and drinks (try and make sure they 're' alleviating alcohol again), then filmed this movie on the DVD and "Mystery Science Theater 3000" mentality. There is no other motivation than to laugh at seeing this movie, which is not a comedy. DO NOT USE IMPORTANT USEFUL. Working with Kolin Farrell to be more monotonous than "New World" can be quite boring, you will not be able to laugh at your mumble friends or two friends.
