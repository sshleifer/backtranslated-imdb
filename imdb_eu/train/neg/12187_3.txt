De Niro Scorses, the worst collaborator in the co-operation of this horrible violent battle. Scorsese is utterly excluded from this element of the movie, which seems to be frightened and suddenly shameless, from that master craftsman. The stroke is totally lost and the southern accents are very annoying and forced. Nick Noltik plays the most famous lawyer in history, who could have defended anyone! The psychotic Niroren Bowden in the 90s is just a typical psychopassist. De Niro and Lewis's early stage is very bad and the high point continues, and we all have never been tired of the dead psychologist. One of the great films of my experiences. Renting origin is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
