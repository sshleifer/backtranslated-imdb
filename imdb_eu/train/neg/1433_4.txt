The images are magnificent and the landscapes of Canada are well reflected. On the other hand, the story was very boring; It was a love story before my eyes that it was a love story in the woods like Titanic. I did not feel that Gray Owl was a great ecologist. I often liked Lord Attenborough, but this was ... bad.
