Whoa nelly! I've heard a lot of reviews about it ... but I think it's disappointing to go to my horror review. The man was directly in his nose! This film was a pure amateur. They needed to be taken, maybe two in each scene, the movie seemed soooo rushed. The script was also bad ... they tried to be unique but the lines failed. Miserably "Take out your meathooks!" Oh, man, I hate trying to make movies. It's all time running with comedy ... but with a horror movie and below average actors ... the results are very pathetic. Lines and scenes were very predictable. But since I was feeling negatively on this movie, it was performed. It was wonderful. Also, this little Asian guy worked in the booth. I thought it was excellent. <br /> <br /> The movie is about 5 stupid tourists that are on holiday in Asia. They end up in a bad place and fall into the hands of a mafia's sex / slaughterhouse. The story seems wonderful. But seeing someone who has a bad case is probably more fun and more spectacular. The only reason for this fear is dying. There was no trace of suspense. <br /> <br /> I liked other horror lovers because of its small blood flow. But unfortunately, the movie was very disappointing with the great U HANDIA. I liked the ankle and blood effects. They were also trap flakes. <br /> <br /> Dream about this movie. Ryan Nicholson's first feature film, and most of the time he failed. It is not denied that it has a sense of humor and sense of horror. I think I'm going to play its next movie as a horror movie of no other than B ... Knowing what this will be. After this dismay, Ryan is ready to give me another shot. As I have seen, the genre is a real man. Good luck next, this was a bad news.
