As a fan of "Jane Eyre", I was excited when the movie came out. "In the end," I thought, "someone will follow the story of this book written by the author." Wrong! The casting director clearly wanted to throw a "Jane", he surely got it. However, he could possibly do something he could possibly do. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the horrible suspense of the novel when the laughter came into the night, apparently from nowhere? Where was her mother's dance and dancing the child's brightness? Finally, why did the plot change at the end? Keep in mind that scriptwriters read the book. What a despair
