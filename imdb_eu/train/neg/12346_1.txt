The basic premise of this film is a political drawing. I believe that for those who do not know about military realities, this is probably a "sensitive" film about gender equality. In fact, a final comment stated: "Women want to know what they can do." What claptrap! Nobody, man or woman, can do everything they can to do and unfortunately Demi Moore has set up the SEAL Hell Week weekend in a 27-week BUD / S program for some sessions in the local gym and their only wishes. Only SEAL will do that. There is an 80% reduction rate, probably the hardest military training - those who voluntarily dispose of, who can not compete physically, suffer frequent physical injury during training or can not handle persecution psychologically. I have never gotten over the explanation of the invented message of this film. In the real world, Demi was not going to last for the first 24 hours in this hard and lasting physical training. Wanting to be alone is not done. Skip this movie as a mode of thinking, and better spend time reading "The Warrior Elite" by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001) to describe what's really going on in this training. Call the bell, Demi! <br /> <br />
