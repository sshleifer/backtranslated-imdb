Alan Alda plays George Plimpton's vivid "Sports Illustrated" as a member of the Detroit Lions football team. It's a strange drama adorned with fantasy. The director of Alex March takes an interesting material about this material, shooting almost a documentary in fashion (with a macho comment) and, nevertheless, touching Capraesque's whim! However, emphasizing on the stage the film, the main narrative becomes nasty. Alda's slight and charismatic behavior is another handicap, even if young supporters meet real life athletes (and Lauren Hutton, as a girlfriend in Alda, how fancy a fantasy is?). * 1/2 ****
