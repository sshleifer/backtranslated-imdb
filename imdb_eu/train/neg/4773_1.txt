good storyline, good emotion ... but the last 10 seconds destroyed the whole movie ... what happened? Well done and a good story that has been destroyed in the last seconds ... sorry, but to vote 1 ... it's worth it, I think that Chris Shadley will bring better results ... but maybe next :) Does all this sense of blood bleed? At the end he was approaching the story to 10, but he did not ... at the end he destroyed the whole story, I think most people do not want to end up with a movie, even if it's intricate ... but it's not over ... sorry
