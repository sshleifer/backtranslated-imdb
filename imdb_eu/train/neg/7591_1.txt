This movie is a novel by John Fante. Why could someone tell you? I do not see any reason to think that this beautiful book should be adjusted accordingly. If you want to make a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, ask how you can ask Dust (novel)? -And if you want to make this story a movie, why would you want to become a Hollywood Hollywood production melodramatic with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek? I do not know. <br /> <br /> The adaptation of the story is wrong, and if you read the book and liked it, I'm sure you do not like it with Towne. . <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, you might find some extravagant pieces of jewelry, bad performances and a bit of cinematic cinema. But you expect the best. I really expected this movie. I really wanted to be good. But it's worse, and it's as simple as reading Fantes, this is not a good movie. Only a romantic melodramatic production of Hollywood is a bad performance, lack of structure and, of course, many shots by Colin Farells. time I have seen it. Bullet I had to see it, I like the book so much and curious. And I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 The muscles of Colin were muscled. So sweet ... I spent all the time, I gave him 2/10.
