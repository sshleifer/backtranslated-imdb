I expected a lot from this movie. It's like a character like Naustradamous like Lee, but instead I got all the time lost and boring movie. I can not explain this movie. It was a wooden play, like the terrible texts written by the parts of the Bible, such as hurricanes, boats and earthquakes. But it was late! The rest had to wait and I expected that something would happen, but not. This movie is about a couple who are trying to get to know the changes that are happening in the world, just like in a place where there was an earthquake in China and end up in a convent that leads eight nuns and a priest. Convent has become a key to lies. The entire movie is boring. One of the wrong laws.
