How difficult is it to write a short film with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Here it seems very difficult for writers. <br /> <br /> I still do not know how Santa is younger and Vince (who plays BIG brother) is older than 20. I needed to lose that part of the story, but the truth did not matter. Many scenes appeared and they were detected; "The funny idea" is the scene of the drugs that are too much in the way where the WAY comedy is lost. <br /> <br /> The director or producer tried to "tear Jerker" at the end, that is, it might be. It was appropriate if anything had been worthwhile from that point on. <br /> <br /> Well, great despair. I see a lot of people like to have fun, because they feed a lot of people, but I'm waiting for that DVD. It's NOT worth 23,978 dollars for your family to take your movies up to date.
