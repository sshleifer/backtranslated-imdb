Wow ... what can I say ... First of all, the IMDb said at the end of the 60's ... Carlito said that it would be very close to jail, when he was 75 years old and said he was 5 years old. No one was a bunch of actors and a story was also sensible. They bring a single actor from Guzman and they are completely different. Why ended with him and Puerto Rican cock? Gale? She said she was in love before. Kleinfeld? He said he knew he was ... He was supposed to be here. And if that is sensible, where are Rocco and the black guy in the first? It was totally stupid ... Pacino and the insult to the first film.
