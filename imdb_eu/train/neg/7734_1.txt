This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story line is weak: I can not continue. The performance is a high school. It annoys the soundtrack. No humor attempts. The edition is horrible. Credits are slow; I would be ashamed to link my name to that film's waste. Do not waste your time thinking about this attempt to play.
