This must be one of the worst movie ever I have ever seen. I think that a college rebel basketball player, his coach, his girlfriend, and a classmate (who plays Michael Margotta) is constantly nervous rebels. The story is nowhere, zero character development is there, no one cared for, and performances, except Bruce Dern coach, is horrible. It's hard to believe that a tale like Jack Nicholson has the direct direction of that film. Be sure to avoid this turkey.
