People like me will scratch this movie. It is not realistic. The plot is foreseen. You can save all the things that are happening, of course, they find the treasure and become rich, and deceive the bad man. We saw it a million times before. The writers of this film have to think that most of the public films are stupid. They should be correct because most people really like this movie. Sometimes I mean repairing inventions. Under the hidden treasure room hidden underneath Manhattan? All the work under the New York underground shows that this room was discovered earlier. And everything that was built in the Civil War? Please, Ben and Abigail's love story? how nice it was, and I thought that the love of Clive Cussler's novels was weak. They just fell in love, in 2 seconds, I would take care of saving my lead, and then getting some. with a girl and a stupid paper. 1/10 Garbage
