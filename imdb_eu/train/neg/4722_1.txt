Do not see this Serb documentary and Serbian propaganda look at this documentary and you will see facts and truths http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ <br /> <br /> Yugoslav Death Series documentary (of five sections) Old Federal Yugoslavia The end of the first half-full period of the 1990s is a serious account of the spread of massive blood flow in the masses. News interviews and interviews by many participants "Jugoslav" and otherwise. The only "improvements" that could be made for this stunning achievement would have been the introduction of Balkan developments later in the program. That was precisely the end of the 1990s to make the BBC repeat television, but even adding some recent events will help to complete the most emblematic and fulsome piece of this work. Perhaps another episode can be guaranteed? A very short title of this documentary was better suited to the fact that the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro "abandoned the so-called" Yugoslavia ", much later in the recognition of what happened in those years. /> <br /> No fiction in "Yugoslavia: The Evitable War (1999)" mode.
