It is difficult to say something worse about this show: performance, poor acoustic partitioning, bad CGI, bad guesses of the time, poor script. It would be nice if the script was closer to the original story. Beowulfen will have enough voltage and material to be used by the screenwriters for a great intelligent material and a better story. /> <br /> And why introduce a new weapon like a crossbow that generates explosives? <br /> <br /> I see this movie as "only" in 21 days. Quality is lacking. I began to think of general (poor) approaches to the Sci-Fi channels (and others), since making movies from classic movies in recent years. <br /> <br /> What is the waste!
