It is often said that movies can not be the same as the original book. Well, in this case, the movie is not as good as the book, but the book is an insult. I'd rather like the Milan Kundera novel than just being "something" called "righteous". on your shoulders or on the softness of being? "It is abandoned, and instead of all the films, Daniel Day Lewis" (I can not say Tomas) sexual adventure, his mum wife, his mistress, and other lovers. Fran√ßois Truffaut said: bad directors do bad films. Do not waste time and money. Read the book, but it's worth it.
