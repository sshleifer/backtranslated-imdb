Other reviewers have said that the last 1/2 hour movie is dead. However, the outlook and Kate Capshaw has an amazing performance, he has never discovered his character and ruins his scene. Connery is just like Fishbourne, but most of the scenes affect the effect as a whole. Unreality with a sense. And the end is just curious. When filmmakers apparently knew this mess, they all needed to be delicious potatoes and pumpkin recipes to have Thanksgiving dinner. That's why, to compensate, too many "dramatic" scores were added. Every single jump is supported by orchestra breeders. If you want an example of a big league movie, you should watch it, or jump on it.
