Munduko ustezko amaierari buruzko edozein film egiteko, gertakari batzuk eta errealismoa izan beharko lirateke 1. Jendeak inoiz zergatik sinesten duten zergatik ez dakigu. 2. This is the New Year's Eve in Toronto Canada. HOW TO FOLLOW THE APPLICATION IS OLD, AND WHY SILVER GELATZEN ZUURDEA (on the basis of clothing) was YOUR TIME <br /> <br /> 3. The play came at the neo au au natural, with the director, could do. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4. The individual parts of the story, and there were no asaldurik were helburuik. I could continue, but I do not want this film to be as boring. <br /> <br /> rating * 1/2 (4) 2 IMDB scale <br /> <br /> thank you as always I am <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSSMAN
