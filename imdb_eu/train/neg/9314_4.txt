Well ... in general, this movie was not worth the money, and above all, it was a horror movie that came to comedy. I rented this movie last night and I and my friends started scrounging. This is definitely not what we were looking for, but we are glad for our mood. The actors in this film (especially Brandon) are so fake, it's fun. And, above all, when Tracy is said to be in a room on a table, to tell the dog outside. They have almost no emotion, and they are so evident that they are revealing. And when the clown plays the role of the black box when he is searched for this thing and Mark captures it, he does not seem afraid of it as if the clown caught him and started to attack him. And seriously, would you just play jogging if you run away? I would be sitting in life! (Even if someone should be poor because it is like 300 kg). Note that the effects are not very exquisite, such as when the clown flows into Susan's forest, and then spills it to mind. Denise and Tracy's room Denise Everyone spots over the head. In the same way as in the previous word, at the beginning it does not make sense and I do not know why the movie was included too. So what is this movie in 2003? He made the sound of music as in the 1980s, and cameramen (?) It was not really a professional appearance. It seems half time that the camera can not stay stable. Overall, I liked the movie. However, I would not recommend it if you want to find something to scare you, but if you want to scatter it or make fun of it, I'm sure.
