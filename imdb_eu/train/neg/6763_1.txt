God, what awful things! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something (see a great deal of music and pictures here), but what really is? Everything that is "behind the killers of the born" seems to be "clear", as the media can turn into trash, but unfortunately it turns into rough movies. Please, Mr. Stone, next time you want to criticize the next television violence criticism to get high rates, avoid doing the same with your movie! Michael Haneke said the fascist film fascist movement was fascinated by the media. What is the truth ... He only said that he had forgotten about his headache before he was overweight!
