This movie was 10 minus but unfortunately it was not offered. <br /> <br /> Why did not I walk in the first five minutes of this movie, I can not say? I would go with my instinct and I immediately left it !! Many of our theater people went unfortunately. <br /> <br /> The stories were missing a movie critique. No earthquake Tremendous impact! Robin Williams was so disappointing that they did not see the other movie I've never seen. There was no single story in the story beyond the salon lectures. I liked the Tazer scene. It was not bad to have some flesh in the plot of nonsense. Someone needs the writer and director of this movie!
