I was not surprised by Dant's surprise with the offer of the "Homecoming" season, there was not much horror story, but a pretty statement about the dead. Screwfly is the story of a male anti-virus virus in the world, replacing the male sexual tendency with women's murderous tendencies. The episode starts a short film about flying screws that slew scientists. Then there is a short scene where a man arrested when he found a man at home. I think it's supposed to show off the beginning of corruption, but it's not clear because it's ever reviewed. The episode continues a bit by entering the characters of blah blah blah. It seems like mysterious, but the section continues to grow worse and worse until its end is sad and unpleasant. The worst event Well, except for chocolate.
