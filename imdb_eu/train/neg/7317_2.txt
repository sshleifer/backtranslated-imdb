After reading the comments on this film, I'd like to share my opinion, that is, it's a tough movie, if you do not see Brooksophile in its entirety. I'm not. <br /> <br /> Looking at some simple looks, the movie is an imbalance that is unbalanced, so it can be absorbed by the most frequent neurosis. It's hard to see. The character of Brooks (Robert Cole) is so sensitive and unpleasant that it is difficult to relate to it-not for the root-while dying from one's own dysfunction. And it has never been a topless scene, and I hope to be taken seriously in a romantic context. Nobody could ever swallow a baby like Kathryn Harrold - - Albert Brooks, of Albert Brooks, of course, if he had not. <br /> <br /> "Modern Romance" has its fun moments ----- but is fragmentary and infrequent. In most cases, I felt that I am feeling like I am with a person who does not like me on a limited trip and that I wanted to finish it already. It confirms the problems that may arise when it is placed in a single person with too much control over a film (for someone who is self-disciplined to go back and see what is happening). <br /> Most popular people, James L. Brooks, is a film directed by the director. Six years later, Albert Brooks successfully completed the "Broadcast News". James has shown us how Albert can create a compelling and entertaining romantic comic. Albert allows us to see James (usually not cast as an actor) in a strange little comic book. <br /> <br /> "Modern Romance" enthusiasts will now comment on the next praise. about it. For me ---- I'm telling you, there's enough grief in the world without finding a movie as an entertainment.
