So far, I'm a little disappointed in the second week of "The Beauty of Lone". <br /> <br /> Some of the plays are good, except for drama. <br /> <br /> I do not know how people feel like "Drama of fiction" in the "Thatcher" years is a drama because of this coverage, but I feel that the book won is much better. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> A promise of a government that is full of Sleaze.
