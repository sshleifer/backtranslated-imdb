Look carefully at the wonderful talents of making this movie: Cameras made by Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, Slezak, Lange and Plimpton. In the sword they prove that the good cast is not able to save a good script. In the story, the viewers ask for a lot of leaps in faith, as well as Hollywood standards. It is not particularly original and "twisted" is incredibly cruel.
