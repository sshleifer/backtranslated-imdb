This movie is an essay to present Jared Diamonds, "Guns, Germs and Steel", as a way of explaining how Europe is the world. <br /> <br /> I watched this documentary version with 3 records. hours I think the information could be presented in 20 minutes. Jared Diamond is a completely unnecessary scenario for bird watching through binoculars: unless Jared Diamond instructs the bow and arrows correctly, the teacher Jared Diamond is badly charged. Does this documentary supposedly be the hero "Jared diamond instructor?" This part of the documentary was so bad. Worst Diamond was displaying and crying when he was looking after malaria in an African hospital. This does not understand theories of "Guns, Germs and Steel". BTW, "Guns, Germs and Steel" has been said 100 times. "Can European guns, germs and steers get out of this bad state? Be up to date and know!" When it finally leads to the business, the same parts of its theory are interesting and very boring. The peoples of other European countries conquered their villages, as opposed to guns and logs of stone and wood weapons. Do I really want a teacher to persuade me? They are interested in how parts of the theory that explain how advantages are being conquered by Europeans, but the coverage is thin paper. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think that only the documentary was trying. I was persuaded that they are as capable as European Europeans. I know not racist. Despite being a racist, Jared Diamond would not convince me when using my original tools. <br /> <br /> I do not think adults are public for this documentary. Children can enjoy me, though. I read this documentary much better than the documentary.
