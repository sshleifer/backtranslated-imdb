Twin twin brothers (as a result of their parents' deaths) are twenty-five years old later gathered to avenge their parents and retrieve a million dollars tunnel. Double Impact lasts for two hours and basically adds a realistic approach to the corsican brothers and Jean-Claude Van Damme, whose twin brother is as daunting as a twin brother. Likewise, action sequences are not so exciting this time and Jean-Claude is shooting more in his martial arts. Also, the support cast is wasted and in two hours the movie is just dull. <br /> <br /> * from 4 (bad)
