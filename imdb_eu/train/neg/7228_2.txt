Good: <br /> <br /> An effective color scheme. Good outfits Basic production set. CGI buildings and specific vehicles. <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> It mixes a fabulous blend of all the CGI actors with Fifth Element and Fantasy Fantasy. The CGI actors have seen worse than video games a few years ago. Bad logic A giant pyramid shows up and nobody investigates; Nobody questions me? And there's no explanation why he threw Horus the gods, and was there no reason to do something like Jill with Jill? <br /> <br /> Ugly: <br /> <br /> Awful script. So, we have ideas that do not fully execute the necessary sub-planes. The dialog box almost doubted. Unnecessary random characters and events. Sad people Jill is supposed to be a mystery, but apparently it was just a mystery to the writer. There is nothing He is not interested and bored to see. It has no substance, no texture. Its character is no street. Actually, there is not a film, any purpose, any purpose (apart from obvious), the only character with any motivation. They are weak and poorly thought out. There is no attitude: the input screen key. Horus is not an immortal one, but, of course, it is a bad man. It can not be explained whether Horus or Jill is the main character. That is the problem: offering half of the movie to each character means that the writer does not fully analyze a character, he never knows anything. They are made of cardboard cuts, they walk around and talk and do almost nothing about studying fine pieces. First time director. Slow, slow, sluggish. Still watching the movie while I'm writing this. I can not care that it is boring. Everything is flat. Action is also not interesting because it is short-term and sometimes useless. <br /> <br /> Overview: <br /> <br /> You are not worth the clock. The Threadbare story, the development of sub-characters characters, crisp CGI is not a nice set.
