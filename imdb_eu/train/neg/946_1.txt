Why is this famous show so famous? I like it for myself. I think it's a bad outside location. <br /> <br /> It's so popular, I have tried to see it more than once and I can not do it through a whole episode. <br /> <br /> First, acting is horrible. They all face an annoying point. They speak non-natural voices, they use natural shades and have a non-natural body language. I've seen a better performance in the nursery school. <br /> <br /> For another thing, NOT OK. The plot is dull. They are not creative, intelligent or funky. Would not a sitcom be fun? Why do not I laugh? <br /> <br /> Finally, what is it seventy years of age? As is the case in the seventies, "Happy Days" has been in the fifties. <br /> <br /> OH and what's up with Ashton Kutcher? Who fired this unfortunate? And is it now making movies? Oh, save us! <br /> <br /> If people think it's a quality television, I'm worried.
