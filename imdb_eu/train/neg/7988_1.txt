Anita and Me Meera Syal, the author and script of the novel, seem to be more than just an excuse to convey English prejudices, complaints and general antipathy. In this movie, the feeling of superiority over Indians with English is wrong. <br /> <br /> The English in this movie are overweight, violent, blunt, confused, childish, stupid, depicted as a lesson. , racist, ugly, bad food and absurdity - of course, it can only be translated into Indian culture by the local priests at the end of the "exchange" film. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, the Indian family is beautiful, clear, educated, can speak a lot of languages, careful and loving parents and grammar school. The film is so terribly frightening, I'm surprised that the BBC has funded it. Otherwise, as it was depicted as an English family in an Indian community, the movie would look like a racist. <br /> <br /> Sometimes my eyebrows crumbled to my forehead. I thought I would come in my queue. First of all, the memorable scenes of Divali celebration women: the context: English are dirty and confusing - and men - under text: English women are prostitutes. Secondly, Anita's meal, where the Neema family talks about a lie-off tool - the text below: English is so stupid, you can do anything. <br /> <br /> But the contempt of English that does nothing. Marriage is a contempt, it is evident through the film. I ended the annoying character so badly drawn - a pretty fallen female tropea - an angry movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a "bend" like Beckham that is focused on loving humor. The abuses of family behavior and habits of a community community in this community, and a movie about two girls from different origins. Instead of Anita and Me, cultural apartheid seems to be essential, since English is a virtually unbelievable caste, which emphasizes the thin attacks on the "other" community of the film. english <br /> <br /> I felt that I was a work done by Anita and Me. That is why the BBC should not finance its production.
