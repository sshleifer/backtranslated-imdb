I confess that I only saw some passages, but each one seemed to be completely different from the next. After the first season, the producers decided to completely adapt the show, to drop their characters, introduce them again and write their show again. <br /> <br /> Probably as you have already guessed, it's the show. Holly (Imanda Bynes) a teenager unpredictable, with Valerie (Jennie Garth), who is tallest in New York. Decent premise: rare couples + fish outside of the water + high treasures. <br /> <br /> Although the old commentaries are lost, this show, unfortunately, loses fun and again, and it is sad because it has a talented talent. . <br /> <br /> Over everything, to change the show (when Val did a regular magazine of a season, then he disappeared, he opened the bakery, what?) When things change, you'll see it completely * show * that you know it's wrong. I mean, a whole new set, new characters and new shows! <br /> <br /> On a side note (that is, just), I know this is a television show that is not real, but Val and Holly loft duplex live on the floor (stairs) with a terrace ... MANHATTAN! Are you serious?
