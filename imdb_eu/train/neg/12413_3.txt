I do not say that this movie is horrible, because they have seen it worse, but it's not nearly half. <br /> <br /> The earth is very confusing. I can not know what happened and where it was happening. When the movie was over, I broke my head. At the end of the credits I saw something that they could clean up, but after finishing the credits, that was it. I felt that I was jittery across the whole lot of the plot, with little or no space between them. <br /> <br /> Character development is very profound. I could not find out when someone was angry or somebody was fighting. I can not tell you to imagine that half of the character was drunk, stoned, challenged, or bad. It seems that this film is about stereotypes (its credit, it's not difficult to use when making a movie about a singer in a rock band), it should simplify the development of the characters, as many other films have already illustrated. children who suffer from abuse, or tests that are trying to clear the heroine addiction. Stereotypes are easy to imagine, which would explain why too many stereotypical characters in so many bad films. On the other hand, this film uses stereotyped characters to the left and to the right, but then tries to keep it incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> A problem with the characters seemed unexplained. I think that because it's okay, because the characters had spent so little time, I had no chance at all, so I never missed one of them. <br /> <br /> And at last, but not least it was Sada's song. It's wonderful. The protection of his music is not rewarded, but the screeches from Sadie's voiced voices usually stifle. I promise you to sing a song at least one song of at least 10 minutes. I guessed that I thought I should have been forgotten. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is confusing. The badly developed characters, the Georgian makers are wooden and rigid, Sadie's character is trunking from one state to another, without a background story or explanation. Music has been overwhelming and I do not think good reasons to see this movie unless it's a bad movie.
