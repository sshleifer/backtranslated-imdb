Well, I saw the movie yesterday and it's worse than you think it's unfortunately. Soil is first and foremost idiotic, it has no sense. The script is full of entertaining and entertaining conversations. The public often laughed. And the suspension is very small. The actors play so much, with the exception of Sharon Stone, which has good times but also bad actors. When the worst part is trying to be aggressive, when they say "I want a * Bip *," it seems, slowly, that the woman is very rude and not sexy. Bi1 erotic tension has completely disappeared. From Basic Instinct 2, the technical one is a minimal movie, DVD is better than normal, but is much smaller than the original movie. For example, the unfortunate joke scene is wrong. Basic Instinct 2 Director Paul Verhoeven is not and shows. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and his shows. The script is made by people who do not join Joe Eszterhas. There's no substitute for Michael Douglas. Something cheap and bad movie has been edited. I'm sorry, but when I got out of the theater I thought: "Why did they do this first movie and the first success of the film with their original talents?" All the original film is like Citizen Kane. The basic first instinct is a classic and it broke into popular cinema. She was acting sexy and controversial. Sharon Stone has been the best in his career. He had the style of Paul Verhoeven. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 is a funny and misguided movie that has been badly targeted and has won many Razzie awards in many categories. It's a pity that they made this movie.
