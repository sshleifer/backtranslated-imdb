Losing time is a completely unnecessary restoration of a wonderful movie. No new or original is left out of the blows against Perry, but rather a marginal interest. The documentary feeling of the first film was so urgent that it was so effective. In addition, Quincy Jones has added a lot to the original movie. I can not understand such a great deal of appreciation. It's very bad. Why does anyone waste time or money doing such noise and why have I lost my time watching?
