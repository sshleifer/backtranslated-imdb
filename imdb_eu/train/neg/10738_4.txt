This was a blind DVD used. When I was playing when I was going, I had a good morning. <br /> <br /> The head of the bubble is comedy, but it is. squalid Land ZANY! It is, but the characters make things so small and disturbed and comfortable. In the end, I think it's depressing. <br /> <br /> Maybe I hope more than a box with an irregular and goofy caper film. (I know, I know, kutxa quotes and Oscar nomination means nothing).
