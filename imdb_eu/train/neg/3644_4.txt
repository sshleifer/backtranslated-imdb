This movie is pretty bad. The operation is abysmal and absolutely obligatory. Also, filming as a docudrama movie does not necessarily make you more credible, you can not get it that easy, Mr Dir. Do not mislead my comments, however, I recommend that you watch this movie, because psychology or psychology behind the authors of these crimes makes it clear. However, the incident of the film is quite rough! There's no other way! It's clean and it just goes wrong with the atmosphere! What happens does not cause me any desperation, horror, fear, or fear, probably in such horrible circumstances. No, however, it's just dropping jaws, "was it?" You spell your language, and in no way are they haunted by the action of these guys. But you just feel embarrassed to still have another movie that started a potential, but eventually it falls into the most important point of her loose face. Zero Day indeed .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
