Had it been a serious attempt to film the Ashanti slave's organization, film still prevailing in third world countries could have a better reception. Instead, star becomes a movie star made in a movie that has been filmed and has unexpectedly paid. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine and his wife, Beverly Johnson, are working in the United Nations at the World Health Organization and working in East African Africa. Peter Ustinov will come together, who can hardly call the ham, as a Muslim slave salesman. As Johnson is black, it still has a lot of kids and a few riders. <br /> <br /> Of course, Cain does not like kidnapping and the rest of the movie goes through the rescue attempt. The rest of the works include parts of William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and Kebir Bedi Indian filmmakers who are very bored with everything. <br /> <br /> Normally, these talented people will be revealed just like the ones mentioned above and they make a landscaping diet. But Ashanti does not do that. <br /> <br /> Without losing time. The smell of tax writing goes into the air.
