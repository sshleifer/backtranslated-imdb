I like comedy movies. I really enjoy it. But I did not get "Invidia" points. I mean, it has a matter that has a sad content, and it's not very funny. <br /> <br /> Although the asset is generally good, it is not enough to make the movie as interesting as possible. Stiller and Black do not show their talent in this movie. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to rent a comedy, you can not do that. If you do not want to be bored and I do not see the only ones with that opinion, because Jack Black also apologized (see Trivia).
