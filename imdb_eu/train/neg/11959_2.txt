This movie is a nonsense of a Japanese movie that strikes a strange violent guest about a dysfunctional family, and the family members see the worst. In this film, nothing is sacred, it is surprising that sexual drugs and violence have spread to the limitation that came over the censors. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that we do not seem to be the only ones. Promoters, instead of assuming subordinate messages, regardless of the others. The film that slides with the worst part of the society and, nevertheless, it is completely ill ... The desperation of a man who has made Dead or Alive and Audition.
