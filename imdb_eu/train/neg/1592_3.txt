In order to increase the drama of this story of the Maternity Department, there is a special focus on the care of "difficult cases". Loretta is the story of Youngen; he died from a long jail. Does the doctor save his baby from the cost of his life, or will he realize his husband? Melodrama and feeling dominate and they are not foolish, at least, say. For example, when moving things, this hospital has a psychopathic side of motherhood, and a woman with a hysterical pregnancy can steal babies. <br /> <br /> Laughter and sarcasm are just enough. It's Glend Farrell's, especially Glenn Farrell's movie, that's when he waits for twins who swear in cold water bottles, he thinks he's a lawyer for sale because of his sadness. Example of its solution: "Be careful". Farrell: "It's too late to be careful." Aline MacMahon, of course, is the main nurse but does not have to give a dramatic moment. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the film is the sight of the child: anyone who turns to watch. Although there is a clear limitation, it should be better than this.
