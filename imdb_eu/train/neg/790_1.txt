Here's what happened: <br /> <br /> 1) The BBC3 heads have programs for different audiences to keep their BBC1 and BBC2 license and work. <br /> <br /> 2) Lenny Henry offers her unfunny friends up. <br /> <br /> 3) It looks like the heads of the BBC3, they are not completely funny to ignore. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If a white person did this kind of thing, he would not be upset. <br /> <br /> Trash.
