This movie sucked. Plays sucked, sucked the script, and sucked the movie as a whole. There were two rows in the undeveloped movie and the audience had to do some work to find out what was happening. <br /> <br /> I do not mean having to write it, but suddenly things are happening and what you are saying is what you find. Examples: <br /> <br /> Heroic negative comments about the hero. The audience has never shown what the guy is and how he relates to the fianc√©e to death. The viewer also has a small exposure to the death of the boy. <br /> <br /> Likewise, suddenly there is a scene with a bunch of boys loading and monsters, and you see it all before. to other scenes. There is no explanation of the type of gun and people. <br /> <br /> We gave it 3, because we did not want more time. While it was fun watching the movie was waning, at least it gave us some entertainment. ;-)
