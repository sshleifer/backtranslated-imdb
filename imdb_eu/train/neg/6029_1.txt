If you ask about the conspiracy and the paranoid ideas of the United Nations, Israel and international problems, look no further. <br /> <br /> This is not a biblical episode based on a few Hollywood supernatural films. Instead, this movie has made a company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with a political and religious agenda. As a movie, sometimes the latest pretensions of a program on a television program (family prayers and church windows are clear when harping roles are playing). <br /> <br /> In the main audience, it may be hard to believe, but many people think this thing literally, just as the movie is presented. And maybe the movie is important. You probably do not see the extravagant images of a significant number of your citizens. So, if you see, see social / cultural documents. You are in every media, you do not need to be passionate about propaganda and manipulative attempts in the film to be warned.
