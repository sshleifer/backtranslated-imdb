The director of this film has created a future, where only abortion and birth control are illegal in all states, but women are sued for murder and sent to prison services. In other words, this movie is the worst nightmare for all the movies! The political agenda is so heavy here and the style of the movie is so valuable that it simply loses the steamer faster. However, I should leave the fence where it is.
