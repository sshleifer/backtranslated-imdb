This movie was abysmal. and not like some good ways. First, the main character is not a very attractive gingerman. Second - WTF continues with the love of this van. On the plot, basically, the guy wants sex, so he buys a van (that is, fairness is quite fresh). As it is unbelievable, it looks like fertility, it gets a lot of chickens! And it fails with some. He then scored with a very hot chicken and realizes that he loves a nice bird that likes bad birds. Then drag races with the lover. And he advises his van. This time danny saves devito days. Even though he did not need it, the wandering boy was overtaken by the empty van. I gave this 2 *, as I suppose there is a sub-type Vulture of the 70s, I do not get it and it's also 70's.
