Viewed on 17/17/17 - From 10 to 3 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): Titanic's catastrophe is nothing more than a misguided version of this event. Disaster replication is not a bad thing, but some drama around it is stupid, misunderstood and plays like theater. The story is the same as the winner of the Oscars, which shows how the crew tried to hide the disaster that occurred later. Good for nostalgic purposes only and James Cameron (almost not?) To make him feel compelled to compete.
