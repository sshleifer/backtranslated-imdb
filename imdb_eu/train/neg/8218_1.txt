I have never finished the movie for any reason, it was horrible and it's just theater. I was not sure what the movie was about in film, but it did not make much sense and it was a horrible violence. Ususally I mean naked in a movie (lol) but it was just because the disease is happening. All the characters got angry and the cry was loud and the camera parted sharply and it seemed to be a continuation of the silent continuation of the project's good quality. The worst film I have ever seen, and I would like to like it for my time. I would not recommend this film to anyone, nor do I even consider it. (N)
