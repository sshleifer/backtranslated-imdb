Silent Night, the Deadly Night 5 series, and the fourth, it has not been the first three links to the title and is a horror movie on Christmas theme. <br /> <br /> Unless you know, there are some things that are happening here ... Joe Petto plays a machine with Joe Petto and his name is Pino. Call a bell, nobody? Now, a boy named Derek knocked on the door, and was open to find himself in front of him. Although he does not open Christmas, he begins to open, but his father stays, scares him and goes to bed and opens his gift. Inside, there is a small red ball that throws Santa arms and heads and begins to die. Perhaps, it would be enough alone. Derek has been traumatized by the stairs since he has seen him on the stairs, but he has not been converted into a Santa killer, but he has just stopped talking. <br /> <br /> A mysterious unknown is around. It seems very interested in toys by Joe Petto. When Derek's mother leads her to the store, we also see when she buys it to find a gift to get trauma. And what does this guy do? Well, we are not sure, but it seems that these toys do not add them to see what they ticked. The owner leaves the owner to pay the next day, and he will pay a "Larry the Larvae" toy for his boyfriend, but "Larry", of course, is not a good toy and expels it. In the car box and of course, well, things are not nice. <br /> <br /> Anyway, at the end, it is explained what happens with Joe Petto and Pino, and like the old story, Pino is not a "real boy." Pino is probably even more disturbed and undergone "Kenitalia" (a soft plastic crotch), so he can bear in mind his evil ways. And the identity of the hidden stranger is also revealed, and there is some wonderful ending. Whee <br /> <br /> A step up, but not a lot. Again, Brian Yuzna, and Screaming Mad George, so there are some special effects, but they are not enough. Some parts of part 4, like Clint Howard and Neith Hunter, but this does not really make a difference. However, now I see the whole series from my system. Now, I could get out of my brain. 5 to 4.
