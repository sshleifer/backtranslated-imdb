How can you bring your hard-earned and passionate bounty hunter with a serious story * with an accent? It's nonsense. In addition, the visual style of the director is nauseable and gimmicky, the plot is deep, boring, confused, gangster-movie rehash and the action is not convincing. The film's new film introduces new characters and is said to be part of the flashback, especially without sequels, to be seemingly enjoyable and confusing. The movie will show you things that are never going to happen and later says "that's not really happened, this happened" - see (apparently) fake "first ladies". What have we seen then in the wrong sequential events? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < 1/5.
