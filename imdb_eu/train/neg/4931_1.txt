This time we get a creative psychopath maker called "Joe Petto", who makes bad toys that kill people. The house where he lived was where the boy robot "Pino" (again, get?) Only lives in the home, after having lived bad luck. <br /> <br /> The easiest worst (and the [eventually] end up in the middle of this series seems to look like this and the previous soft soft movies, but without sex and nudity. "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and homemade films are like hybrid low-wins. In 2000, they began in the sixth chapter, but it was canceled and it was never finished. We only hope to keep that way ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
