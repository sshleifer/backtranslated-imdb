On another good review, loleralacartelort7890 says: "It's true that the Americans use a secret aluminum alloy, it's not very well known, and the exact specifications are a secret, and why it's a secret: why should they show it again? Race in Roman space If they were, it would be very mute for the authorities to have a new radiation protection technology. "This is completely wrong. There is (and was) a Roman anti-war "Apollo". Apollo Command Module design and construction has been available for a long time. Lightweight aluminum and stainless steel "honeycomb". The entire external surface (except windows of course) is covered with a heat shield made from phenolic resins that is thicker at the bottom of the recess. These materials really are better * in space * (charged particles) when the type of radiation stops, allowing X-rays and gamma-ray ionizing photons to stop. <br /> <br /> Space radiation is a specific problem in the long-term space flight, as it has the potential to cause large explosion of sunlight. But Apollo astronauts was not a serious threat. The command module was well protected by Van Allen's belts (about 1/2 hours or more). They took all the dozimeters, so we know how much radiation receives: 1.5 Rem more than usually and much less. Two of the 24 men who went to the moon (12 landed), 18 are still alive. Only two cancers died: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died of heart attacks, pancreatitis (Roosa) and motorcycle accidents (Conrad). At the end of the 70s, the statistics of a male group were quite good (Shepard would be 86).
