I have seen some terrifying horror films in my time, and this is not the worst bundle, but it's definitely the bottom half. Script starts A young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern, in order to give him and his future wife a better job. Cute eh Then the movie gets into the toilet right away when you realize that something is dying. It turns out that there is a demon in the cellar containing the souls of the people. All the hospital staff are the patient of the doctor, the nurse and the guardian of the safety guard, who has to make a ritual almost enough to cut off the tongue and then abandon the devil's house. to get out and steal his soul through the magic of special effects. At this time the movie is so stupidly stupid, I asked him to finish. It's been an hour yet. Half-and-Half "The championship from crypt" stretched out for an hour and a half in a vacuum. Tiny Lister's best picture of John Coffey (The Green Mile) for Tracy Scoggins, a stereotyped Nurse Ratchet movie that fails at all levels. I have given two stars for two reasons. 1) His fianc√©e is quite hot, he set a bit of pain and 2) The movie really looks good, much better with horror movies than with the modern wal-mart quality camera. <br /> <br /> In the end, avoid this punishment, even if it's in the drafting of the movie (I do it and I feel deceived). As a bonus bonus game, you and your friends make a shot whenever you talk about Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shaking his head. You drink 15 minutes drink the movie.
