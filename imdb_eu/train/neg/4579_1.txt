"What do I know Bleep!" It was one of the worst times I've ever had in the movies. There was less of a movie and more than a descendant of the school, but at the same time there was no special feature. The essay of a storytelling was completely pathetic, almost anyone will tell you. Marlee Matlin is just her underwear. I will not put it on top of that. Many of those I am going to present can not formulate. Although this movie was boring, he suffered a horrible error of reasoning. He was terribly contradictory, he took such a manipulator, became a creator of your life, an abundance of expression, a piece of shoeless propaganda. The interconnection is explained as a great party of our lives. However, we encourage the film to control our environment with ourselves. It completely forgets that other people are trying to control the minds, that is, it seems more. Or, at least, the structures that exist us confine us to. Thus, the movie was more solipsist. Solipsism and interaction are merely confused unless God is powerful. There you will be surprised (?!?) According to all the things that this film shows. Otherwise, you will be very disappointed, purple, or maybe both. Likewise, the title is so horny, I do not warn people to see the movie as I see it, I feel it is delayed by the name I call. Shame for everyone involved.
