I must admit that I ought to think this outing, something that should happen, apart from the body of the first scenes ... and at his disposal. I was wrong. A movie on Betty was included in the beach, attached to the first part of Mordant Morven. I do not like those Scottish young lassies doing these days, who owns your screw or what drugs they take. Visually, the promenade of the Andalucian Cape was very nice and surely for me. Nadir was his retail store for his lover. When the movie was over, I had two thoughts ... 1. Is that all? 2. Now I see why her boyfriend died. Rename "Bare Bitch Boredom, or What did my trip to Spain". I'm so savvy for bringing these things.
