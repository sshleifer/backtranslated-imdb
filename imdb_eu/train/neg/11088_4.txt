This is a good movie, but it has a deep emotion or storytelling. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real events, which has almost no limits on the action, nor is it a real suspense. <br /> <br /> Washington is incredible in the head, but sleeps asleep, there is no chance of supporting muscles or acting. <br /> <br /> The story is just a bit flat, even if the title character is listened to, it was an obvious ending; however, other films about these injustices have no emotional effect, you do not really care; Outside motivations seem more academic. than to take care of his welfare. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to inject some emotions, using the exterior of the hero Carter worshiping, but this seems to be forced. <br /> <br /> The film is ok but it will soon be forgotten. .
