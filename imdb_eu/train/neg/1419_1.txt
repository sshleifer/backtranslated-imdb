This is a horrible movie - and unfortunately, this short one made the company do a lot more. The summary is basically an idea of ​​jokes, something that might be fun for the beginner and maybe you will be angry too. I was certainly uncomfortable when I saw very young babies (most of them appeared about 2 years ago) and pretended to be grown-ups; In this case, a nightclub and bar room. It's kind of fun if you force your kids to laugh, if you want to be grown up, but I can not see anyone wanting to see it, especially when it's just when the young Shirley temple is dressed. dress and like a vampire! And then, other children act like adults in adult situations. At that time, I'm sure they did not try to make a call to the pedophiles, but when you look at it today, that's when it comes to mind soon! That's why I got bored with a boring movie, and I hope to see it again! Quite strange and horrible.
