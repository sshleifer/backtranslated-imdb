I saw Phat Beach cable a bit and I liked it. The guy looks like the best character looks good. The rest of the characters are different stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like these low-budget films because they take a certain amount of time, because it's almost a yearly attitude and a documentary fashion. Phat Beach is also fun in this film for low-budget babies strictly homemade girls. Most low-budget films have quality "local children" on the street, and children in this movie can tell you strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them hung out so much cellulite from the bikini, it was fun to see how "young people" really remained too over-utilized to see how they were seen on a skank of a high mileage. There were also some cuties. This is the charm of cinematic dirty money budgets. You can see lots of puppies, and some real cut! I registered some of them on the IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is his only credit. Bad. It would be interesting to get someone back in the "Where are now" book of all the cuties that appeared in the history of the movies. What happened ?? Surely, it seems that a lot of youngsters are getting a lot of them out of them, but when you watch them on the TV again you ask "What happened to X?" However, this movie is mainly struck, but it has some fun moments.
