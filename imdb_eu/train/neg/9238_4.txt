A single note comedy is likely to put on the edge of current feminist teeth. Betsy Drake's secretary baby and marriage secretary is in love with the idea, hoping for women's magazines, until she is released as a bachelor's degree in Cary Grant. The rest of the films go from one roof to another. I think the word "perky" is approaching approximately Drake's function. He has a charming smile, but after 20 minutes, taking care of his prosthesis, I began to overdose. The role of Grant is basically a secondary one and its usual habit is common. There is a scene, however, that almost regains this fine exercise. Drake asks Mr Grant in a room of respectable ladies. In it, his peculiar way has a very important freshness, and if his production did not rub his nose with that sharp smile over 90 minutes, maybe the movie could be more than a day-dream dream.
