Fortunately, I did not watch the movie. Also, I can not even mention the spoiler after fifty minutes of the film. It was bad I laughed once, Yahoo! The poster was revealed with concrete, and the theme of the song started. However, I thought that's just what I thought was fun, but then I realized it was another product. <br /> <br /> I love drawing. I saw almost religion. (However, I missed the last episode, they have shown that they were a Ph.D. from that time, and it was just a claw, someone commented on the show's page). This picture was much more than the movie that Penny and Brain had much more. I set up the whole thing, they reminded me of Robocop. Then, Broderick makes the whole feeling of Inspector Gadget. It's as clumsy as cartoons. It's another thing, they work well when I see their gadgets, except for black oil. He even squeezed the tone of "Wowsers" full of enthusiasm. I felt so desperate that cartoons were so badly killed. Everyone else felt this way. The recollections of young people between 14 and 17 years old are remembered and we love each minute. <br /> <br /> I went into the open movie because it linked it to the cartoon. It seemed strangely the movie was delayed. The gag of sight, and the stupid conversation is based on humor. Disney pain and physical humor rely on children to promote a movie. There is no product location in this movie, and it shows. The wise machines are not as good as this. The sticks look nice, but they were very bright. The cartoon looked better. The scenes were crazy. In 40-45 minutes I watched the movie, they did not hear a laugh, and laughed before Dudley-Do-Right preview. This movie does not have to be seen in people of the mind's family entertainment. I highly recommend "The Iron Giant" dull but very good. This movie looks at all the drama of the family
