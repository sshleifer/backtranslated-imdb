Rosie TV lost a lot of time around Tainos as if they had had a great impact on the current Puerto Rican dynamics. They were not. It's true that Africans and Spaniards know that. My dying is on the screen, especially when it looks like a small black black light skin (an ugly black father, a cousin and aunt), but in order to recognize the true real essence of what is happening today in Puerto Rico. How influenced by Africans speak in Spanish, food and music. It's so common and I've lost a lot of respect for myself and I do not accept anything. Also, since she wants to dance around her African personality, it does not necessarily take on more blacks (Lackawanna Blues). Next we will find the proud Black Latino (thank you Zoe Saldana, Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa). <br /> <br /> Now they say they are African for "Puerto Rican" and not "black." ...thank you. Certainly, "blacks" have nothing to do with "you"; so love is not lost. But, surely, if you were in the United States and exercised the Civil Rights movement, we would like to denounce any treatment that you would like to receive from the "blacks" of human blood, sweat and tears. <br /> <br /> When I'm fit, Puerto Rican has a great image in the media, but we're not trying to respect the blacks all the time, because we want the media to take advantage of low points and behaviors. keep minorities mind't or generalizations. However, of course, you're into the hype that you think you are one of you or a senior ... you are not. Also, you think that the black culture is BET, you feel like you're right ... you're wrong again and you need to get off to the breeze from the bells. Try visiting Atlanta, Ga, Houston, Texas, Charlotte, N.C. Believe me that nobody of these blacks wants to claim your "culture".
