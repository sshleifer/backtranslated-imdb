That is to say, the film based on somewhat controversial incest and lesbianism, that is to say, to warn. That's it. They are pathetic conversations and the sensuality of "sex scene" is completely lacking. Acts and conversations are more suitable for secondary school children, however, it is an adult audience. The movie is small and superficial. If it has a story and more plays, it might be better. Oh and on top of that, another thing: why use internal monologues so much? It seems so cheap. For all the shame films in Romania, as well as for adults who try to see it. I know that there are few means, but that's not always an excuse for a movie. Please start using good actors in your movies and do not let them with musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can not work!
