Kareena Kapoor in a bikini hmmmmmmmm. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar ... <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor .... <br /> <br /> Maybe Saif .... <br> /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in a bikini ... <br /> <br /> A good banner. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in a bikini ... <br /> <br /> Good reasons to not see this movie ... <br /> <br /> Or so I thought ........ People did not do JBJ ... <br /> Why i why i forgot. <br /> <br /> For all the critics, the first part of the movie is not bad ... <br /> <br /> There are some intrigues and REFUSE SHEETS IN THE DRAWING MEETING RITCHIE TO SEE ALSO USE THE MOBILE LOCK STOCK AND SNATCH REQUIREMENTS. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor sheds on a rugged pattern. /> Akshay Kumar is what can only be Akshay Kumar. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is annoying, but it's somehow fun. YOU CAN NOT KNOW YOUR OWN MORE. > Saif is the main Khiladi principal ... again. There are occasional laughter and some laughs. s, and some goosebumps kareena-saif love story (lime rain, behind me my bicycle hmmmmmmm). <br /> <br /> But most of this get MORE TO HALF MEND ..... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> It was almost an animation that the space was not due to the dampness due to the people who thought of it. things that came. <br /> <br /> THAT THE TORTURE THAT'S HOW THE LORD IS THROUGH THEM. <br /> <br /> Saif begins as a sudden comic book. <br> /> <br /> KARENENA SEXIA, ANORORGIQUE, THE SECOND FLOOR IS PLACED, YOUR PAPER IS NOT (and only girls can notice and other men will notice the second floor on the second floor). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only one that removes insanely madness, but becomes a bit too unbearable. . <br /> <br /> TAKING UP DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE ABOVE ABSURDITY. <br /> <br /> WHY? !! WHAT ??? WHEN? NO !!! WHAT DO WE DO ... <br /> <br /> The collective voice followed the audience in front of all the songs of the second half, even without a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> THAT'S FESTIVAL IS EXPECTING YOU'S LIVING BUT, BUT BECAUSE YOURSELF BECAUSE. BEING USED BY THE MIGRAINE SUPPORT ABOUT YOURSELVES AND THE KINGDOMS. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie for any other reason than academic interest. <br /> <br /> + s Throw, Akshay Kumar, the first semester. <br /> <br /> +/- what, when, how, with whom is a great disorder. (You need a book to complete this). <br /> <br /> + s cast, the second half full (many pages are required to complete this). <br /> <br /> A total of 3/10 (I try to avoid 1 and 2 seems too much, but do not make a mistake this movie is not good at first.)
