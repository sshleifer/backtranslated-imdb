It's one of the best envy. Great Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler and Christopher Walken. With such a cast, one can not expect the best. However, with "Invidia", nobody saves the disaster. <br /> <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and colleagues in a factory. Both are making decent lives, but because Tim has a better performance, it can pay more than his friend Nick. Nick is a dreamy who always has new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick gets in touch with the idea that the puppy's steak disappears (yes, I'm serious). In love with the idea, Nick decides to invent this product. Timri has offered to invest in his idea and share 50/50 profits. Tim refuses to think that the idea will ever work. Money is much like his house, like a horse, a personal trainer and exquisite deserts. Tim begins to feel envious of Nick. That's why the movie is a name. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it's still horrible. This movie has the worst case of dialogue and very bad interpretation. Again, as I mentioned earlier, none of them would save the mess. A homeless personage called "J-man", the great Christoper Walken did not make this movie funny either. The movie is bad at the beginning, and it's only a bit worse. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie: * If you like crap (without punctures) * You want to see Jack Black in the white line <br /> <br /> I said, avoid this movie for all costs, but avoid ESPECIALMENTE : * When you're out of the bathroom's mood * you love animals
