From Jess Franco's three names to the list of bad DPP official videos (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars), perhaps the least worthy of notoriousness, because the jungle clunker is so dull. Gore inept few, rape scene, and many nudity. <br /> <br /> Ruby gorgeous Ursula Buchfellner plays a star in the role of Laura Crawford, kidnapped by a kidnapped kidnapping group and takes away a remote tropical island. a wild tribe worshiping the "demon god" worshiping the wild forests (those who want to eat the hearts of women with sacrifice nubiles). <br /> <br /> The $ 6 million price to send Laura's agent, Peter Weston (Al Cliver), is a brave mercenary and a Vietnam veteran rider who travels, but they find it difficult to crack down on a double cross. During confusion, Laura fled to the jungle, but directly into the arms of her native, weapons that she wants to offer to her god. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Awesome effects, and ham. The result is that the fight is really wrong (a couple of sessions that took me to finish things), and Buchfellner is not enough in all of his acknowledgments. This movie is a hurry to see again.
