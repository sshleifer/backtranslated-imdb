Luke Benward, who was disturbed eleven years ago (Billy "Worm Boy" Forrester) goes to a new town. In her new school, Benward chooses other boys. They have worms in their thermos. Realizing his reflex gag, Benward faces his face faces Adam Hicks (like Joe Guire). Benward bets can eat 10 worms a day - without any problems! <br /> <br /> Hallie Kate Eisenberg is impressed and impressed (like Erika "Erk" Tansy) to help archery Benward. Bob Dolman, former SCTV writer and director, "does not hurt the worms when making this movie." In a related note, SCTV star Andrea Martin has a fun scene. "How to Eat Worms Worms" were based on a popular novel by Thomas Rockwell. Young children with secondary backgrounds should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> **** How to eat worms (25/06/08) Bob Dolman ~ Luke Benward, Adam Hicks, Hallie Kate Eisenberg Alexander Gould
