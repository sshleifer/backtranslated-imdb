I have liked to see the original movie and I loved it, which is why I expected more replication. <br /> <br /> GOOD: Effects and make-up are good. Complaints about punctuation and images were not appropriate, and the performances were successful (Tim Roth was excellent, other managers were well-versed, and some "assistant assistants" performed very well with very limited roles). The scenes of the events were exciting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> BAD: The audience's way was great. The characters will go to the circles and suddenly the tunnels will be located in the center of town. Also, what is the path to escape during the whole room? <br /> <br /> The story was cut down to add the possible action. I like the activities, but the original movie has more flesh and more respect. <br /> <br /> In the end, the end was completely absurd as it was presented. Without seeing the inevitable sequence, there is no justification. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
