I'll give you 3, because we know that we need to know the history, so it does not happen again. I agree with comments from the United Kingdom's knight. The movie was pretty awful. All topical, no real plot. There are many historical and technical details. Check out the DE 529 technical specifications, or any Everts class Destroyer Escort, and see what you mean. The US black history is now one month, and I'm called racist to say that, but the history of this ship is not so great. They did some work at the school, followed by a "submarine" hulk. Sorry, but the blacks did much more in front of World War II, because this stupid movie is very credible. This movie looks like jokes. Let's start the name, I can handle it.
