The play was not very good, the story was alternately simplistic and clear. On the other hand, the consequences of the fighting against the right-wing Flanders blockers and the Moroccans living in the Belgian city of Antwerp. Is political analysis? Is West Side Story Belgian or modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is not strong enough to answer two questions (as also the director's questions). However, some scenes may be in the form of a movie by Ken Loach in Antwerp. After all, the city has been the focal point of the extreme Flemish blockade and is fighting a lot of tensions and tensions between different populations and cultures. It's hard to make a movie about this situation, and this is not a success, unfortunately. However, he is telling the story of a very real and intricate situation in Belgium today. Many foreign audiences should be watching, and realize that it is not the most important, but Belgium is a real movie that divides in a country of 10 million people, internationally in the 2000s. <br /> <br /> Dries Van Dongen
