A psychopassist about a girl named Prom Night Donna (Brittany Snow) is trying to kill her on a yacht tonight. And thus, to kill his family, his friends and his enemies. <br /> <br /> Before leaving now, let me tell you, lately, you were terrified by horror movie horror PG-13. You are tired of the stupid girls in conversation when you talk about "God, my God" and the things girls. And you're really tired of getting in touch with the girls and then weeping. And the last thing you are tired of is reworking the US Asian, Japanese and Chinese films. That much summarizes the night of the Prom, but I still do not do it with the review. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br If not, do not miss the prom night. You never hear fear of the murderer and you see a bit of blood on the wall. Deaths are repeated as 24/7. Therefore, they are not only frightening, but they are evil. When I met the maker I think I'm ready. The girl is too much talked about, too many boys talk and "Oh my gosh" a lot. It's our prom. I understand it is fun, but it's too hard to ask for concentration. <br /> <br /> I would be the first to see other movies without the Prom Night 2008. I'm not surprised if the DVD is cheap and fast dropping. Seriously do not spend your money or dull activation, cheap scares and 'Kill for the Night' when you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> One star 10. (If I could give it to the PS, I would have zero film in the movie).
