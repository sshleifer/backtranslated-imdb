It was true for this movie. I recall that a 4-year-old fisherman about 15 to 20 years ago discovered a water body and remembered that they had not been reported until the end of the trip. I reckon they had interfered with a corpse (or some of those responsible). I'm not sure it was in Australia. Australian outsiders believe that the country that lives in a country of rape and rape. Wolf Creek and this film would promote this perception. The same movie reminded me of a simple Plan. But to date, one of the best Australian films, as I said, I can not be generous. Put it like this, I would not see it again.
