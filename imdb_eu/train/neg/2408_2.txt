This movie creates a serum that generates dead animation. First, he uses his brother when he is shot dead. His brother then infects other gang members. In some scenes, the areas are slowly watching, and in other scenes they do so pretty quickly, which makes no sense. The performance is mediocre, but the story is not helping the movie. Makeup is in the blood on the face of zombies. I'm sure the budget of this movie was very limited. I think the movies could be made better with the story more original and with a better budget. You do not want to see a good zombie in the movie if you do not see it.
