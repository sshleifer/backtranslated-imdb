Before explaining the "Alias" comment, say "The Desert Trail" is a bad thing, even with Western standards that look at The Three Stooges. In fact, Carmen Laroux Juanita is a bad boy. If you listen to Mexico's accent, you'll soon discover the classic "Belle du Saved" Stooge classic as the Senorita Rita. <br /> <br /> John Wayne's "The Desert Trail" plays Moe Howard's character and Eddy Chandler plays Curly Howard. Like a Stooge counter, 53-minute movie strikes a gag Moe Curly. The character of Wayne, the skull who is looking for a bully, is not very pleasant, but he is a supposedly good boy. <br /> <br /> Using a walker's ride, the cowboy will receive Wayne's box-office box and win it if he gains money, the other 25 riders need 25 cents out of the dollar (much less when Wayne steals the box office) . There is no explanation for the Wayne team to take down the rider and still take the heroine that she has. <br /> <br /> Things are getting worse at this time, deliroa (Al Ferguson) and Larry Fine's pair (Paul Fix, like Sheriff Micah in the TV series "The Rifleman"). At the box office and then stolen money and kill the walker manager. Moe and Curly are guilty. <br /> <br /> So Moe and Curly move to the other town to get rid of the law and change names with Smith and Jones. Who fills the former, but his old friend Larry, whose sister becomes a second split in love (leaving Senorita Rita in the old quarter and there will be no apparition). <br /> <br /> Larry's sister, Mary Kornman, is a brilliantly brilliant woman (grown today, but the youngest day was one of Hal Roach's original "Our Gang" shorts. The main reason to see Mega-Lame on the west coast and its scenes are much better than the Moe and Curly production, as they used to shoot a totally different group. <br /> <br /> Although the sequence of action in 1935 is very weak and there is no directional management technique so bad. Two main fields behind them end up with a broad plane of a rider that falls on horseback. Two times the editor cut a shot of a character on the floor, but there is no horse in the frame, the movie is completely different, and the character has different clothes than the stunt rider . It's a good idea to use footage in other places, that is, it's not remotely remotely. <br /> <br /> One thing to see is Moe and Curly's horses The scene in the movie that goes on and leaves a cabin (on the right screen) when it is on the cabin when it goes out to the cabin. . The camcorder follows two stalks with a small zoom to the right and then flippers on the left to show the way to the left. Outside of the home movie, I never saw something like that, because it does not look stupid (it does), but the headmaster has never performed a scene. They left the two riders and then re-positioned the camera and approach posse as a special movie act. Or if they are creative feelings, the sequence would be staged, showing the cameras in the foreground and the carts that come close to the back. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
