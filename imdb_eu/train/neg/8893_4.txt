Celia Johnson is a good nurse. Michael Hordern is just as good as Capulet, even though he's been a regular rover and not a Lear king. John O'Conor reads this verse, in the same way as Fra Lorenzo, even though he has never taken anything. Alan Rickman is just as good as Tybalt, so that his "yuk" was a popular role. Christopher Strauli's good Benvolio. <br /> <br /> They are nice sets, but they are not as amazing as those of the BBC in Shakespeare's. <br /> <br /> And that's it. The rest is weak and horrible. Rebecca Saire was 15 years old in production, and she did not know how Juliet played. He opens his eyes wide and equals the same line equally. Patrick Ryecart is inadequate, and his self-respect is incomprehensible. It works smoothly on the balcony scene and does not cause any erotic or emotional impact. Their deaths are a relief. If they were a dagger, they offered me a few hours earlier. <br /> <br /> As a Mercury, Anthony Andrews is impossible, if it's a big shock to remember the excellent work of "Brideshead Revisited". The Shakespeare's verse mirror is divided into ten or three words, and then becomes as unconnected and incomprehensible as possible. In this production, the queen Mab abdicates. Wonderful. <br /> <br /> The director Alvin Rakoff shows a periodic snapshot of the camera, which shows what we want to see. The conflict of openness has no coherence. However, if there is a mood later in the battle, Rome feels kneeling on Tybalt slippers. Tybalt takes over the official region. However, did he get that? <br /> <br /> R & J is a long play. This version is not recommended for use in the classroom, or much more.
