Okay Who was it? Who gave Revolver 10 to 10? Are you correcting Zubi Kanpaino? You were so much. Did you dare? Is this a kind of worship? Or does Guy Richie sign 788 himself in different names? <br /> <br /> I say something else before, this I say. Because we do not understand a movie, it does not mean that it's not great. Maybe you had a bad day at work, or you sat down with the movie after seeing a line with your wife, and then there were no bad moods. Perhaps there is a fundamental blockage, such as you do not have a mental capability or enough philosophical sense developed. BUT And this is very, very big. XXL elephant sized mega-thin finishes. <br /> <br /> Please do not confuse the complexity inconsistency, and do not mix it in these two hours for a short film. Really Maybe you think it's pretty intelligent. Perhaps you can think of yourself as a romantic image: an independent thinker who defends the masterpiece against sheeplike sheep songs. Please, no. You're ashamed of yourself. <br /> <br /> Revolver is lost in everyone's time. If you think about it for a few minutes, you might even know it. It was thrown away, crew debris, waste of the hosts, and undoubtedly damaged precious minutes (you can not know) anybody who can sit by this unhappy, wicked one. mess <br /> <br /> "No - wait", a voice comes in the dark. "You still do not understand. LINEAZEA. This means that the story does not fit into LIVE DIRECTLY. This is a complex and remarkable work of AUTEUR. The question leads to difficult EXISTENCES when the CLUB came out - have you not heard? -You can not face complexity because they can not. They're eating nowhere. They're hateful of Lynch movies, are not you? "<br /> <br /> You hate it, I'm a fan of Lynch. I prefer Memento mode, so a narrative that is not convinced in a non-formal way does not have to be filled with fear. Although I recently studied recently, I like many philosophies. For these reasons I do not like Revolver. I do not like it, because it wants to talk about the most important topics, because it is a suggestive, superficial way, to be unreasonable. I'm not a great chess player, but Richie's chess is just like a four-year-old young man. I do not like it, because the characters, without exception, totally alienated me. "Oh!" Richie calls the apologist. "Brechti tightens the guy slowly!" It's just a reason. You might not be able to write a sweetheart script. <br /> <br /> Revolver Comparison Fight Club is really instructive Fight Club has a nihilistic conversation that laughed: Revolver has unlucky cookies and eats your lines, Fight Club can recapture a great event, as far as Revolver's content is incomprehensible. ... well, they do not make sense. If you keep track of the carpet, you'll be taken out of your house and then lock all the doors and windows and never let it go again. <br /> <br /> Guy Richie seems to be philosophical he says he has to repeat some small sentences, they are often spoken, but they often shine on the screen with attributions: it's almost pathological. <br /> <br /> But this particular feature of the film is incomprehensible Anyway, you can get married in the best of all the gangsters of the world in such a good way. In the end, it's so unimportant. You do not care for anything. You do not understand anything. You go home. <br /> <br /> Actually, I liked it a bit: the killer has a trusted crisis. It's great. But I can not watch the movie to watch it. It's only a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Please, believe me. It's horrible
