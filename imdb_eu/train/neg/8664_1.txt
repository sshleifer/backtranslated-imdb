It's just a joke of a movie, a dangerous creature that opened an opening scene (Spoilerwarning) that had already lost me killed another creature in his cage; That is, a scientist guesses what he does and works in a monitor. In the cage, seeing things, these writers think how stupid they will come from man with a big white shark that jumps in a fish tank, because it eats your white fish ... It is useless and even more sour. And I will not even talk about cast, It is worth the effort. why they did not immediately write the girls gave me a mystery ..... And somehow this idiot continues the whole movie. Good things, the better CGI low-budget films have average. <br /> <br /> If you do not see these little things you see, but notice that your IQ 60 is more than you. he probably hates it.
