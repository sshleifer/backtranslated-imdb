The first one was the best. The second was sucked because the conversation was horrible. However, the storyline was not so bad (in fact, stories are all good and bad lines). I've been given several times throughout the movie. I know Jackie Chan is a great martial arts experience, but he's not a good actor on Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker was not good either. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, some lines, a great performance (but this is based on his script). All the characters were not so good. But things that I like in Rush Hour 2 are always less of action and sex scenes. I know Jackie Chank does not do any good things.
