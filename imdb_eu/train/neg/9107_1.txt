Anyone who swore I made this film. I was more annoyed to stop the valuable minutes of my life. I had a wax job and I was entertained. At least Cher laughs at me before I get hurt. He was initially confused but then caught and I realized what happened. At this time, the movie was half-full, and I'm a procrastinator, but I want to finish things to the end. So I saw everything I had saved. Actors not as attractive as Cruel Attempts do not persuade. I saw my nephew demanded much more attention than the luster shown on this movie screen. If you like bad movies with bad plays, watch this.
