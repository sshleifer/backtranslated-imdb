I am a fan of Shakespeare and MST3K, so I was worried to see this episode. I commented on the first movie, then in the MST3K section. The recipe for this movie: talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare material and $ 1.25 quote. Mix well and then drain all life and movements, until it is dull and alive. Serve cold in a large stone slab. The film, I give 10 to 10, because at least the actress deserves a bit of credit. Okay, now in the MST3K section. I will confess, when I saw him, I slept to the middle. I also understand the reaction of many other parties. However, when I saw it the second time, I noticed many intelligent references and the good lines that I lost for the first time. With this episode, this trick is: listen carefully! Some visions are required to catch each line. Give a second chance, and you'll see what you mean. MST3K Episode: 7 1/2 10
