This movie seemed like a camera, sound, film, set, music, clothing ... but steady, Gary Stretch! I do not know if he was just a poor conduct or a bad script, but I would say yes. Given the question of this task, it has been difficult for me to promote myself, even to the end. He could kill him or fight a sword / knife. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> Then, king of the killing king was not due to dinner and sex. Queen Pretty. And the extreme to kill his son? And then, like a king who wants to push his lover? I can see one or two threads here in historical bytes, but the way it was presented was all. <br /> <br /> I did not know anything about Gary Stretch, but it was horrible. As I read another user's comment, I read about dubbed audio, but I do not think it's duplicated ... after all, it speaks English, right? It was wonderful. The lines read directly from the coronary table ... flat line. It may not be a voice for gesture fluctuations. <br /> <br /> In addition, I saw it at the end, so the film was at least "interested". It might be more possible if the script / lines and questionnaires were given more. In addition to the quality of the landscape and the shooting team, this movie is everything. Throws and stories were secondary. I give it to the 10 movie team.
