Running a lot of time. A misunderstood opponent with a very low complexity. A scientist who is receiving and receiving communications in space and attacking them is attacked by aliens. Together with his politically friendly wife, he invades their territory and secrets around them. The process becomes a treacherous. Yes, however, there is little chance. There's a scene that gives everything they want. This is where the sad movie has a lot of long periods. The plot is not technically bad. We're only following a car, going through the woods, researching a building. This is editing. I think the story is not technically much more supported. Not much here.
