Free movie screening for the insect killer script. An ants are killer next to a mysterious hotel. Hotel food believes that the sanitation of the hotel's kitchen directly flushes on the old ants. There's no suspense in this movie and it's not scary. Watching the bunch of mammals that kill the victims is not very scary. <br /> <br /> Spoilers section The stupidity of the hero is incredible. The health inspectors said they could not be a hero for being ants. The virus must be mysterious. After saying the insector, the hero takes the bulldozer and destroys the ancient colony. This prevents millions of ants and catches people in the hotel. <br /> <br /> The last spoilers In general, the movie is very lame. I do not understand why he got the DVD release when he has not had so much film. The only invention for the DVD book appears in Suzanne Summers. This is a movie to prevent it.
