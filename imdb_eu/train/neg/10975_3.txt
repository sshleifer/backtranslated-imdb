This movie blows: right now correct. There are some scenes gems located in this stack of piles, but no one can not align the plot to retrieve it. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in "12 Monkeys" and plays it in the same manner. Colin I usually hate being a fairy, in general, but it's okay in this movie. In this movie there were two rows of lands: = about a boy who sheds his clothes with throwing clothes and the other about a woman with a mustache. Let's see. This movie does not mean a great idea of ​​what he does not want or where he would go. The characters line the story lines in some levels, but they are not worth the scripts in any way. The whole thing is weak and useless, and then OK occasionally. But in general - Do not worry if you do not love Irish accents so you can see mediocrity and all the sounds like Lucky Charms elf will be saved, catching some fascinating films that have hit the American fetiches.
