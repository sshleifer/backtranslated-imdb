Nothing better, I decided to see "Aztec Rex" (as it was billed). For this reason, stories could be stupid if the dinosaur effects were convinced. They look like animators (later artists are steady details to finish CGI effects, adding more details, adding smoother moves ...). The dinosaur is a completely stunning look, that is, probably because of this you really want it. . <br /> <br /> <br /> Dacha Lachman's beautiful Ayacoatl mode. He kept my interest; If the quote only rises and some of the convincing dinosaurs can be used. <br /> <br /> Disillusion. At least, the cast and the crew were shot in a movie that was shot in Hawaii.
