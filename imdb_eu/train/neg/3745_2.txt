First of all; It is very dilettantish to describe the way in history by trying only pistol positions, germs and steel. The same has happened from Marxist economic positions. <br /> <br /> The reason for the success of the West can not be dumb luck, the advantages of domestic plants and animals. We have seen that advantages and bonuses around the world are completely useless if not managed wisely. In Japan there is not much natural resources, but Japan is one of the first economies in the world, with the same situation in Singapore, but Nigeria, a country with many oil resources, is only a half-low success. They had access to western technology and inventions of these two countries, but why they failed? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Daimond said it was very important to understand the understanding of guns, germs and steel bills. Perhaps the main factor in world inequality is not geography, but people have the ability to understand and use things? Head of cognitive ability. And in this case geography is dependent.
