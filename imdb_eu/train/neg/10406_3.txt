Note: This review has minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> Now, the first Temblores writers are the official ideas. I'm a fan of the first movie and the first two follow-ups are quite good for live video feeds. Tremors 4: The Legends Begins, however, is a very sad movie. Where are the Graboids? <br /> <br /> In the first 90 minutes, due to the lack of relative Graboids, I am sure that access to the series is "the analysis of the characters". Unfortunately, there is no interesting character in the film, the character of Billy Drago, who has few lines, little things to do and, at the end, little screen time. It was the presence of Michael Gross in Burt Gummer, which kept the films 2 and 3. There was no action on the screen, I am sure that Burt Gummer would also be very interesting to hear and / or hear. However, Gross's Hiram Gummer makes a healthy and boring replacement. <br /> <br /> Graboids (the Dirt Dragons in this movie) looks good on the screen, but it's as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see that I saw that Tremors 4 was 101 minutes in the list. Pretty good for the video. But after seeing it, I'm sure this movie is too long for 15 minutes. The conversation is long and boring and does not add to the plot. Were they to make this sharp film? I do not think it could have more time and it should be spent on the script. <br /> <br /> When I hit a gold mine I thought I saw it when I was shiping to Tremors 4 ... I'm sorry !!! What I thought was lucky, pay # 4 get # 1 for free. Well, I think that I made payment of the Original 4 for Tremors and I've made it free, I can not imagine paying a single dime for the tremor. It's unforgettable for the fans of the Serie 4: Legends begin 4: Legends. even if it exists. <br /> <br /> Izaro 4: Legazpi gives 10 to 10 rates.
