The movie was screened on Nicolson screen. However, I had to fight the movie as a result of boredom to take scenes without Meryl Streep Jack. it was likely. The relationship between the characters was not unique; These characters have been portrayed before, and much better. It was considered the worst sense in real life situations: 90% of everyday life is boring, and it's not worth it to write or watch. Because Ephron felt Carl Bernstein's writing and writing about his life and relationship, he fled. Perhaps he wrote it as therapy - for many writers, a passage of his life is cathode in paper. Okay, but a Hollywood person felt the story that deserves a story, it's a mystery to me.
