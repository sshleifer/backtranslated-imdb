I could give it less. Do not worry about renting; If someone burns the DVD. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie. The digital "film" is also a complete waste. I've been better at Youtube on 12-year-old boys. Lommel has said that he has written, in this case, the illiterate is a classic case in both languages. The storyline does not exist, the conversation is mainly shouting, the camera's work is an attempt at an artificial attempt, with unrelenting cutting-edge unrelated jumps, as well as the scene of industrial transport and a curiously angry young woman. <br /> <p> Normally I can follow the plot light or smaller, or watch the movie "creator" - I like David Lynch. <br /> <br /> This is beyond my understanding of limited powers. or it's totally trivial. I think, "this is what we will soon see, we can see a title that we can take and we can take a bit of money and see what we can see." We can not see why Lionsgate is concerned. It's worthless, it's so bad that I did not lease the other director himself.
