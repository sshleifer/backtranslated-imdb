Nicole Eggert named this star, although Micheal Dorn and Stacey Keach were much larger than the stars. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is "Land on Earth". Eggert plays a girl who feels a feeling of foreigners against the military and takes her into a very sexy costume. Undocumented and partial nudity, unknown sex scene, appear on the way. <br /> <br /> The film encounters some pieces of work and jokes that will show the photos. Star Trek's jokes were pretty much liked by Micheal Dorn and he got a very beautiful scene of death. <br /> <br /> It was very clear that Stacey Keach had to take it and the movie was quite pretty. At no end, it would be nice to show the kind of talent that Aliens gave to Eggert.
