My husband and I went to see this movie. Two hours later I found my money and time again. I was so disappointed. The teasers of the movie are basically the best movie points. There was no scary fear of movies that were not included in the cinema entrances, etc. Most of the horrible pieces I found were only comical. After seeing other films based on the Japanese writer's work, I must conclude that in Japan it is terrifying that it is not the fear of the US. My advice: if you are a fan of true horror movies, keep yourself seated. I can not really rent it, unless it's sold out.
