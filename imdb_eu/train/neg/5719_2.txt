This movie is like a theater maker, with * BAD * action and not much suspense. There are gore elements, but you do not feel anything in the characters, violence is not very effective. Some pieces are strange ... it's like a snake to force someone to hurt. What is that with? Do you think that's terrifying or horrible? It's kind of stupid. In terms of torture, there is no way at all (except at the beginning of the explosion of the boy, but they do not show it). He says he is "slow to die," but the butcher quickly kills them. Deaths are pretty fast. Yes, I saw the version "unprofessional". So overall, I did not see the worst movie gore, but it's not good either. You have not lost anything, if you report this.
