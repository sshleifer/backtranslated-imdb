I grew up with Scooby (I'm telling you somehow again). I hate Scrappy, I love Daphne, and I do not have a whole lot with the gang. But that's sad, the mystery of Scooby Doo is a solved comedy-not a bad spy guy jap anime. I like "whats new", some of the risks posed by Daphne Makeover sometime ago :( and try to lose * many sex drugs in many generations, but this "get" tip is a crap and it should not have been named as Scooby. They also tried to play punk with the subject of the song. I will now see my scooby doo DVD where you need to clean the dirt of this new series for me.
