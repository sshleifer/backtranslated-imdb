... However, I'm not one of them. Caro Diario was at least two-thirds of the time, but something like that gave us a boring and self-centered third part of the film. Moretti says that he feels the need to make this movie, but he does not want to. He thinks the audience feels he needs to join him, but he does not really want to. The movie about politics and the Italian elections may be wonderful, but it's not that movie. At one point, Moretti and his friends are outsiders of the Communist Party, discussing dialogues that are being prepared for the party leaders, but the feature of this film has never been seen. In accordance with the political challenges of Moretti, the births of his son's birth and after-home movies and later the events that took place after the child's death in Pietro. The film drags us over several years and elections. We will continue to see definitive sequences or solid arguments, but they will never come. Without a doubt, I can be patient with Nanni Moretti again. It seems like an hour and a half forever.
