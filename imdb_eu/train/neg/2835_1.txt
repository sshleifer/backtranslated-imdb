Dereks seems to be trying to find rolls for "Bo" 10 called Bo. <br /> <br /> I worked in a Florida Keys marine park. One day, the "Ghosts Can not Do It" was circulating amongst the shoes that prepared the "fish house" that was being prepared between the footwear sneakers. There was a scene where -dolphin- he thought Bo suggested (or Bo the delphin), asking for "making eggs". We read the script -lauuughed -... <br /> <br /> We did not make a part of this movie in our facilities, although our dolphins were "Big Blue". > <br /> This must be the end of life of Anthony Quinn. I hope that he has fun in this film, he certainly did not do anything for his heritage.
