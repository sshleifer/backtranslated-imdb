On the 1st, 03/03/2003 - 10-2 nd (Dir-Brad Sykes): 3-D movie mindless, within the movie chronicle about zombies that eat meat. Yes, we see the zombies that we eat in 3D parts! Wow, no !! This has happened repeatedly in a 2D zombie movie, but usually a zombie movie is a story that is underlying, it's not real meat. That's the original zombie classic being good. Meat was eaten as a sensation. We really get bored in most of this 3-part chronicle, because it's easy to understand and is the last indent that reveals it. The latest story is that the story started actually filming (a reporter is investigating a nation called a spirit) and, of course, we also see zombies eating meat. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch classics, not 3D blessings.
