This movie, essentially, is Dafoe's two-hour nature, almost literally dying. In this movie, the only surprise is that you do not have enough trace or personality. It was just a sad, drowsy time. <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is an excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But the movie sucks. Slow did not make the movie bad, it was bad. It is not confused with artistic writings about art on anamorphic details that draws coherent cohesion in the plot, rather than focusing on the perspective of several perspectives, at the end of the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as an entertainment, I have slept. (Seriously, I was asleep and I had to see the movie again, that is, it was even more disappointed.) <br /> <br /> In general, I do not like doing any negative comments or comments about the work of others, even if they suck , but justified this film. It's very bad that the best actors are ashamed of the final result.
