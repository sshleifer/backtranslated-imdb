This film shows that it deserves to see all the films made in Hollywood's most celebrated days. Because you've got a great deal of split distribution, this does not mean that chimpanzees can overcome a script! Think it: movies were Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, Charles Boyer, Gloria Graham, Lillian Gish and Paul Stewart, and it was still a bad movie! The basic premise of the film is not bad: a private psychiatric hospital where workers make it worse than their patients! Similarly, the underemployee's pregnant wife (Widmark and Graham) had a great deal of promise. In any case, the script was handled with all the delicacy and rigor of a buffalo drunk - the movies repeatedly emerged from top to bottom. In fact, it was less than a drama and the "Hospital" section was very bad. Subtlety, this movie is not !! Realistic, this movie is not !! <br /> <br /> This movie was a great reason in most cases, but I also blame the producers for veteran actors and those who are doing the same. For example, Paul Stewart may not have been a household name, but this character actor had a brilliant talent, especially when he played gangsters at Film Noir. However, here Stewart is thrown out of a strange European accent with a very strange psychiatrist - he did not work because he was out of his interpretation area and his character was fully developed and dimensional. Similarly, Charles Boyer seemed to be completely out of breath. Seeing this beautiful romantic acter at the American heart was just like a psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a pretty scary movie. The train's disaster is a very quiet way, but it's not very nice. My wife and I liked a good part of the film, but we thought it was a very good handwriting. <br /> <br /> PS - When art imitates life, Oscar Levante played one of the sick. . In real life, the bright Levant spent a lot of his life on the head organizations.
