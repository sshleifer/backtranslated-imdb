Ira Levin's Broadway Smash comes on the screen with almost no bone flesh, a mysterious plot, with just a few tricks and rotations, but no one cares. A frustrated writer Michael Caine intends to steal the work of a brilliant young man and throw himself on his own; his plan could be a bad thing to kill his talent, which Cain has with arms of his spouses. The first act of everything presented is dead, and Cain acts as an actor to make up his mind. Dyan Cannon is wrong with his wife, and Christopher Reeve (the central part of the movie) is a very good writer in the role of a better writer. These three characters, and Irene Worthen's neighbors, are so inaccurate, after what happens after the setup, much less after the start of the second record. Sidney Lumet's management is cell and fuzzy, as the design is simple and unclean, and the end is a disaster. The actors have to give the script some substances to fight, but with such thin material they are seen to be laborious efforts. * 1/2 ****
