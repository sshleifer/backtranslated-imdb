With a movie called "Gayniggers from Space Space, how are you wrong?" Just throw in some of the top stereo-typed characters, use Village People as the leading soundtrack provider, and throw tons of gay-gags. Landless importance. Very bad, this movie does not make any mistake and no joke. All the characters appear together with the German trooper, they play a joke or two and the rest fails. <br /> <br /> The title made me laugh and was about to laugh more about the movie. My expectation was great apparently.
