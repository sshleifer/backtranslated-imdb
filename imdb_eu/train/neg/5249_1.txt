I'm 13 years old and I hated this film for the worst film in its territory. When I was wasting my time, I was disappointed that I was hanging on the cover and in the back, but I was wrong. But when I saw the delta, it was completely different and I was a bad actor and I did not know how many girls I wanted to be when I wanted to be. Cinema was confusing in some parts and I did not enjoy it, but I saw everything in the movie to see if it would improve, but it was not boring and sad, and I said BORING. And I do not think many other people liked it like it was boring
