What happened to Martin Scorcese to complete this film again? And he not only renewed it, he totally ruined it? The innocent decision played by Robert DeNiro (the most amazing character, which hears much) is ridiculous in a religious fanatic and is a hallmark of attitudes that Hollywood (and Mr. Scorcese especially) face - attitudes that force writers. The best way to make a person madness is to think of thinking about a crucified tattoo. In any case, the movie is horrible. <br /> <br />
