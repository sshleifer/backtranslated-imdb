This movie started with credits from titles, boring and intensive boring wood. Without a doubt, director Richard Jobson directs his debut, but who has awakened the earth by this misguided script? According to the government project, it seems to be another money (Scottish Screen, Surprise, Surprise). I was sleeping three times and sadly my opinion has to be slowed down than this. Please, sir, Mr. Jobson, who has done what we have done before making this sedative of a movie, come back!
