It is always hard to make brothers and sisters better than in your life, always taking them under that shadow and not being bothered to leave your family away. So imagine your oldest brother Santa, and then imagine how hard it should be. Here is this premise <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn plays the title Fred, an angry loser, who spends a lot of energy on her, who does not expect people to enjoy her or her brother. , Santa (played by Paul Giamatti), praise too big, because Fred must be the star of the guy who wants to portray himself. After all, do you not know, Fred needs financial support, and so he needs to do it until his brother Christmas. And they continue with lesson and life lessons. <br /> <br /> Well, that would happen. Actually, with a good deal of time in Vaughn's conversation, Kevin Spacey is getting an auditor to close the operation of Santa (and one of the most vulnerable) to a Christmas movie. I've seen bad guys for a while), Elizabeth Banks is not gifted in a bit of Christmas clothing, John Michael Higgins too much in his elf dress (fair, highlights) and a bitter movie. to feel the same season rates as the second season of the season, to feel fun about all the worst thing about commercialism of the time. <br /> <br /> Rachel Weisz also walks, as well as Kathy Bates, but it's not really a Vaughn movie, and if you like her style you'll find something to enjoy here. Unfortunately, there is very little time to recommend this apple. Outside of Vaughn's riches, the script does not create any unpleasantness, except a good scene associated with a friendly group that works with a very specific problem. <br /> <br /> David Dobkin's direction is half-stable and stable as 20p. A Christmas card that you have not seen for a 10-year-old birthday that you think does not seem to mix the ingredients together and thinks it's a delicious Christmas milk without taking any good mix. No, we get a sweet burning top with too much sugar. Forget and ridicule the elf again if you want a modern and wonderful Christmas comedy. <br /> <br /> See if you want: Santa Clause 2, Santa Child, Santa clause 3: Escape clause.
