The film is worth 2/10. A 1.5-star girl, (I'm sorry I'm pretty good, I think the pretty girl is the only one in the movies), and 0.5 is less than Azumi. I have seen Azumi from 1 to 2. seating I was amazed to be able to sit through it. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about more movie spots. Girl Ueto Aya is nice. All this has to be restored to the whole movie. In fact, if the main character is a male, I am sure that most people (including myself) would not touch the movie. <br /> <br /> Now let's talk about minus points. First of all, the truth is a roar, it has a lot of repetitive scenes. The Nachi and Azumi scenes are back. It seems like a shooting mode in the theater. Japanese traditional drama loves flashbacks, and this movie too. Secondly, the film is not very realistic in a historical structure. I do not like realistic movies. But this movie is like a bad way of showing creativity, like spiders and spiders, such as ninja ... Shinobirena reminds me that even though Shinobi is a fantastic movie. Additionally, the effects of "I do not know", the director directs people who literally kill blood spraying (literally) around ... people who have not cut their head ... and so on ... etc ... Too many of them spoil the show da. The animation effect seems to be strong in this movie. It degrades much of the show. Third, is not Azumi killer supposed to be? For me, it seems like a man-army, it's a female. I do not think you're entering into the assassination army camps. When I felt "Assassin-liked" at the time Kiyomasa Kato Azumi was killed at the end of the year, at the end, the plot was thin in both films. Linear land without development and no surprises.
