Marlon Brando lost his interest in performing this movie. His interpretation as "Swedes" is the worst of his career, and that is precisely what he wanted. It does not abuse you. Instead, he acts in a strange way, and his unrelenting body is fun. The scene rising from the toilet seat of Brando is probably the funniest moment in the history of cinema. Until it comes into the sun, it's hard to believe that the desire for AIT, Agua en el agua and El Padrino, was the same actor. <br /> <br /> I think the real question is why he played for Marlone in recent years. Wrote the movie for the business? He wanted to make himself full of stupidity? We never know But this film is a wonderful research on bad performances. <br /> <br /> Note that, according to Donald Sutherland, his veteran fellow strives to fill his lines, he is ashamed of accepting his participation. This travesty.
