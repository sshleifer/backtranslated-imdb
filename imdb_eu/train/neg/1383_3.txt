Lame, a superhero action movie whirlwind. I awaited the great hope for this movie, and I do not despise the genre of actioneers with HK buddy cop, but I rarely see that the story is dull and playful. This would be forgiving, as always, in these types of films, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it is not. The action marks the reality of the brand and the nature of the HK initiative, but it is not very involved, incredibly penetrating, and in fact, it is often completely inconsistent (perhaps due to the recovery of the American version, often signals often show patchwork places). I was very disappointed.
