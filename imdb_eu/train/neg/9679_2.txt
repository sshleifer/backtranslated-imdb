This movie was a terrible way: you just need to worry. They did not care what happened in the plot; you do not care about characters. Everyone was heartless. I ended up walking around 45 minutes, I just did not want to overwhelm my desire. There is too much sex in the movie. Sex may be okay; It can also be a movie (so Karma Sutra), but here the interview was not beautiful or sexy. It was just ugly. Do not watch this movie
