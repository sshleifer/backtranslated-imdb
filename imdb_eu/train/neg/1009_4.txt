*** REVERSE AN ADVENTURE REQUIRED *** I will make a short and sweet comment. I bought this Best Buy movie because I was interested and they feature excellent actors like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. What could be bad, right? Well, it's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake is in Pollack, a police case that police Edison police police may face. LL Cool J da Deed, F.R.A.T. a police officer in a special group called. (First Response Assault Tactics). Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) has collided with the "on-the-edge" team. In the opening scene, Lazerov & Deed bank robbers were taken, but at night, two pairs of drugs are shaken. I do not want to give a lot, but they give bad things to the boys who do drugs. Pollack works with Ashford (Morgan Freeman), Deeds and Lazerov, goes to court. He plays the evil one and suspects Ashford's help, makes some research into ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey) who is F.R.A.T. The team joins Ashford to bring justice to the alleged police. <br /> <br /> From the beginning you can say that Freeman and Spacey's performance is quite bright. The only person who gives full screenings is Dylan McDermott. This movie is a case of nuts and I believe in it. LL Cool J This movie is awesome. It says all the lines in the same way and shows the same emotion. It was much better in films like Deep Blue Sea and Any Given Sunday. The movie starts with a nice action, but then it falls on the movie feet. The end is not satisfying. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. This weekend I'll give Ebay.
