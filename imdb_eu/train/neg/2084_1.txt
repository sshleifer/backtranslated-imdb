if I use negative numbers I can use it. This movie was really divine. I was hoping to be horrible when I joined the theaters, and somehow surpassed my expectations. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, acting was painful. I wanted to go out, but he was driving my friend and he wanted his money, he thought we were both disappointed. <br /> <br /> When the breasts grew, the girls changed their power and hair. color was wrong Eddie Izzard was bad in the nasty part of the superhero, he was very weak and stupid. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) was a psychotic and strange person, with Matt Vaughn (Luke Wilson) friend (Rainn Wilson).
