Tim (Gary Daniels) desperately wants to get serious TV shows. When he asked for the wrong job, he fired. Her pretty but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) says to her husband. Coming home, Tim is surprised that his house has an uninvited guest (Christopher Lloyd) from Marte's plan! Uncle Martin called him, he soon tries to help his new friend navigate the land's life. But Martin is having trouble going everywhere, from bathroom to laundry and more. Lovely Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finds Tim on the go, but the real love route in this case is not smooth, either. Soon all the TVs make Tim istilking, waiting for a story about a real alien. What should I do? For those who love television in the same name, along with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this film is not worthy to link proverbial medications. It really is, without a doubt, enormous, without trust in the plot and the supposedly special effects. Daniels is well as earthling, but Lloyd is just as terrible as an alien, overacting a storm. The rest are suitable casts, as well as clothing, set and production details. Even if your children have watched the cover and ask for a movie, persuade the video clip to select another movie. Be sure kids and adults will find a huge movie this movie, so in 80 days, choose a night from the Museum or around the world.
