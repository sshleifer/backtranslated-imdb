In the 1960s a religious hippie lay on a sacred religion and left a man, about a man who fights sixteen years later. The man has a child with other police, hidden behind a police attack, and another man named Hawk lives in a small cabin near the river. The worship kills some of its followers or villages. It's hard to keep track of the characters' names, or what scenes they take. The boss was given an agreement sixteen years later (I received the box - I lost time on films). No one is older, not significantly, however. <br /> <br /> A murder occurs with a large circular record, others are made with knives or Crossbow. I have never heard the title of the movie, but most likes it, hooting and hollering. <br /> <br /> A pretty bad movie is combined to explain what happens with the voice that helps (not much). Some sound effects were quite bad. A man gets a kick and we hear the sound of the noise crash. A woman wears a gun and we do not hear the fire, but we listen to a bounce! Apparently, it's not a comic effect.
