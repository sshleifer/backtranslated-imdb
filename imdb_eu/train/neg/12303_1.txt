This is a very bad movie, in an unintentionally funny way. I could not see watching, I was so much laughing! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, but it's not parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul, Emily Wendell, the wife of the preacher's wife, Luke (Corey Sevier), a hilty and mysterious traveler, was finally in prison; The only thing he was guilty of Sevier, however, is bad behavior! Note that it is not worse than the other actors. It is sensible that the actors are films that do not really believe; they're playing straight. Everything about the movie is bad: playback, script, love scenes, peacefulness, plots, music selection. Stage scenes are so stupid; First of all, the shooting of the church, then Luke's last words, Emily, I was laughing. <br /> <br /> Of course, Luke got a lot of weight and he crunched them in prison, and we saw a bare stomach. This is the highlight of the movie.
