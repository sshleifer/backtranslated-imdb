You acknowledge the stereotypes and falsehoods that you have heard about Middle Mothers devotion, and you will see that it has been the star of a hilarious excuse for a movie. In the end, the fortunes of Kurt Hale have changed (I thank you) and we hope that it will take a long time before seeing some of its features in theaters. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was amateur (I think some have used a camera for basketball scenes). The plot was rude and very unpleasant. You really can not understand why anyone has done it. I looked like my eagle was, and a 300-pound lady sat in front of me, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> I did not leave the scale because I had no reason to give me a negative rating for this movie.
