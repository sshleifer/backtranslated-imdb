This is the only movie I've ever seen, the only one that asks me to write reviews on any Internet site, and that is someone who likes "Monolith Monsters attacks". This movie is perfect for anyone who wants a harmful movie. It's like sex and violence, for example. I think this movie is safe for children of all ages. This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to entertain, question or stimulate. Adults can easily obtain sleep before the TV while the children watch this movie. Do not be surprised, however, when the baby wakes up and then turned off the TV and started a board game. As an adult who enjoys entertaining, everything that enjoys everyday life and fantasy, realism, drama, comedy and action, all the adults that turn real life into life and / or imagination, this film does nothing.
