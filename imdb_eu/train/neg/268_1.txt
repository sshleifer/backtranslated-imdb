1 How can I get everyone without a peak like universal translators or translators who can better understand each other? Did the creators of this show realize that the people who moved to different parts of the world, in different periods of time (Attilla Hun was not the contemporary Greek culture of prelature, and were not the contemporary pyramid builders) speak languages? and can it never be developed in a language similar to today's English (except "inflections"), which were influenced by Latin, Ancient Greek, Danish, and French? <br /> <br /> 2 Cultural differences are not so easy to overcome, they have to gain confidence, but the groups are supported without any suspicion and people begin to sort as their appointed heads. They would really like the fans to perceive that they perceive them as gods. People who know it must surprise their technology and accuse them of spellings and the like. <br /> <br /> 3 Historical background: no. Visually, it may be considered Greek or Viking culture, but anyone can wear a set of cloths or a local costume with a rubber hinged pair of plastic horns, and proclaims the appearance of the piece. A small town theater group will surely have better props. <br /> <br /> 4 Boring! Another Canuck lame production, that is, inexplicable for ten years. The kids show that they can grade, but anyone who has little knowledge of human behavior and language can not afford to see the first twelve episodes of Season 1, just like it did. I wanted to believe I had found a decent science-fiction show, otherwise I'd close and clean it for the first five minutes of my computer!
