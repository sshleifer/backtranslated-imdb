It's not completely out of the way, but completely stupid. "Killer Tongue" is a disturbing mix of science fiction, horror and supposed comedy. What this means, cinema is completely harmless and incoherent. The interview is very small, especially for the script to complete the "pond". I would not call it strange, like "full nonsense." This movie will be blank and warn you. There is no reason to waste time, and if so, the sweet smell will look like rotting fish .......................... ... ............................... MERK
