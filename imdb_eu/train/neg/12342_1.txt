Anyone who knows my reviews in the Internet Movie Database knows that I am a penetrating girl from time to time. I do not like films, I mean, for irreversible reason, I feel like I'm going to review. However, if anyone is familiar with the worst movie I've never seen, do not miss Transylvania from 6-5000. Without a doubt, this all takes the title of all times. Film awesome. I can not believe it from the beginning of the end ... <br /> <br /> It's obvious that Mel Brooksen's young Frankenstein's taste was taken, but this was a very enjoyable film. In horror movies traditions, this is an awful and terrifying act of embarrassment. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr are being embarrassed that they are now newspaper partners in Transylvania (perhaps, at first, they realized they were found to be liable to lies). During the course of their research, they encounter the main monster of horror favorites of the past, like vampires, men, lupes and mummies. <br /> <br /> This one of the films that gamble to his ending may request a bet. to encourage them with their hearts to alleviate their emotional distress. It marks the trajectory for all participants and proves that there is a great entertainment when the comedy fails.
