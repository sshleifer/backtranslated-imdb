I like cast, but the story slowly develops in any case. Danny Glover makes a good job asking if he's a bad guy. Meanwhile, the rest of the characters are part of the story. Dennis Quaid did not have much space in the story. I thought the first scene was dipped below, how the story has developed. I would like to see it again. I value 5 (I will rate 5.5).
