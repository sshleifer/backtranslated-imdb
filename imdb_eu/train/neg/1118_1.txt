I was really terrified of this mysterious film. What a dark and unusual atmosphere. And that awful musical score. He was really expected! In fact, after ten minutes you start sweating and you feel uncomfortable, worst you are worried. This movie has a real nightmare atmosphere, and even worse, everything goes away. When I'm bored with an hour and a half, I'm trying to sleep, but the awesome soundtrack tells me. Nuit Noire is an awesome image: eyes, ears, your mind and, above all, the portfolio: money is at great price in an amateur movie because it's a great homevideo to think about spending this amateur.
