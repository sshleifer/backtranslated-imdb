I'm a fan of filmmakers, I'm pretty cheesy and my game is ridiculous. So, think of my spirit to go to the local Rent shop and I found Vampires vs. Zombies. The name is very entertaining, you know that nobody in the world can take something similar, it must be bad. <br /> <br /> And boy, BAD. After watching this horror movie, I talked literally. I and my maid sat down outside without saying a word until after a few minutes, watching both the future of our lives and watching this movie. I broke the silent despair with the words: "... dude ... what?" Yes, I'm an attractive individual. <br /> <br /> A quick 'street review' is Plot; There is no way, ever, in "WTF" mode continuously. Characters; No development, without forgetting. Music; Worse than porn. Vampires; Vampires Zombies; Zombies? <br /> <br /> Finally; Everyone should watch this movie, honestly, I want to see it so bad again. So, do yourself one side, see and get depressed.
