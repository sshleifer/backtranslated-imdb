For that, I introduced myself to the extravagant person who thought it would be "thought-provoking". I love Indy movies and I hope I can also dig it. I hope that the theme button is hot, maybe I can see an outlook on the outsider. <br /> <br /> It's all you can say ... If it's something you can torture yourself or maybe a boy? you like this. Personally I do not like the idea of ​​cutting down on myself or myself, it was a waste. bad script, bad performance, bad story, bad management, bad edit ... I could still. I do not know why he criticized a criticism of a political point by giving this film 10, deceptive and ignorant. Voting on a IMDb movie is not a precedent. Others think that seeing a junk bomb like this is controversial (this movie is not, DRAWS is trying but it does not work). <br /> <br /> You know that the movie is bad in 15 minutes and all the main characters are dying. unfortunately, they die, but they did not give justice to the public in their painful habits, they only suffered 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Please do not feel like it. I received this movie in my local video store at a vault in .50 and I'm feeling ripped off!
