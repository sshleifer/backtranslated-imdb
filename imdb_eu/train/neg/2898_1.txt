Wowwwwww, about an hour ago, I finished this awful movie !!! I wanted to deactivate it in the first 10 minutes, but I would give it an opportunity to improve it. Or, at least, you can have a vindictive quality, at least it seems to me that you can write the movie, or really intelligent or very well shot or something you think ... Needless to say, that was not the case and I lost an hour and a half. I do not know why I'm so terrifying, because it's a bad description of "my disasters," because it's a bad "IMDb", you should reassure the disaster and pay more attention to people. Rate movies and comments are not paid to write good reviews or, in a way, participate in the movie or any other such. I thought it would be funny to see that after this great movie it was included in the grading and I was very surprised to see quite high scores ... All 7-10 star ratings should be clear that they are completely different. movie ... I'm still a fan of the movie, but I think this process of evaluation seriously because this movie should be bigger than 3 times a maaaybbbeee.
