There's really no reason to look at this much more for some misleading suggestions. <br /> <br /> An excellent example is the filmmaker claiming "Saul" or the writer of Paul of Tarus (The Hebrews of the Hebrew Book). As he says, Jesus does not have any idea that man or whatever has been said, this statement is deliberately false, others complain that he or she does not know what the "Bible" says. <br /> <br /> First of all, we can not investigate misleading evidence about Hebrews 8.4; This shows a quote that "Jesus was on earth, he would not be a priest," because of this, he sees here the ignorant and unknown viewer to accept his false premise ... why? What he who does what he who does what he does, does the same. That's the stuff that comes out of context. <br /> <br /> 8 is a verse; 1 "The sum of things that we have talked about now is: we have the chief priest, that is to say, on the right side of the throne of the Majesty," He was in the earth and brought him to heaven after his supposed resurrection. <br /> <br /> It does not matter if the filmmaker wants to get out of the audience's context. Here is a foundation that provides that "Paul was not a JUDGMENT OF Jesus, but" in heaven "will remain only in one? Hebrew 7; 14." Clearly, our Lord went out of Judah; Moses did nothing about the priest for this tribe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br/> Would not you think the filmmaker was trying to show that the writer did not know "Jesus the God"? But, surely, Paul did not write Hebrews, but I did not enter here, but the filmmaker Paul said, and this is the premise of the point given here. <br /> <br /> It is not like this filmmaker does not make different points in different places, but takes the same blind part of the attacking religion. When he is involved in these tactics, with my strong opinion, he loses credence as a religion. He chooses, and the movie is no longer a documentary, but rather a personal opinion, and the bias of the filmmaker, nothing more and nothing less.
