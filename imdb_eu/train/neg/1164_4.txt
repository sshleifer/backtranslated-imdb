I do not know where to start, so I'll start the back of this movie's skin. "Alive Vincenzo Natali's Kuboa Kitamura Versus combines." I have not seen Versus, so I can not comment on it, but I think that Cube is the perfect movie I recommend. However, in this case, someone "tension" has confused "boredom". <br /> <br /> <br /> I will only go ahead and I will ruin the whole plot, apart from the holy Swiss cheese of a crust. Cheese, and the movie is not worth spending, if you do not know the land before, it does not matter. If I did not understand the land, do not knock me - probably I had to fight with my eyelids. <br /> <br /> So, once the American American Nevada lost an OVNI in the Nambi desert. Apparently, that is because both deserts make sense, so they're probably in the same place. Some continents or not. The monkey came to the UFO and got a stranger to a Japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to survive in the wilderness. Something. It is enough to kill anyone who is currently killing the host. The Japanese military wants to use military material, and so the current host (the daughter of the researcher) decides to pass on to another dude. But instead of choosing someone in the army, even if they are people who are wild and already military, it is likely that it is a good idea to select a series of punishments from the death row. Oh, and the reason for this crime is the reason that comes from the queue of death because it is the first murderer of non-lethal electrical shock that is the usual method of history because everyone is dying when the effect of the placebo is electrocuted. . I do not know if they do this when they kill everyone who can drag them into the staff room, if they do not let them down, or they want to cut their electricity bills. <br /> <br /> Then, the movie The Matrix was really a lama, and the unnecessary fights bring tears to us one hour. And wait, now they remember that they had already seen that the foreigner was infected, so that the entire film was totally ruined and human life. Everyone dies. End <br /> <br /> I did not feel like a sandwich I wanted to sleep or eat in the film, there was a bridge with a wall hanging on the wall. , and there he was hanging there, and there is another stroll. The road that hangs on the wall says: "I'm mine, shoot me." And looks at life, and it's not like or anything, so it looks like a fatal and does not want to suffer from the wall guy. So he shoots it. <br /> <br /> (Rhetoric interruption) <br /> <br /> In the stomach. "Gee LOOKS FORTHY".
