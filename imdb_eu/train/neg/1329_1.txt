This movie is AWFUL. I have not laughed so hard in a movie that has been a long time ago. Leno should be standing up and television at the end of the night. The movie cars were excellent, but the movie was the most stupid movie ever seen. It is pathetic, the play is horrible, and the plot may be 4 years old. Do not be bad, it's hilarious jay, but not in this movie!
