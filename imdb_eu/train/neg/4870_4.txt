The movie is bad There is nothing special. It's just a "kid" movie. There is a reason to see this: animal discussion. Some say it's fun, you can not stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in the book, I'm saying "Keyser Soze", or if you say "I'm killing a dead cat," or another animal, see. There's no other good movie to watch. Vote: 10 to 10.
