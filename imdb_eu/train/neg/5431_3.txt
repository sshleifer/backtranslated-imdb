This is your typical Priyadarshan film tipography: a series of missions in a stupid mission. His signature climax is in the middle of the entire cast of the film and is one of the money that is hidden in a moshpit crazy. Whether it's a lottery card waged by Malamaal Weekly, black money on Hera Pheri, "Kodokoo" Phir Hera Pheri, and so on. The director is wonderful. Do not get bad; Since his films are strange and weird, I enjoy comedy. However, most of the previous films have been humorous (Hungama and Hera Pheri). Now, the dizziness of his films is blurring because the same formula is being used repeatedly. <br /> <br /> The songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks great. Rajpal Yadav is angry, and Tusshar is not much better. Kunal Khemu is well and Sharman Joshi is the best.
