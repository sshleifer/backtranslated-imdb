This movie had an 8.1 IMDB rating, which is why I expected a lot more. Spontaneous energy starts with fun and enjoyable. But before reaching the middle of the movie, it starts to drag and everything is badly predicted. Office characters were very wonderful in the first third, but we know them well; They become caricatures, not real people. This is the story I have seen hundreds of times, only here we are told. The thing is, I can create a predicted love story if it had not been the only dialogue! <br /> <br /> The only thing that could be worse than the characters was incongruous and disconcerting motives, and sadly that was the case with the Dead Letter Office. Fortunately, this movie will be Dead Movie Office soon.
