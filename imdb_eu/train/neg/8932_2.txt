It is worth mentioning that watching this movie was very strange and it was a disaster that was published by the 1970 Century 20 Fox Fox. He has also appeared in a series of critical feature films, which has intensified his interest. I watched what a bad movie I wanted to see. When they see that, I think they have my answers. Although I'm going to say that it's such a strange sight, theater, direction and script are so astonishing that the suppository satira is completely lacking. Racquel Welch seems to be trying to get the movie, but after the initial sequence of the sex change operation, the movie goes down so far down the hill, he can not do it alone. John Huston Uncle Buck Loner definitely does not need help, because it licks and lines on the screen, it sometimes seems to be what he does. Rex Reed bounces on myron's Myra status and also has a masturbation scene for her boys. Bravo debut shows! Farrah Fawcett plays the silent blonde; Apparently, he probably believed in this mission. But, of course, the most important role undoubtedly Mae went to the west. The face of a 75-year-old woman, who was visible in the face of the plastic, with sexual innuendo, seemed to fit into a horror film. I do not mean to throw it personally; But in this movie no one comes out well. Management is so valuable and unlikely that this movie is not only bad, but boring. Throw old movies from some old stars and the movie is disconnected. Everyone who liked it and I was happy when I saw the least, but Myra Breckenridge seems to have always been the havoc.
