I really expected the show to be fun, giving all the hype and fast preview clips. And talk about hype, even though I've heard the creator of the show BBC World Today - a show that broadcasts all over the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this show is not even delivered to bring it closer. Every joke is obvious - it's the first time you hear a fun type of sound, but it seems after a fall - and it's not a new treatment or conversion. All characters are in one dimension. It's play - well - crazy (I'm nice). CBC is a classic recipe: one that always fails. <br /> <br /> If you are a Muslim, you should be stupid to believe in one of the white characters, and you probably were pale. a bit injured, because almost all of your characters are deprecated by being soft, ignorant or both. The problem is not white, it's a problem - most of the best comedies are rooted in it. This problem is not just fun - like this show. <br /> <br /> Canada has fun - we regularly export to so many Hollywoods. Why did not they find the producers of this show?
