My wife suffered from this atrocity, after 10 minutes I tried to shut it off, but forced it through the whole thing. This must be always, manually, the most dramatic performance of a movie ... <br /> <br /> It has been a great script, such as: <br /> Sammy - "If it gets here right away, it gets a bonus du "picture. Sammy - "No, a bonus" <br /> <br /> Summarizing: a horrible script, an awesome and very logical performance.
