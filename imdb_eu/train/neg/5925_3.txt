Is Star Trek the "worst" of TOS? Maybe he gets at least the bottom of the votes. I mean, this passage has no great sense. Do you see something that makes you mad? Give me a break. This section also has a different feeling, the music is increased, it is almost forced to increase a feeling. Give me Klingon, Gorn, Tholians, Romulans, no more creatures like Triskelion or those of Medusin. Aliens are very boring to make a passage. McCoy will give the famous phrase "He's Dead, Jim". Spock puts out protective glasses when the ambassador is transported away, but Kirk does not. For the third time that I am remembering, this is a "fence" that is terribly "tertiary" now. For at least the next three episodes, "Specter Of The Gun" and "Day of The Dove" and others would have to be followed, and I'd like to like the likes of Trek to see the syndication show, where I'd like to see. Personal observation, Trek loved to use purple, pink purple color, like in the corridor outside the compartment, usually the gray pass is now purple. We ever had a purple bridge, but it was interesting to see. I found out in several sections, it was a lightweight filter and it works very well, but this section is quite lame in the corridor on the boat.
