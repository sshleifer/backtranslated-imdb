The pathetic use of science to justify religious age / philosophy. They do not have anything to do with each other and what is said about quantum physics is much worse. <br /> <br /> Examples? Quantum theory accepts ideas of Eastern religions that reality is illusion. How In the subatomic world, you will never be able to predict a particle in a specific time. In your opinion, it's just a place at the same time. Similarly, the observation action seems to cause the event. Solid particles cross obstacles. All this, to date, is accurate. But then they say, this means that if you think you are honest enough to walk through the wall, actually. Poppycock is full. Instead, according to the theory, it is possible to walk through a wall on our level, but it's just coincidence and nothing related to belief. You would also enter the eternal wall to have the most remote possibility of passing through the wall, necessarily astronomically opposing. <br /> <br /> This is just an example. figure a little science But much more annoying is the narrative of an ill-fated photographer Marlee Maitlan. In the middle of the image, it becomes so mixed to be incomprehensible. Something related to negative thoughts created by addiction and self-destruction. That may be true, but Quantum Physics is not related to that. <br /> <br /> In addition, the theory of cosmography in physics is a new thing today. Instead of losing this Dreck, I recommend you rent Elegant Universe, a wonderful series of PBS made in NOVA, Newton's and gravity, I'll give you 3-hour episodes of Ed Witten's and M Theory's physical history. Quantum mechanics is quite well explained if you want to know the fog of metaphysical awareness.
