This movie is horrible. Terrible One of the worst movies. I can not imagine that Gigli is worse. We could say the forecast "NO", but we started looking for something we've found right now, and we decided to move forward. <br /> <br /> STUPID US. <br /> <br /> Affleck NO IS an actor. It's an image and the explosion looks good, but Bruce Willis did not even get it with "Die Hard." Taking off the shirt and playing it bad, it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> Catherine O'Hara was the best - it's always good. Gandolfinin once again whistles (if it was not Sopranos, it would clear it) just like "Mexico". <br /> <br /> Affleck makes all the scenes and, as they say, they have no characters. It has any motivation for their actions. <br /> <br /> Avoid this filter at all costs.
