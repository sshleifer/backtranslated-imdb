Having watched and loved postcards (I really loved the postcard), I decided to try another Uwe Boll movie and I stumbled on a local DVD store and I think it was better. movies <br /> <br /> Although the first 10 and 15 minutes of the film were very promising, it seemed to be the beginning of a great psychological excitement, it soon dropped down and eventually sank most. The slasher generic movies I have seen so far, including lots of puzzles, emotional reactions and sub-parting. Boll seems to have done his best to get a decent plot, but after a while he has stopped. Maybe he should get a comedian ?! The good thing about this film is that it achieves a generous global atmosphere, the sound effects are better than those I expected and the soundtrack goes well with the general atmosphere, but the unequal tranquility of the movie, combined with the word, generic character is half a half boring time, my experience is completely ruined it has The scene is amazingly well done, but there seems to be no shock value. Let's not forget the camera's work is quite nauseous. <br /> <br /> I hope that Uwe Boll will learn about what's good news for a day, because it seems he can do a lot of fun movies. once shot Seed is just one of them.
