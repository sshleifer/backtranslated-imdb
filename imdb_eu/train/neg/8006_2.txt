This movie acts and fears well with the comedy and the theater, the only way to make emotions among audiences, just like a horror movie. Unfortunately, with storybooks, sad plot and contradictory scenes, the movie made me frustrate, and it's hardly "ever the greatest monster." <br /> <br /> Let's get started with good things: comedy, theater and special effects. From the start, this movie starts with fast and sharp paces. The opening scene - the monster is originated - it is rich and fast, and reminds of the classic "catastrophic" disasters of many monsters. Pacing is faster, the opening of other monster films is a great and often awesome scene, and it was a great opportunity to leave the movie straight away. For 10 minutes, you get "why", "where" and "how" you are and you are ready to act. This movie must be delivered. <br /> <br /> After another brief and good sequence, characters come in: lazy and her early childhood, grandparents, and talented sisters (aunt) and, of course, monster. Characters come in context from each other and their conflicts appear instantly, allowing the audience to feel that the monsters suddenly reveal their ruin in the field of living and working. <br /> <br /> Your own monsters look like a stranger, like a dog and a fish that is infected with squid. The consequences of this creature are not in any way unusual, but it's compelling, and you can never watch chains in the movie. He knew the movements of the monster, like rottweiler grows and enthralled the linoleum like monster barn in the crowd, slamming, crushing and eating on surfaces. When the path of the monster meets the family and when the tragedy occurs, it is a painful moment, and you can think of revenge, but from there the movie begins to appeal. <br /> <br /> Dinamita initially breaks the focus and continuity of the movie. The lines are inserted and then canceled. Characters change the position without apparent reason and comedy is involved in dramatic scenes that are confusing, and the obstacles seem to appear and apparently disappear. <br /> <br /> Regarding the comedy, tell me: I am ready to accept a lot of humor. I do not know the Korean humor, so things can be lost in translation. However, I would like to like a major Asian university, and still lives in Japan for the past 5 years (I'm still here). I think that Asian humor is better known than the average white. I understand that I understood that a lot of the movie should be fun, but not for me. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: after losing the first attack by the young daughter, there is a family funeral; we all mourn. A new character enters - brother - and the tension increases, obviously the two brothers are in conflict. They both lose their loss and end up being a hard-hitting rival. This contest is basically fun: the two brothers are so fond of competing in a funeral competition and show a terrific nature of family love in Asian comedy. This homemade comedy was offered to the family, and it is a ritual mute fun, but it seemed really lost in the context of a lost girl. ************** END SPOILER ************* <br /> <br /> Then come the plot holes. There are many points that are never shown or, worse, they explain and, in the end, they are invalid. Finding an obstacle is not an obstacle for a character to be a good thing, but you would expect something like that. Instead, they are already immersed in the listener's time, problems are just "not" and nobody has ever started to start the problem. So I ask: why bring it first and foremost? <br /> <br /> The main prevalence of the film caused problems with new problems, and suddenly the film was filled with an anti-trusting force that was not solved by the world. Without a doubt, the introduction of new and bigger problems is a story that tells the tradition, but if entering a new arch requires a summary of another, you should explain at least a full explanation of the new arc. It's not in this movie. Instead, as with several stories, only 20% of the entire course came up and, in the end, the parts never completed a complete one. <br /> <br /> I'm ready to accept it again. This can be a lot 'cultural'. Perhaps in the tradition of the Korean tale a comedy was included in a tragedy. It is common for a story to walk like a child coloring outside the pages of each page, but it never ends. It might be possible to present the problem in the plot, but to randomly remove this problem without random solutions or karsis. Or perhaps these are sloppy works and draws a film of much better reputation than rampant bad stories.
