In the movie theaters I saw this movie and I got into the room when I was surprised. There was only one girl and me! This was a very good movie for me. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, it was a short film. Ben Affleck buys a family in Christmas Eve. It is a very predictable narration when she is in love with a girl who hates her. His performance is fine, but the film's comedy is not very good. The ground line is bad and the comedy is not what it is. <br /> <br /> However, there are several points. For example, the family is breaking up and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I expect a review that other people have squandered their money. I was so ashamed when I left the room !!!
