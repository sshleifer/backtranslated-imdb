This is the type of regret you put into your video camera. Stephen Kings is a bad and bad version of "Misery (1990)". I can not understand how this movie got a 5.2 score, because it never had a story, and when I finished the movie I rested. <br /> <br /> This film should be released as a short film for more time, the same is spent. And like every bad movie, everything happens at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minute period ... <br /> <br /> So, before you decide to watch this movie, put some new batteries in your remote control, fast forwarding Because you should ... do not worry, you will not lose any importance.
