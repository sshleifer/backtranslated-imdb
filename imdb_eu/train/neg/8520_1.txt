When I realized that "Hamish Macbeth" was broadcasting in the United States, I was very happy. I was sorry to see the evil thing I had. I see the civil books of M. Beaton about the excellent portable Scotland. The characters in the book are very entertaining and written. The powers in charge of this Mish-Mash have never read one of Beaton's books. It only has the name "Hamish Macbeth" with the series. As well as not familiar characters, the show is very hard. It seems actors need to shout their lines and cite each other. If you love MC Beaton Hamish Macbeth, do not waste your time in this litter.
