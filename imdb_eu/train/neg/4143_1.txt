Being myself and my other half treacherous with dustbins could not have been a great success to get a good movie. However, with the cover of Freddy Vs Jason's 2004 cover! The worst movie I have ever seen, if you can sit down and laugh at it! <br /> <br /> The effect is horrible ... I can do better if my camera truck is just so poorly zombie's faces and nothing but stopping your neck, hands, etc. Any line, a curious flashback that is nonsense! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "You broke my tooth!" A man who split his "cigarette" from a vampire was the man whose uncle Jessie Dukes crossed a Santa!
