Entertainment Tonight has fallen in the mountains in the last few years, but since last night's fall (August 17, 2006), they got a new bass. <br /> <br /> They decided to make their dissemination effort. Photos of the current body of JonBenet Ramsey last night ... They say that "photos of the case you never saw". Two graphics were very disturbing. One was near the face and head / neck and it was clear that my skin and my face were softened around the neck. That was so terribly frightening, I could not believe it. How has ANYTHING related to Hollywood Entertainment happened? Nothing !! They have already dropped a lower level of dignity and values ​​... and it shows. This was the first show ... and now it's just garbage. <br /> <br /> From now on I will see Access Hollywood.
