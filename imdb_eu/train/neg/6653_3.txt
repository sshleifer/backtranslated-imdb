I only saw this movie, and I must say that the loss of time was great. She played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad), the girl can not act. She read her very unpleasant lines and had very natural faces on her whole movie. On the other hand, when Rosanna Munter played Petra, it is natural. He acted with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple: we saw a lot before. He breaks, finds another, becomes jealous, breaks another girl and eventually they return together. There was no surprise, that Eva would be split up and that she would "tie" Adam Petra. The only thing that nobody saw was that Petra told Adan Eva to go to the party. It became Serra, because Petra's party did not see them before, and asked Eva to win the back of the heart, it was very nice. <br /> <br /> In addition to Rosanna Munter, there is not. A single act that gives a memorable reality. <br /> <br /> The actors with a mediocre film are not cancerous, so I do not recommend it!
