Jane Eyre is one of the greatest novels in English and should read this script. I hate writers explaining what Spark's remarks are about. This movie is overwhelming to see you read this book. <br /> <br /> The "red room" is so small and I wonder why they eat it. In the book "In the Red Room". 'It is predicting the whole story and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is so ill treated in the film, I'm sure she was happy to die and get out early. The book is one of the most believable characters and has no red head. The subject of all Christians is not missing the rest of his life and movies. <br /> <br /> Get yourself aside and lose the movie and read the story Charlotte Bronte masterfully told.
