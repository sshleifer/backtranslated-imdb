When I watched the previews of this movie, I did not expect at the beginning - a teenage horror movie about. But, wow, this movie was absolutely horrible. And this is generous. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the casting of the movie was horrible. You feel no (or no sense) feelings for the people. The performance was so enormous that it simply waited and waited for God's horrible things. Secondly, the points of the film have no connection. Someone please tell me why the little girl starts to look like the boys scream "PANCAKES !!!" At the top of the lungs, when Jackie Chan enters, the man that has never seen the virus and the virus is getting even more emotional? Why is it still that the child's dad is angry with the virus infected and is looking for the trash? I felt confused and incensibly, literally, I said aloud: "Where did you get that?" <br /> <br /> I just could not believe what I saw. I really thought I saw bad films, but I must say that Cabin Fever exceeds all this. I want to kick this movie and put me back. Then blow my head. <br /> <br /> Please keep yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. Looking at herbs may be a good alternative.
