The Treasure Island DVD is required in any production production course! It is an example book that does not want to make a movie. When watching the movie and listening to the writer / director's comments, it graphically shows the wide cave between what people know and what they know about them. Call me the old man, but I think the movies as a means of communication, and communication is not the whole audience does not know what the director is talking about. The director's alleged intention is to make the movie "Hollywood Agreements". Among these conventions are the clarity of the nature and concept. The director realizes that audiences often do not understand the points that avoided the "Hollywood kliché". However, it never seems to understand the idea of ​​topical existents for one reason. There are links to quick and clear complex ideas. It's good to avoid them, but they need to be replaced with another way of communicating the idea, not just deleting it. The film was built on a premise and rich premise. In the two days of the Second World War at the end of the Second World War, the identity and background of an unknown body is attributed to two puppets. Soon, each one of his fantasy characters starts with the character and their invention becomes more and more authentic. A person who despises less than the tradition of the story "Hollywood Convention" can create a wonderful movie with this idea. This film is definitely not! Puppets make everything they can to make them more coherent, but they have often won overwhelming and dull scripts. Especially, Gonzo, who plays a hard life, I'm surprised. In Muppet many films, it is always remarkable as a charismatic puppet.
