Every day I see a lot of shit, but God receives the Hot Rod cake. I saw a free NY release tonight. I'm expecting paid customers to show you a fun version. The laughter was rude, the plot had no interest, and the characters were of a size. It is noteworthy that Adam Samberg has a fun dance scene. It was the only scene that was unprepared and I really laughed. In addition, I can not remember the courage and dead air. SNL and Samberg fans may be disappointed. I know I expected more from there. But I definitely do not recommend a free screening or movie.
