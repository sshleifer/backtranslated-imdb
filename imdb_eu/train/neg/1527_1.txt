If you really want to miss out on two hours of your life, do this: <br /> <br /> 1) Check it out on TV shows. 2) Find the movie 'Men in White'. 3) When 'Men in White' arrives, sit and watch. <br /> <br /> And that's it. Two times a puns, a nasty (and not so funny) movie reference after two hours, and having experienced the lowest cost of production ever since, you waste your time in two hours, and asks exactly why. br /> <br /> Why did I do that? It was stupid enough to think that the movie would be really good. It was not that. <br /> <br /> But when you're old enough to remember with Power Rangers, you can see some of the faces you already know in the movie. Probably, in order to save production costs, Saban (who also works with Power Rangers) decided to wipe out monster costumes all over the film with their favorite toy cattle franchise. When I saw them, I saw some old monsters. So I think that at least I have a value for nostalgia. <br /> <br /> But if you want to see the real power. Rangers monsters, see the same Power Rangers. This piece of garbage is much better than this. (And that's something to say!)
