As an inspiring director myself, the movie was exciting with the mind critique. Shot with the latest digital camera, probably with a 35mm DOF adapter. The good edition is decent, the sound effects are not over. I'd give an Indie 7 movie, but the story is not interesting. Drama is a supporter of the characters' development of a horror film. <br /> <br /> It's not scary to just have fun or enjoy those who want to sit popcorn. <br /> </ p> <p> Honestly, this movie would be good if we continued in the 50's <br /> <br /> This movie is about a family with a dry field, and that's just it.
