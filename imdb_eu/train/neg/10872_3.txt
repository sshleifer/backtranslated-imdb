Here's an indie movie that I would like, but I could not finish. The lack of script (killing in the main titles is proclaimed) to kill and kill the image. The story is not a story worth trying to make. I got bored in 10 minutes and then I suffered the rest of the first 40 minutes - I hope it's best - before the end of the chapter ends (even if that was not worth the effort) OZARK SAVAGE tries hard to make it hard, Evolving the best EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX sequences, as a result of which OZARK SAVAGE is not very well before, and better, this movie would be as entertaining as 10-20 minutes less, but as a feature it is full and obligatory. , there is no money in shorts, so I understand financial reasons I think it's 75 minutes + +. The director Matt Steinauer shows great promise and I want to be lucky.
