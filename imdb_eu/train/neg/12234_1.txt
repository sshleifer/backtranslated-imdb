I think it's just the second part of a movie called "My Girl". "My Girl" was a very good movie, but it's ridiculous for the second part of the feature film (Thomas J.) to be a major character (Macaulay Culkin). This story ends after the first movie. I wonder why someone tried to find a way to get the story done. It was nonsense!
