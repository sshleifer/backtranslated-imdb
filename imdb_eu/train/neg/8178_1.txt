Have you ever sat down watching movies for 20 or 30 minutes and suddenly saw that you actually watched the movie? That happened to me with "The Young Graduates". The video box cover, if you find the video, is very deceptive. I would swear that the two women on the front would not even film. <br /> <br /> However, a decade later I was born to appreciate the better points in this movie or ... the junk is empty. I'm looking at this one, but I think some films have developed a connection to this movie. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... on the plot. A plot Let's see ... somewhere there must be a plot of land everywhere. No, I did not find it. Drugs that are considered to be in the elderly for schools, and decades old, are becoming obsolete in the language they are talking about. One of the female students has their teacher's condemnation. The teacher has a cold wife (who designates the ice maker), so the girl's advances are allowed. <br /> <br /> There are many conversations and fast conversation and spacial dance. Our cat, BooBoo, was shaped by old school dances. He saw an amazing intensity as the dancers shook and danced at the balloon. It's nice to find at least one species that is interesting in this relic. 1/10
