I have almost any owner of Seagal films (that is, those who have low budgets), and I should say that this may be the worst, not just for his films, but for all the films he has ever done. The highlight of this movie, and the only reason I gave it to 2 stars, is A. Seagal, and B. Seagal has a number of sequential action sequences, specifically in the store, as well as others. full army with a knife. Next, Seagal will kill people for 90 minutes, and do not get stuck with a story line, because the story is not only blowing, but also the theater, F-18 and F-14, somehow F-16, as well as Stealth F-16 it was fast. Also, Stealth never had to supply it ??? Since then, Afghanistan has taken an airfield from one point of the Air Force. At last I found out that Afghanistan did not own the Air Force, we controlled the sky (USA). Likewise, this great secret mission was playing with all the crew in the room, but the Almirant still tells the other guy that he is a secret. Also, how did the Seagal truck go from the bottom? Tell us why they were imprisoned, since the Air Force Air rider is a big command (if not Owen Wilson?) And when are their drinkers in Arab countries, given the Muslims' lack of alcohol? Are Arabs also listening to women's orders like # 2? The film emphasized that Seagal had killed 50 people with 50 knives, and there were no lesbian scenes with a very short and totally random scene.
