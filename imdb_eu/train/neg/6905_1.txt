Polynesian men's clinks are drinking, fighting and unwanted sex, stupid and uncomfortable. The real Polynesian life is more fun than those stereotypical cardboard characters. Unexpectedly, the Samoan girl did not see Samoan's appearance or act, when she seemed to be somebody who was somebody like a white woman. With weak water story lines, you can not say anything about acting - even if the best actors could not do anything with this script. It's sad that the polynomial actors play sad stereotypes in a movie that does not have a good scene and is ready to see only two or three "jokes". What is the loss of money from Kiwi taxpayers, what is the lost opportunity to make a great movie about a passionate community? It's better if they do not make movies as bad and crazy.
