What was the good idea of ​​MGM thinking of putting Clark Gable student in the role of a Salvation Army employee? Ironically enough, another star of great future, Cary Grant, also played a Salvation Army man two years later on SHE DONE HIM WRONG. In my opinion, it's easy to see the stupidity of these roles, but I'm still surprised. WHO thinks Salvation Army boys are "HOT" and who dashing those men look and acted as realistic representations. In the past, I worked with the sister company I organized the Salburu Armada (American Volunteers) and I have never seen girls (which unfortunately, for me). Maybe I should get a job with Salvation Army! <br /> <br /> So, if it's really curious, this is a great movie to look for, but all others, bad writing, crazy conversation and annoying moralizing are very slow.
