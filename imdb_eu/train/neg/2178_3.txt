Jason (Herb) Evers could take the experiment with me, I would not like this movie any more. Many of the first seven Samurai reviews have been accused by Toshiro Mifune. However, more and more critics watched the movie, they saw it as they had necessarily done. Jason Evers, of course, is not Toshiro Mifune, and his abuse is that. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors in this classic B were good actors, Evers and showgirls were less. If you see this movie, you would realize that Evers was crying in almost every line, that is to say, when he smokes and his nose fills his frozen gesture. <br /> <br /> The special effects were similar to B in this course. From the point of view, there is not so much in my head that I think is fantastically good or bad for this movie.
