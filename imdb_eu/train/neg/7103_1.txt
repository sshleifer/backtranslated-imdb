This is the best way to describe this movie aimed at a married couple in a house that is being killed by the first wife to be married to mysterious circumstances by mysterious wives. That's fine, but playing is the time to get bored. Actually, one of the fun things about this film warns of the beginning of the film for anyone coming out of a huge coffin. Well, trust me, no one ever offered them in front of this offer, when somebody is frightened, plastic skulls, earrings, jewelery makers and doors break out. And it's the worst music, a kind of music that is played by a sixth student. And you will discover such an incredible secret that is so obvious, to ask what people in this movie were thinking about. Someone dies in the race and knocked the head and the police never called for investigation. Yes, at the end, it's a slow pace (it's very bad when it comes to more than one hour in the movie), it's a boring story that is easily taken by an average person. It seems that no person in this film is the average person.
