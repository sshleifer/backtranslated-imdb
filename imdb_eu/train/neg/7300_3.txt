This movie is about a group of five friends renting a farmhouse in the woods. One of the people catches a great virus that eats meat. Suddenly, friends are linked to each other to make the illness anxious to try their opposite. <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is a horrible movie. In the meantime, he tries to find a lot of genres at the same time. A tribute, a slasher, a black comedy or a terrifying movie that is unwanted comedy? Nobody can say At first the scene is serious and the second change becomes fun. When the movie is about to be fun, the humor is quite soft because the end is not there. I really liked it. <br /> <br /> But by the end, I was quite disappointed and worried. Violence is wonderful, far more afraid of looking at the screen. Each pitch changes in each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes horrific and sometimes quite random. In fact, she makes a girl playing karate. What do we need to get this? This girl punched a character. Was that fun? I do not know. <br /> <br /> Some of the shows were decent, and many were very amateurs. I do not take responsibility for most of the characters. The plot liked me, but the execution was awful. As a horror movie, I did not know what it was. I did not find it fun, tense or scary. In the end, I leave you indifferent, "What happened to me?" Unfortunately, you never know the answer to that question.
