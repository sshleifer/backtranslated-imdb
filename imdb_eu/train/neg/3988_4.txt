In summary: <br /> <br /> There's a lot in mind about Spike Lee. Color of racism, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, "heter sexism", drug war policy, etc. Thinking ... <br /> <br /> This level of awareness is great for the owner. I believe that a blessing is that more and more people have decided to study the key aspects of our daily lives; the silent and invisible forces that govern our society. However, because Lee makes fun movies he will not become a good filmmaker. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The description of these socio-political forces is "Jungle Fever". This is largely the result of two major failures: <br /> <br /> first, Lee is just trying hard. He seems to be desperately thinking about every 90-minute political and social reflection. And so the final result seems confusing and insoluble, because it does not have the time to develop the characters to fulfill the ideas they want to present themselves. And so it spreads stereotypes and leaves rigid testimonies and highly charged conversations. The final result is very dramatic and is not realistic. Secondly, trying to make statements about a large number of social functions, does not appear to have a specific or original interpretation of the social and political issues presented. The one found is a senseless flood pool. Feel that you purchased a basic sociological book and dropped 500 pages. <br /> <br /> These are a very important problem because it sacrifices the art of the movie and turns it into a loudspeaker. the voice of the filmmaker. He can not talk about himself and allows himself to speak. <br /> <br /> It is not just an artwork or a good political debate. <br /> <br /> Even though I still focus Lees on these important issues, I must say: <br /> <br /> Two fingers down.
