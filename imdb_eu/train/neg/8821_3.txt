Why do not they learn? When you use a nice and juicy exploitation gimmick, use it! Do not try to get deep and thoughtful; you will only be foolish. <br /> <br /> Evil Christmas is Harry Stadling's story, when he saw a little bit of kissing mommy (like dad's) when Santa Claus came back as a child. So, of course, Christmas is obsessed with Christmas and, finally, when disappointment becomes too big, it goes out, dressed as Santa, and dies in the city with children dressed in toys and kills anyone wicked. <br /> <br /> It's pretty easy and it's not a bad place to start. (After all, how many schwarz-themed horror films use Schtick?) Unfortunately, this film aims to be "Portrait of Santa, a Serial Killer" rather than "Silent Night, Deadly Night." Two-thirds of the movie goes to documenting the slow but inevitable breakdown of Harry, which at that time were the first titles I wanted to buy the premise. You know that a slasher movie is having trouble with your kidnapping when you're on the go. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the madness crash could have been credible to a trained manager, but you! We have a guy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently, this is his only movie, and it shows. The action scene and the scene jump into action without knowing the clear or clear shots of actors, where we are and what we are seeing. <br /> <br /> Even though the film is remembered, we are still dealing with the great self-compassion, insecurity and neurotic behavior of Harry. More depressing than most fearful, Christmas evil must be avoided.
