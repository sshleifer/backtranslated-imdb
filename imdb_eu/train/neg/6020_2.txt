I like the latest movies. I like B movies. I expected this movie I'd like. <br /> <br /> Evil effects, often horrifying music, ignored the coconut lines. I ignore unexplained events and the excuse of the film by Deus ex Machinain is constantly based on this topic. I can refuse people who are struggling against hunger and people who are trying to reach the whole world. One of these things does not kill the movie. This dying movie means it's boring. Nothing happens; almost all scenes of the film are designed to encourage film makers to moral morality, for having a consistent story or suspense. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an entertaining B-movie look elsewhere. This movie is boring.
