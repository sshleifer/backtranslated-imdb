Dr. Mordrid is horrible. I would not recommend it if the adult or the child were murdered killer. There's so much dirt in this movie, yes. Speaking to the eyes, there are eyes in the sky in the back of the stars. Only the devil could imagine such an evil thing. I've rented all the copies of local video stores and I've shredded them with lots of stuff. This film should be blocked in a winery that is behind a fourth dimension, with all the horrors of hell. That's where the movie is. If you want a scandalous entertainment, go and rent All Dogs Go to Sky, or Angels Outside. They deserve to watch these movies. If you want to make a match and you love horrible movies, see Dr. Mordrid
