There's not much to say about this movie, it's horrible. <br /> <br /> There's no way in doing and interviewing too much in the mid-decade, the story of a hybrid male lizard is not very well explained and the whole thing. here holes are placed here and there. <br /> <br /> CGI is something you do not want to see. It is so nice that it vomits me. <br /> <br /> The good things on DVD were in Extras. Gag coil. Everything else, waste of time and money. I hope that nobody bought it, this is not even worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Just stop this.
