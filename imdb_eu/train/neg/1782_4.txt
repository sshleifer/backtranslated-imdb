A charming little boy and his mother are out of place, cats and deaths will soon follow. That is why this is summarized. <br /> <br /> I will admit that the cats are terrified after watching the movie. But seriously, despite the fact that there are many things wrong with this film, and I think that there is so much to do with it, it's a very pleasant experience in general. <br /> <br /> Characters are more like cartoons here only with trusted basic instincts. The lust or anger of fear, greed, pride is motivated by these people. Although it seems to be arguable, it seems that the fault actually tells the story. The supernatural premise and Stephen King's script (I do not know exactly what Mr. King's is) works well with FX interesting, make-up and good music. The absolute curiousity of this movie is definitely what Alice Krige plays with Mary Brady, with the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> King is trying to get a simple or different storytelling storyteller (agrees) in this case), trying to get into a little horror treasure on a collection of horror fans.
