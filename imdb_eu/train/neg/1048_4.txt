Victor Vargas lift: review <br /> <br /> You know, lifting Victor Vargas is like putting hands in a large oven. It's hot and gooey, but you do not know if it feels good. I tried to get up and down Victor Vargas just as I tried. I noticed that something was not good. Victor Vargas has some doubts about the director. Apparently, the director thought that the backbone of the ethnic East of the lower family of Latinos would prove to be an idyllic story by film critics. He was right, but he did not deceive me. Victor Vargas raises a story about a seventeen year old boy, who invented Victor Vargas (Victor Rasuk). He plays teens with more wheels than all the years that Rolling Stones have visited. The film begins in 'Ugly Fat' Donna's room, where Victor will seduce her, but her outburst goes off when Harold's (Kevin Rivera) is looking for her best friends. Harold and his sister are trapped in an attempt, Victor Vargas escapes controlling damage. However, in the shameful involvement of youngest neighbors, nothing is going to hunt Victor youngsters to get more fresh meat. In a warm day in New York, they focus on a local public pool where Victor's eyes can be seen by Judy (Judy Marte), a beautiful young nymph (Judy Marte), who is not quite strong and independent. Victor and Judy become the focus of the film. The story is about Victor's family, grandmother or grandmother (Altagracia Guzman), brother Nino (who plays Victor's true brother Silvestre Rasuk) and his sister Vicky (Krystal Rodriguez). Event Victor follows scenes between Judy's scenes and her family. Victor tries to face Pimp-Daddy trying to make Judy's feelings and a conservative Catholic promotion for her grandmother. <br /> <br /> There are few problems that arise from the Victor Vargas Concept, but they are shameless. Throughout the movie you will meet with some of Vicky, Nino, Grandma, Judy, and Judy Melonie. The problem is that Victor Vargas knows nothing about the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood. We know how to soften her lips and she knows that she plays in the trash, and the girl invites herself to enter the bag, but that's all. We know that Nino plays the piano and, silently, you have been able to see the prizes of the family piano. We know Nicki's sister, a loving girl interested in watching TV. We know that grandmother is a woman with a traditional Latin profession, trying to grow her children with a conservative, excessive corruption in the world. Still where is the owner of Victor Vargas? There's something in this movie, but we're telling what the movie is about. That is, farther the biggest mistake of the movie. Victor Vargas is not so much a character, but a ball of ping-pong, Judy and his grandmother bounces, but we never know Victor Vargas who he really is. It's important to know that Victor Vargas is one of only known, a Manhattan teenager who is sexually active. It's a total alpha man. Victor Vargas is not the type of character he likes. Why anybody? So, at the end of the film, after this incident, would we really think that Victor Vargas has achieved some degree of depth and that his path has been a flaw? How could the depth of this two-dimensional nature be? Only if the director worried about worrying about getting his film done by his main character, he worried a little more <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, to the big screen. A few films have made in the past. The film is really happy for being real and I will not argue that way. I have not seen this level of reality since it was given to CBS by Survivor. Although the movie is really beautiful cityscapes, writer / director Peter Sollett was very close and hand-drawn. This problem is especially evident in the claustrophobic inner scenes, to make a deep breathing exercise. As the film continues, the shots are narrower and narrower on the face on the screen with their forehead stuck in the forehead; Victor Vargas can smell cheap colonies. The overall effect is not realistic in contrast. Inner apartment scenes look small and small, this is not true. I have been in these types of apartments; I lived one at a time. They are not exquisite, but they have high ceilings and are living spaces that are decent. According to the rules of the film, these apartments were 5x5 cells with brick and mortar, split paint and cracked walls. Unfortunately, the ongoing use of Sollett's close shots and a great shot at a single scene has been a great thing. But Victor Vargas Raising is only the second movie of Sollett, and his most popular, will be a strong filmmaking effort, which will make it even more fun as the film continues. The summary that I read a comment has been shortened: "Ethnic Origin," and I do not agree more. If the film and story of Victor Vargas really is true, the characters would not be applicable to Latin, Chinese, etc. Whether it be However, if you take this story and tie it in a few neighborhoods with a bunch of teeny -Bopper white kids's results will not be fierce, and we'd see more movie mistakes. Indeed, in this film, I am concerned about other aspects of using Latinos. While we question Victor Vargas in some aspects. For example, Victor, Nino and Vicky all have the same room. This triggered my alarm, because it was contrary to what I thought. A family of respectful family, any Latino family, should not be divided between two older brothers with a thirteen-year-old girl. At first I was sure it was wrong, but after talking with my grandmother, I learned that my problem was justified. Considering how much your grandmother is, we think that Vicky would sleep in her room. <br /> <br /> While he was my grandmother, the grandmother's house grew as a conservative in Latin. At full time, I had a lot of connections with the movies in a variety of ways. That's why my critical point of view is sweet and sour, because it really loves this movie. Unfortunately, the lack of respect for Victor Vargas was not frustrated by the feeling of the film. Maybe Victor Vargas reminds me that when they got me when I was playing with Sega Genesis, when I was seventeen. Perhaps without any eye to the film, Victor Vargas Latino is just a stereotyped hot-blooded, who ends up shouting at her car, "Hey bean bee, do I want my mahogany to me?" Anyway, I do not like it, So, finally, how do I like a movie about him? So, forgive me, I'll bring my hands to a bowl of clams. <br /> <br /> <br />
