CQ is very slow and I am David Mamet. The movie continues around a young filmmaker who is making a movie filmmaker. Then he started to lose my movie. Deep and deep It's not really. The problem is not to end the "Dragonfly" movie in CQ. This CQ is very parallel, and the end is missing (in my opinion). I was lucky to catch this film at the SxSW Film Festival. I had a great liking when I saw Y Tu Mama Tambien and many other great films. I was waiting for the performance of Jason Schwartzman. But it was not an easy movie. If you're not into Science Fiction Science Fiction or Slowness in the 60s, jump out. <br /> <br /> CQ feels like a study film. If you want to rent an independent science fiction movie, Donnie Darko does not sleep.
