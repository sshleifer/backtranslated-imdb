After Chaplin made one of her best films: Dough & Dynamite, she made her worst: Gentlemen Of Nerve. During the first years of the films, Chaplin made a third of her films. Many of these were experimental in terms of ad libbing, editing, gags, location shooting, etc. This happens in a racetrack when Chaplin and her friends do not pay. Mabel Normand is also with her friend, and Chaplin gets rid of her and Mabel friends. Afterwards, he has echoed Mabel and has no apparent influence on his behavior. There are a lot of slapstick here, but there is very little to recommend this film to see if Chaplin develops later. I saw the form was wrong, which could cause its delight. Charley Chase can be seen. * 4 stars.
