I'm really surprised that the great director, like Chuck Jones, has begun to get very boring among the cartoon I have ever seen. I did not laugh at this short, and Bugs Bunny is a cartoon for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always fun, not boring! Unfortunately, this short is Good Night Elmer (another very boring Jones very boring) with Bugs Bunny. <br /> <br /> The first warning of the sad cartoon is always a gag payoff. Good Night Elmer was boring because he had dragged the same two gag with the planned win. This cartoon, on the other hand, suffers a second sign of a cartoon: there is too much talk. The cartoon has at least two gags in the sleeve, but most seem to have a great deal of collaboration with a longer look. At some point, he ends up eating Elmer and the commentary said: "That was the www of weawwy awfuwwy good", maybe it was the redundant conversation on cartoons (those that read aloud the characters in Woody Woodybecker's characters). it's not in my book). Even though the cartoon is only 8 minutes, it is felt in a similar conversation over the next 20 years. <br /> <br /> Elmer's Pet Rabbit did not make me funny cartoon, but if you sold your soul to Chuck Jones and could not admit that he had directed some clunkers along his career, he might be able to enjoy it.
