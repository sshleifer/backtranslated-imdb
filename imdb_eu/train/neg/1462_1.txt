This was the worst film ever I've ever seen. Mikshelt says the movie is not historically correct. It starts badly and down there. Hitler's father curses his luck as he marries his own nephew, "what happened!" In fact, they were the second cousins. Hitler's mother Klara, her father, Alois, called her "uncle" because Alois was acquitted and raised by her grandfather, and when she grew up as her son, she was really nephew. He was much older than Alois Clara, so Alois was the habit of calling him "uncle." Hitler fights his fellow soldiers and decides that his dog is just a shame and reveals the intelligence of all audiences. Hitler finds that she passes behind the dog through the trench, when she catches her with poverty, she throws it out so she does not destroy her. Seeing and listening to his soldiers as far as they are, the cowardly man jokes and punishes them, but his followers hide directly from the crust, and the last one, as we are saying, dies. How, if Hitler was the only person to survive the scene, was this story of brutality and cowardice? Hitler himself was "proud"? - I do not think so. Hitler then attacks Hitler's intimidates and bullies with the poor, stressed and transported Jewish officer. I can not suppose that this Jewish officer was thought to be a fierce fight against the hut, and thought he thought of some of his stores, though I am convinced that the iron crosses were not distributed in this comic fake. <br /> <br /> All grotesque clues are here, a relaxing and hypnotic influence on Wagner's music man. If only producers were keeping Ian Kershaw. Then, they might find that "happy widow" of Franz Lehar floats the boat that floated over Richard Wagner's cannon "South African Holocaust"! <br /> <br /> Maybe Hitler died. 60 million people, but what kind of pardon would you ask for the great taste of music? <br /> <br /> I followed, but then I would be there. <br /> <br /> Give it a miss.
