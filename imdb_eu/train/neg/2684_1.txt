I found a movie for Americans who lost a tower to the United States. As a tribute to the awful event that occurred in recent years, each director can argue with old events (which have nothing to do with terrorist attacks), or criticize America's political behavior or compare a different political situation. This does not do anything or share it with September 11th atrocities, because it's embarrassing.
