When listening to this very funny movie, I eventually rented it <br /> <br /> at the video store and I laughed about 75 minutes three times. <br /> <br /> The movie is a collection of subjects that laugh at television <br /> <br /> Incoherent mess. Jokes are stung, in terms of humor <br /> <br /> They are just about the 70s, and <br /> <br /> jokes go on (almost like the new one) SNL in recent years <br /> <br />. Yes, this is Chevy Chase, but maybe a minute or so. I really liked <br /> <br /> it was very hard and there was not much nudity, but was not it fun? <br /> <br /> Please, benefit and rent a very distant movie from Kentucky Fried Movie.
