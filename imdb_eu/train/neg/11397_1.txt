This was awful! It had a great story, it was not bad and it was as good as an amateur version of evil, but it's not nearly as good. <br /> <br /> It's a good job to do all my misfortune. There was no need to visit the toilet, I would doubt if I would come back. This is Hammer House of Horror, a big-screen Hollywood theater. <br /> <br /> The only value for this movie was the endless offer of beautiful women. Not bad among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to leave beer with your friends for a night, this is just for you ... otherwise, it's like a pestilence!
