At the sixth level, I decided that all teachers would be a very good idea to do this film for a full semester. Every class did something that was a great show. We saw it in English and we had the characters we wrote in magazines. We talked about mathematics drawings and other marine issues. We talked about whales in science (it was really interesting, so it was not time to lose 100%). All day they were tortured. Not only that, but they will take us twice a day to the horror scene in the exam room. I could see that it was a new series or something, but, for example, '93. I'm still trying to block that.
