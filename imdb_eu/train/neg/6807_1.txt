Spoilers Maybe some details, but nothing is linked to excess. He should not care about this movie. <br /> <br /> Air Rage reveals the air infiltration premise in the midst of the executive decision. Ice T-T takes a team of four "elite" men, who wear heavy black shirts, we can imagine that they only need to hide their stunning armored bodies, their tactics stupidity (when playing Star Wars playground level 3). shoot hail <br /> <br /> The color that I most liked seemed to be the use of similar actors. Cyril O'Reily will instantly discover someone who has played a movie that you really like, even though you've probably never been able to put it in for a long time (it was Porky). Here Cyril is a great hit by a character by Bill Paxton. The most horny is Gil Gerard, so noisy and you never know as a TV buck Rogers. Instead of reminding us of the loyal heroic nature of that time, Gerard was a tough and hard character that John clearly represented to John Goodman. In the end, Alex Cord gives us a nice hybrid look like the kind of Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas. In New Jack City's ten years, Ice-T's performance has worsened dramatically. It's not about acting on the lines, because it really learned about it. <br /> <br /> One of the elements that play this movie is information CD-ROM. It is hand-made, and apparently and incredibly encrypted, despite Gerard's NSA's security of nature. What a joke I would like to mount the information that is on the CD in a never-ending format. <br /> <br /> In spots of unlimited aircrafts, shooters are as loud as cannabis, and may cause a person, so there seems to be no budget. The chosen weapon is quite fun. For the use of a cafe, the flight attendant is a realistic representation of the film violence. When it comes to intuition, the mini-gun gun must be one of the worst gun designs. A real elite team would bring MP-5 to one of this sort of thing or maybe SOCOMM .45, or even customized Hi-Powers as an old school or perhaps the school would be FN 5.7 ... 92 standard motto. It's totally incredible, because the deadly weapon is most lost. Bad, supposed type of fortune's soldiers experiences a nonsense blend, unlike the mini-Uzi gun and the Tec-9. Functional barrel charger no silk. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers would like to touch realism. The aircraft carrier and Ice-T ceded up to 10,000 meters before opening art. Also, the flight attendant NOT seemed to be able to close the door, basically just surrendered. To the ground, it's not worth mentioning the flaps 2 minutes before touching it. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Duke of Hazard's "At Risk" told Duke of Hazard about Roscoe P. Coltrane to shy away from this footage. Obviously, SR-71 (retired) was an incredible choice because they could not get the F-117 stock. In addition to being mothballed in 2001, we forgot that for a moment the SR-71 B-2 is not a purely silent airliner, and that's in a vacant range ... Well, I'm not an expert, but I doubt whether Radar is invisible. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, the F-16s show "F-15s" repetitions were unreasonable. Details of the 747 were stupid. The airline will not have enough passengers in the 747, without mentioning all the original stupidity. Be careful with the use of wiring electrical. <br /> <br /> Wow. A show Catch the Stars or something. Do not pay to pay, but see to laugh. No bad talk, No Holds Barred, at least with little originality, in favor of the worst movie.
