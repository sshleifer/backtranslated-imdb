Spoiler warning. <br /> <br /> When the main character's sister slips down the stairs, the murderer breaks a glass of vodka next to it, it seems to be drinking. To kill him, he tells his sister-in-law partner (Teri Garr) before taking his baby drink for 4 days. However, the police never mention the results of toxicological reports! And as the characters said he was drinking, he fell down the stairs. Eh? A very bad mistake in this movie, it's very horrible in general. <br /> <br /> It's amazing, considering the bad cast. Some mistakes: the writing is not very good because there is no tension in the bad music scene, because we know the first scene of the movie, the mystery response.
