Today's A.S.L. We had to be forced to see the students and the movie, and from that moment on I was leaving the movie untidy. The movie, of course, for P.V. There is no "common feeling of deafness" in the middle of them. Also, do not mention the movie or take into account other situations that are debated in this issue. For example, hearing was born after the hearing. Right or wrong in that case? The movie is favorable and almost everything is called "D". It's not that bad, but having a true documentary does not have to have any control.
