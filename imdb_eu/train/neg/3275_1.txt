DO NOT USE MANAGER TO TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER AND BEN JONES HAVE NOT KINDS. SHOULD MEET YOUR BREAKFAST! First and foremost, this movie starts with Bo and Luke with Jesse's moon. Bo and Luke would never have been like this in the real series! This film imagines the imaginable characters that make things that never happened in the series. The Uncle honest Jesse and law. In this film, the jury and the crime of smoking is the Governor of Georgia. Also, if you add the extensions of Dukes in Hazzard Reunion! and the Hollywood Dukes of Hazzard, I have a question: HOW DO YOU GET JESSE MOONSHINE USING THE DUCK DREAMS IN Hollywood AT THE MONTHS FIFTEEN? AND HOW BOSS HOGG LIVES RESERVE, NEW RESIDENCES ON LIVING LIFE IN 1997! CINEMA AND ROSCO-RAN HAZZARD? MAGIC, CHARACTERISTICALLY LIKE TO LIVE, CHANGED FROM 11 AND 8 YEARS OF MONTHS? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, as in 1997 and 2000, James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach had to make a nice family movie with original live characters. what is the show and still still displeased with this insolent movie! If you want to watch good Dukes movies, buy the original series, or go to the walmart.com website and buy Reunion 2 and Dazzes of Hazzard Hollywood 2 DVD sets. Both are the main characters of the original work and they are family members! Do not miss this time in a movie that's worth a CD!
