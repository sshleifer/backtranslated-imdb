It's not easy to name a lot of pollution in the history of cinematography because the candidates are so numerous, but Nemesis 2 has been my favorite since I saw it. It was so fun that we needed to rent again the next day, and I laughed again, indeed, I was literally on the ground. (Usually it only happens when I see "Antarctic Scott" in Monty Python.) <br /> <br /> Throughout the whole movie, the feeling of what-heck is complete to the viewer. I am totally confused, that clumsy home video has come to the time of production. It is supposed to be a driving force, but it has no apparent connection with the first movie. The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" is a woman, although she is going to take us halfway through the film to stop guessing, with all the muscles and what the barbarian nomad! <br /> <br /> There's no plow, there's just a long back-up scene, it's so slow and stupid, it's really interesting to call what's called scene of bullying. There is hardly any conversation, given its quality, and then the movie suddenly breaks up after a brutally violent action scene, which was never explained. Fortunately, never be bored, always there is something absurd and false! <br /> <br /> The horrible movie is usually boring, but Nemesis 2 is a very serious and imperative. it's really entertaining. Rent this movie, or buy it, do not be disappointed!
