On the surface, Omen 4 was a good idea. It's nice to see the devil see that the child could be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as Exorcists, when girls are aware or when they are very effective in the devil. But on Omen 4, stunk. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Delia is not thinking about being a devil, but rather it is a child with a problem. Therapist only, maybe a subject that can only help a priest. It does not look awful or awful. It looks rather dull. <br /> <br /> This film was a potential and could do the same person who made the previous three films. But it's really insane to make a sequel to one of the favorite horror trilogues for special TV shows. <br /> <br /> It abandons several levels. Looking hard, the performance is hammish and the consequences of a television drama. The characters do not give any sympathy and you do not ride. Recently I saw again when someone brought me to Christmas, and it was horrible. <br /> <br /> If you think of seeing this, I would not suggest it. Check another one, or watch Exorcist, or watch The Good Son. Just do not waste your time!
