The inventor of Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is preparing his Smithsonian Institution with a troublesome dissipative machine / diffusion machine, he and his wife Diane (Eve Gordon) will prepare a long weekend for Adam's son (Bug Hall). Wayne's brother Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett), and his children Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) volunteer to care for Adam while his parents are away, but could be luck (and Titles he would have waited for it), the adults unexpectedly zapped the Wayne rays. While the kids flee, their miniaturized people are huge insects, carpets trace their guts, and they need other threats. It was bad, just like most live streaming movies, Honey, Shrunk Ourselves was an amazing madness. I had to laugh at the movie "Roach". Stuart Pankin and the chief of the party were even more fun at the danger!
