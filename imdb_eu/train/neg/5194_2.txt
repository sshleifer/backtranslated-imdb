I'm not mistaken, I want to see marijuana as calm as the next guy. I will do it now. The writing, however, was not realistic. The PTA's children did drugs, but they dropped the drug into the hands of the drug addicts. Give me a break. Mary Louise Parkers was an insult to my mind full of beautiful character. The characters were not liked. In essence, the plot lines were not anywhere. I understand its only TV ground. The hypocrisy was shameless. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mother and I think that's what ... WHY ???? I have only the feeling that I was preaching through a sensitivity show. His wife's trap is like saying good, but with an age-old situation. I do not agree with the same thing, but I think people get my opinion. Keeping children's stuff is great for walking campaigns, I think, but it does not water like a waterfront sitcom on a coastal mother, like a local pot separator.
