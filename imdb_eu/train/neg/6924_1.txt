If this movie were worse, Uwe Bolle would direct it. This nonsensical mess is like Ed Wood Hitchcock. It has been a long time since I saw this pepper perfume, but I remember that all the people involved may suffer serious harm. How to make a star on this movie, I'm surprised to see everyone who has seen this gut. I give a star because there is no lower grade. All copies of this movie are burned with salt and stored as toxic waste. No, a copy must be kept under ultraviolet security and will only be shown to filmmakers as an example.
