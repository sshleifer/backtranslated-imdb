I once again wrote the review of this movie, when I bought it on DVD and I felt very inadequate. <br /> <br /> After trying to read some comments from then on I tried to see them again. Being a filmmaker and making myself similar budget films (ie, a budget, shot with a digger camera) I make my own comments. The budget is not a student project (and not a good one), posted on video / dvd, to look like an award-winning movie (if you read the cover). So, people disagree about thinking it's not something. I want to return my money under the act of describing trades! Full garbage
