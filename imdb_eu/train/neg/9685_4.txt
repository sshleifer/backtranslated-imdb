You do not know yours, but I've always felt the 'ART' with the attraction of cinema. The first art film was made by Peter Greenaway "The Cook, Thief, His Wife and Her Lover" ("The Cook"), which is, in my mind and overcome the creative cover. The film was the latest paradox, beautiful and grotesque ... this is about "cinema of art", analyzing intellectual ideas and moving the purpose of the screen onto the screen. Life, real life, can be like living in the home, and what the art shows is what it is. I love films of all kinds, but especially those who entertain and say something, especially if I agree with the good attitude ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 WOMEN" is a "classic comedy" where dad and They collect a son harnessing their sexual fantasy. There is only a very brief mention for Fellinir in the film, unlike the ones suggested by the preview. The main focus of the film is the close relationship between father and son after the death of his mother. The initial scene of the movie is the pain of my father is incredible, you can feel pain. Later on, Greenaway rules, harem gathering, love and death, and meat that reveals the flesh ... This is an argument, but I feel it is superfluous and superfluous. And the idea that this comedy can be is brilliant to me. Mostly good-looking, especially when Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (although Mandy's poor clothes need to be worn) is a story that is missing out on the film, and Greenaway's excessive hints. See other wonderful movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Receive receipt. <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I can not recommend this film as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
