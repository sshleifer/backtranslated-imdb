Also, the boat deceived me. Also, I fell into the penetrating ships and DVD covers as "copies of unhappy fans as a copy of the shelves". Although it was cheap ($ 6.99), it was not really worth it - it was not afraid and very limited. The endless thing was very cursed and it did not need drilling. I really do not even know how it turned out to be "bad video". The story is dragged, the characters are clear agent agents ... it's not mandatory. The DVD bonus feature ("conversation") is very rare, the director seems to be very inconsistent and not all, as the main actor speaks of Shakespeare's production. da.
