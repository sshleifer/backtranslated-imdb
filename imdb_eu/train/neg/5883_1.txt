This movie has no sense of humor for anyone who has lived with a family member with a mental illness. So many scenes have reminded me graphically of the experiences of my life. This film was the "Mommy Dearest" version. It depicts graphically and accurately the life of children of many parents of mental health. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to be corrupt and act like God. <br /> <br /> Someone told me that it was fun. In no case! Humor is better <br /> <br /> The movie is so intense and disappointing that my son and I had to leave the room. The best use of cinematography is for people who do not understand mental illness or who do not really know who they are.
