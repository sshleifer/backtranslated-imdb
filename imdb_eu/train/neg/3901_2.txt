The script is nice. Casting is completely non-watchable. Not style Costumes are not the appearance of High Highbury society. With Gwyneth Paltrow compared to Kate Beckinsale, I can say that Mrs. Beckinsale speaks better than Mrs. Paltrow in English, even though Mrs. Paltrow's representation is the same as Emma Woodhouse. No doubt Mr. Northam is Mr. Knightley of all versions, it is romantic and does not fear and resembles Mr. Knightley in the television version. P.S. The viewer can not see Mr. Elton-Ms. As the development of Smith's relationship evolved as a motion-maker, it could not be understood where Emma was trying to make a match with Elton-Smith (as well as portraiture).
