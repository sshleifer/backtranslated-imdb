Amazing! <br /> <br /> In 1965, I saw the Jury surviving in Gagarin. It was honest, non-understandable and kind, it was pleasant and educated and intellectual. I saw a clown in this movie! The actress dummy looks gestures gestures and imitates. They made a drawing! Another real Gagarin! Do not believe in this movie! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie after films like "Fire of Taming" and "Apollo 13", and after reading Chertok and "Rockets and People", "Korolev: Myths and Events" Golovanov. Awesome scenes, performance and poor production, and a lot of accuracy in "Space Race". <br /> <br /> The film is a theft of Russian historical events. It's not a lot of interesting knowledge about space projects. Some facts and details were perverted. For example, in 1945 Korolev did not have a prisoner (he was released in 1944), and in 1940 there was no gold mine in Kolyma in prison, but in a special prison design office. He was a designer at the Korolev prison design office and was not buried in prison. But the film was made by Korolev until 1940 (the prisoners had uniform shoulder warfare). IMHO, film makers do not have deep knowledge about history and can not make interesting films.
