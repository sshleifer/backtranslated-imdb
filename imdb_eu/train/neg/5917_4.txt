This movie is the result of the evil people of modern society. So, robbers, rapists and killers (the murderers of this movie, Carl Panzram (James Woods), are three or worse) will be responsible for their actions? An interesting idea, but it is very difficult to bring it on the screen in an intellectual and emotionally satisfying way. And here's a very short Killer: Journal of Murder. Although the film is trying to make Panzram's behavior a point of view, despite its violent youngsters and trying to put into operation flashbacks for education, the viewer has never thought of panzram as the culprit. I am convinced that the system is corrupted, with a mafibian occupying the Leavenworth Prison ill patient (where most of the films take place), most prison guards are sadic bullies and the prison director is something like a despotic megalomaniac. But why underground caregiver Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard) has taken pity on Panzram? Even after reading the terrifying newspapers? The movie offers some explanations: Small witnesses Panzram strikes a haunting (stereotypical) sting on the guards and Panzram's mind is amazed (although clearly why Little Men think this is so intelligent). Certainly, this is not enough to be sympathetic to an enemy like Panzram, even if this movie makes its crimes worse and its identity stands out? On the other hand, Panzram is very faithful, and the viewer is impressed by the fact that Lesser surpasses all the atrocity read by Panzram's newspaper. Does this little man put any lesser number on everyone who seems to be less friendly? Perhaps the minority is the product of modern society, judging by substance rather than appearance. <br /> <br /> I'm able to advise the protagonist of Monster, Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, as a movie that handles roughly the same issues. More integrity and scope. <br /> <br /> BTW: Looks like a murderer for a television (not so good).
