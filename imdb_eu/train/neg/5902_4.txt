I expected the cinema to be completely dumb. With little experience, any entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the film, but it was a nonsense that followed the single singles guardian. <br /> <br /> This one said The Singles Ward was very annoying about everything. The whole movie was badly dubbed and watched their mouths while they were listening to their voices. This lack of professionalism has exceeded the mormon cameras that do not have business games. <br /> <br /> This film will do well in Mormondom, especially in individual university communities. However, the conclusion will not be a hope for poor losers who are losing their unmarried. (Only the pretty girls of Singles Ward will marry, they do not make fat, ugly, but they make all ugly men). In the end, we realized that the entire movie was an advertisement on LDSSingles.com.
