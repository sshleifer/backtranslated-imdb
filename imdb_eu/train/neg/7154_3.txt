This movie provides dependence on cooking. Based on Shielah Graham's autobiography, it seems that the powers are not well left. They could not decide whether Graham's story or Fitzgerald story would be, and also how much more the story he wanted to be a soft-pedal. So a movie that could be a wonderful story about two wonderful films (Fitzgerald) and celebrities (No. Graham) is a sad drama that tells us about what we know little about. In addition, it has not felt any time since 1959. The evil scene continues with a horrible scene and we do not know where the story is or how long is it. However - and that saved me the movie - Ker never seen the most beautiful look, and Peck is always a beautiful man. They really make a pretty and handsome couple and I want to be a better job. It's a scene that makes a job: Scott Shielah is still in a state of drunkenness and usually seeing these two refined stars is very disturbing and gives us an elusive idea of ​​what happens in their relationship. In addition, the movie is an unnecessary choice and is obtained from classical eras of Wald Walden's soaps from 1950s (PEYTON PLACE, FOR BEST).
