I feel like those who take part in "Christmas Eve" do not think about the movie. The characters are not consistent and the plot is so sensible that he has acted as a sketchy screenplay of a single family's payment for a rich family when he was rich. /> <br /> Ben Affleck portrays Drew Latham, a wealthy and wealthy executive publisher in Hollywood, a typical image. Missy, her girlfriend, will leave before Christmas, because Drew did not like Drew to take Nigeria to Fiji, who called her "family vacations" and Drew has never been sent to her family. Then we learned that Drew's father was 4 years old and that his mother was dead, so it's a mystery why he does not say that he does not have a family, he believes that his girlfriend does not believe it. to look after his family. <br /> <br /> Just afraid of being alone in Christmas, Drew keeps track of Missy's decline (why I have no idea), who suggests pardoning a ritual in her childhood home. When she meets the family that lives in her childhood house, Valcos, Drew offers 250,000 dollars to be her family, so she can recover the toughest childhood memories. She gets angry when her daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) has an adult because she is "not her sister," and even because she gets to write her own family script as her "real" family. This is not a sensible when Drew demonstrated that he grew up with his mother's family. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Alicia's character, unbelievable, is incomprehensible, that her family has accepted Drew's money and does not deny playing. along with his fantasy. But for good reason, he suddenly likes Drew, and in a few minutes he hates audacity as much as his girlfriend. Drew is very wrong in the whole movie, as well as the story of Lonely Christmas on his childhood is not a sympa. I really want to finish: "It's a joke! Because they do not see my family, they're threatening everyone's real cause!" (2/10)
