Once again, classical cinema has been renewed in acoustic mode, resulting in predictions of ruin. Title is false about this movie. The time is not convinced of the performance, and it leads to too young and too bitter to be criminals. Arthur Penn's movie was inspired by style, humor, vision and talented characters. Although the 1967 version does not exist, however, it would not be a necessary movie. The 1967 version was far from the facts, it presented the glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was very exciting and innovative in 1967, and it was a great opportunity for you to watch over. This remake of 1992 seems to be better known than the true movie that is known and the rumors of the rumors of this version are unpleasant and not very interesting. Certainly, skip this and hope that the 2010 version will be better. Could it be worse?
