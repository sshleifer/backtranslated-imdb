THE LOST MISSILE behind the story is not a bad idea, but unfortunately it takes a little bit to bring the story to half, and excessive footage and special effects are wrong. /> <br /> The movie begins with a missile that sends to the Earth. As the Earth wants to strike, the Soviet people turn their fear off the ground. This is not necessarily good, however, because this apparently unmanned artisan has a steam path that destroys his path and the container is low above the planet's orbit. In other words, with each episode it does, it follows a variable of death: we can all kill one! So, this good American scientist (a very young and almost unknown Robert Loggia) is planning and planning to rescue us, and especially his immediate flight in New York! Unfortunately, they can not keep Ottawa (I've never been there, so I can not say this is a big loss), but thanks to the good American knowledge this can end up destroying it. destruction purchase! <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, it is not the bad idea of ​​the story and the original. However, ancient male clips in fighters and radar domains remain old and seem like padding. In general, the genre's extreme fans love a decent movie, but hardly inspired, they see it under your care.
