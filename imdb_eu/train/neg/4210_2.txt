Richard Tyler is a little boy who frightens everything. He did not like riding a bicycle or escalating at his tree house, because he knows what accidents might occur. So one day he is riding a bicycle and the rain is beginning to wait until the rain stops waiting for the library. There is a whole story. He lives in all types of workers and, in the end, he is no longer afraid. But the story is very compelling and good actors like Macaulay Culkin can not be better than the story itself.
