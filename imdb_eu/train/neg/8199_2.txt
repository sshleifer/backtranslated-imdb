I'm glad I did not spend money on the cinema to go to :-). The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss, etc. It's just a collection of other classic titles, which are simple and absurd scenarios. I can not really get the idea of ​​creating this film: it does not offer anything new in its story, it's also nonsense. Also, there is no need to see - FX apparently taken from the second-hand shop, you've seen all the other movies in general. It's definitely not invalid.
