I was not very impressed by this film. Originally called Sin Eater, everything was mentioned in the last part of the film. I'm not sure what to do in the rest of the film for 20 minutes. It was very slow and what Robocop (Peter Weller) was choosing from one of the main actors. It was a sad point. <br /> <br /> I can say everything in matters related to Catholic religion, but you do not expect exorcists or stigmas about this movie. It will probably take a few days and the word comes out.
