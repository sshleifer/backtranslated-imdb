If you missed reading the book before reading the movie, please do not give up this series. I bought this first copy of this year's book this year, and I've finished with almost 10 books. I can tell you a garbage that does not smell of dirty movies. "Left Behind: Films" While the story "Vagado atr√°s" (book) continues, the characters are not exactly close. <br /> <br /> Some examples: Rayford has never felt the feelings of Hattie (when he is reported as an extinction); Buck Williams blonde, a journalist, is not a TV reporter; Chloe is in Stanford, and a lot of the book's detail asks Rayford to "live"; Buck and Chloe did not meet much later, created by Hattie at the New York meeting; Irene and Raymie have never been "in the book", but Rayford's flashback thoughts; The roads are very disturbed, Rayford and Hattia take helicopters out to the suburbs, etc., etc. ... <br /> <br /> And this is the first movie; They release the third. Please, if you do not like movies, give yourself a chance to the book series.
