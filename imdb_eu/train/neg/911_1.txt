It's never been the worst Swedish filth. <br /> <br /> It is very shameful to make the wrong script become a movie and show it later in 2006 at cinemas. <br /> <br /> I have never seen so many visible protected products. in the same movie. It should not be obvious. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why so many well-known actors also thought that such a movie could be featured. I've had a respect for some of the best-known actors in this movie before seeing the movie, it's sure now. <br /> <br /> I have heard that it will be a continuation film and I can not understand how it is possible.
