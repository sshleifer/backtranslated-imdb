At first glance, this documentary / fiction / cartoon is very entertaining and is a stimulating thought. Of course, when something causes thought, then it can be studied. It is true that this movie combines metaphysics and painful effects. The connection between science and spirituality between "What Bleep ..." is not, in fact, the root of science. According to a study by the Transcendental Meditation mentioned in the film, a group of meditation may reduce crime in a specific area, Washington D.C. in this case Indeed, in 1993, the crime of HRA (Homicides, Rapes and Assaults) was 30% higher than the average crime rate in 1993 in 1993. It has not been diminished completely in the analysis of the homicide rate. In fact, all of the claims that link metaphysics and science can and can wreck. <br /> <br /> As a result of this information, this movie is a bad attempt to make people dull or joke. In any case, I suggest suggesting that you have not lost your time. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a long-term science-based science-based thinking, Mindwalk (1990) should be considered.
