(There are Spoilers) Miya, kari Wuhrer Homicidal nymphomaniac hooker takes life and car 18 virgin, though she is embarrassed to admit too, collage freshmen Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. At the end of the film Myia not only deflowers, but has given a poorly innocent and naive Trent lesson how to spot how dangerous a nut walks and keep it far away for him or her, to end it, becomes one. <br /> <br /> A truck stops resting around a chariot resting place, Miya Roy (Burt Young) picks up on the buggy rear seat for heavy, hot action. Roy is very drunk or stupid, not realizing that Miya's daughter is unknown! Leak through the force of the rage with Miya without it, Roy almost kills him to stop studying collage student Trent Colbert in the first year. One of these trucks goes through. <br /> <br /> When he sees his chance, Miiak goes into Trent's car and thinks that the two films are the strangest persecution of the cars they ever put in a movie. In the northeastern part of the United States, two slew cars have been killed and shoot-offs have begun by state-soldiers who will eventually be taken to Trent's parents' home, as kidnapped. There, there is another shot between the stupid Miya, with a whole SWAT team that strengthened local police and state soldiers. <br /> <br /> You expect a movie like "Hit and Run" to be deliberate or unwanted, but it's not. In fact, the film is very disturbing in everyone's way to Miya, as Roy relates to his perverted and attacking father. Trent drives across the Northeast Miya, swallows the boat into the motel room with whips and light candles. With a slow Miya, Mr. With Foster, he deceives his guns as part of a strange sex game. After fostering, Trent goes out of the room, in a room in his room that is cold, the $ 400.00 wallet still has no car. <br /> <br /> Thanks to its parents, the money to pay for the refund of Thanksgiving home calls for the money to return to Miyako's mobile phone at a local dinner. Like Trent, Trent let Trent loose himself, and later attends his father Roy on the highway, trying to start Trent and Miya on the highway. <br /> <br /> The Roy goes back to this empty locker room, who walks behind Miya, runs in a square heel, heels up the slopes, and knows what he gets with her. own shotgun Roy was so busy trying to get rid of his pants that he had forgotten the gun. <br /> <br /> Both despair and murder, as well as a race, the two despairing charges against them remain in an S & M / Tattoo boutique. Trent puts his ear and nose in it and is dressed. Leather and chains, myri, matches his dog's neck. That is why we can get acquainted with the correct and conservative Parents of Thanksgiving Dinner. <br /> <br /> With the shooting of local soldiers, after one of the injured wounded, the two refugees of the law will end Trent parents with Mr & Mrs. Colbet, David Keith and Elaine Martyn, the entire local police station, with a SWAT team, waiting there. <br /> <br /> The last movie was really worrying, the audience would be asking you to ask how accurate a movie was trying. Initially, you felt a great deal of sensitivity to Miyar, but at the bottom of the Death Valley it was evaporated as fast as a bowl tray. Although Roy was the strangest character, when the movie was over, Miyak completely obliterated.
