I understand that carrying a novel to the big screen is always a problem. That is the only positive thing that can be said about adaptation. <br /> <br /> Did you read "Wise?" The book is amazing. Flannery O'Connor wrote about South, no one. He was a South American, a Catholic divine and an elegant writer. Together with the first novel, he found a dark and disturbing story of faith, hesitation and salvation, with sensible humor and astonishing generosity. The book's characters seem embarrile to those who do not live in rural areas, but I can assure people that they exist. Not only exist as families, feelings and worries. Flannery's intentions were so often understood - it did not work on these wooden zealots behind. That's why he saw the fine operation of what was called "grace" ... even in violent, sorry and wonderful circumstances. Reading 'Wise Blood' will be a fear and a constant conviction. In the end, we are thinking of our opinions and budgets long and hard - the vision of our world. <br /> <br /> That's not the case with John Huston's 'Gilligan's Island' adaptation. None. Fartsa da. Bad farce The whole movie is overwhelmed by the malady that turns the stomach. The play is inadequate, southern accents are fake and insults. The filmmakers do not think thinking about southern religions. Mrs. O'Connor's intense prose is restricted to small visuals and amateur theater. Soundtrack ease of relaxation and 'Clockwork Orange' are a mix of electronic gazpacho electronics, as it is not a story or even MUGIA. They gave me free access to this film and I was almost there. Really horrible <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In the South, however, the beautiful places are full of wonderful individuals (like all other places on earth), and the inhabitants of the South and their attitudes in the film are cartoon characters that are offensive to borders. If you injure yourself (I'm not), then this movie crosses DEFINITELY. <br /> <br /> I do not like talking about an artist's work - I was not a man from John Huston, and I'm sure he was a true and honest filmmaker and respected his place in film history. My views are clear from reading O'Neill's reading (and love) flannery. So, I'm not saying from any other perspective. It works as an independent cinema that works in a single cinema. As far as Flannery O'Connor fans - and maybe I'll add nose-friendly, and open-ended individuals - this movie is a waste of time.
