An American young woman visits her Irish roots and protects herself from a druid witch. It seems interesting, but after an interesting start, I lost it and I wondered where I was going. Do you think the movies are truncated in two directions, are we watching the work of Irish women struggling against the problem of alcohol or seeing a live movie about a wicked witch who comes back from the past? The director can not decide. Both of them do not seem to stand, and in the end you're not got it. This could be done much better and the story was dragged to the finish line. This was very boring.
