Jeez, only in the 70s ... Antonio Margheriti presents the humble hybrid of western and kung fu film in search of treasure. The co-production of this co-production with Shaw Brothers and the only company in Italy are: storytelling, outdoor events and highly beloved T & A. Lee Van Cleef's former warriors, Yancey Hobbitt's skin-related infirmities (seriously, Julian Ugarte, the man who had made the darker productions of the European genre), gives the bitter moments he invited you. - immense dialogue, fun back sounds, and little-effected sound effects with a totally dangerous effect (especially, each jump by Lo Lieh). <br /> <br /> While this little event falls into the fare and square, it's great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen, and you can not deny the charisma of this couple. Do not expect too much, and you'll give it a lot. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. What's yours
