The problem of "The Killer Elite" is the time to seek and watch this movie, trying to get more experience than many of its principles, especially the director of Sam Peckinpah. <br /> <br /> Peckinpah's volatile was in a rainy weather with this movie. At least one biographer knew cocaine. Add it to his drink, and it is not surprising that things fall. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the concept behind the movie is good, and it's a good first ten minutes. Mike Locken (James Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) are private contractors that make many dirty jobs to the CIA. They move fast, live well, and seem to be the best friends. Then something happens breaking with their brotherhood. <br /> <br /> The opening scenes show us a building - why we are not saying exactly, this course according to the dark motivation of the film. But the implications make the boys wound up and do not really care - the antihero is much like that of a bunch of wild Peckinpah. The opening title tells us that it works at ComTeg, and then adds to the cheek language "... the CIA is a nonsense idea of ​​any type of organization that can use that organization". It's a pretty quick way to let the audience know everyone's bets. The traditional Peckinpah shelter has to be added, such as Burt Young, Gig Young and Peckinpah Bo Hopkins. the crazy person who can not make a shot on the day, and the scriptwriters, including the famous Sterling Silliphant, try to make something more of the story as an unforgettable platform. -Liners and chops-socky bad knockoffs. The social comment goes into a modest attempt to inject a dose of a liberal. "You're doing so dirty that job, you can not tell who those are bad," Locken tells him, if he needs it or not. He emphasized. <br /> <br /> Wrong Peckinpah is a wicked and slow way. We went into the 40-minute movie before collecting the first battle scene, a completely chaotic collection. We have not previously known a lot of people who are struggling at the airport in San Francisco, a dialogue office with them in the office of war. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, cast is left to be a fight inside a fleet of Victory Ships, so that the open ninjas can shoot Caan. It tightens any suspicions of true suspense. "Put me seven-five years old, I'll take him a little boy," Samurai climbed between two samurai warriors before a duel - from China, we all know the Ninja territory. (The battle takes place in San Francisco, but it's not surprising to get Mounties to break things down.) Among its masters, Arthur Hill is a gentleman, the organization has "Humpty-dumped". He refuses to renounce the resignation of Caan and his film recovery, at the moment of the film, although he and Amy Heflin, Vanen's daughter, have appeared as a nurse. Caan was one of the best actors of the 1970s, with Heflin, Duvall, Hopkins, and two youngsters making the "Killer Elite" true audiences. "You do not see" Killer Elite "thinking about it. You think about the movie that looks like it.
