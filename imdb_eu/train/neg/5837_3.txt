I can not say that this movie really liked me. It has some fun moments, but it does not seem capable of itself deciding whether a comedy or drama.it really works like either. Light tone to be a drama and there are few fun moments and very far away. There is not much sense between it. It seems like things happen without reason. And they are very convoluted. They feel they do things. If they had taken some time to explain things while they went, it could be a better movie. In the end I would say that the climate was against it, but it would mean that the rest of the films were actually building. Something, but that does not mean it just ends, which was not boring, I really said, but as I said, there's no point here. I'll be reluctant to let you die of winter and weak 3/10
