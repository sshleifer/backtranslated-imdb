It could be a great movie (because it was a bit premised), but it's never been over the cartoon. The performance was pure and I was so stiffly dressed in moments, I thought I would fall into the theater from the seat. I never mean never see ... This piece of Godawfull ... Danish cinema has been getting a lot more in recent years, but ... if this piece crosses the border, it is fearful that nobody ever wants to rent a Danish movie. This movie is the reason I wanted to register here. I really felt that people needed to walk away ... my feelings go to the people who go to the cinema to see it.
