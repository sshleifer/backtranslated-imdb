Unfortunately, the good introduction into the genre of the unfortunate genre has been introduced, as it really satisfies. Willem Dafoe is a superb detective of NYC, who has been reprimanded with the same technique of retrieval that has been retrieved several times before in some murders. Scott Speedman is a Dafoe partner and has a pretty good chemistry (at least a bit). Other characters will appear together with both. Clea Duval is a close friend of a victim and is an art dealer / guardian of Peter Stormare Dafoe ... it's a little bit hard, Stormar, of course, is never sad. The end of the movie is endless. Quickly check out Deborah Harry less than the neighboring Dafoe neighborhood.
