This film, for later school, is not bad, and that is the problem. Nothing happens. You feel like you're in a class. A man teaches a young bunch of youngsters to be good paintball players. As good players are training, we never see the traces that they do wrong. Suddenly they become good players by meditating. Likewise, there are too many characters and they do not develop the character. It takes too much time for the main character and his sister sexya and not enough for other kids. This could have been the "Bad News Bears" (original), because it was a girl in a boy's group, but there was no movie. He has no feeling and, after seeing that your bones leave sadness, the bag is not fun, does not see it, and it's nice ... there. Plain Boring. Something that you had to take before school at night. It's as sad as a long day and it's been a long and long day to see this movie.
