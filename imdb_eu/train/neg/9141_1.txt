Oh, what did Sam Mraovich think? What did anyone think of "this movie"? Mraovich already heads "Ben and Arthur": the director, the writer, the producer (as well as the USER producer!), The filmmaker, the headmaster, you did. And he sucks in more than one series of rumors (Mraovich). <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with this movie? Everything. The film has two gay fans, Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Mraovich- * groan *). Ben and Arthur want to marry everyone when they hate gay people. To make matters worse, Ben's "ex-wife" mad (they do not divorce), Tammy (Julie Belknap) was crazy, Ben left another man and asked Ben to return. gay, too!) and Arthur's Christians, hypocritical abuse, Tammy's brother, Victor, are identical, and Arthur will try to kill him straight away after killing his church. <br /> <br /> The film completely blocks a block (that is, Ben and Arthur Vermont go to marry and Alaska Airlines, Vermont palm trees, FedEx cargo is returned to the aircraft), they hope they are comfortable in a wooden bowl, plus many and much more) and startup holes (Victor slaughtered the "Final Plan" and changes the "Last Deed", while Arthur and the private detective drive the same car blah, blah, blah). "Actors" are very bad and they are in good shape at the top; The script is terribly terrifying (for example, "I have no sense? It makes no sense! It makes sense, who makes sense!") and I can not do much worse with the "movie" I do not write them all. <br /> <br /> However, "Ben and Arthur" is the most beloved and unbelievable thing that Sam Mraovich thinks that he has created something really fantastic (see his fake comments "Ben & Arthur" and he himself. comments are obvious.) Mraovich is narcissistic and his pride blinded him with seeing his name as something really awful. <br /> <br /> So, to conclude, the worst film you've forgotten is never saying that all the bad films will fall under this title, "Ben and Ben, Arthur", even if Paris Hilton's "The Dark Knight" looks like "Ben and Arthur "compared to the monstrance.
