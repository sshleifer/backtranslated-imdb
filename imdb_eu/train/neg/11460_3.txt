It's fun to have fun trying to show the very intelligent Orcas, and in the meantime (and they do not even know), the viewer makes a stupid movie ridiculous. Richard Harris plays Quint. Sorry, he is wrong, he plays Nolan Captain, the fisherman who catches the sharks, but tries to catch large catches. When a whale killer catches a woman (do not ask) her friend (do not ask) rampage (do not ask) and starts STALKING Captain Nolan (Do not ask). Soon, Captain Nolan realizes something in common (do not ask). It is very amazing to make movies here. However, I have to tell you that at the beginning (whistle sounds and a lot of other things), it is very funny and the final credits (with the greatest goddess song) are quite fun.
