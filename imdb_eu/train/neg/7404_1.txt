I was interested in this movie at the beginning, after reading the review that reminded us of this movie by the reviewer, Silent Hill. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of Silent Hill, and disappointed with the premiere of the movie, I thought I would give it to him. an option Note that Fearnet only lists this movie as "Dark Weight", not the full name. So when I saw the name "Mr. Lordi" in credit, I immediately thought of the group (some college friends like me), but I did not think it was important and I pushed forward the thrust of the thought. > <br /> The movie is strong. Although the "Little Creepy Girl" in DEATH, the use of audio isolation and good use began to publish the story. Tough atmosphere was built quickly, and the best indication was that it was an excellent movie. Since monsters are horror-starring stars, I can not wait to see that they were hidden in the halls of the hospital, they found that the main characters were trapped ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And then the first monsters showed up and very tired I was. When he appeared for the second time, Megadeth seemed to have come from the concert, and the dizziness was completely deviated. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere over the film stopped. In full, and the story was asking what was happening, but the fears did not exist. However, the end of hope would be worth everything. Unfortunately, that did not happen. When the movie was coming, I was very faithful, and immediately I revealed the bad thing in the second ... Lord singer? Really <br /> <br /> What is all this movie boiled down? A stack of hospital members of the Lordi team behind hospitals? Suddenly, the design of stupid monster was sensible. If you were in love, even members of Marilyn Manson or KISS. I'm sure I've seen what I've finished in some of Lordi's music videos several years ago. Did they go on to make the whole movie? <br /> <br /> However, when I knew what really happened, I only managed to do it. I do not "spoil you" for you, but I can safely say it's likely to see a plot before. It may be more than once. <br /> <br /> So, if you're not a lord, do not be afraid of that. It's not terrifying, it does not bring anything new to the table (even if it's borrowed from other horror films, especially Silent Hill). And, I can not stress enough, I am antagonist. Lordi. Talk about a Buzzkill. <br /> <br /> You will really feel better watching Slipknot music videos. In other words, it is not possible.
