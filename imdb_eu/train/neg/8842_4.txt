Undoubtedly, all the major reviews of the IMDb film have come up with this film "Parasomnia", which has only been revised and invented by a single film on the IMDb tour. I often suspect that good reviews are just as good as selling shorts on the IMDb, but it seems pretty clear in this case. <br /> <br /> That's not a huge parasomnia. but it is very well for being a potential movie. <br /> <br /> Positively, Patrick Kirpatrick is a great wicked man, who is a wonderful workman who projects threats and evil. I could easily see what Hannibal Lecter needs to play a really memorable evil. Beautiful images are in the sequences of dreams; In fact, the film decided to study this land, maybe it might be something better. Improper use of hypnosis is also a bad concept. <br /> <br /> Although the suspension of credibility is necessary to immerse yourself in any good story, it is a good idea to get that story. . If you feel bad about what you think is nonsense or strange, the story will be lost and that's what happens with me with this movie. Other reviewers have mentioned here and I do not want to enter the spoiler territory, but I will say that the final setup is especially playful and disappointing, as well as a variable mental age character. a few years of life <br /> <br /> In the end, there is a germ of a wonderful idea here in hypnoticism, but unfortunately, this film does nothing special.
