Note everywhere to all mad scientists: if you make your son a genetically mutated monster, you must give him a great name just like "Paul". I do not mind the horrific shark shark with a sharp dagger and the people in the water in the water and in the dry. Give a child a richer name, such as "Thor", "Rock" or "Tiburon". Although I dine, I will probably just sit down laughing, "Ha! Get this load! Paul Monster is shredded by me shreds !!!!!" The worst part of this movie is that this shark is called "Paul" in the whole movie. It's just like a horror movie that is worthy and terrifying. There is no other section open "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy". Scientists go through the entire film that runs through the whole island, and suddenly a little girl walks into the wild inside and just spills water to restore her itching in her foot. "Water came out and killed. SciFI Channel made the only thing that came true of this film, but it's a hottie, but that's a small silver cover, or in a misguided movie.
