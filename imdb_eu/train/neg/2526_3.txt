I do not agree with this supposed masterpiece of the new German Wave and I am much more than saying: <br /> 1) There are major mistakes in simple explanations, such as the basic communication of critical fields. Mary's abortion and secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers did her husband understand, in return for a substantial financial payment, to return his wife and not claim his wife until he died in Oswald? The original scripts asked her to commit herself to the suicide of Mary after she had read the text of Oswald, when she learned that her husband sold Oswald effectively. In the latest version, however, Maria pushes her wrist on her wrist only on her wrist. Then, Mary is confronted with the deceitfulness and moral compromise that causes herself to affect herself and live. <br /> <br /> 3) Fassbinder seeks to overcome people by force in politics. personal As opposed to what critics and "experts" say, I do not think it works. Dramatic aspects of the dramatic events of the movie are only included in the historical sound of the old soundtrack or the sound of the German reconstruction. <br /> <br /> The tough ambition that rises from Mary's poverty and prosperity is the parallelism between the wondrous economic miracle of the German War. Mary wants to be a woman that reflects her time and space, but they are truly non-original and accurate. Women have proclaimed their independence through their sex life. <br /> <br /> 4) In the end, there are no cases of void and amateurity. Fassbinder's dependence on drugs and, consequently, distress and inattention have affected. Unknown people are talking on the screen without ever seeing it; music is badly invasive in places; and act as a melodramatic attitude for occasional replacement. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, he does not even mention a movie that condemns a country for voluntary amnesia collective.
