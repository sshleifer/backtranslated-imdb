... but here's the key "usually". I know you worship EVERYONE filmmakers. B-rated movies in the world, this is Z-rated. Absolutely ridiculous. My account about most of my B-rated favorites is that they do not take themselves seriously. The authors of such films treat the film a bit, even though it is a tough topic. However, I think that the producers of this film were playing seriously, as they formed a 10-star classic, as they were the bad attempts of changing lines and mute cameras. However, in spite of all this, I HAVE GIVEN AID 10 out of 10 stars, just like I'm on the road like this. If you had a B-rated fan, I tried hard to find this.
