It is terrifying when you create a strange and fascinating story that is potentially interested in you, and it will gradually leave you a bit longer until you master the mystical head. . Unfortunately, that has happened to me at the end of the white rumor. <br /> <br /> It's not Michael Keaton's fault; It's been nice to see him again being a star of the new movie, maybe a bit wrinkled, but still giving a solid and honest performance. As a man who recently killed his wife, he obsesses his spiritual life for a lifetime (not a new idea), through the electrical fuzz that you see on his television screen. br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the spirit communicated through spirits is called EVP (Phoneme of Electronic Voice) and there are many people who really believe in it, so I will not make any comments. I think that, or them. Let me tell you I will stop interrupting credibility when buying fantastic movies like that, but I can not accept it, I do not know what will happen, where it was. When he left, when the credits were rolled. Actually, it's a lot static. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, movies like this seem to be totally astonished, but if a film does not work for me, I think it's the fault of the filmmaker. myself (I did not know if he was tired or when he was very tired). Well, BIG FOCUS was awake, I shined my eyes and sharpened my tail - so who guess who is to blame?
