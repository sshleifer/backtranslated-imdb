With James Spader one of my favorite actors, I hope this movie is at least a sustainable one. It was not. After half an hour, I saw the rest with the remote control of my hand, that he was ready to move forward. So absurd, so standard, we know what will happen in each scene. It's enough to announce the word of the word literally. This is a scratch head that makes a movie and said, one of them "how ever did this film?" To try to say something positive, I add some particularly entertaining effects. But, in general, if you have seen 5 science / film films, or if you have more than 9 years of age, do it aside and jump.
