what kind of thing is this? Power rangers vs Freddy? It was just as good as the original movie, but the protagonists became a baby from the parties that earn super-powers of their dreams. It should be rated by PG or PG-13, that is, I saw that it was quite mature, but it was only 1/3 of the movie. The rest are small children. Additionally, Christianity is too much in focus. I know Freddy is a devil, but there are many religions with different ways of fighting demons. Why should Christianity always be? Orientalism is full and has a white man / Western dominance. Do not see it, show little children who love guards.
