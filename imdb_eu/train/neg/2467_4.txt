This movie gets me 6/10 grade and 9/10 too. That's why: acting as a horror horror movie, as an act and dirt and fears, this movie will get bored. Above all, Lifetime is a family drama similar to what you see, but put it in a horror universe. The story and the ancient formula are hundreds of times restructured. If you are looking for originality of the plot structure or minimum conflicts, you will be disappointed. You will have to remove something from zombies and A Beautiful Mind as melodramatic. This is 6/10. <br /> <br /> However, the basic synopsis and the idea are quite original and above. Literally, you and your friends will joke, drink half drunken. . . But this joke got a breakthrough. Idea to me 9/10. The only perfect reason for them was that they could get away, but they did not. <br /> <br /> Two mixed mixes. I thought it was fun, but like every comedy, it was not so fun. I saw my mother and little sister with me, and we made jokes about them more than writing scripts more fun. There were great geniuses, but there were moments that were bored. <br /> <br /> I hope that other films take on this kind of risky and original ideas. I can not say it was perfect, or even closer, due to the lack of originality of the plot. <br /> <br /> A wonderful family movie. An excellent movie to watch boys (or girls). Excellent movie to watch with any movie. . . But if you only see it, it will be boring. Other people always make this type of movie fun and richer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
