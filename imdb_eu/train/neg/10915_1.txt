War films have to convey the fear of war, to avoid idealism and to respect some guilty military principles. Zvezda is almost not the first. As a Russian film of the Zvezda War, I was expecting patriotism, sensuality, beautiful poetic images, lush score, slavic cheekbones and German Christians. I did not need to have an affectionate love of love, realism of the war scenes and malicious soundtrack by avoiding any excessive historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, Holocaust). But nevertheless, our sensible history suggests "the liberating Poland". Film missed a chance, but not like propaganda.
