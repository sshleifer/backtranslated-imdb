This movie is a bad attempt to feel full of original fans. The only thing that people had forgotten was that the original was justified in assuming that he was supposed to be incomplete. <br /> <br /> I want to go to this movie with the toilets. I'm not a negative type guy, but the man in these films is not a comment. The land was a bad reflection of Carlito Brigante's life and I feel that my time has been wasted for two hours and money. I still love the original and I'm leaving this movie to stop my opinion.
