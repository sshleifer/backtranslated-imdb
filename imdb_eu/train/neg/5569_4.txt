I really tried this movie. When I see it, I think everything is: "this guy gives me the limit, I would give him the order". CODEPENDENCE also calls the letter frequently. Was it really before the movie? "Make a chronic two-person relationship with two depressed social societies that make their isolation more profound and their relationship with their worst life." As I have seen in life, the last thing in the earth that is likely to be a friend is a constant self-compassion. <br /> <br /> The mood of the movie is markedly 80-ish; enthusiastic and slow. Do not be misled, the film has its own moments, just a few of them.
