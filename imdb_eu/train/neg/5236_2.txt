I watched my friends and this movie a week ago and I have to tell the whole world (or at least those who read it at least) who have not only seen the five films that I have never seen in this movie. It has the honor of being the prime number. I've seen a lot of movies, but no one is stupid. I could say that I was watching ... my excuse only waited for a few hours and we could not go anywhere else without freezing our buttocks. I do not recommend anyone. At first I thought we were seeing a giant movie, but after 10 minutes we did not happen. It's not a comedy, it's not drama, it's not an action, it's not fear, it's horrible!
