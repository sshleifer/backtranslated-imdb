I really do not like this movie because it did not really bring the messages and ideas brought to you by L'Engle's novel. We read the novel in the English class and I really liked it, I can not say I'm afraid of the movie. There were inequalities between the novel and the correct version, and it was not Madeleine L'Engle! That's why I had a bad rating. Do not watch this movie if you're a fan of L'Engle's texts, you'll be very disappointed. However, if you're watching the movie with entertainment (or in my case educator), it's a wonderful movie!
