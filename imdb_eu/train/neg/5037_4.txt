Lursail = Melissa is a new girl in town. He is fifteen years old and will come for a year. Since Melissa is beautiful, she wants to be bound by all the boys in the town, but some of the people who catch her interest die mysteriously. <br /> <br /> This film wanted to see this movie because it was honest. On Friday, Dana Kimmel, placed in position 13, was not the right reason to go out and watch a movie. When I began to see it, I realized that "Sweet Sixteen" was not very slasher, it is very sad and boring and will not go anywhere. After more than an hour, only three murders have taken place and the story has not been developed properly. <br /> <br /> The film is very well shot with pretty good photography and good management, but with other slasher movies from the 80s, the movie sometimes has darkness. The operation is pretty good, although Melissa's character is sympathetically endearing, despite being a full slut. <br /> <br /> The story line is not completely rough, but it tries to be interesting. The only thing that was interesting to me was that Melissa was the most amazing and Dana Kimmel was really sweet and pretty. <br /> <br /> Anyway, wherever I would go, I'd be going to get a fairly plain slasher. Recommended for Slasher lovers.
