This is one of those films that you want to watch again, and then some, as time unexpectedly chosen, the time you reached the video store, etc. <br /> <br> /> First, look: it's a pinch, it's a small budget. Now, in itself, it is not a bad film. But the way it was shot tends to be an unnatural act and so pay close attention to it. <br /> <br /> Then the story. 3 people work on weekends. Of course, when EVERYONE goes to a campsite, they stop on the earrings. When they arrive at the place where they are left, Mr. Ranger will be thrown away, because the rocket is switched on in time and then drives where they are. (remote cab). Of course, 2 "pretty boys" walk around, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry are immediately damaged, but apparently Bambi eats it with both legs. Mady is desperate for this development because he forgets his previous weekends, remembering his face and stealing his friends. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot about it, by the way, the old hermit lives, it may not be a mess, and the area that hosts is "renowned". <br /> <br /> So, of course, sooner or later (unfortunately), some of the weekend's visitors start to die, and they find several boy traps (even though they're a bit smaller than a couple) and the rest of the boys understand it well. There is no food at reception for a mobile phone (who would miss out on a movie to watch their mobile phone?). Mr. Ranger continues in a curious series of magazines and looks like a strange joke, but he says he'll offer help. <br /> <br /> You will have a fantastic conversation that you do not want to miss. If you're still awake. Ask them to wake up in a blank screen. <br /> <br /> This is a great thing, the production values ​​are awful, and the whole commitment is not only and it seems incredible that I've also released it. Avoid all costs from 10 to 10
