According to the IMDb, Takashi Miik's "Horror Segment", the Imprint, was banned in the U.S. That's why I just wrote back to the Swedish version of the written version ... <br /> <br /> The director of Takashi Miike's manager Ichi The Director of the Killer did not have any hope of fearing Horror masters. series And the Imprint DVD book looks very much like writing. <br /> <br /> The story takes place mainly in the Japanese distant board, in the 19th century. In the century, and tells the story of some journalists. Komo, he left his wife behind and told whom to return. Tired and disapproved at the banner, this is the end of his long journey. It turns out that a prostitute, a calm and quiet girl, knows about Komomania, and has told him how reluctant this man is and what has happened to him. The story that he tells is nice, because it is difficult to swallow ... <br /> <br /> When it seemed to me about this episode, it was first and foremost that it was unnatural, and most of the parts of Japan spoke clearly. -Ingeles. But I'll leave that, it's not a big deal. What is great is, however, how miserable the rest was. Miike's story moves at a slow pace, because in 63 hours my watch can not be seen several times. The harsh scene in the middle of the movie felt so motivated and that this pornographic intrusive scene was also not interesting. For the sake of violence I felt violent, without style or disposition. The only scenes that triggered any type of emotion were the fertile images that flowed beneath the deep water that they listened to water, and the only emotions which, honestly, disturbed them were feelings of disgust. <br /> <br /> A journalist who brings in the love left behind plays Billy Drago, more memorable for me as Frank Nitti: Brian Capitanos (1987). I have always found a very frozen portrait of Dragos Nitti (and I mean it in a good way), which is why I am almost annoyed when it seemed so terrifying (NO, in a good way). His performance seems to show bad insects that are taking place in any sense or sense of impatience. When his comics had to react, Comma was sitting on the couch, twisting and rotating the horrible action of Drago. I appreciate the greatest part of the story, Yuoki Kudoh (a geisha souvenir of 2005), who is considered to be a deformed prostitute. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure it's supposed to be chocolate, though it might get bored and scary, but I found some sort of thing ... you know ... "blah" (and I saw the clock again, for the last time, but I'd like to end the final episode). Maybe it's been a little late, but I'm not the only part of Red Dwarf, and Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules, the only person who could not think of it, was stuck with his eyes. They look like foreigners ... Fortunately, if you decide to see this section and then see the Imprint, I will destroy your final images. <br /> <br /> My first thought, when the Last Note was over, was worth noticing, as well as listening to Edward Shearmur's headline theme (I think the same music is used in all sections of the series) and that ... great warning It's one, do not you think? <br /> <br /> Michiko Kitamura's costume design can be emphasized, and said, at least, that there is not something missing in style and function. There are so many films and TV series to show Japanese "geisha-fashion". This is not much less and I am disappointed. Takashi Miiki's horror episodes are boring, boring and amazing. In other words; Really, really bad!
