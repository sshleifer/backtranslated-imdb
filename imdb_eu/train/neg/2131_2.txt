I wanted to see the action with a satirical comedy tour (as this movie came out) but that failed me. For me, the plot was somewhat confusing and I soon lost interest. I feel like John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for participating in this movie. I will continue to be an enthusiast of all of them, but I feel that time alone with my feeling. The only thing to say about the movie is that Hillary played so well with Yonica's character, she did not know about Hillary; I realized that they had taken a few scenes. Fortunately, I rented $ 1 through Red Box; I wanted to see it on the big screen when I paid for it, I'd really like it!
