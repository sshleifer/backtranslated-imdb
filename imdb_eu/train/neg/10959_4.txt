I am a fan of the series and I have read all 7 books. I wanted to see this to see how it was done. I can not say that the only people who need to see this are those who read the series and they are curious. It's pretty bad and it will turn off reading. It does not mean, but Lucy is so ugly that she takes away the movie. Was the director's daughter? Seriously, I'm sure Beavers of the movies were jealous. The head had an embarrassing misfortune. The movie gets lost so much in translation. CS books are not translated by Tolkein LOTR, or even by Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> They did something right! Aslan! very well made. Even though the other cast-stroke-faced figures (castors and wolves) are stupid, Aslan is well-executed because he was not a human actor. (I think it's like his old horse? Within 2 people?) I would also be curious about what children think about this movie. Would they have enjoyed it? But for adults, they do not have a safe bet, even if they were a CS fan.
