As well as being a filmmaker, I thought that it was a delight for my home-made "My Wrongs ..." with a dark and subversive sense of humor (it does not give anything but a DVD cover, but rather an ambiguous one). Chris Morris, the controversial director, including "shorts". I really knew better, and I should avoid avoiding (and often offensive) part of a ribbon. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see the church scene (especially because we know Morris's confused attitude, which is very popular), his television series (Brass Eye) is a pedophile and does not want to be wasted. This is how the comedy was tagged. <br /> <br /> The runner's comments seem to be an innovative idea in principle (being a runner for me, often an interesting and uninhibited concept of the movie process), but unfortunately it is not here. Instead, They are directed to some students who are studying film-makers, but there's no great film in the film, there's no great film, this is very interesting, but it's not worth the mere film of the celluloid. <br /> <br /> This movie would never be said anywhere Approximately, on the ground, nature and dialogue, it is based on its higher style, leaving the spectator surprising and unsettled. Her simplified message - chalk Acai must take responsibility for its actions - it is obvious and obvious. <br /> <br /> The film has moments of pseudo-coffee in surrealism, but in the end it will not convince. It's irritating to entertain, clarify and just end up. If you want to see an excellent piece of short film, I recommend you "Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life" by Peter Capaldi.
