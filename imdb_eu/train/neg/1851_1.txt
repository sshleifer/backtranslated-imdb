"Friend," I will discuss Ron Atkins's work, clearly and without any tastes, according to this class. If he is an expression of his work, I have never wanted to see him from him. They are disgusting, self-cultural, badly harmful and stubborn. The title "frighten bitch" is an angry low-budget filmmaker who kills a series of murders. There is a small nudity and some constraints, but only one element should not hang that clay. The lighting is awful, the conversation is puerile and, above all, shouting, and the direction is clear. I saw a PhD in American filmmaker filmmakers at the last Fangoria agreement. Atkins was one of them. He talked about something important about his work, but after seeing this, I did not see any import. There are no styles too, and amateur video effects are only enhanced by powerful video effects (eg, solar energy destruction). Not so bad is it fun too. Avoid.
