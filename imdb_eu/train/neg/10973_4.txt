If you love "Pulp Fiction" and like handheld cameras, you love this movie. I liked the strange story (although the movie "Pulp Fiction" was the supreme movie of "The English Patient"), I thought the characters seemed realistic but interesting. It's not "On Waterfront" or "Citizen Kane", and European pretentousness loads. But the farthest away is a hand-held camera. It's so strange and annoying that I was waiting for you when I finished the movie. I do not know why they think this new filming method is very big. If you tend to be a disease of the movement, keep it away, the handheld camera will be wrong for about 10 minutes.
