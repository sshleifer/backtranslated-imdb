In the last year, Uwe Boll has shown a marginal improvement as a filmmaker, the power in the "King's name" ("Lord of the Rings" clone) and proudly vulgar, posted on Sat 9/11 "Postcard." But then he came to "Seed" and in counterattack Zero was restored, maintaining its offer to maintain legitimacy and far more respect. The guy is a fan and his film shows a horrible screwdriver and they are never sad. <br /> <br /> The first film created as a result of frustration is "Seed". a wicked erroneous attempt at social commentary, and an iconic jab that creates a mythical slasher (Boll often seems to be taking a successful restart of Rob Zombie's "Halloween" Antagonist Maxwell Seed (Will Sanderson), 666 He has killed people and is sitting on the queue of death. After frying the beast without success, he climbs up the tomb to seek revenge to avenge him ... And so he begins a totally free chain. <br /> <br /> Creates a new line of the Millennium Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees are trying to quit, and Max Seed does not describe it and it is boring to leave the impression, and finally, it looks like a wrestler who is bored by "The Toolbox Murders." Seeden's character and Boll's message "they are against each other: the death penalty is wrong, surely, but are we supposed to sympathize with a boring killer who has been hundreds of corpses? I did not. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Michael Pare plays James Sadar's "Dexter" character as a noisy and unpopular brother: he has a policeman sitting at his desk, crossing diaries and decomposing animals and Watching the scene without a stop to people trapped in Seed's reef. With Seed's hiding place, with a cardboard bundle, the sequence is so painted that it is not conceived (there is hardly any illumination) and it is almost annoying (a healthy dose of jelly) to sleep. <br /> <br /> The short film does not limit this sequence alone: ​​it seems that the "Seed" filmed by a drunken filmwriter, with a sharp and dumb camera, is more of a technique. stomach-turning like gore; The very short duration of what happens is that they only pay attention to the narrative, the almost non-existent meander. About 90 minutes, this movie is considered as a torture that Bollen intends to do. <br /> <br /> The mere genius ... I think this joke is for me.
