I was not particularly impressed by the fact that a short film with music lasts 40 minutes. Thank God, I was asleep. I use the timing photos very well to show the passage of time in the light and shadow movement, people, water, clouds, etc. Unfortunately, that's all. <br /> <br /> My predecessor is the predecessor, who proved the excellent Koyaanisqatsi in 87 minutes in 1983 and proves that a sequel is a better one, Powaqqatsi made 90 minutes in 1988. <br /> <br /> Test both.
