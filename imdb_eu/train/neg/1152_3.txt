I understand what the movie tried to portray. Unlike the elderly, they are treated as unlucky, which means they are not allowed to feel and just like their own lives. <br /> <br /> I have not had any problem with this message, but I feel that seeing it could be immersed in a way that could be so painful. I enjoy a good art film, but when the film is very conscious (as in this case) the result is often frustrating. Placing a suitcase with a suitcase slowly up to 5 minutes and try to avoid dashing, but at last the audience is still annoying. pull together. This movie is a movie that you would like, and it certainly has its own merits, but I was too frustrated to recommend it to someone else. Roger Michell may have a deeper message than other movies (for example: 'Notting Hill'), but at least it was a movie that could be seen.
