I've seen Belle Epoque recently, I think it might be amazing because he won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language. I was immersed in the face of the foresight and simplicity of the film. Perhaps I had a conflict with the movie so far filmed until now, the argument of a beautiful woman-oriented man and, finally, the result of falling into the good girl. Apart from the preview of the plot, some scenes in the movie failed the story (for example, a specific wedding event). Sometimes, the film preached in these ideas and, in terms of Francoism, it was films and the Church. The film had only one thing, the landscape and Violeta being a strong and independent nature, women were not really related to them.
