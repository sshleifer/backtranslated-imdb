When I saw this movie in the theater of mystery sciences, it is called "Living at night". The title is much deceptive than "Batpeople". In fact, Batperson would say more accurately. This movie is about a doctor who learns about bats because I intend to do better to cure rage. This is not clear. It is clear that he and his wife turn around a cave and a bat mumbles. Scientists have to walk around to investigate bats. Would not he come in? After getting bitten, his wife will go on a honeymoon and start there. They never go to the doctor. The guy is in the hospital and kills a nurse. In the end, the guy kills 3-4 people and his wife is next to him and the supposed killers must be killed instead of the murderer.
