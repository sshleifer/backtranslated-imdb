If you really enjoyed the 2002 Resident Evil movie, you should see it instead of seeing it for 2 hours. I can not believe that no one comments that this movie is a cheap blow to RE. First of all, a "special" command is the only defense of an installation with AI and holography. And this rip-off "Hive" has some traps, but they inevitably kill a group member. There is also a chess reference in the RE dialog box. Although there are no zones, the nemesis of the "tower" film is a bio-creature, a very color-fog, which suggests necrotic fabric, with many superb cyborg components such as a super-mutant RE. So, the story dedicated to Mr. Richard Taylor to claim any credit for that story. <br /> <br /> They are not the same film, of course, but the writer thinks I think the idea of ​​Resident Evil. .
