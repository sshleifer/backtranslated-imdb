Film awesome. Without losing time. <br /> <br /> Rear music is so powerful that you can not understand speech. If you listen well, all that's talkable is not really understandable. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is bad, the edition is not there, the background score is a headache, the action is bad, the interviews are not understandable. Well, Kareena looked like a wrestler, now looks like a hungry fighter. You are in love but you can not get grace. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see the movie after three hours, but I would not like this film to be a pleasure too. <br /> <br /> Please, torture yourself, watch forward.
