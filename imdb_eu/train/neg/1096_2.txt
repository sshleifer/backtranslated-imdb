While some training scenes were realistic, many of them were depicted as ex-Nazi military instructors. Of course, the people on the screen were non-military types or they wrote a movie for that audience. <br /> <br /> I am a Viet Nam veteran, and some of the ways in which I had military instructors were still to be served in a military jail. <br /> <br /> And I really loved the "heroine" and her friends (two private) scene sitting at the captain's office, burning. cigarettes and talking to the captain and lie as his friends. This type of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation, as was the purpose of that scene. <br /> <br /> At last I asked: "What's the movie for?" He seemed to walk around the place except "I hate all authority". Thank you God received from the library and I did not pay to rent.
