Vampire cyborg governs the world and uses human blood as fuel. However, it will be a power shift thanks to the refusal of employers (Kris Kristofferson) and a woman warrior (Kathly Long) against Lance Henriksen and Gary. Daniels (this ridiculous movie that tells Zinegoria) From all the unanswered questions from this horrific movie, who is the idea that Kris Kristofferson would sing a country singer. . No, I was not mistaken when I realized that Kristofferson had an observer or something I thought, but not a cyborg. It's surprising that it was written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren should not have any wisdom. However, despite the bad casting, Kristofferson is a nice thing about the film. A woman is much more human than a Kathy Long expressive. (And Kristofferson plays a robot) despite mixing, Kristofferson gives a few interests. Lance Henriks's slumming and Gary Daniels wasted, but basically Knights fails. As you go back, you wonder who was thought that paper was a good idea. (This is a movie that Kristofferson is trying to break the robot in his backpack). Everything worse happens when it comes to what happens, and fortunately, I still have to do it, even if I have nightmares for probability for that event. <br /> * from 4. (bad)
