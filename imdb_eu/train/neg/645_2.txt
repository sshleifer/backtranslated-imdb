When I saw the preview of this movie, I could not see it. The plot seemed good and the setting was great. I mean, a slasher movie, a prom night, a great idea! And in the plot: A secondary school teacher turns into a sexual obsessive student, crazy, arrested, will escape in the afternoon three years! Tonight tonight, supposedly wonderful and memorable, becomes hell !! However, I saw it and I was very disappointed. The worst "horror movie" I've ever seen was not the only one, but I've never seen one of the worst movie ever! First of all, it was not scary. There was not a moment when I was sitting in that movie. Similarly, the scene of murders was so tender and sad. All Slasher made the victims cut their stomachs several times or cut their throats. Likewise, it was not absolutely clear (PG-13). The scene with the most blood is surely a black girl to kill killer. Cut his throat and break the pages hanging around them (they do not really cut off the throat). <br /> <br /> Then you will see that the killers will enter the movie. . It's not mysterious, terrifying or terrifying. It's just a killer. <br /> <br /> Likewise, he liked everything in the movie. An example is that in the end, the killer is the main character, and at the last moment, the police shot and killed. Likewise, every thing in this movie was foreseen. The victim, after seeing a knife, loses his life, conceals it, thinks he escapes, and then the murderer goes out and dies. <br /> <br /> In the end, the sequence of movies was very bad. The guy enters the hotel, few people die, their bodies are found, someone pulls the fire alarm and everyone comes out. The main character loses something in his room, finds the murderer, escapes and escapes. That's it! She and her boyfriend go to the house, slasher kills the guardians of the house and finds the girl and then loses the detectives. The sequence of films was so stupid and clich√©. <br /> <br /> If you thought it was a good preview to watch this movie, believe me, do not waste your time or money. It is not surprising that the movie was showing the smallest theater in the theater. My friends and I, together with these two girls sitting in the back, were only in the theater. He told me before saying something about that movie.
