I was excited about this latest 60s comedy, bringing my people closer to one of their favorites: Maggie Smith, a young Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov. That's why I decided to not work as a movie comedy or a movie soundtrack. Ustinov leaves out of jail for a long time in a large American corporation in London. Karl Malden and techno geek as the director of the Newhart drama, Ustinov passes himself as a computer expert and immediately plans the "perfect floor" of the movie. To do this, you must pass a proven security system that protects the corporate mainframe. And here's the problem. His perfect plan is that everyone in the movie is confident and stupid. Her handsome excuses her face, and this should be the only computer center that does not wipe the video camera. The second problem is congratulations (really fraud) in the first 30 minutes of the movie, robbing the extravagant image that stole a huge tension in many ways. Maggie Smithe unfortunately mislead as a weird neighbor / secretary next to Ustinoven who can not keep the job. I love Maggie Smith, but it seems too much together here, too much, called for more physical and physical comics. In addition, Ustinov and Smithe do not have chemistry together, perhaps it is an age difference, but later a romantic relationship, which is a true love, is still a bit dull. Ustinov wrote the script, and thought it very well at the time, but I did not know anything about it, it was terrible and the dreadful waste was made.
