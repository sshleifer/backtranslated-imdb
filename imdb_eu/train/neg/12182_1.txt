Well where did you start? I think I'm insulting with original Aileen Quimnn to Annie. I loved the movie Annie, and I expected this wonderful movie, but I was so disappointed! The play is awesome, since I was born a few years ago from the original Annie, I'm 25 years old and Annie is still my favorite. , Some characters originally? very wrong to write, correct and act. This is not a movie I want to see again, and I recommend that you never see any movie, Annie Lover, because you will be very disappointed. Young girls are not singing bad, but they are not yet compared to the original
