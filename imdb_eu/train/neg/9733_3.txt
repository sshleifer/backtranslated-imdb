It seems more than bad TV than a bad movie. How disappointed is Hooper and Dourif! <br /> <br /> Government contractors carry out a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb. The boy born from a pair of experiments repeatedly fever feels 100 degrees, and when he's an adult, people of his life begin to smoke for themselves. Why do you know it? <br /> <br /> The people who are totally ignoble do well, but when they work in a different way, they change the way they look. When fire fires are drawn in the arms of the characters, it's a stupid look, it's more worrying than it is. It is ridiculous, too, that the fireman traveling through the telephone lines and the headset of a receiver falls into giant shots. How is this exactly? <br /> <br /> Another thing that seems to me nonsensical about the movie is the visibility of a person's own parents. Later on, in home movies we see the exact shots of these visions.
