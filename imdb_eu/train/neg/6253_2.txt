It's not a very good movie, but the information is quite accurate to represent torture techniques. The aim of the film was to demonstrate the brutality of NK POW camps, which was carried out effectively enough, with the amazing nature of that era. If you see this (and there are many) technical difficulties, you will see the forgotten corner of the forgotten country and you will see strange things - it's once again bad for DMZ in the north and not in Guantanamo Bay. </ B> <br /> <br /> I do not believe that Korean veterans have been tortured by any torture, and watching movies like this and Pork Chop Hill, Vietnam films. I do not know '54. People trapped in concepts of World War II (much like boys) or in warfare or whatever, but it's interesting to see it 16 years later. Films like "Go Tell The Spartans".
