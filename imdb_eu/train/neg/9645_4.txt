It's a bad season in Bollywood with lots of remarks, about being in the box office. London Dreams is no exception. Let's play ... Your dreams follow and how far you get to get it. Is it exciting for you? Unfortunately, the movie does not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to do it one day. His dream is to perform at the Wembley Stadium in front of a reputed 90,000 spectator. Two brothers, Zoheb & Wasim (Aditya Roy and Ranvijay debut), and join a giant Priya (Asin). Together they make up the "London Dreams" dream. After impressing the head of a recorder, they become night-time sensations. Arjun is hidden in love with Priy until her goal is not achieved. Then, Arjun brings his boyhood friend Manjit Khosla Mannu (Salman Khan), a quiet man with no intuition, to bring his flag together. Mannu is a talented musician and is a true talent and later on, he remembers Arjun Maniev's superior skills and his relationship with Priy. Arjun, with the help of Zoheb, intends to blow Mannu. Then the rest of the film is filmed. <br /> <br /> As regards the technical aspects, we only feel the shadow that Vipul Amritlal Sharen Named in London. He just felt the script. A glorified camera to cut a shorter one. Suresh Nair's script strokes her thoughts. As defined in the predicted mode, the scripts were rumored. The camera's work is amazing in capturing the beauty of London. While the songs are watching you are the only entertainer. <br /> <br /> A few songs are dumb, while others are noisy. The stinging of the Ajay show was in its negative nature. Salman is monotonous and puzzled. Asin is an unforgettable one and I will not do much in Bollywood. Aditya Roy is very impressive Ranvijay is well. It's a bitch as we've seen in many movies. The process continues with Ompuri. I do not want to make mistakes, as the work will be in herculean. <br /> <br /> Finally let me be correct and correct, London Dreams is no movie.
