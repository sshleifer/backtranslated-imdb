Elvis has left the building and he's lucky, because there is no odorless smell. Scene director Joel Zwick finds the scene finding an unfunny book to find even less fun. Dead characters, senseless gay characters and jokes, this movie is more fun. Kim Basinger is a movie that creates a hope that turns Doris Day into retirement. Let's remember his own way (talent), and not what it is. David Leisure, Dennis Richards and the rest are talents worthless here. Zwick finds a way to minimize their talents alternately. The boy playing Elvis resembles the sounds like Gomer King. Basinger is a very young girl who basically plays baseball playing baseball in the pre-season. He really looks and is really good. The only reason to see this movie is to look for the Tom Hanks kameo. The camera is not fun, but at least it's not painful. We must ask Zwick that Hanks's images are credible or something that makes this movie.
