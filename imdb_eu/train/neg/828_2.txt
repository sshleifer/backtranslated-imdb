Let's see. "In another place" we finally found that there was no hospital and all things were at the helm of the autistic child. At the end of "Newhart" he was a dream. And he told us everything he had finished with "Roseanne". Very "creative". It was more annoying. Yes, it was just a TV show and it was not a reality. When you're trapped in a great movie or TV show, you want to believe that it's at least "real". At least on the screen that shows the reality. This type of end of this series has been done twice and the old hat was frustrating and simply not spectacular. Now, have a "Newhart" dream? At least, the show was made in a creative way that exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show. The idea itself was not surprising, but it was so brilliant that it was undoubtedly the Best of Serialik Final Ever. Roseanne scammed me, she became a fan of me so faithful.
