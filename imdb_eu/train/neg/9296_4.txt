Normally, I am a generous critic, but I must say that this movie was very bad. I am stunned to seem most positive reviews. <br /> <br /> There were some beautiful shots, but they were very badly wasted in this movie's sinkhole. It is possible that work on "Daggers" was not a mere act, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no double chemist, Mei and his men seem to be more lenient than love, and most are stupid conversations. Translation was just a problem, but it has been a recurring use of the word "flirt" for 8th grade, not for blackheads, forever, worthy of death, for love; I felt the wind was overtaken by a metaphor. The listeners are rarely cared for the characters, which is why the emotional investment is very small in the film. I wanted to go forward with a remote control, I fell into my seat, ready to breathe, but above all I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> ******* spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Now, cake icing. Or, in other words, adding damage. Finally, it was the end of one of the most horrible things I've ever seen. The boys fight for their insertion and shout and shout each other. Oh, and then the snow begins. Randomly Oh, and then Mei (a dagger inserted in the heart) will suddenly appear. Then he throws a dagger to get to the finish line to get a dagger about 5 minutes and, in the middle of the screen, he is comfortable with a little drop of blood. Wow, cool <br /> <br /> Well, then, Mei died, I guess at last, because he threw the dagger in his chest and killed him. Jin sings, weeps, the body closes, the screen is empty. We and the people around me are making a whispering rumor. It's not a good sign <br /> <br /> Visual sign, but eventually failure.
