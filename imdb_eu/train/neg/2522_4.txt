What a horrible movie! It is a good idea for the robot between the fighting, but the story is ridiculous, the true innocent human action, which acts and does not exist, and which, according to this type of movie, is archaic. I thought they were made around 80 and 84 and was surprised to see that it was 1990. Aliens after 5 years! Okay, many people said it was good considering the low budget, but I think "what is it?". It seems incredible. I would not mind seeing a remake with a new special effects and a completely re-written story, I still like the idea of ​​many robots to harm each other.
