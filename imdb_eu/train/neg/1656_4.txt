Except for lovers of silent movie filmmakers, they will also appreciate the lyrical camera and busy (but demanding) backgrounds with the 1933 version. It was a general use of sound in 1928, but it is not more than fifty words that tell a story about a married woman, a story of a woman who spreads her husband after a young man in the romantic desert scene. <br /> </> It allows the jealous marathon to be moved to the village with a lively scene, which usually continues to drive, is the wife's lover. In a horrible jealousy, he starts off at the junction of the railroad at high speeds, but at the last moment he has changed his mind, nervous loss. Surely, it's a strained tense, or a slow and clear story. <br /> <br /> HEDY LAMARR, whose discovery is close to treatment by Marlene Dietrich, but her beauty. They still did not make cosmetics better when they brought it to Hollywood. His screening is especially sad and wonderful, as well as losing his marriage, there is only a little smile when he finds his true love (ARIBERT MOG), after swimming his clothes naked. > <br /> The swim scene is very short, it scrupulously takes pictures and does not deserve the full heat. The scene of love, later, takes a close look at the lyrical photography that appears in most of the film - such artists. More symbolism gives way to imagination - this is one of the films that claim to be a lyrical masterpiece. <br /> <br /> It's not like that. It is unlucky, due to the initial sound (including a backdrop to the intense symphonic music), and it is unfortunate that Miss Lamarre has watched Louis B. Mayer's movie, and accordingly gave her a career in Hollywood. I did not see something I saw at work. <br /> <br /> It seems that this was considered as a silent film, with all the camera work. As a result, the boring scene of "employee" continues too long and requires no obstacle. It is not possible to finish the movie with the corresponding comment.
