The success of the TV series on the work of public writers is not a guarantee. Yorkshire Television learned this hard way when they bought rights for books credited with Dick Francis in 1979, three of which were broadcast for "The Racing Game". Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, who lost his right hand as a result of an accident to replace a private, artificial jockey with a private eye. Gwilym suffered from acute charisma (and it was bad), while Mick Ford (who played irritating Chico Barnes) thought of a horse ass on every screen. For six weeks, less than dynamic couples walked around the countryside, avoiding unfavorable races, usually using the same methods: shuffle, rider, or doping horses. The Yorkshire TV show cast money, but it's in vain. Violent, sexist, distant and repetitive, he quickly loaded the knackers in the yard.
