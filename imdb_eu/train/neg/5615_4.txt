I only saw DVD 1. The proper program may have 10 minutes of adequate information; Otherwise they are a lot of religious backgrounds. As the director Brian Flemming recently found atheism and sarcasm, and with these tools, he could easily bring his rival. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < movie The subject never returns. <br /> <br /> Religious people skeptics discourage their religion's inconvenience, of course, if rooted in abusive upbringings. The arguments of those victimized people seem irrational, which is why they are not believed convincing. <br /> <br /> Religion against people wants more data. We do not need to tell that religious people are fond of it, Americans have to tell more than Christmas Jewish annoying music in mid-December. <br /> <br /> Fleming superintendent at the best scene. Childhood Christian schools help them understand better about the director about his motivations. It seems the most sincere part of the movie, and it was too short. <br /> <br /> Fleming can self-consciously have a good story about himself (past and present). ) The evil institutions adopted in Christianity and the doctrine of his youth. <br /> <br /> And maybe he could "go to earth on earth" to a more documentary material that could be given. I do not know how to find out about Saul's and Paul's writings in order to find out about everything close to the air, but the quick Wikipedia search suggests that most of these arguments are unloving. <br /> <br /> Bonus conversations are pretty good because they do not reinforce Fleming's theses. Sam Harris is a spokesman for anti-POV religious and has no clear Christian religion around. Harris also has good (and easily Google'd) conversations with Salon.com, Amazon.com and Samharris.org.
