I was debuted at the 1997 Toronto Film Festival. After the screening, the writer / director and several cast members were asked to answer questions, no one could ask. Rarely, the short film has been directed (why are the random frames out of some scenes?), Corrected the Wicked (David Arquette, paraphrased by Dorothy Parker, does not have an emotional gam from A-B). It brings lunch and there is no problem. Characters perform completely without reason, to move on the plot in certain directions. In the end, the movie arrives completely randomly and to the end, "to really think". Unfortunately, what you think is: "Well, 90 minutes of my life will never be returned."
