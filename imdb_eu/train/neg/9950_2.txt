If the original casting idea had been saved (Rutger hunt, not Ice-T), this movie could work. Unfortunately, the rapture had to be included in the picture (literally) and mess. The main employee of the black productions could not be a black antagonist, so Rutger and Ice-T roles were exchanged. This was just the beginning of the downward spiral of this film. Ernest Dickerson assured him of approaching "curbing" news that this was another act that could be confirmed. Master shot, close, close. Gads, 'Who's Line Is It Anyway' also uses more creative camera work. Eric is rewriting the work of "The Dangerous Game", at least as an attempt to modernize the classical story, but fails to motivate why this person's character is motivated. We never give reasons, "no one loses this person," why the leaders (Rutger rewritten) do these things. In addition to John McGinley and Charles Dutton's direct work, you do not worry so much. A bit of curiosity, a real drunken accident occurred when filmed by F.Murray Abraham, and caused the death of a young poisoned driver who caused the accident.
