It's really an awesome "B" movie. It is absurd and often shameful. In the plot, the basic "business show" routine does not exist. In fact, the film is just an excuse for boosting the war effort and featured some well-known 1942 music groups such as Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby, and Freddy Slack. Each group is about three minutes away, with the exception of Mills Brothers for two reasons, for a few reasons. Ann Miller does not dance to the last minute of the movie, and does not need to do it, but he has put things in the middle of numerous propaganda patriots. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment in the film, I think, was in the Duke Ellington segment. The group seems to be playing in a train. (At the southern depth of the era, the bands were divided into railcars when traveling). Johnny Hodges is seen next to Duke and Harry Carney can also be identified. In the final moments of the film, the violinist / violinist Ray Nance runs down the camera and "uncle Tom" blows his eyes and shakes his head as he did in Willy Best. For tribute to modern audiences, especially jazz lovers, the tribute to segregation is sad. Some movies do not see.
