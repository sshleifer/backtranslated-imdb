I learned from Wendigo many years ago in one of the "Scary Stories" of Alvin Schwartz: according to the story, Wendigo - after calling your name to the wind - drags you and then pushes and spreads to heaven. you Although the idea seems pretty curious, Schwartz's story has made the idea quite consistent. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is not a movie. Basically, it comes from all horror film clips: it moves to a new family home and starts to strange things; Anyone who harms them asks, and everyone will hear the old Indian guy better. I've seen things I've seen several times. <br /> <br /> Either way, avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan ("Malcolm in the Middle" in "Dewey") have done much better than that.
