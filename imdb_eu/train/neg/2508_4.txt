At that time the movie was released on DVD. I know some WB pressures the movie for The Dreamgirls. But how can your catalog publish a movie since 1976? <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed with the DVD edition of this movie, there is no special feature, 5.1 DD sound. come WB, and you can do it much better. The audio and image quality of this movie is in need of serious help. <br /> <br /> It seems WB has not paid much time and attention to this movie because it's a black movie and my sales are good. All the songs that the original CD does not contain could contain a CD that could contain it. <br /> <br /> I would recommend buying this DVD. Yes, because it's a classic movie. But WB needs to add some special features. Take notes from other group movies, The Five Heatbeats or The Temptation, because you would only see the performance, and the sound is much better than the DVD.
