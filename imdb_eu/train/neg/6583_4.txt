Interesting stories and a story that does not work. <br /> <br /> When you see the movie, maybe I'm not feeling like I was at the end. I did not really know who was in the rooftop, as Taye Diggs was apparently bored as a detective; the other characters seemed one-dimensional and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The problem was as rude as other girls, making the sweet little girl an opportunistic bend. I can not understand the moral message of this movie, and the detective story and thriller does not work.
