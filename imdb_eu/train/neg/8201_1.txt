Buy your favorite chair and play the station as you throw it to the waste dumpster. Spend 90 minutes useful. Live your favorite game. Disconnect - poorly shot - unmanaged litter. It takes a lot of different "science fiction" movies and tries to make the pieces a pathetically weak story. There is nothing new here, it seems that filmmakers do not have the chance of getting a game of entertainment, but a touch of skills and knowledge is needed to become a good movie. That money we're seeing is a waste, and personally I want my life 90 mins back.
