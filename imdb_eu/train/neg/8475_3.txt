(NOTE: I thought I would be the only writer I have undergone, but I agree with others. I think it was quite obvious, that is, the abuse of bait-the-cat. However, here's what I wrote: ) <br /> <br /> Owners have been on holiday for two weeks - leaving only a cat (Sylvester) for a trip to California and locked in the house. Milk does not mean, but the cat, for its relief, finds canned tuna. However, with himself, he can not find it open. <br /> <br /> If that little mouse has a home ... and the cat is spilled. After shaking Sylvester, it is a rodent that is softening in the second after shaking it. Sylvester tries to do everything he can to get rid of the tuna, but he can not do it. <br /> <br /> This is a frustrating story and why the "guy" sadistic mouse overcomes me. Tom and Jerry are similar to cartoons, where Tom is the worst ever, even though this small mouse is often in conflict!
