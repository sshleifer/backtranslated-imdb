My God This movie was horrible. I can not complain too much. I only bought to buy. It was enough, somehow. It's funny that the most boring part of the movie was that the woman was very strongly forced at the outset to be born to a great baby of mutation. <br /> <br /> Also, I think it's funny that most prominent feature film was a Hispanic soldier, he was an assistant actor on Friday. All the films made a great performance. I have never been one of the worst cast I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I expect that it was much more terrible than the first one. It was not. I expected that it would be more experienced because it is a sequel and the horror films continue to be much less than the previous ones. I was expecting more experience because normal gore and violence sold a horror movie these days (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 and 2, Dead Silence), but it was not as dramatic as it was before. It was another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The first mutants were disturbing, but the filmmakers tried so hard to be surprising in those that they were absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> I also hate the whole concept of the soldier's clip, the camera that shows the phone's camera, "I love you, mommy" four times. It was absurd to show first, because the soldiers' mother was trying to feel worse than the rest of the soldiers, and it was even more stupid to try to feel himself three times without showing us why. This movie was a joke.
