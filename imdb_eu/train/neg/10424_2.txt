I would love this movie. The play is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great, but I thought the movie was very good to me. The films give cheap and cheap employees. The daughter embarrassed her mother and, although she did not raise her daughter, she always confused me. Barbara Stanwyck worsens her daughter's daughter, but her daughter loves to be happy to find happiness with her father's family. I wonder how many people have seen this movie in that way. The effect has been very good and it's worth watching. I do not like the story. just a personal preference. Thank you
