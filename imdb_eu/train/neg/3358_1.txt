Haunting A restart, of course. The original psychological thriller was awesome and was improved over time. Compared to the 1999 version, it is classical. There is no character development here, only cartoons (slut, the authoritarian brain, "Here I will be" a boy, a so sensitive bookworm). But, given the fact that the stars of the special effects are "stars" and how banks are, I think that the characters you're empathicating are secondary concerns. Unfortunately, the effects are harmful. Kerubin, mewing lighted doors, irritating the dead children who can not speak clearly ... and at the end idiotically sappy makes darnedest a new age butterfly and rainbows enema. I miss my Skittles, thank you. Bruce Dern, I liked it since "Cowboys". Stop.
