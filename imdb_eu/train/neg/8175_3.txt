The mood of this movie is pretty good and shows the feeling of the 80's with some good performances. <br /> <br /> However ..... <br /> <br /> The script is run by the mill, except for a couple of comedic moments, and it's strange that I hope it's a shameless hope. A totally dramatic and compelling character and scriptwriter who most likely watched the right clicks when they saw a documentary panorama when they were facing the nation. The main problem is that this movie has no real story. "Arty" marks all the boxes right, but nothing happens, and at the end you are wondering what the point was. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
