Never make the main competitor to make the worst film. Joanna Pakule's character I.Q. 3 is less than the writer and the director. The script would not go through the class for writing a bachelor's degree; "jokes" are young; the concept is sharp These actors were looking for work. I stopped to see if it would be worse. He did that. Life is short to see this movie.
