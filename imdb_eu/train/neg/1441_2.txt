I received this movie on the cover only when I thought of joining an "Indiana Jones and The Doom Temple" adventure. Unfortunately I fell. I did not even like rainbow before. This was so great, I could hardly find any good quality in this movie. The skin described some amazing effects. There was no one. The movie was so lightweight, even those who portrayed stereotypes. The problem gives you an idea that you can solve with violence. If you want to teach your children. I do not have. Keep away If you are looking for family entertainment, you'll find something more inspirational.
