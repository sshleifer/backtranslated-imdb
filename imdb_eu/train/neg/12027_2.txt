When I saw this movie in the middle of the night, when I was rolling in the channels, there was nothing else to see. It's just one of those movies that you can watch on film just for a moment! - But notice twenty minutes or, after that, you just can not turn it off, whatever it's bad. One of the bad films of such a bad one is good and it's so bad that it's just ordinary BAD, it's worth seeing just seeing them! A great night mid price, only to drag the wonderful tennis. Do not worry yourself why nobody can say that Chad Lowe is male because logic does not apply.
