First thing first: I'm not conservative. And even though I never mentioned it as a liberal or a democrat, I was on the day before the first war in Iraq. I think that John Cusack and I think I'm sure that politicians are obvious, I'm sure we're drinking if we're friends if we ever talked about Adam Curtis's great BBC documentary. My point is this: do not review this review, Cusack's War, Inc. I think that I am not part of the choir he is preaching. There is no doubt that WI policies are tailor-made to attract my demographics, but the problem is tailoring, and Cusack writes, produces, and puts the boxes in the notebook worse than cheap suits. <br /> <br /> As they say, "the path to doom is full of good intentions." Cusack, his co-writers, director Joshua Seftel as well as actors, would definitely make a film about Robert Altman's war against M * A * S * H. It was as unknown and inadequate as Michael Moore's Canadian Bacon. <br /> <br /> The current state of politics, foreign policy and war "efforts" is already absurd and, therefore, tragic, pathetic. and, unfortunately, it is comical - watch The Daily Show and see yourself. The last line is that the Bush administration is not as entertaining as it is, so we can not write it down, why would you try to compete? <br /> <br /> WI felt that the problem was the main problem. hurry up In order to get it, Cusack was basically gossiped by Grosse Pointe Blank (one of his best films), which completely changed the shopping list from Naomi Klein. Most of these ideas hang on for the first twenty minutes of your film, which is so repulsive that no jokes or jokes or referrals of Halliburton, Neo-Cons or Iraqi occupation are deliberately evident. light or fun Writers were so blindfolded by their own dogmas, thinking of these issues, they thought it was a fun and subversive movie. The problem is ... it's not. Now, these ideas are news yesterday, if you are not living below or being ignorant of ignorance, denial and stupidity (read: right-handed Christian), jokes are insulted. <br /> <br /> WI may be more subtle, subversive, offensive and nurtured in collaboration with specific research / ideas on the occupation. As with the same thing, jokes and sight are all the gags are so bad and they are so bad, so subtle, subtle or satirical that the evil is so small, they did not do much more than cry. Homer Simpson once said "it's fun to be true" and The Daily Show proves it every night; War, Inc. However, it proves that truth is not fun. Bottom Line: There is no need for hyperbole to clarify the US / Neo-Conservative policies ... it's just a joke. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
