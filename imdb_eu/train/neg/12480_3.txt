... or, indeed, so badly, when you see the time of your life when you laugh at your ass! In 1983, James Sbardellati's "Deathstalker" is one of the awesome productions of the Sword & Sorcery sub-genres, but it's really fun. The play is awful; The argument is empty, and effects and photography can not be amateurs. But bad performance, cheesy effects and mistakes make movies so fun. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS AHEAD - <br /> <br /> Deathstalker (Rick Hill) is a very skillful and skillful warrior. One day, a good witch cared for three chaos and power of creation, a sword, an amulet and chalice, to rid the country of its brutal rules, the evil king and the Munkar witch. Getting the sword is very easy, but they are the owner of Mulek and kettle. Fortunately, the evil king has organized a championship where the best competitors of the county warriors fight against each other. The winner will take the place of the king. Of course, the king does not want his place, so he has planned the winner (first of all without organizing the championship). Deathstalker is not only the power of three creative creatures, but the beauty of the old daughter of the old king (Barbi Benton) from the evil Munkar claws. Fortunately, he is not bored on the tournament, while Kaira (Lana Clarkson) has been kidnapped by warrior women ... <br /> <br /> He has a lot of movies, very excellent. stupid and fun scenes. Some of my favorite scenes are: <br /> <br /> - Deathstalker leaves his sword guy bad. However, the head falling on the head is not like that. He has a red head that falls into his head. The man with Deathstalker cut off his hair with dark hairs and beards. <br /> <br /> - When the character of the female warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) enters the character, it is seen for the first time. Black outfit, face and body hidden. The Deathkalker traveler, Oghris (Richard Brooker), fights and swords his garment (underlying, of course, topless) open, revealing his breasts. Her breasts see the first thing in Clarkson's work, even before her face. <br /> <br /> - The last Deathstalker warrior must fight in that champion, a giant man and the head of a man. a pig <br /> <br /> - The evil mumble has a small creature locked in his chest. It creates small creatures with fast creatures and toes. <br /> <br /> ... There are many other unwanted, entertaining and entertaining scenes. The play is awful, but Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson are late for sweets, and although I've described this movie as 'unwanted fun', it was a nonsensical movie that I was completely aware of by some of my agents. To keep entertainers entertained, there is a lot of women's reproduction. "Deathstalker" is a horrible movie, but I still recommend it. People with humor will have the time of their lives!
