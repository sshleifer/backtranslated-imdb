He imagined that this film represented a "ladie's man" degree, trying to bet definitively. However, I did not have the responsibility to fix his role, because I did not take care of his character. I do not know what those beautiful women saw. He did not have any class or charisma. At least one should have a way of thinking about women's skinny knees playing saxophone, but in vain. As a musician, it's not sexy. Hide, too, that knowing things that fell in love with a woman married for five minutes, were absolutely amazing and ridiculous. Is this man ashamed at all? Ordering and stopping and ordering things would be more attractive to the character, but his character was simple and boring. <br /> <br /> Gina Gershonen's character was useless in Britain. It could be as loud as possible with the usual voice that spoke in a voice, sometimes fading through the movie with a poor British accent. <br /> <br /> The only two characters that I looked after were fish and frogs. Now, these two chemicals! For the Academy's two nominations? STAT! Plots holes, character development, immense performance, unnecessary drama, moments of the topical ... What a mess of the movie?
