In 1989, "The Dream Child" is the fifth movie of "Nightmare", and from that point on, the whole series has become a garbage. The good films of this series belonged to Wes Craven's 1984 origins and the third part of 1987 was "The Dream Warriors". In the second half, it was disappointing and boring, and the fourth part of Freddy Krueger's frightening madness began. angry with constant jokes. This fifth installment of the series does not recommend anything, except the great audio-visual (and great) and scenes, as Freddy Krueger's story is about to translate. The rest of the films are mostly our maniac jokes-jokester template for stupidity and the formula that tells the old bunch of old-age teenagers, the old bunch of teens who try to avoid sleeping. Freddy dreams of waiting. Lisa Wilcox has returned to Alice Johnson's role, and she does not like the content as a super-mutated rhyme for the "erotic" children, just as justification for being cheerful and boring. In short: There is no originality, only the decline of the old formula, and the jokes are hardly annoying. My generous grade 3/10 is the result of audiovisual content and, above all, to highlight the inequality of "Freddy's Dead" in the next sequel. If you are not a favorite of Freddy Krueger, you should avoid the "Dream Dream" and, nevertheless, that will be blank.
