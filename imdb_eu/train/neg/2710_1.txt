In a way, our country, for four hours, sharply changed the 60s. And he was painful for four hours. The main events and events were trivilized and "claimed" about two families, but the African American family hardly ever saw you. I was ashamed of NBC and I was ashamed to throw it into the trash. It was very entertaining that the happy family you saw at the beginning was tortured in many ways, but it came across important events over the past 60 years. And the second family is not that factor. Perhaps they have offered five or six scenes to the family. This poor child ... Please NBC, do no movies about any other time ... leave PBS and History Channel
