I really wanted this movie, but it was impossible. The plays were ultra hammocks, plots were annoying, and the rhythm was SLOW, sooo slowwwwww. I wanted to finish the movie whole time sitting in the theater. I'm praying for twenty-five minutes. Certainly some of the viewers were nice, but I mean, boys, really! And for a movie about a tuning of musical instruments, there was not a lot to talk about music. There was music that was annoying and boring. Sometimes sound sounds rigid even though they were annoying. This film overwhelmed me, and at the same time dragged me away. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that's why. I need to see "Tideland" and have a bad taste in my mouth.
