Oddly enough, Rene Russo's eyes and mouths are not Buddy the Gorilla's "Buddy", Jim Henson Pictures, a pillar produced by Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope. Somehow, Russo's faces occurred in post-production stages, and they literally fired monkeys on the screen several times. A true funny story adapted to the memory of Davies Lint's "Trudy" by Gertrude, a wealthy doctor's wife, who transforms his mansion into petty and wildlife. The film overcomes it with good intentions ... it makes a great deal of sincerity. The film never needs to be lit by the type of "family film", and before too long people and animals seem to be very programmed (there is nothing real here). About ten minutes, two chimpanzees go through the kitchen of Russo and the butcher's knife has begun to push back and forth (Alan Cumming grows on his head); However, there is no eyebrows for all day while fun. However, when Budok rages in a stormy storm, police are called - and everyone looks at Buddy's window as he raises the entrance furniture. The furniture should have the slightest worries for anyone, when they are not flawed and worse. But, at least, we know that Russo was in good hands: when Caroline Thompson needed a good shot at the manager, Rene's elimination once again led to an extreme approach. They ask me what this picture was for a lipstick quote? ** ****
