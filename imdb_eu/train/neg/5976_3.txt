The rumor is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY are more than boys. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is provided. The Jersey girl goes to New York to become a songwriter. And without an initial frustration without luck, they heard about a couple of 300 partners who each made each last night. He makes an audition at what works and amazes at the bar! The place is full of "two-year-old children" watching their children dance. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad and some characters are nice, especially Cammie (the "fashion coordinator" was very nice) and bouncer but we know, the drama was horrible and completely dark. While Violet and her father seemed to be very hilarious about the whole movie. Check out the Violet keyboard with the break dance break! <br /> <br /> As I have thought for the first time, how could production be horrible? With this short film, Hollywood could stand upright and not show any public cries without showing any new discounts without saying "You were warned!" Instead, COYOTE UGLY seems to have the direct intention of trying to kiss all the important backgrounds around the world. Advertisements on bars in pubs, but to show a thin paper on the "dream to follow your story" story that someone desires all male men desperately! <br /> <br /> And finally, music. There was no broken music I found in the movie, especially when it was necessary (hospital scene). Each scene feels like the music you want to be a short video clip until the bar opened. But the highest point was final: in the 80s, Cyndi Lauperk was jumping with Violet and hoping to jump on jelly. My dear, I personally thought of Bon Jovi's long hair and even jelly to jump! <br /> <br /> Instead of working with other intelligent cameras, when they dance with the koyote girls (especially the soaked scene) and cute couples, COYOTE UGLY is just about to be embarrassed. Whether you looked at it or not, it was like killing time. Or lose by looking.
