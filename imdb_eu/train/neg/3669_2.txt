I really can not think of anything good about this movie ... it's not the only thing. The script is a nightmare ... the writer blurs the chemical and biological characteristics and does not understand the difference. It would seem that they would at least get a technical consultant. Bad performances were the most cast ... even though I do not blame ... the material is really shameful. The edition was bad ... I will stop now ... its bad 2/10
