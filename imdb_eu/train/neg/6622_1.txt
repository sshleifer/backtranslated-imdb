Like many other Bachchan fans, I expected to wait for the remake of Sholay. This movie was not. Thanks in God's name because they did not use the name "Sholay". Ram Gopal's version is not worth the title. Camera work, locations, costumes, a completely out-of-court dance, I've combined all conversations together to make the movie I've ever seen. You ask that the cast of the actor cast money for this movie, and Ram Gopal paid a lot of money for the cast. The only paid actor, ant, the first movie was the only similarity. Abishe's role was absolutely ridiculous, did Ash need money to pay for marriage? Save your money, mind and time, do not worry about that movie or DVD.
