Orson Welles, thirty years ago, was given Mike Sarne as the "greatest train in the world", but unfortunately there was nothing he needed to see if the train crew was still in a hurry. and a weird kind of awe.

In fact, it keeps secrecy vigilant. However, Michael Cimino has been closely linked to the political and artistic Armageddon that make up the "Heaven's Gate". Both films seemed to be the ego ego's directors, but at least Cimino was a great gentleman. The 70's films, before removing the wickedness of the studio, only had Mr. Sarne "Joanna" enter his dressing rooms. In addition, the "Heaven's Gate" was a memorable and well-managed set and the "Myra Breckinridge" wardrobe was empty. Simply, it's the worst example of a hand that stirs food in Hollywood history.
