Was this film a positive one? Critics who know nothing about video games can detect gambling mistakes. No damage to the initial damage is clearly visible, for example, the first example. <br /> <br /> And maybe I missed something, but Super Mario Bros. 3 had he not played before playing before? Well, if that happened, I did not lose anything ... how did Fred Savage know the nature, as well as the little girl about the game? Some people do not know by second or third playback. <br /> <br /> Beyond gaming errors there is a low quality of this film. Here's nothing memorable. Children did not even show video games in video clips. Many of the children I knew at that time had a lot more experience. Above all, plays and stories are only halfway in their most powerful points. The characters are soft and very interesting, "The Witches" (the youngest child) is a very silent and dry child who speaks very traumatic. This is not realistic, it was necessary to start a movie that began to form a plot of more than 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the only value here is that nostalgic. Whether you liked it when you grew up with this movie or not. It was about kids playing video games, and you probably saw obsession with NES. But if you do not love him as a child, you do not keep any interest, and you will be barred from extinguishing it. <br /> <br /> It's not my lord, I did not like it. .
