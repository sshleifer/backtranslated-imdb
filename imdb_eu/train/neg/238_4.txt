Cinderella story for grown-ups in dreams. Romance is very unrealistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect and so on. Until Cinderella is finished and Shahid Kapoor is my only reason. If you are looking for a love affair, this is definitely a movie, but for the rest of the people around the world I would recommend a three-hour clock. Wake up people! <br /> <br /> Five out of five friends who watched the movie did not recommend the movie. Most realistic times we had a great shake. Maybe I'm missing something. I can not believe such a movie can win a classic like HDDCS!
