The strong rhythm of this movie breaks us. There is no real suspense. Most of the characters were bad. The Irish double priest was as stupid as the interest of love. It's misleading. It could be a better girl than to choose the film's sensuality. The main conflict of the main character was not involved. This movie is totally positive. It's like stealing someone who did not want to go to the gym in that day.
