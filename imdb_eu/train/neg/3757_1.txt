How did this happen? In general, movies, etc. I love F / Bigfoot. . but I still hope that they should be written without such cheese. The effects were sad, the lines were more sad. Avoid at all costs. I only finished renting, since it was an incorrect case (with Lance Henrikson looking for Sasquatch film, I have not seen it yet). The movie is a good idea. There was a great potential for a small movie here. I do not understand how it ends up like that. Go to any university student's film / art / students interested in English and find a better script.
