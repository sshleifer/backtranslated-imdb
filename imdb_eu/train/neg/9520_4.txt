[*** SPOILERS POSTABLE ***] The popularity of this movie is ahead, so it was planned to see it in the TCM mailbox. What a great despair! <br /> <br /> The excellent cast and production values ​​are primary, but the characters are not deep, the plot is thin, and the whole thing is long. In order to achieve a movie that deals with alcoholism, family distribution, infidelity, gambling and sexual repression, the movie is curiously flat, prosaic, impersonal, and topical. An example is an example of Frank Hirsch's portrait of the believer: his wife's request was "high up and relax a bit", following a mental headaches and headaches. ("Hey Nancy, I'm blues tonight. Come on a record"), all well-spent formula. We do not believe these people are real, but cardboard cuttings play in the puppet theater. Similarly, the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never explored or explained. Dave's arrogance with Gwen again / off-again is not incomprehensible to discard or eliminate its potential. The marriage of Shirley Maclaine / Ginny's despair is, nevertheless, obviously, from the point of view of the audience, to fail, and it was clear - that this type of television series could have convention. Only one person is killed. When the kelpie started crossing the track, I started to bet myself - Dave or Ginny - to kill. The whole thing was a capital with a 'P'. <br /> <br /> That's what Maclaine's performance and Dean Martin play here. But, in general, I think film interests should be one of the times of Hollywood history.
