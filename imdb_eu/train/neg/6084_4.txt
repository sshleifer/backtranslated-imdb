It is possible that a man who knows Sledge can make fatal damage to the room floor. Maybe someone will cut the director one day, but I'm uncertain. <br /> <br /> He decided to incorporate James Garner into the spaghetti western market, and so they brought a lot of Americans to fill the throw. there are People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And, of course, Vic Morrow wrote and directed this film. <br /> <br /> Garner always feels guilty as guilty as they are so playful. But he plays seriously and works well for the hours and children of the Site. He successfully breaks and breaks his usual stereotyped. But a man named Sledge can not take it as one of his successes. <br /> <br /> Luther Sledge has the title role, with a great price for the famous illusions. When Tony Young's partner dies in a saloon and Garner has taken the proper measures in Eastwood, John Marley's saloon continues. <br /> <br /> Marley spent his time in a neighboring territory, and it seems that they are gold shipments. lock and lock the resting places for the rest of the people. Garner makes his gang together to make a robbery. <br /> <br /> Here's what comes out of the movie. Normally, film stars feature the mainstream of methodical planning. Undoubtedly, in this case, The War Wagon mentioned another reviewer. Garner, however, wants to join Dennis Weaver as a prisoner of the US Marshal's false marshal and decides he'll be jailbreaking. He will rob the gold. <br /> <br /> That just swallowed it. If it was easy to get gold, it would take a long time. I would like to say to the western blood of the Italians and those who like it, in the breaking of the prison in enough three films. <br /> <br /> That is not the whole thing, of course, is illegal and that's what we have before the end of the new movie. The film has long lost its consistency. <br /> <br /> Allan Jones's thirty-year-old singer-songwriter is credited. But I can not find myself in the movies for a lifetime. Maybe the Donkey Serenade choir can do better. <br /> <br /> It could not hurt.
