The difficulty with the version of "Les Miserables" applies to the same "Oliver". Composers wrote instead of the stylistic term of acting, they only wrote Broadway melodies, historically unidiomatic and stylistically disturbed. <br /> <br /> Too much, wild and bad playwrights. Do not mix well with some sunshine that scroll through the score. The mix is ​​very pleasant, which leaves the skin decisive. <br /> <br /> The young Oliver's questionnaire does not matter in matters: it is tempting and coveted timbre, something less than here. Fagin performs his usual routine in a timely manner, although there is little ground for the song to be forced. <br /> <br /> "It's a long time that needs me" gives a sharp interpretation, rude and strained. Two large productions, "Who Buy" and "Think Yourself", seem to be overproduced, but with everything that is sinking in the kitchen. All this must be done, one more to overcome the line. <br /> <br /> It seems that the senses, despair and destruction of the novel do not seem to be choreography and wickedness. Although the novel is considered as a classic, I must admit that I am having trouble with Mr. Dickens' consciousness, because his work casts a negative vibration. That might be to prolong his unhappy personal life, that he was full of misfortune and repentance. <br /> <br /> All the combined talents of this production, behind or behind the camera, exceeds the contagious structure of the basic material. All of this is a lot of experience for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
