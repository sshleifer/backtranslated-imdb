I never heard of it until it appeared on Cable TV. It's a typical science fiction of the fifties: simple, depressive and non-paranoid! Even though the introduction of a romantic couple is the same, the documentary style is far more widespread, that is to say, the excitement of dropping out many narrative exhibits and adding cheap footage to human beings. It's a very small budget! Although not particularly unusual (later, the apocalypse-through-renegade-missile angle is used, much more, DR. STRANGELOVE (1964) and FAIL-SAFE [1964]) and is a compassionate merely a unique vision of the movie. There is a lot of unwanted laughs about his theme - especially in the face of unexpected accidents and a group of young youth delinquents!
