I wanted to see this movie but, on the other hand, it closed me a strange ridiculous scene. The character reacts nothing. Let's say: Heath Ledger walks on the night (I think it's a cemetery) when he is attacked by spirits, who escapes. After the train, he takes a leisurely stroll and finds a friend who has seen everything. Asking what has happened, "it has been attacked by the devil," he says, "he is attacked by anything serious," it is said as if it were a little more exciting than a tire four. <br /> <br /> I shut up to ask something ... a demon or something, I was worried. Replies can only be rented by someone with their own death, and the priest observes that the man is hungry and hungry because he is hanging and hanging over his body. <br /> <br /> 0 star ****.
