This movie was not as pretty as I expected. There are a few shades in a few paranoia-festive conspiracy conspiracy in the DOO. Most of the plays are mediocre, but common in the 70s are quite ordinary. A photographer and a model tells the strange things that happen in the woods and the victims are soon. Planeplates are seen, more people disappear - but are ultra-private secrets covered by aliens or our government? Soon, a reporter and "UFOlogist" (apparently molded by the writer's director) become involved in this devotion, and become ultra-targeted agents that are just as threatening as they are, and absurd. Then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The movie, presumably, is a UFO conspiracy theory that is as sane as the average, but it should be taken so well. Camera work is for a low-budget movie. Pacing is pretty good, the script is nonsense and nonsensical, and there are issues that follow. What is the splint in my mind? Honestly, you can not say a lot without writing a spoiler. You can say that if you do not want to take the movie to the bottom of the fast progress, it's worth it.
