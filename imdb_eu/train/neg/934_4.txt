Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were just as big as they were. Ritter was not too bad. His name was as pretty as usual. It could be a good movie. The bad plot was horrible. It was totally predictable, boring, and boring. <br /> <br /> For the first 15 minutes, the rest of the films were distributed as a child's color scheme. The characters were cardboard cut pieces. There was nothing new or interesting to say and overtake the performance, it was a pity. <br /> <br /> In the end, the screenwriter was not a victim. Especially incredible with children's "precocious" lines. <br /> <br /> Again, the actress is only much less punctuated.
