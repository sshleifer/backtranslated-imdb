My goodness is a bad movie. In my review of the films I was completely deceived that they are safe rubbish. Yes, yes, good friends are wearing white ones, bad guys are wearing black ... and they always win. Go home and embrace your children, and feel how good Hollywood felt. Blech! I can not believe the dead movie developed by Wes Craven. I think he needed a bit of money to pay for mortgages, so he made this garbage. Anyone who watches the movie thinks this production can make it as good or better as an experimental director. <br /> <br /> Let's see, a nasty man wants a sweet girl who loves her dad. do it wittle IL 'bad thing or her dad will hurt. All-American girl next door, but will keep the day and overcome the bad guys ... we know the end. ROCKS of the Powerful Girls <br /> <br /> Now, just find an idiot entertain this would find ... "roller coaster ride", and let something fresh or new. All the "super-duper" opinions you see on this site are industry hackers who either make money or pay money or sell their soul to the devil. <br /> <br /> Rachael McAdams is beautiful ... Yup, that's it. No good performance, not horrible ... it's just nice. He should have shown a lot of skin to save this movie. It is not hard enough to be a female actress. <br /> <br /> Cillian Murphy was passable for at least 28 days. But here he pretends to be an intelligent mute boy. 5'5 '' With his McAdams kicking his butt immediately, that's why he was an animator ... and a field hockey player ... and I am sure that he has all the Tae Bo tape ... So he must rent it as a result of an international terrorist to rent I would not trust Steal a lot of gum from 7-11. <br /> <br /> See, the movie was made earlier, before doing well. Go again to upload any of the Die Hard movies. Believers endanger you, international terrorists, except pleasurable and believable characters, and bad boys are competent and interesting. I simply do not understand how Hollywood knows how to easily cope with the ways in which innocent people can easily cope. It is not surprising that the revenue from the films fell. <br /> <br /> You can not lower your $ 6 common pool and save 2 hours of your life. <br /> <br /> Ciao, FreddyShoop
