There's nothing in this movie that shows talented talent scrap. Nobody ever tried to do it, though they have been stuck in the cafe's accessories. There's nothing to hear. The quality of the film is horrible. Most of the "action" takes place in narrow corridors or apartments, because the camera is designed on the right side, as some cameras shake and move forward while the lines of 'actors' appear. Not even a tripod and microphone, the sound quality is horrible. Although "Manos" prices were better, they had at least adequate equipment. What plot is lost in wicked production. <br /> <br /> You can match your home video, a 5-year-old boy who is testing 5-year-old father's camera phone video. You will have a long search engine to find a more in-depth movie.
