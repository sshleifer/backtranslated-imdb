This is not a good movie. The play is very hard and convincing. The film does not seem to know whether to make a real horror approach or to go down to the camp and kitsch route. I have never seen the first movie, but this is not accepted, but there are some untold plots and the viewer is never aware of the importance of vampire lead. No effort of observation is worth
