Take the SciFi Original Movie and mix it in a small alternative / version history and you'll get "Azteken Rex". It seems that Hernand Cortes had to conquer the Tyrannosaurus Rex and his friends before conquering before the Aztecs. This is the impulse of this movie. As a result of the absorption of land; The writers who suck us are just the tip of the cap. There are some problems. To begin, Cortes plays with Ian Ziering. With a black movie, Cortes is as compelling as Ziering playing Axl Rose Gandhi. And although Cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs are present in a whole group of Hawaiians. Aside from that, T-Rex (s) looks pretty good, even though one of them casts out CGI. And they easily die; I suppose that T-Rex had happened in real life, surely, in the sixteenth century. It would have been a rather rare jewelry store of the century or at least. But something goes wrong. There are also human-scenes graphic sculptures in T-Rex, but it's amazing, but I thought it worked well in this context. There is a lot of action and the full angle of colonization prevails, but it does not surpass the dinosaur's angle, unlike the "Warbirds" as the latest SciFi Original dinosaur movie. Generally, a movie that values ​​a modish film (but according to the original SciFi Standard).
