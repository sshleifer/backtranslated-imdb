I expected it a bit like Tim Roth. I was not happy with this movie. I liked it with Ang Lee The Hulk a few years ago, so I thought I'd have more bang. First of all, I was very happy with the performance of John Hurt here. He seems to rescue his eyebrows for that. His performance was not convincing. It was not as good as expected. Tim Roth is always fresh. Gama thing is not the story I do not think. I think the best part of the movie was the end. He had a nice action. The only problem was original was long. This is not long, but sometimes it has been boring. Some years ago, I remember Walmart was really selling my movie and why I always asked him. I know now. I wanted to get it out, but I did not.
