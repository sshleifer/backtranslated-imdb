"Launcher man" is definitely the most boring and curious film ever seen in my life. My aunt's holiday videos are much more fun. <br /> <br /> The actors seem to have been hired at uglypeople.com. They do not have any talent to persuade them to act in a way. <br /> <br /> They walk in the foot and walk through the woods. "The Lord of the Rings" are more than just talking together in three sections. After the first hour, I started reading the Porsche brochure while watching the "Men of the Morning." Wonderful. <br /> <br /> Losing time and money. I would give this movie 0 out of 10, this is not possible, I need to give a star.
