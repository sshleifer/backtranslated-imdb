The plot of 'Edison' was a decent one, but an actor spoiled the whole movie in particular. He prevented Justin Timberlake from filming the film on all lines. It's one of the worst actors I have seen so far, and it would be like F.R.A.T. straight <br /> <br /> If the emotional scene, the action scene or the silent scene, Justin Timberlake ruined it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time watching this film. Do not load charging, thumbnail porn would be a much better option. <br /> <br /> And Justin, if you're reading, bend to music. You're not good yet, even if you started thinking about singing and singing really well.
