Why should Mary and Rhodes's story be? Divorced women with daughters with indifference. And why very little reference the original show and the characters? Her daughter was a stupid and strange character. Why can not she ever be the daughter of her mother's television? It is reasonable to leave Mary Minneapolis and return to Rhoda NYC, but why could not Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens invited stars? It's just a wonderful way to remember wonderful characters. It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together, of course, but it could be better, much better. Well, Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, fortunately, Mary will do better next time if she inspects Richard Richards again.
