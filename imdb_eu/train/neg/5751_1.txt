Films should be filmed one day, the camera's reflections and scenes that you can see in its red pointer, and the green light that blends in with the actors of the landscape! Land and lines are horrible, even the smallest. inspiration (at least a movie similar to the thriller). Pelikan has a poe-related, superficial and child-friendly approach. The movie is very thin and not exciting. If you want to see the B-movie fun. Relaxing with your friends, then you can enjoy yourself (like me), but there's no way to take this film seriously!
