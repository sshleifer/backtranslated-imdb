So do not think renting in stores, because it's a bad movie. JJ Abrahams thought you'd write this movie. In essence, a rat cleans the toilet and in some way needs to be expelled again. The fans of "Shrek" can be absolutely horrible, but fans of "Wallace & Gromit" will probably be disgusting. Also why did not they make clay or clay? I mean, CGI animation ?? AARDMAN movie! !! Of course, Aardman stroked it while Dreamwork did everything. Wrong, wrong, wrong !!! The characters are almost everywhere, so it's a good idea for a bad movie. Everything in the movie DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I was sleeping almost bored watching this movie. No, wait, really, I watched this movie bored asleep. It's really awesome. But fortunately, it's not as bad as "Shrek."
