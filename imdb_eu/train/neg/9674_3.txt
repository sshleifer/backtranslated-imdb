This flick reminds me of really bad science fiction movies in the 50s and 60s. It is not terrifying or interesting, but it is dull, cheesy and stupid. Special effects are eager, all actors are playful and the end is just awful. Wasting your money, renting or buying something is better. I got it from 10 to 3.5 (I found it pretty funny for Indian sardine).
