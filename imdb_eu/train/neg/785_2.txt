The playful and inept movie is definitely the worst version of "Hamlet". Branagh's approach to material is plain; When Ophelia is depicted directly on the jacket, the Fortinbres army appears suddenly on the horizon ("Monty Python and the Holy Grail") when Francisco only shouts. The "Ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack" voiced before the Chicamore voice, and the crowds of Jimmy Cagney's Bottom and Mary Pickford Chase came to life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> /> In Edwardian, but at the same time he decided to use almost non-compressed text, so often, the dialogue rooted in the mentality of the monks is not in a context that is making sense. And Branagh does not worry about these wrinkled contexts, with the ambiguous character of Hamlet and Olphelia's relationship, as the spectator tries to treat ambiguity as a plain sex scene naked by bridesmaids. <br /> <br /> In a non-textured way, Branagh lets her leave her favorite movie hobby: Kenneth Branagh's other movie videos. This is never so evident as "How all the news happens" to me, as it ends in the first half of the thirty-second film (at least that feels like that). This tries to play with spectacular growth in Gone With lines. The wind "I will never be hungry". This may serve Branaghen, but it does not serve Shakespeare or the conversation: when I saw the movie in the theater, I bent over to my friend and I started shouting "Great times with Mr. Hamlet." Branagh retains the funniest and most enjoyable moment, when the effort to get out of Olivier's films was celebrated by Claudius' death. Hamlet jumped over the monarch from a tall tower to the king, with a sword coming in. Branagh's Dane King casts an apparent rapier in the palace through the heart of Claudius with the eyes of a superhero hero. At that moment, the only thing that was passionately madness saved was that it was so fun that it was so fun. <br /> <br /> This movie is sometimes considered as a serious tragedy. In fact, once the star-shaped show of a talented filmmaker has just passed his narcissism. The emperor has no clothes, and this Hamlet does not want to offer anything, but to see unexpected laughter and the incredible control of a man's creatures.
