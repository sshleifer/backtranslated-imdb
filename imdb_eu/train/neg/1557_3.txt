It's vital that the movie is a boring global channel, and it's not a real cultural cross. The semi-easterly journey is described in an annoying way: of course, mud brick villages, dirt tracks in the desert, women with black outfits and abdominal dancers. I wonder how camels and dates lacked the palms in the whole picture. The identity of the two main characters is very clumsy. Many situations are hardly credible. <br /> <br /> The original idea might be interesting, but if you're looking for a cultural vision, you should skip this movie.
