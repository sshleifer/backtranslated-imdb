Potter's awesome performance and a vanguard plot with no tension. And in terms of feminist controversy, it is not expected. When I discovered this landfill for the first time and I think it was very compelling I was glad to see it. That's why I immediately answered this question: "Ever worried the movie I ever saw?" Also, I have the comfort that all other films in my life will be better than The Tango Lesson. But I must admit that I was surprised by a script written by Potter for the granting of subsidies to the art council of the whole world (as in the closing credits). <br /> <br /> I saw Orlando very well recently, and I've seen Potter learned what he learned at this film. An exquisite range of dresses, the main women given by a few hard cameras, and a fascinated effort to fascinate the public cinema. So why would not the Tango Lesson escape with the nonsense of self-indulgent?
