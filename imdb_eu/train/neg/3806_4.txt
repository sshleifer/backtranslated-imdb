My wife and I thought this movie was a good, but not great, version of Manhattan Murder Mystery, a version of the television movie (BBC). The story has little voltage or chemical character, not plot. Woody Allen's character goes deep into his mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson do not have much to do. It's disgusting, I must say. Ian McShane's role will be revealed. <br /> <br /> It happened to me first and foremost, "I wonder how much BBC Woody Allen had to pay to get out of Manhattan?" He needed money and he needed his appeal to increase their audience beyond the drawing of two stars in the youth market. I give 4 stars to this movie on the 3rd because the background noise is pure. If you want something that you want to do while picking up stamps, you will sort the stamp collection. I would not pay to rent again.
