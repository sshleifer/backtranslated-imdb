In a distant planet, a spatial monk will be run by a psychopath. Many of them are released from prison and imprisoned in a prison. They are placed on a huge giant space that is passing through the orbit of a Supernova star. Large craftsmen live only three people, allegedly a film budget is not hired for many actors. However, to cut short a long story, the last three evil goodies end up cat and mouse in a game. <br /> <br /> The curious psychopath of this movie is annoying. In general, the word 'annoying' is not a term that would describe nonsense, imbalance, horrific, dangerous, but not "annoying," but that's it. Three people with a giant ship are not seriously believed to guarantee as many important roles they think - this ship is almost the size of the city! Considering that the film is about 50 years in the future, it is quite optimistic for human-made craftsmen, regardless of what they do for everyday tasks. Although the boat is a sizeable size, all crews have small outfits and small rooms and dining areas seem like a plastic table and chairs. But there are many corridors. <br /> <br /> The film works well and mostly works as a science-fiction thriller. But nothing great.
