"Houseboat Horror" is often the worst Australian film ever, and is often described as a movie slasher, described as a typical movie called "The Promo Award for the Oscars". When death is burning, they are trying to shoot a music video from a foreign lane on a remote lake. Slasher's just-played and typed lines make no sense of surprise and annoying characters. Certainly the pillow is divided in half. The layers of the throat are cut and a woman kills her. If you like cheese-making movies, you can try this, but warned you. At least, Sweden's "The Bleeder" is 10 better.
