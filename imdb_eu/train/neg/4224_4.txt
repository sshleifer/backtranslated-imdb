STAR RATING: ***** Works **** Just Mark the Misses *** Little ** Behind the Bottom * The Pits <br /> <br /> Forbid this effort to make Nick Park a beloved man and make a dog, The old Wallace is forced to fly to the moon without running out of cheese. <br /> <br /> The shortest feature is just 22 minutes, this W / G adventure is the first and it shows in some way. The plastic animation is a bit crisp and fun here, it reminds Mork about a little man in the box beneath the animation. <br /> <br /> It's worth the artwork behind it, I've never really wondered Wallace & Gromit (maybe a bit clean and traditional for someone of my generation). The only one I really enjoyed is The Wrong Trousers (which was younger and less aware, we would say, high-level lifestyles of life.) I was encouraged to actively search for this early effort due to the resurgence of the successful adaptation of the latest film. <br /> <br /> It was technically exciting in the first two (all things considered!) This is missing the emotional intelligence that the heirs have. That said, it's very fun as the first attempt, and definitely setting the standard for larger things. Two stars, but two good stars. **
