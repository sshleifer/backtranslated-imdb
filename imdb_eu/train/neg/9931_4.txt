"Black Angel" is a small whodunit. June Vincent strives to save her husband from the chair because he is guilty of an old friend. Dan Duryea (the wife of the murderer) helps Vincent find a real culprit. Peter Lorre has a suspicious role. This black film acts as a cheap programmer and does not achieve anything. It's pretty nice, but sometime it stops and the mystery solution is one of the "challenges" one of them. The latter could only fall into a movie, but it was not very good before it was done. Vincent is a bad hero and Duryea has never been very good for boys. I love noir films, but this was a real disappointment.
