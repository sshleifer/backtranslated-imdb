I watched this DVD (this is called CORRUPT in this format), and sketches on the streets have really overwhelmed Harvey Keitel's Frank character, Frank, so much like that "THRILLER OF THAT RELIGIOUS AND BIG PRINTING THRILLER" by BAD LIEUTENANT. "The carcass did not mention the old Italian movie, how old is Theo? When a character does not play a CD player, it will pop out a large plastic pancake, it puts it in the square squares, a kind of mechanical arm, which pancake thingy listens to. The point I see around the cinema is that the DVD case has not been thought of as a 20-year-old movie, as well as Italian films with poor production, such as many other Italian-American films, except Keitel's cast and Johnny Rotten's performance was awful, but it's static with cinematography and sound quality, thinking I was seeing a copy of a fourth-generation pirate (I do not know what a bad DVD or short film is, and the worst is Ennio Morricone's score. CORRUPT's music is not possible A man who made intrusive music in the midst of Clint Eastwood's wes who made the ternen music <br /> <br /> Everything is wonderful because CORRUPT has its moments. The biggest psycho thriller ever invented, but it has kept my interest, and as always, Keitel makes good results as the police force. It's just a shame, the rest of the films did not adapt to the high standards
