Well, I think "the emperor does not dress". I watched this show at PBS last night, I was glad and terrifying. I loved "Morse" (I bought a whole set of DVDs) and I felt that, I always liked Kevin Whatelyren Sgt. Lewis character, WS John Thaw show, deadline! After seeing the new "Inspector Lewis" (because it is billed here), I am sure, then, that I was right ... Whately is good (although it looks like scary (both older and too much fat), but it just does not have charisma to perform the show Thaw. <br /> <br /> And with regard to his "assistant" Fox, yes ... he might understand what the British reviewer might say, but I could not do the most. <br /> <br / > In regards to Andrea Innocent ... I can say that they lost James Grout. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say that they ought to have to leave "Morse" in peace.
