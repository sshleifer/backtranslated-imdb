A friend as a FEDS agent (I remember, as I speak), I cast as agent. Submitted to the DVD to see it. It was "interesting", but it felt like an amateur movie. An extremely amateur film. Really boring and poorly written. Without a doubt, it was very fun to participate and involve, but there was no doubt that there was no open comment. Maybe I would have enjoyed Omaha, but this girl from California was bored and honestly embarrassed by the involvement of my friend. <br /> <br /> If this filmmaker works out or does more, he really should try to have a really interesting story, and GOOD actors. I'm sure it was a great tool for learning. I'd like luck in the future and I hope to improve shooting.
