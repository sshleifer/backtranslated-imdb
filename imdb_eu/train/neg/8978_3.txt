If John Waters wrote and directed "The House of 1000 Strings", it would be something like "The Blood Shed", repeatedly tapping with a heavy object. It's very entertaining early in the middle of the first half, but then it's done on slippery and people doing genitalia, with electric chores, cutlery and alerts. Susan Adriens (Sno Cakes) is very annoying and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is just about anything in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about "The Blood Shed" is that most audiences do not have to forget a long time.
