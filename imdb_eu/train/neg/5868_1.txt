One of the worst films of all time. <br /> <br /> Low productive values, a terrifying story, a bad script, a dark drama ... and I can not say with an adjective that describes the correct verb. He is the director of Joan River. I know Hell is a special place for people who have financed the movie; prolly is located below the child's resistance against genocide. <br /> <br /> This movie is a train. <br /> <br /> (Terrible) x (infinite) = Rabbit Test. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, it's not fun too.
