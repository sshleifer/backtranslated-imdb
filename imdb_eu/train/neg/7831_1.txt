With MASTERS OF HORROR, NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES, it can be seen as an absolute nerve of the genre with only a helping hand with THE TWILIGHT ZONE and OUTER LIMITS. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the problem is that Adina does not make any interest to the public, it is aimed at TEN-YEAR-OLDS, just to be able to count on body bags and just about that. And, therefore, it is gross king, and King is obscenity. <br /> <br /> Stephen King is just illiterate ?? In general, he has the ability to tell stories by Bart Simpson. Since he can not read his unique inspiration, they are films. <br /> <br /> Actually, cinema is not a bad place to start, as it generally escaped the "realism" attack. But these movies are rumors, not the only thing, and if you want to write, you need to go deeper. <br /> <br /> Of course, PICKMAN only had monsters as well known. However, it should be clear that any vampire with no university is Drakula and Lugosi. <br /> <br /> At least AUTOPSY ROOM is a clear indicator of what is wrong. We can almost imagine that this pathetic dizziness was trying to get something out of his desk. <br /> <br /> No, keep in mind, trying to describe the exact horror of the system with an integral part. stupid stupid, but trying to bring a dreadful story to his little nephew. Let's say, you were paralyzed, and people started thinking about how you were dead and how you started opening up on those autopsies! Would not that be raw? And that, boy and girl, is the story. <br /> <br /> What is characterization? Yes, it's one of the suits, because he never appreciated life, you know, and now it's too late, right? And shouting? Well, they can not really hear, do you know? He says he will take the hospital to the trial, but there's no more shot, you see, I'm lying (or I can not remember) and everything. And he's thinking: Oh, please, do not split up and this is horrible (lying like that)? Now you would not have a wonderful story? You know you have read somewhere that the snake bite can do that. I think Agatha Christie was a great medical officer. What was the name of that snake again, a BOOMSLANG? It has a ring, no. <br /> <br /> Let's make PERUANA BOMSLANG! Sure, Steve, that's great? You have Afrikaans BOOMSLANG, moron! But, how can you say that the recipients are children and not just headache? It's easy: there's no sex. <br /> <br /> Well, there is, but it is the crack of a door to our parents' room. Modern filmmakers are very important in erotic aspects of the genre, monsters, victims, harassment. <br /> <br /> <br /> But unlike UNIVERSAL and LEWTON, they do not know what happens. Everything that is really left is laughing at the SM Club and fascist faith is that people with sexual preferences are themselves evil. <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Wray. Freddy Krueger has only killed. <br /> <br /> And that's why he's not really upset, should he torture him first? We do not understand how to illustrate it, because it would frustrate our pure sentiments. Therefore, fear and romanticism become unpleasant and psychopaths simulate. <br /> <br /> Our hero, you see, is a rubber fetish and you can not only get it if you know someone. know ?? rubber gloves And that's what they use in autopsies, and they know that, of course. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Of course, this is the author of his inspirational authority. It's a bad thing, it's been cut, maybe it's over the last year's whistle!
