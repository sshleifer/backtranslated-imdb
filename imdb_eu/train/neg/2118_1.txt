What can I say about seven kilos ... I saw it well in Tokyo flight in Seattle and the flight was long and the boring movie was no doubt. The character Will Smith Ben Thomas is almost completely impossible, even though he has finally recovered. The extra two-hour run of the movie has wasted most of the time on the screen, with random junk scams as slow as possible. In the defense of films, Rosario Dawson's character adds a bit of life to life, but not much. I do not understand how we can do someone weeping when I wanted to make these movies, to make the whole thing I wanted to do. Will Smith also ends with a medina to kill himself, proving that he is deadly murdering with a jellyfish.
