I saw SCARECROWS on the rumor around him. Well, I can not imagine that this movie is like it, because it's bad, it's bad. <br /> <br /> Those who did this movie do not know the horror thing. The whole story is a wedding that is not a two-genre: action movie (guns and criminals) and horror (dull life). When the criminals dogs are dying for lightning, two genres separate each other together, first they are criminals and who cares for criminals, and the second, because they are stupid criminals! Happy zombies does not work here. Where is that fear? The criminals wanted to die dreadful and painful deaths. <br /> <br /> But the story has been so constructed that this genre's marriage could have been managed by the originals, which they NEVER have. Simply, the super-intense criminals and the scarecrow are "alive", just because filmmakers thought it. To make things worse, cinema is a terrifying film (like television) and worse, the whole series of interviews are cited by the CB and we hear a constant conversation about images that seem to us constantly. a radio show. This part was really bad. The director had to instantly shoot the stupid ideas he was given! You can not tell how annoying it was. <br /> <br /> As I said, SCARECROWS's criminals are very stupid. For example, when someone suddenly reveals money and straw (straw), his wound is wide open, others ask: "What is the drug?" When they throw bullets they could not kill (the txorimalos were "zombiefied." Do not ask ...). Get a strange idea, the birds. I never saw giants in a movie. And then the girl is there. I wanted a scarecrow to kill him quickly, because he was suffering from an ass. When a father finds a scarecrow damaged by a "cross", he is pitying the criminals in a shameless scene (bad game), even if the criminals could not do it. What was it! But the birds are the weakest in this very weak film. They are not terrifying. Not many of them explain. This land device is a simple device on this plot device. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wesley shoots a scarecrow face for 30 hours and does not give her a scare. And that scene speaks in the fridge. Thank you laughter. <br /> <br /> In the end, I had to be the worst movie I've seen recently (and I've watched a lot of movies these days!). KILLER or SCARECROWS, I'd look again at SILO KILLER. Yes, SCARECROWS is bad.
