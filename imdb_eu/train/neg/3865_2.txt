This is very bad. Actors You can say that you can really harden, but we all know that you can not. Writing is so obvious and simple, it is sad to try to sell it. The mood and steps are so tired, it is hard to believe one of the best believers to do so. <br /> <br /> That said, it's so scary that it seems tough to look away from the screen. We only need to hear where this railroad is. But we caught it on television. If we paid that, we would be bored. <br /> <br /> So it gets 2 stars, at least to be fun and fascinate to be bad. And unexpected music (in the face of a hard-hitting Indie soundtrack) is reminded of a part of Scooby-Doo ... but not so good.
