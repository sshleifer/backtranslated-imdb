Dr. Seuss should be sure that he or she would be alive right now. Cat in the Hat proves how movie productions can take on a classic story and turn them into a huge goop pile. Mike Myers has a bad reputation in Cat Hat! Myers proves that he can not play this movie. It works like a prissy girl who shows thousands of tricks. The kids in this movie are pretty good, somewhere between the annoying lines. The story is similar to the original, like most movies based on both suggestions and other stories, it's never the same with the original story! What a malignant neighbor was a bad idea. It's a bad fool that he could never get anywhere in life. This movie is like a comic book that is not condemned by the newspaper, if you think about it. The movie is sure to look bad! You're sure to have a fun joke for adults, when the cat is cutting its tail, and when the censorship is turned off, it's a bit fun. At least Grinch had an agreement and the movie was really good! This movie is a cartoon piece with bright colors and a bad performance. Was Mike Myers the movie really? And another thing, fish. What is it with that stupid fish! For the first time you see, it's a real fish. When you see next, cheer up and speak. But it looks like an animated piece of rubber. This movie is totally destroyed. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised that jokes like water park jokes were good, that's fine. If you choose, see Grinch instead.
