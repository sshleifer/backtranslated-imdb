I thought that this film would be much better then. It was similar to spy genre, and it reminded me from the beginning of Pleasantvil, but this movie was short. <br /> <br /> The ground is ridiculous. In Russia, the KGB and the Soviet Union have begun a school of espionage to teach teachers how to play espionage, but the training country is a bit dated, so they take two yanks from the United States in different things. up. I do not know, but it seems that alone. It is very strange that all Russian people do not speak Russian accent. Someone got into the polls. <br /> <br /> It's also a dry comedy. There are two fun places to play, and they're not about singing and dancing. In the end, the movie will let you sleep. <br /> <br /> And as if it were punching on the face, this movie is so sick in the US. The film continues to reiterate, the US is God and Russia is the devil. This is the kind of Smoke campaign that was made against Japanese World War 2. Among them, the US is a film that thinks it's full. <br /> <br /> This gets 10 to 10. and I'm nice. In fact, one should get one, but the dance scene was fun, but it was too long to make it fun too.
