I bought this movie on the DVD so I could get a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode. Luckily, Mike, Crow and Tom Servo are watching, because the movie is not the same. There is a plot, even if there are some actors who can follow and act out a story, there is nothing else. The movie was so boring, but I never saw them again without Tom, Crow and Mike. As mentioned earlier, MST3K was better than the one shown in the previous section; Mitchell.
