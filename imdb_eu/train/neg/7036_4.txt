I do not spoil anything, I tell you a woman to see a sex with a goat in this movie. If that's your thing, then your movie has arrived. <br /> <br /> A woman and her husband will go to a retired sister in a family home where they live in the woods. She is a great lady to say, at least, to her sister, and it seems that interests beyond family love. On the one hand, there is a set of disruptive characters that begin with proclaiming pagan rituals of all kinds. <br /> <br /> The graphics are pretty weak and the characters are quite muted. His wife continues to her husband even when her husband starts to become a little girl and start hanging along with the pagans, even if they continue with sex. As for the exploitation of things, there are a lot of meat and there are some kinky couplings, but there is nothing better than anything else. O, and the scene of the said goat sex. <br /> <br /> Most viewers will not reach the end. The fans of exploitation will work, but they will want more. <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
