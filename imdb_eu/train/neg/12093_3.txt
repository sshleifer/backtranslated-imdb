Isabelle Huppert is a wonderful actress. The director of the film "La Pianiste" understands this, giving the viewer a long face at Huppert, which is nice. Huppert is not an animated actress. The emotion registers with the eyebrows or the slightest splendor of a smile. <br /> <br /> In addition to seeing the experienced actor in his career, there is nothing to recommend this movie. (Well, if you enjoy self-cuts, sado-masochisms and extravagant behaviors, "La Pianiste" would work with you, not only for these features but for recovering value.) <br /> <br /> This strange material is buried in the truth there is a nucleus The people who compete at the highest level - musically, athletic, whatever they are, start as strangers, and are unfamiliar with competitive environments. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary to travel to the movie theater to learn the lesson again. <br /> <br />
