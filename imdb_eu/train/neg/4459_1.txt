I do not say that because the value of production is so low that it was shot down. That girl's shot hair on the creek? Did we really have been sitting down the long film and watching it doing it for 5 minutes in the same place? It was horrible, lighting was just bad. You could hardly see anything and the characters talked about, it was almost impossible to say what they were saying. See full movie? Of course, I have not leaped from the majority and I have not heard anyone say I must first see the whole thing to judge. This film was so badly executed and executed, even by independent bass guides and small standards. An awesome movie ... it's not wasted if you want a good laugh at that time, but it's not so funny for actors as the lines, it's a bad production.
