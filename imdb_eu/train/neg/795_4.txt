When you see co-protagonists of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, you are expecting a good horror movie, but this was very different, just as I would describe it as science's first attempt at science fiction. The scientists Karloff and Lugosi play (Rukh and Benet, respectively) - partly the competitors, until Rukh won Benet, with a demonstration that demonstrates his excellent theory. Science was here, it means at least a bit around the edges (so science fiction, fiction), but somehow Rukh Andromeda allows this type of rays to look at the ground "billion billion a few years ago." In the previous historical period, the horrible meteorite was dropped to Africa, leaving scientists with deposits of substances called "Radium X". That heals and destroys them. Much of the movie is bored in Africa, which Rukh eventually finds and picks up, which unfortunately generates a great weapon, unfortunately infects himself with this disease with some sort of illness. <br /> <br /> Both Karloff and Lugosi are pretty good here. Lugosi plays a role in the role of the guy, although, clearly, it was not compelling to me, especially in scenes from Africa. The story was a little too, and although he kept his attention, he did not fascinate me. It's a science fiction, rather than a horror movie, and as this science fiction was at the very beginning, I think it's a bit cut-out. It was OK - nothing more, but less than anything else. 4/10
