In any case, a woman who works with a scientist puts round metallic balls in their minds that change people's minds, but in reality they make these attacks into zombie-like killers. The white and hidden young women "Cobaya" in the experiment are in desperate need of teaching interpretation. This movie is horrible, horrible and bad. It does not have a lot of logging on the scripts. You will continue to experience problems. It has no special effects. A computer screen that represents a great scientific breakthrough looks like an Atari screen. And even worse, he felt a puppet with confusing hair (like a lonely boy in summer camps) named George, Jessica's trustee of a personal servant ("main actor"). Throughout the movie you will depend on the stupid and sophisticated suggestions of this puppet. But wait ... we bring together softcore, unerotic and almost nude scenes with some girls with some bars. In the meantime, an annoying soundtrack is considered in the background, as has happened in some spiritual discoveries. One of the cast is not good either. There are different levels. Gore and "horror" parties are not particularly filming. It seems that a teenage movie has put together. It's no coincidence that Henry Sala, a director named but not a commercial, made another movie. I almost got bored, almost stupid, nonsense, seeing the chorizo! And how is it finished? What happened You know hide my secret for me, because I can not understand it for the rest of my life. I know they've lost their time to watch that garbage, because it was a bored nightmare on my weekend!
