I think it's an effort to leave behind Vermont with John Rambo and his life. This series is aging and Rambo is no longer a loner, but a cold blood killer. It's been time for somebody to die on the screen. Vietnam was not a fun place and, in any case, Hollywood is tired of me. This is not the worst movie about Vietnam, he is the successor to John Waynes Green Boets. In any case, John Rambo brought him around a 50-gun gun with more than half of the Viet Cong Cong army and a large number of Russians. Worse is Rambos' speech at the end ... Please! Yes, I have heard that they are doing something else ...
