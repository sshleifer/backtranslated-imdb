I watched this movie in New York. The next day I was waiting for a bus, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. He was spotting and he did not want to wait for PORT AUTHORY. So I went through the street and saw the worst film in my life. It was so bad, I saw the entire movie and I chose it. I have not seen anything yet. It's been 69 years ago, so he called me crazy. I stopped because I can not believe it alone .........
