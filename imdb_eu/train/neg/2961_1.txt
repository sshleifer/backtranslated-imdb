One night I looked after a family of three children, and my mother gave me this to show up on Wal-Mart's week before. All three children were physically ill in that observation. I'm sure it was a pizza that was eaten, or something taken from school, but it could really be this movie. Totally annoying. Someone can take the production of these rude ones for me. Fortunately, I turned off the movie when I noticed that the kids did not respond and when I was surprisingly active. For parents who are there, I strongly recommend that you watch your children watch the movie.
