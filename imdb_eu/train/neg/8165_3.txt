It's a fantasy story. It's a story of cannibalism. It's a story of revenge. It's a very bad film with great violence. I think I have never seen that the slasher movie is the cheapest. The usual place is isolated, wonderful campers, to the desert. Yes, there are pretty lively scenes. It's very sad Bad edition and full work. There are ghosts for children talking in a litter bin. I am not sure that ghosts and psychos play with the toy. In addition, a man eats a piece of meat that has left his wife's food. A friend of mine asked me why it was necessary to give it free sick violence. I am afraid that our evolution is just another step in the unexpected. Three are not here intelligent, there is no language in cheeks, only a sad waste of time. Lots of blood; little plot
