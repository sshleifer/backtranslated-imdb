I rarely give a good comment on a movie or movie that I do not like, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is horrible, horrible. <br /> <br /> I would not have had any such an animated series I'd better understand, but as a live action, it indicates 'cursi' and 'campy' terms. Power Rangers. Multi-colored 5 spandex teens fight against teens using their martial arts abilities. The costumes are awful; Apparently, athletes and gymnastics remember what they would like to wear. The play is shy, and the choreography of the battle is so bad and, therefore, it is a sharp sight, Jean-Claude Van Damme, who looks like Bruce Lee, that is to say, to himself inadvertently. They denounce that they are dancing; like a version, a 'trencher', or ballet making, rather than fighting. In addition, there are cartoons that are prominent in martial arts, yet it is done in a stupid and entertaining way, it seems stupid. <br /> <br /> Children show or not, that is, on the edge of such holes and nonsense. And although this version is set in America, you can think of seeing some internal fighting sequences in the U.S. not filmed, but in Japan; Thus, the "fake" battle and footage was borrowed from the Japanese version only to be placed next to the US version. <br /> <br /> If you like this type of thing, then a stick with the Sentai-Japanese equivalent.
