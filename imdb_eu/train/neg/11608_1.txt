When this man can make a movie, I'm sure I can do one too. <br /> <br /> Actually, when I hire to make a movie for you, I promise to do it: <br /> <br /> 1) I will add more naked women. This movie was not there. I think B-class horror movies are only rented for the traditional exploitation of the female body. I would not want to let my audience go down. <br /> <br /> 2) I do not know too much about the scene when the hero wakes up to find out that it is only a dream. I think HorrorVision about these 4 scenes. And considering that the movie was only an hour long, the dream movie was quite a bit long. If I decide to make a dream sequence, I will assure myself that I'm going to wake up without a roommate. I mean, when you wear a leather pants <br /> <br /> <br /> 3) I do not mess up all the movies like Star Wars or Matrix, because my budget is small and I do not want to know what my mask is. I despised Hollywood films in high budget by adding satirical references to them. <br /> <br /> 4) And finally, I do not mix modern technologies with the undead. I mean, that a palm-rider might be so scary ... at least, they would become rolly polly monster, or something that started before the screens began. <br /> <br /> So, if you're looking for the qualities above-mentioned horror production with me: wanna-b-movie director extraordinaire.
