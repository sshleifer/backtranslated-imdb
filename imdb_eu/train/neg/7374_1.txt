This is definitely the worst movie ever made by Steven Seagal. And that says a lot. Do not be fooled by the ratings, it's a great way. This malady was not worth a score of 0/10, if appropriate. <br /> <br /> - Any kind of plot <br /> <br /> - The worst case of action ever, and not many of them <br /> <br /> - Seagal does not do anything, fight, talk (a lot of duplication), etc. As always. <br /> <br /> - Seagal is fat, lazy and it does not matter less about this movie. Clearly something that is obvious <br /> <br /> Take all the garbage DTV movies that Seagal has done, bind each other together, multiply it by a thousand billion, and then all the evil that you will gain. t also describes the absolute crapfest% 1.
