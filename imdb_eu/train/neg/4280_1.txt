This should help with a special warning and warning: NOT RECOMMENDED PEOPLE TO STANDARD. <br /> <br /> Daneliuce's nightmare with dirty limbs becomes a true nightmare. Also, it is obvious that the man is misantrous, he hates everyone - his country, his country, his actors, his work. Hatred blinds and forgets his trademark that he knew a long time ago. <br /> <br /> The so-called "cinema" is nothing more than a horrible picture chain, without any artistic value or professional knowledge. It's an insulted, good-natured, sense of humor. Pity, shame, shame!
