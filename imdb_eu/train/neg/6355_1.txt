I could not wait to watch the movie. About the middle of the movie, I could not wait to finish. Actors (whites) delivered the lines as Woody Allen said: "Say this ..." Then, they said their lines on the screen as they wanted to imitate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know how Will Ferrell really speaks and does not say Mr. Talk to Stum as with Allen. The part of the comedy in this movie was as boring as the tragedy and never was fun or fun ever. I must admit I have never been the most important fan of Woody Allen, and this definitive movie has not become me. I think his writing was as bad as the direction. This movie has fallen as the worst film I have ever seen.
