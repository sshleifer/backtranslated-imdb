I am glad to have a movie in Berlin in Berlin. But after the presentation I was totally disappointed and annoyed. Too much, too much time, too much substance. The Spanish Civil War, like all the wars, was enormous. Revenge, a very human behavior, not quite beautiful, is shown in various films and plays, as well as homosexual relations and skepticism about Catholicism in Spain. But what Villaronga tries, the worst tragedy that is the worst case of the movie. It's really grieving to watch the movie Angela Molina. I do not even tell anyone to watch this movie.
