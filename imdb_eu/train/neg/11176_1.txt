I watched this movie in the early preview and I could not stress it was this movie. From the beginning, the audiences wept for the great accent of the Pacino south. Poor Al looks really, really higard, and I can not decide whether this was intentionally part of the addicted role of a drug addict, or maybe he just did not sleep before the set came. Much worse than the Pacino agreements, however, the excuse of a plot is woeful. At the beginning of the film, we can say that Pacino's character is gay, and I suspect that this was originally conceived by screenwriters. Later on, however, we suppose that our credibility is suspended and we believe that Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both riding around) are older than men, who face a remarkable man who looks fertile. In general, the worst part was the main plot, with a corporate spying that is never fully explained, and we have never been responsible. Due to an anticipation, I will reserve my final judgment because of the possibility of re-shooting and editing, but I bet I do not pay a percentage to see it at theaters.
