If you saw Sholay in 1975, do not watch the movie. If you saw Sholay EZ in 1975, go to WATCH IT. But do not miss this movie. This film has all the ingredients that could be mistaken for making a remake of Sholay. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the role of a psycho psycho (probably 40 minutes not to be burnt only). If you remove the rest of the movie and only watch the amitabh character, it still deserves a watch. But as an Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not direct his talents. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is very up to date and I think that the only reason Prashant Raj has thrown Raj's role is because his young days have a great resemblance to Amitabh. Sushmita Sen has been thankful for her. However, the "best performances and all the non-performing arts" awards must go with Nisha Kothari. It gets a different level of playing at this level, although high schools exceed their performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a deadly enemy, take it to this movie. :)
