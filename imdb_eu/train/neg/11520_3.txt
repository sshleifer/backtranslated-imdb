I did not enjoy this movie. On the one hand, I found it plain and ordinary, for no reason. I know also misogynistic (against women). The movie does not seem to be anything, and I do not like to find characters. It really seems that there must be no point. I miss something, but for me, this movie is a lot less time when I can do something more productive and more enjoyable. When I use my face as a pin cushion. James Garner is this thing, such as C. Thompson Howell and Shirley Jones, and James Cromwell.all is wasted and I'm sure. That is, there was a bass in each of their careers. There is also a movie by Jennile Harrison (the last three of the Company's), and it's nice to see it in its non-fun role. I'm rising above the scripts. Tank is 3/10
