Well, the remake finally came to London last night, unintentionally, horny, unmarried, and without humor. I do not know where to start, while I was entertained with that strange tribute, it did not really move me. The play is a sammy cry, there is no original music, there are too many "Disney" costumes. After "Crashing Six Months" by Nik Cage, it's ridiculous. With Bear's Cage, the viewers were happy with the comedy that puzzled a series of "nasty" comics on the island. It's a strange reproduction, I believe I'm very convinced, the comic strip reminded me of something made in the 80s, just as curious as the interpretation of the Hollywood Strike's Hollywood!
