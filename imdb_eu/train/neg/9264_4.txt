The character created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (as well as producers) is a minor character created by Gene (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). The little girl Delia is taken from a convent. He was elected to the congressional Gene York and led the finance committee. In the meantime, Delia seems to be around when death is incomprehensible. It generates great risks when it comes to metaphysical reasons, because it destroys numerology, therapy, healing tips, yoga, tarot, etc. Karen York hires a private eye (Michael Lerner) to investigate strange and extravagant events. <br /> <br /> This television show shows emotions, ice cream, horrible events and a massive murder. Damien, for example, in Damien, seems to have filmed a disturbing murder in a few minutes in the event of massive killings. The main illusion is the observation of new and innocent victims that have special effects. In addition, middle-class actors, such as Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser, and Faye Grant and Michael Woods, have been a captain of the army. As always, a magnificent musical score from the great Omen I and III Jerry Goldsmith. The film is only for hardcore followers, Omen saga. Photo by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard. Previous and much better are: Richard Donner's "Omen" (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick) superb original pieces; Don Damien 'Damien' (William Holden, Lee Grant); "The Last Conflict" (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow), by Grahame Baker. Rating: Average below.
