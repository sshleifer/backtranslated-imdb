He had all the clich√©s of this type of film and no substance. The Earth is nowhere near the end of the movie and I felt the viewpoint. Production was good; However, the script and the performance were the B-movie quality. The casting was bad, because the good actors were mixed with raw actors. Good actors did not hold or even raise others. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth more words, but I will say more to fill ten minimum line requirements. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr., play cartoons in other films. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for innocent training, I still do not recommend this film.
