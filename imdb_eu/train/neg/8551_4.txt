In 1982, the siege of the Iranian embassy was two years ago, the drama of dramatic balcony SAS, and the war with the Falkland Islands, which is now better than a Gung-Ho "SAS" film. He creates an Iranian siege of kidnapping, using Britains Number One hero of the day. Got Edward Woodward and other famous actors and did you win? ... Well, maybe not! The film itself does not aggravate the situation, while the play is secondary. It's like a passage of a long-running "Professionals", but without a formula. This film is nowhere fast and very predictable. Cubby Brocoli may have watched this movie and Lewis Collins decided to make a change as Roger Moore Moore's James Bond. Look at the general fan of Lewis Collins or SAS pages, save your time.
