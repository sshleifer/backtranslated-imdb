Pet Semitary, a horror movie of the 80's, with a brilliant director and atmosphere, is a copy of the Italian ZEDER by Pupi Avat√≠. It's clear that Stephen King has almost completely copied all the ideas of the director (Zeder films made his own King's book before) <br /> <br /> Cat, on the floor, everything has been copied, this is a case of plagiarism. But Stephen Kind is a well-known American writer, it's totally normal for him not to have it, with a quintessential quote for Italian (and, to a lesser extent, crap-like). ) But the original idea, I repeat, is Avati's Italian director <br /> <br /> Let the world know
