I flee from this movie, thinking it could be much better. An extreme, hard-hitting fight for an extreme survivor, he is supposed to be a documentary from National Geographic with the sale of the Columbi sports. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Brian (Jared Rushton). to prepare to travel his plane to see his plane. Mum bravely gives her a gift of a knit as a gift (what's up with Rubik's cube?), She needs little, she needs it soon. Once in the air, the pilot of the aircraft (Ned Beatty will blink and crash) can withstand the heart without entering into the airliner's plane. It's very lucky to go swimming (or, in other words, swim) to find Brian's shelter, food and rescue hope. <br /> <br /> Here is where the main problem of the movie begins. For Brian's loneliness, Jared has very little talk; Therefore, the film should offset the tensions of each scene. Instead, it shows around walking around, sitting around, etc., the risk is minimal. As a result, excessive reliability is a mixed marriage of parents' parents as a source of tension. These scenes are on the way and they do not add too much story. Even worse, occasionally Jared ?? His face covered with mud - With the "Predator" he creates unlucky coincidences with primal screams. Lamentably speaking of our souls, he helped us keep warm at night. <br /> <br /> Another disappointment is as Pamela Sue Martin is as completely effective as her mother. Both parents have little impact on the film. For example, we have never shown how Brian's disappearance reacts, how to organize rescue attempts, and so on. The filmmakers did nothing more than explore the source of the voltage instead of spending so much time on Brian's events before his departure.
