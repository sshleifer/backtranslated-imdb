I see this movie in order to find a nice and interesting story, but the story is not good. The cast was not better. <br /> <br /> Obviously Shahrukh Khan was still there, but it was not enough to make this movie "compelling" and interesting. <br /> <br /> I read that film Flaubert "Madame Bovary" was a novel, but I did not see myself in the Indian mind. <br /> <br /> In general, we dreamed and filmed the movie. good time, not to lose our time and change our mood worse. I just can not understand how a "high" vote is achieved by an average of 6.8 / 10. <br /> <br /> So, it's a kind of movie to escape, and because there's no need to ignore it because there's nothing for it. in it! You just missed a "dark movie" "story that is strange and not meaningful."
