This movie is totally awesome. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story does not exist, the characters are full of stereotypes and you only laugh at Special-FX. Apart from this movie, Rapio Coolio's invitation is as an official police officer. <br /> <br /> This movie was not a comedy. If you want to watch this movie: first get drunk and then get some good laughs ... especially when the first Special Screen appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> But if you want to make trash movies cheaper, this movie is essential for you.
