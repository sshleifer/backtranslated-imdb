Simply, the twin is a movie about a twin woman who is worried about her sister at home. Then he returns home to find everything, he is not right, and find out about what happened to his sister and why he should know it. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing that works, but it's not quite. I can not really pinpoint why it did not work, but it was good enough I would prefer it to be better or at least get small things, Do you have flashbacks with girls that play twins, have a closer size? I think maybe that's wrong with things wrong.
