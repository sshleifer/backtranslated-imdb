I would enjoy this movie, but Van Damme does the same old old garbage. Poo knickers usually fight for scenes. The guilty people were usually killed at the end without losing this loser. This movie is very doggy, if you make the highest nature, please, please, Van Damme, you need to get some acting lessons. Van Damme is capable of anyone who likes it. It seems sad to say that Van Damme's only way to get into the theater is to write a movie, he produces a movie and makes a movie screen. Avoid VAN DAMME AND CLOSE IT BACK NASTY WIG. This movie gives me two out of ten, because it was better for a sandman. To add insult to the injury, I lost some loss to this waste
