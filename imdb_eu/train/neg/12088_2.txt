I have read reviews of this movie and, in general, I found it pretty good, so I saw it. I am a great lover of film and movie arts, but I think that this is another case because the critic turns something into something "art" or "intellectual". I will be compassionate: I never wanted to have sex scenes. Of course, the piano teacher has great psychological problems, but I did not want to see it graphically. The movie is basically annoying. I mean, when I saw a dream for Requiem, I was proud of the final scene with Jennifer Connelly, but this was not so much about the disgust and madness that I felt during this movie.
