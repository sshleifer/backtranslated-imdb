Since its publication in 1983, "A Christmas Story", counting on the story of his Jean-Shepherd-alter, Ralphie has become a true classical. "My Summer Story", however, still has a Shepherd narrator, but it does not charm, and the characters are not the quality of the original film. <br /> <br /> "My summer story" The minimal and most common stories are not very interesting, that is, neighborhood neighborhoods and fights. Charles Grodin, as I usually like, is very difficult in father's father's role (which Darren McGavin originally manages), and his character is never enough. Kiernan Culkin Ralphi is a bad representative and his younger brother is forgotten here. It seems that mum only deserves it here, and maybe the film director protects the sauce with a boat, luck is moving away from the dark housewives "in the night of free dishes." <br /> <br /> This story is mostly untraceable. It invites you to be pleasant but, as a sequel to "A Christmas Story", it's very poor and it's not worth the time for most people. 10 to 10
