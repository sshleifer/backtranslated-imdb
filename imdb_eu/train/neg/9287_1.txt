WOW! Why would they ever make a movie contest? Half Past Dead was a bad movie, but at least what he wanted was an idea. HPD2 does not know what it wants to be. It just does not exist on the screen, I can not explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is Twitch (played in Kurupt Tha Dogg Pound) to another prison and there is a box filled with golden bricks on it. In prison, a rebellion breaks a prisoner. One of them is shot by a man named Cortez and Cortez escapes. At a visit to Conjugal, Twitch's fianc√©e and Burke (Bill Goldberg) are kidnapped by Cortez and run in a rush room. Burke involuntarily twitch his friends and eventually get into trouble by idiocy inmates, to find out about their beloved Cortez. <br /> <br /> Review: Universal Soldier: Return from this unnecessary sequel. The script is horrible, the play is awful, the conversation is a joke, and every person in this movie is caricature. Look, I know it was a low-budget movie, but there's no excuse for what they do not do. Nobody in "Film" believes in the characters they play. No One "as an actor, Kurupt should be ashamed of himself." Twitch's character is an almost-renowned puppet-minstrel, most often put on by Burke or other prisoners. Bill Goldberg goes through the film all the time as if he were to take a PHD (giant dump). Fight scenes in choreography and pathetically bad, and action movie HPD2 is quite boring, even if the action happens! Let's not let anyone tell you that this film is quite honest, and it gets rotten and people with Follywood scorn the main reason.
