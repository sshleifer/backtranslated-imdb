I went to this movie to believe in good reviews. First, it is ridiculous to release a film produced in 2001, in India seven years later. The movie is dated. In 2001, it was also a film-based quote. It seems a scene that a taxi can work on how to make a low budget man. Anthony Hopkins does not know what he is doing in the movie. It's a long ending monologue. If the movies were sparkling during this scene, I lost my seat when I slept. Jennifer Love Hewitt is nothing like the devil. She wears clothes and clothes in a bad and bad fashion. As for Alec Baldwin, the scene that goes to Webster for the first time will not be lost. What a loss of money! As Anthony Hopkins has invented, "Go back home and write better!"
