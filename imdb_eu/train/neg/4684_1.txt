This movie is an insult to all attackers. He was stupid The monkeys seem to have written. The play was absurd. If most people have an Armada point of view, I will cry for our defense. This movie was horrible. Under the sea below, I put under the below films. Gene Hackman really needed the rent he had to rent. Denzel Washington was very important. The plot is a bit wise. And the end. Is a mutilator paying his crime? Hollywood would only think this junk. If you have not yet figured out, I did not like it. And if it were not for all the comments, I would not worry about posting.
