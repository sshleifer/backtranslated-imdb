This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Slow, boring, not terrifying, it's not fun, not dramatic, or entertaining. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar was frightened and shocked by her old story. He could not sell his character, nor anybody else. <br /> <br /> That Grudge was "good", do not miss this unless you lose your waste. time and your life. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie free of charge, so I do not want to meet a man who has missed out on a nonsense that lost 8 times. It was free, it still sucked, I hated it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
