Now, it would be a bit of a topic that I started with about the title, so I'll wait. First of all, this movie asked me why children made stupid things in laboratories and broke their bottles. Then I realized, that is, it is a movie with a message, that message is beat to kids and such things will not happen. Things you like? Insecticide is growing like a giant monster, causing a bit of a cause, before the "kill monster indirectly" before it is dead. Now, according to the prescribed ... Blue Monkey ... does not have any blue, no Simiani. Now, as I have deceived or something like it is. The cover image was still in search of some bugs / crab / idiots / idiots giant nurse. That happened, but I wanted monkeys! We recently enjoyed a few nights before (Cask and Cream brandy drank half drunk), I ran away with a monkey with more than 80 styles. Not so much If you like snow boarding or you like blue, this movie is not for you. If you want good and good reasons for kids, rent this.
