As you look at this movie, it's horrible. <br /> <br /> If you watch horror mode, monsters are a cunning movie with puppets right. <br /> <br /> If you look at comedy mode, you will see the flat part of the humor and it's just lama. <br /> <br /> If you are a romance, you wonder why he would stay with that guy. ** ch! <br /> <br /> If you look at the action, you can not really pull the noisy hero. <br /> <br /> <br /> As you can see, the movie is not delivered. remotely entertaining As they say, monsters are obvious puppets and this movie was another attempt at a Gremlins movie. However, we have the most beautiful monsters in this genre. Critters seemed pretty good, but Ghoulies looked better at the munchy puppets. The characters in this movie are not very difficult. Heroine is a roguish guardian, her girlfriend always complains about having a friend who has a military man and another has complained about her spouse. At the moment, the heroine and the military are fighting with the cracks ... the movie is completely stupid. I like the scene in a horrible star of the club (of course, it's not a club, but surely a dinner) and heroes say the server 21 will not give 21 years. Give me a break, I'm 25 years old and I look younger than anyone.
