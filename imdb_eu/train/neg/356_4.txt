The shapes of the movie are suspense shocker. There are surprises, turns and turns, vice versa and excitement. Sometimes this is actually a "seat" movie. But he condemns him, and he condemns them. <br /> <br /> The bad part is not incredible; its nature is not together. I refuse to "ruin" the movie, but I would say that the character we know at the beginning will be the end. <br /> <br /> The second disappointment of the film is great - Finally, it turns into a bloody slasher movie. There is a qualitative difference between "Friday 13". Not all films are absolutely dazzling, but this film is sometimes drip. <br /> <br /> Even though Sean Connery is not a fan of the movie, it's not about usual habits, and it often only seems to go a long way.
