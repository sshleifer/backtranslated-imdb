This Vulpine Massacre movie should be a real title. And you should read the line label "GUARANTEED FOR YOUR CHILDREN'S BABIES!" In the remote region, the fox is a nature drama that tells the story of a wild family. The two foxes begin to gather and match and the birth of a large family and their attempts to gather them. Only one word is said to be in the narration of a tree next to a tree, to discover the love and life of animals ... A beautiful landscape of life and a beautiful animal animation. Does it look good? From there, things go straight to the hell and then drill into the nucleus ... <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers below - Or it might be warned! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But it seems to be good enough and it helps to keep the cheerful music cheerful ... And then he dies ... Then we have an advent of siblings. And then he dies ... A sister gets her screen time ... and then dies ... And so slasher is like a horrible movie, after the fox, another one dies by nature, the traps just rise and disappear, And even a bunch of snowmobiles! At the end of the film, the foxes have almost been massacred. However, fortunately death does not appear on the screen. (At least we did not see it in the version.) Unlike "Tarka the Otter", the deaths of this movie are almost all surprising and sadistic to build hopes and then expel them. One or two laps would be acceptable. It's a nature film, after all. But it's not the whole family. <br /> <br /> Do not go to see this movie that has tricked the movie. Take a look at that with some outlook, things will not go well, and you or your children are feeling very bad for you or your sensitivity. You can enjoy it Or maybe not ...
