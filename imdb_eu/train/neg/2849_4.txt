This film and some of the 'Last Minute' comparisons, but 'Chasers' is a bit of a stretch of Interstate Highway in Texas. And as a landscape of the desert, there is nothing to distinguish a lot from it, since it is not a prisoner that a woman is also transporting in the two navy. No one cast well; It's not surprising that this writing. Dennis Hopper, the director, does not give much space to write their memories, I do not think so.
