It's hard to imagine what happened to Per Kristensen and Morten Lindberg's head from "Gayniggers from Outer Space" - the movie is billed as a comedy, but there's no real joke about the bad names of characters (B. Dick Dick Sgt. Shaved Balls). The rest of the movie (presumably) with voice-over synchronization (unbelievably) is fun ("actors", especially without feeling the lines they read), a screen and plot full of spelling mistakes in the "futuristic" computer screen. it almost does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Although 65% of viewers have given 10 movies to 10 films, what good is what the good film is. It is possible to see ENTERTAINING with some friends, but this film is worth a few out of ten ... Some writers, like some blacks, got a little more than just a score. star in this movie.
