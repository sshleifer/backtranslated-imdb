I am angry with the modern adaptations of Shakespeare, if the director can not use it or update it. If you use them in updates that are updated through current words, XX. Or XXI. It is set for centuries, although it can work well with the different styles; For example, Trevor Nunn's twelfth night settles late in Victorian. If it were set in the 30s, songs and dances and shakespearean texts would be much less. Unfortunately, although the show is very enjoyable, it is quite trivial. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Branagh. I agree that it is too old to play a student, but more importantly, it is a Shakespeare-based actress, despite all the efforts of another student, shows the strength of the performance all the time. Of course, the King should play it, there is no problem being a King King student surrounded by young students. On the contrary, in the matter of the King, we acted as a pleasant but clear actress, so it is a reference without a name. <br /> <br /> I have found the song and dance that I found pleasantly pleasing songs and dancing, unfortunately, Shakespeare's great interview was cut out. So the whole thing is full and fluid, and I'm very bored, including comic turns, and it was happy to finish. Branagh has not made Shakespeare's justice in this production. <br /> <br /> However, Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan have won prizes, as brilliant as they were.
