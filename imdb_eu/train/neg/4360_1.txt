First of all, let's say let me think about writing a comment for this movie. The best revision of this kind of film can be silence. Movies directed by housewives and grandmothers. This movie tries to be "real" and the characters should be "real people". An Italian can never think that the characters are "real": they are just "low-level" stereotypes. It's a very wrong life in the Italian landscape. The plot is weak (on the plot? Which plot?) And the mood does not laugh at anyone over the age of 12.
