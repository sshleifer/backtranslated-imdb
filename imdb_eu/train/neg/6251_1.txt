I only stayed for the first twenty minutes of this low budget movie. The most awful nonsense that Americans from a North Korean POW camp suffer from severe food and medicine, without bath, in a humble, rugged park, sleep in empty floors and - let's not forget. Permanent torture: They always get their hair done adorned with hair sports. Unlike the brave Armor-only Harry Morgan, quiz and acting is awesome. Ronald Regan can not portray a single character and create a scandal schematic for the past roles. They were portrayed officers of the North Korean champions, most of which could be cast out of the Caucasus. But supposedly Russian officers were advisers to Korean, wearing a Nazi anti-virgin uniform (he recycled the costumes of the Second World War). To speak with the accents of the general Burkhalter of Hogan's Heroes, that's just six stupid types. Do not miss this time.
