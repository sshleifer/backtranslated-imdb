As I was originally from Puertorique, I confused the requirements of this "documentary". First of all, Mrs. Perez compared to Mr. Campos with Che Guevarra. In fact, sir, sir. John Leguzaimo is not the origin of Puertorrikoa. His parents were from Columbias. There were not very specific investigations around it. I think the future of our race is education. This message could have been sworn in during this film, Education is our path to freedom and power. I think that the future efforts of this production team would have all their focus.
