This is the latest time I've rented the video without going into IMDB reviews. Steven Soderbergh directs Limey, who has written a horrible Nightwatch, with Ewan MacGregor and Out of Sight with anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a good actress and it is shameful to make a bad movie. It often confuses the editing for the final decision, which is the feature, the story, the filming and the simple sense. This movie is wrong. What did they think?
