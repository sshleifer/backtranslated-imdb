I will keep this as short as possible, since the aforementioned piece is hardly mentioned. ZOMBIE 90 is the worst film ever made. There, with another huge zombie entry called "ZOMBIE DOOM" from Schnaas (VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films drain very bad, they must shoot all those who participate in their creation. I sat down by ZOMBIE DOOM (almost no ...) but ZOMBIE 90 is so inept - even if compared to the horrible movie of Schnaas, I had to go through all the first 10 minutes. CERO acting skills, gore inept, camera camera style, ridiculous duplication ... continues. I can not find a single thing that swaps about this garbage; and I can usually retrieve any movie on ASTE CHANGE. Actually, it is one of the worst movies ever made. You were notified ... 1/10
