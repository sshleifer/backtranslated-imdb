Mandatory ridiculous movie version literature "Moby Dick" classical. John Barrymore is the captain of Ahab, in love with her daughter Joan Bennett. Her brother Derek is the mistress of Mrs. Bennett. When Mr. Barrymore loses his whale into an event, Bennett refuses. He must kill the whale and win Bennett ... <br /> <br /> The 1930s theater scene would have seduced many scenes; above all, scenes about Barrymor's losing leg. However, the movie does not live well; The movies of that era are much better, both the silent 1920s and the 1930s debates. Both John Barrymore and Joan Bennett are not attractive. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (30/08/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
