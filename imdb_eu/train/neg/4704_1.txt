It was a bad attempt at a backpack. At least, the back cover was good music. <br /> <br /> This is really a sad case of Hollywood nepotism. Hollywood directors, musicians and bad makers create "poopie" shows to make their children a protagonist. Oh, please! Potty humor was also bad. I hate this thing when talented kids (musicians, actors, and artists) throw their legs in order to be successful and that's why it's coming. <br /> <br /> Help all !! Why was not Gene Simmons? Ameriac's taste for entertainment is getting worse.
