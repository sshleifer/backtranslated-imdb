"Carlton-Browne Of the F.O." The main reason that they keep watching. Peter Sellers is the second billed role. But watching Peter Sellers this movie is a mistake. <br /> <br /> Sellers play amphiboles, Gaillardia, the first British colony of the dirty-poor island's national prime minister, now a lot of Russian. Drilling during the Cold War. Amphibols want the interests of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to play against each other for easy gains, "very nice and under our table all our cards." The main character of Terry-Thomas is that Britain's lazy diplomat loves Gaillardia to not forget Great Britain to show off reverse appearances. <br /> <br /> The positive review says: "This film is a movie, because the average is considered to be a bit of comedy." "I would say that the" Carlton-Browne "is below the average because the comedy does not exist. The first opening of the film's first two advantages, Terry-Thomas is genuinely wicked. and in the shocking score of John Addison, things slow down slow crashes and bad jokes. Carlton's-Browne awakens the death of the chief and the darkness of Gaillardi (nobody can find on the map). As the island arrives (after airsick jokes), the expectations are quite small. <br /> <br /> They're still very tall. In Latin America or on the Mediterranean island it seems that the island itself is so pathetic that it eliminates the famous airline of its airport, and the review stands parades the parade. Apparently, the army is still drawn on horseback by a thick accent that says a joke: "During the war, the army uses a lot of horses." <br /> <br /> Sellers never take center stage "on the island of his character. The plot replaces Ian Bann instead of Loris, the throne that inherits after his father's murder. Bannen is sad as well as written. Normally, this would mean that Sellers would be the main target of robbery, but with a thick accent and trapped behind a greasy mustache, Sellers would be happier if we remember this year in the other two films of that year. "Mouse That Roared" and "I'm all right, jack "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Film on this film like "Jack" This was the director of Boulting Brothers, along with Roy Boulting, Jeffrey Dell. Usually, the Boulting film combines it with the bad social satire with nothing but commercial comics, but here are only fey jabs on both sides. Amph Ibulos has expressed its general value in English ("this man, how do you say, Chinese aboard"), while Carlton-Browne is much worse than it deserves. <br /> <br /> The weakest and longest piece of the film, Loris, is with Ilyen. When Luciana Paluzzi gets a point when he makes a point, he puts it in cases that are not apparent in cousins. <br /> <br /> The film ends with the theater's revolution. , and Carlton-Browne seems to literally link the last coffin to his coffin. Apparently, she lives to see another day, but the movie of the same name is strictly DOA.
