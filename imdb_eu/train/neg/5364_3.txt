Complaints are valid, the main problem for me is that the TV series is aimed at women. I agree with these night soaps, such as Gray's Anatomy, or Ugly Betty, or West Wing, because stories are of interest never ending. However, when the idea seems to be the same as the soaps of the day, it seems that the hunky male (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly, and Chris Lowell) face sexual tensions and romanticism, and in a small hospital, it's a lot of ridiculous situations. ... or similar to Baywatch women. Men liked it and they had it, even if it was the woman who wanted it, but that's a great forehead show (or something that men will see) is not unrealistic.
