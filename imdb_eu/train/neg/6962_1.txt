How could they be such as good actors like Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet ... so ... do you really get involved? I can not get it. It was wonderful, it was very annoying (but some of the main roles), the jokes are dumb and not fun ... I will not talk more about that movie, except for advice: do not go see time and lose money.
