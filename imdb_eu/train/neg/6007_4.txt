Surprisingly, it has some quality recovery films at the end. On the other hand, this movie is very bad and tidy, with a small budget, which is insulted with no handwriting and with it. <br /> <br /> It's insane with all the money They never seem to have enough money to make a decent film for Christian circles. I am not a religious, so I do not care less, but the film festival will get a new church audience and people will find more interest and curiosity when reading the bible. In this sense, these films are always wasted. <br /> <br /> The small budget dies at the movie and falls. The film also sees its effects as well as a general movie that gives it a nice B movie. <br /> <br /> But this movie is more damaging. The things that happen in this movie are just insulting the mind, and then I'm not even complaining or speaking about the religious aspects of the whole story. It's just about the way the movie is moving forward, and the people in this movie make things that do not overwhelm the audience. <br /> <br /> I also sometimes hate how the movie was a TV series. . It seemed to me that it was simply a long time to turn this film into something that was added to some characters and dramatic developments. Sometimes I did not care so much. <br /> <br /> It is still to be said that the film gets firm and consolidated towards its end when its story focuses on its essence. It is still predictable, but it has been prevented from seeing this movie, and in terms of these types of films, it will be much worse to see it there, although I do not think it will win this movie. new souls <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
