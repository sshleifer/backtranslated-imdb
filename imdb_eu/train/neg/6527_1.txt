Without a doubt, the Saturday morning television show was badly played. In the end, these producers needed to come back. Well, in this incredible offer, at least the amount of money saved was counted. The script could be extracted from some of the opera series inevitably forgotten, Gerald Mohr's cool-dude, murmured by Naura Hayden, along with stunning lines. The director should not do something fair with the flower story, so the action is boring. Space props are meaningless - Bulova wall clock and portable writing machine, for example - but planet groups must be the worst in film history. Most are rough drawings and they are often sprinkled with red light. Although Mohr is also used with hairy hairy breasts. And it's a bad thing - just as thin as on the plot. Any viewer that can move to the end of this movie will hear Martz's message - and he will probably agree completely!
