Located in Providence, Rhode Island, Mass Food is a satirical attempt for the role of the media in government. Most of the time, the United States tried to control the media in the Iraq War, but it still remains. There's never been a horror in the story and it's never been too good. Worst, the film's direction is made dreadfully because it does not give more attention to the odd angle of the odd cameras, "is not it a strange way of retaining the camera?" Special effects are bad ... The video of an explosion will be projected green over the city and, in the best case, it is likely. <br /> <br /> A couple of movies have bright spots ... advertising. for cash services (claim service and party buses). But very little is it worth the movie. <br /> <br /> To get a better zombie movie, try Hide and Creep. It has the same weak production value, but behind it there is much engineering, humor and talent.
