I just downloaded Netflix's DVD before I rented it, I returned a few hours of my life. Actually, I think the film director also wrote. In this case, according to credits, the same type was "writer and director" - unfortunately, it represents the overall quality of this production. There were some interesting moments (for example, Judy Tenuta's scene reminded Judy-ism of her initial comedy habits), which valued two stars for me. These moments, however, were very few ... and I hardly ever saw them as the opening sequence was almost incomprehensible to me, without any criticism of violence. I confess to knowing once again that I had to see that part again, if you were asking me something I could see. No, though I know at least the characters who would be more important, since then. The "rotating camera" technique was used too much and was basically unsteady. I talked to the TV screen: "What ?!" or "God's sake, with him!" It is not recommended.
