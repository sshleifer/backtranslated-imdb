It's a great city with old San Francisco credits. In this, filmmakers tried to make use of the city. They did not even manage the most basic realistic details. So I would not recommend it for being a San Francisco movie. You do not think "oh, I'm there", you'll think "how do you make two story firetrap / stinky armpit hotel relaxed in the lobby?" Some tracks used East Coast speech styles and affections. It displaces, but the performance has always been a matter. <br /> <br /> It seems that stories were filmed in three different styles, at least initially. The Chinatown story was the most effective and interesting. The plot is fragile and ripped off from Hong Kong classic action movies. The originals were a lot more emotional tension and resonance, better suited. But the play is fun and we'll see James Hong and other pictures. <br /> <br /> The arrival of white boys was no doubt. I think the filmmakers do not know what they need to do, so they are structured and cut off. Father is a curious despair of a liberal Berkeley - really, people, everyone knows that he is not a groovy ghetto - but his segments are the most humorous. Good opportunities were thrown. The learned and dreaded West Coast is another jerk of yuppies in New York than in New York. They are equally overwhelming, but always separate. That would be interesting; It was not that. <br /> <br /> There was no Hunter's Point introduction. It was the three most popular derivatives, and the most distant from San Francisco. You've seen it before and you've seen it better. Video game was also better! <br /> <br /> Although these characters are the origin and direction of the script, the characters have the potential, the actors have the talent and something interesting to start up around the wrong direction ... about ten minutes later. Good concept placed in the wrong hand. <br /> <br /> PS, here is a minority missing, see what you can guess.
