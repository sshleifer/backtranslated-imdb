Although it seems to be an old show (2002), I saw the first episode first and I must say it must be the worst show. . . always <br /> <br /> I do not comment, but I was surprised to have a show that is trying to give a show, and I only think this was their audience, children under 12 years of age. old people or less than average IQs. <br /> <br /> The episode that last night included so many decomposed story lines, they seemed to represent each land plot and tried to preach about friendship. , family, religion and politics !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> The storyline covered in the section: Frat House hazing was wrong with too much alcohol - She wants to be the Death Senator. . Death is really a peanut allergic murder The Senator thinks he can be his best sworn enemy and best childhood friend because he made the votes of the Senator because of the law's votes but eventually got a conscience and say "no" means Mulit Millionaire. Everyone has a suspicious but regular cohort (a former girlfriend of a married girl had to be a lie, the victim had told him that he had changed his life experience, that the senator had not paid the children of sworn money. In the meantime, the hero of this dribbera has lodged her daughter's "age" and turns a boy, who eventually gets courage to speak with the help of his aunt, but leaving him alone in 'girls say that there is not enough, so keeping up with them is a must . Do not worry, the boy has come back to learn about the truth about life and then drops the "girls", and Aunty also explains that he can really trust God (I was almost sick at the moment). . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This 'Drama' gets you to know who Sue and his FBI team are the killer. . . This will make you laugh, of course. . . <br /> <br /> Only one year ago, a boy from Fratrie met who was known to have been taken, and his true father is an international terrorist and he is trying to make his father a terrible father die and plant funeral in a funeral. . . . . . . . <br /> <br /> The characters are cardboard, acting cardboard is continuity cardboard. This story is cardboard. According to the show's enthusiast, it has an iron cardboard <br /> <br /> Why did writer's writers try to gather the show on EQUY eventuality in a single show, of course, in character development or in the ability of actors to complete a simple line of land. Seeing this show is like watching 'Last Action Hero', with Arnie's choice of 5,000 people dying, except Arnie, she's a better actor (wow, it would be a day we'd thought it would be !!) <br /> <br /> The words of the beloved character of the Simpsons "comic guy". . . . <br /> <br /> TEKNIKO MUSIKA TXIKIA. . . . . Never
