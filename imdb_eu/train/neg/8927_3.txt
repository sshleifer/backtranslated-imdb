Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) makes a sex change (John Carradine - dead drunk) and appears as Myra (Raquel Welch). He decides to destroy masculine masculinity (or something like that), and teaches history of the film in a funeral director John Huston (do not ask) and break a happy young couple (Roger Young, beautiful and hunky). Farrah Fawcett - both Farrah Fawcett). <br /> <br /> Gore Vidal's brilliant novel, which was perfect and, of course, tried to shoot. They also recruited English-speaking anti-American attitudes and hired "talent" (Welch, Reed) actors and old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West). all together and ... SURPRISE !!! Completely havoc <br /> <br /> Films rated X in its version (up to R down to R), above all because of the flavor of the scene by Welch's Rusty (Roger Herren) and Welch. . do sex with Fawcett. <br /> <br /> The movie is very far away ... the scenes jump around the place, and people say it and do the things they do. It's not good, but I was not bored. <br /> <br /> The effect is enormously changing ... Reed is horrible ... really sad. Huston makes the landscape more and more hose and LIFE is more extreme. Welch is not as bad as Myra, but his lines do not make sense, you never know what to do. In the West, there is hardly any movie in the film (blessing) and a woman over 80 years of age is going to hear a woman who breaks up sex jokes. Roger Herren (what happened ...) was very young, pretty and bad as Rusty. Fawcett is okay. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find things about it ... seeing it is unbelievable. See the movie - think!
