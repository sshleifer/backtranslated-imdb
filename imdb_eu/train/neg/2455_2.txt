I remember watching the movie in the 78's with my parents and having a great time. Of course, I had seven. <br /> <br /> Before taking the Jackson movies, I rented my wife and I because I never saw this movie, and I felt nostalgic. Ralph Bakshi was sold out in the middle of the animation process of this movie without money, and he had to cut the corners of that production. This film was mostly done with the rhythm, using animation techniques for people with quotes, this is something. A great part of this movie is in very simple sense in simple animation. It seems that some people in front of a screen, for example, have some animation effects over them. <br /> <br /> As a result of the budget constraints, the compression of the film was also one of the "Ring Solidarity" and "Two Turrets" episodes. It's something like a movie version of Cliff Notes in the books you get. <br /> <br /> Not bad, however, the animation brings a lot of warmth, I found Jackson to be missing it. movies Think of money in how good finances can be. <br /> <br /> This movie is also a highlight of the never-ending episode. A few years later, a special television medium-long television broadened with the aim of collecting things. I would all say it was musically.
