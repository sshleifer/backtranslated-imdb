First background; I am an Englishman and have lived in London all my life. I was in many games in 'The Den' and in other London club motifs. I know the kind of person that enters the huliganism and I know how they behave and how they talk. You have to say that the movie is bad and bad. Green Street is one of the most realistic movies I've ever seen. I spent most of the movie shaking shaking. I felt that I had to point out some things I thought I needed to write down. <br /> <br /> <br /> a) People do not have such lectures in real life in London; The filmmakers were too full of slang and they seemed stupid. Unfortunately there are types of hooligan, but those you see on Green Street are more parodies. b) Acting actor Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam), unfortunately, was called "English" or "Cockney" as Osama Bin Laden. He is in the north of Newcastle and I'm surprised to see other actors act next to his face. How do we suppose to take them seriously? Why did not people in Eastern London just play that part? I would make myself a "little girl". c) Mr. Frodo. I would like to say, how can I expect Elijah Wood to take seriously the double size of the people and the really bad hooligan? He would be dead. Just as simple as that. Honestly (as a Brit) it was difficult to see this movie. I'm sure the movie will be bombed in the UK. In some states, it can do a bit better if the Americans do not know what (or care) they do not know. <br /> <br /> Please, my American and foreign friends, do not think that word of nonsense. Yes, these companies exist, but they are very underground and rigid and on a smaller scale. The movie just got 2 for me, because they actually shot some in London. These things usually try to shoot in Cardiff (Wales), or because they do not expect something.
