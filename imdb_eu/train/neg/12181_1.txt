Unfortunately it was not for a score 0 or I chose it. This movie lacked the power of many original so many films. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocence of Aileen Quinn's newcomer, and John Huston (the father of the actor, Angelica Huston), is this film so enjoyable. Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming, and Kristin Chenoweth also released a new version of 1999 to make a sequel. Before making this movie, Ashley Johnson was known for her role as Chrissie Seaver for the first time, Growing Pains. He had movies in some parts, but I do not know who thought he had enough talents to make his own talents. And adding Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom, ridiculous! Could they not get enough actors to play Daddy Warbucks, Hannigan and Annie, but will they sign up for a few British women to be signed by Joan Collins? It's not surprising that this film was as bad. The critics were right for the film that they did not agree with, although it was only for television, although it was a bad part of the adventurous movie.
