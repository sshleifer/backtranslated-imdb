So it's not funny this movie - it seems that the residue of excellent stars, so they forget about their star writing. The bright moments of hotel management that are fascinating are John Cleese. You almost fall into your seat with a laughless laugh with Donna Summer's "Bad Girls" and big heels, a mink coat and a hat. The rest: Forget it!
