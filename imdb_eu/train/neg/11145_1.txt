Where do i start . . . I'm sorry ... scratch! That's it, torn! I only have 1.5 hours of my life, I can give 1.5 hours to make something more useful, like this horror movie about how to paint dry paint. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not fun. not dramatic, no action, nothing ... <br /> <br /> Its predictable, its boring, its tragic ... <br /> <br /> It might be a bit hard here, but watch this movie and you will feel the same way ... or ... not, do not look ... even if you do not want to think about it.
