I did not care about the movie, the book was better. Do you know who was shot? *** This is where your site was my first visit ... I found the answer to my question. so now I look like a dummy, but I still think I will present my comments. And yes, British Columbia is beautiful. Or why did you take it from its South Carolina coastal environment? (this question stands out) The place was essential to the book's base and to match its change film. Oh, I just read where I have to write at least ten lines. Here's my other main topic with the movie. Kim Bassinger was annoying and I thought that book. I know that the book and the movie were a book; Not so good. I found the book's character much more enthusiastic. In addition, the book brought the rural and almost primitive images of the monastery. Although the film's "castle" was much more spectacular, it distorted the feeling of the story and compared it with the characters.
