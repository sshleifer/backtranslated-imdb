I would like to know more about this movie I have rented. I would put it in my queue based on Heather Graham and his acting (IMHO) as a strong author. Although the movie parts are charming, he guessed a lot of the movie, developed it, or just felt boring or predictable. People did not mention so many ICK factors, the brothers thought it was a pair ... I do not care what the story is about a large part of the line, it still feels a bit, um, gross. And Charlie, for zoologists, certainly does not seem like the other Homo sapiens signals very similar. What happened to him (warmth and common interests). This story could be much more interesting. The highest points - Molly Shannon (I sometimes agree with his annoying reviewer), no trace and dance sequences (if Sam & Gray were so big dancers, I would like to see more, the parts that we were shown were much better than the movie, it could be better.
