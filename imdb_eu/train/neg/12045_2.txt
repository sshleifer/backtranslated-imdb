Hello, <br /> <br /> This is my first post on IMDb, although I use it for a long time as a reference. I like you all. As I am Greek, inevitably, I hope that my opinion will cause me your dismay. <br /> <br /> I have spent 2 years studying Omirus epos (and not Homer as you see everywhere) of my life (all Greeks), rhyming rhyme. If I remember correctly, Iliada (Iliad) was in Level 8 and Odysseus (Odyssey) at Level 9. Warner's Troy, for me and my Greek colleagues, had a great campaign (I learned in the UK). <br /> <br /> Iliad Epos is one of the best literary works ever. Omirus, a Greek poet, spent 400 years after the same war. History historians K. a. In the year 1200, a Trojan war was set up, and the reason for the war was not the beauty of Helen but in the strategic position of Troy. That said, Omirus Epos does not present events (because historically it is not exact), but this was never the purpose of this work. <br /> <br /> He asks himself to read this great poem, honors, love, anger, hatred, heroicity, discipline, loyalty, etc. Fights longer were the long conversations between the conflicts between the war. None of them were revealed in 'Troy'. Warner's Troy was very cheap for my eyes, as well as my colleagues for Finnish and German English. It's shame to spend millions of dollars in bad situations. By the way, the perfect storm was a bad and stupid superproduction (computer graphics did everything), but Wolfgang Peters is the best work. <br /> <br /> I can conclude that you should see something more to conclude. I would give Troy 10.n. It's a real B movie. <br /> <br /> Cheer up <br /> <br /> Alex
