The film is a portrayal of Shannon Lee, an interesting and strong filmmaker, who presents two very cool characters during the first period. But then something happens and suddenly Shannon becomes a straight face, a bad second hand lost to the girl and the movie in her context. In the second half, there is no charisma, and clich√©s, bad performances, horrendous terrain and even worse. The gang Mafia was chosen for Chechnya for the great actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Game of Death was a bad and clownified Bruce ... then Bruce Lee played. I truly believe that it can do much better than that and I hope next time in a better production Will take part. <br /> <br /> If you're a real fan of the basics, and if you do not take care of the quality, go ahead and watch this movie. I was waiting for that person, but I was very disappointed.
