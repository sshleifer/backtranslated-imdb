Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) believes that finding a perfect woman at Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) is a quiet but pretty woman, though she'll soon find out about being poor and possessive, and even G-Girl superheroes. Even if you do not know what Matt does with the things he / she does to frightens and breaks with him <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < My Super Ex-Girlfriend is still a nice comedy, but it's too much in sex jokes and it's an unforgettable experience. What went wrong? Managers and directors could not overcome the weakness of the script and I did not like it. I expected the guy to be a jerk and he could be a fantastic female revenge. However, they became a kind kind and become a psyche superhero. It was not very cool and fifty minutes afterwards, the movie was well received. Certainly there were some fun lines, but the central weakness and endless horror did not really reveal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ivan Reitman lost his touch. After successfully completing the early eighties and early nineties, Evolution and Father's Day began as wickedness. I would not say My excellent friend, but Super Bust, but I do not give credit to the quality of the movie, that is, it's not too much. Don Payne did a great job with the script. Most jokes were lame and most of the helpers were just one note. Likewise, the joke continued to reuse the same, to be really boring. <br /> <br /> Some actors were just enough to save the movie. Uma Thurman was as good as G-Girl and she had a lot of fun lines. Luke Wilson was pale and not very interesting. I do not think that creating an attractive head and supporting roles like The Family Stone is better. Anna Faris was doing his "Scary Movie" routine and the old man arrived. It requires a challenge or at least better scripts. Wanda Sykes is for me. It was fantastic in Monster-in-Law, and it was wrong in Registries. Here, it's annoying and does not bring anything to the movie. Eddie Izzard is fine, nothing special. Rainn Wilson was annoying and not funny. In general, the movie was disappointed. It was not horrible, however, that it had so much potential and the final result was average. 5/10 rating
