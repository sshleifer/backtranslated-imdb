The night after watching "The Bodyguard", I felt the need to write a review. <br /> <br /> This was not a great camera that could have been pretty decent. She was far beyond the scapegoat. Angels were wrong, nothing could be seen, especially in the battle sequences. The first things were awesome. <br /> <br /> Stories Sonny Chiba has taken care of himself as a guardian, who is ready to take him to the top of a drug ring. Judy Lee has approached him, because he is not right with Chiba. Lee's introduction into the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thought, a group of Mob and other thugs are after him. <br /> <br /> The story was decent, and although it was a huge double, this could be a good movie. By giving me a better direction and editing, I am sure that Kung Foo was a classic movie. Still, it's like a 70s movie action. <br /> <br /> Note: "Pulp Fiction" has the initial sequence that the fans know, and then continues in a Square School of Times Square. There is no relation to the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 to 10
