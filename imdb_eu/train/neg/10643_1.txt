Normally, I'm a fan of I'm a fan of the eighties and the early nineties ... but the movie is terribly terrifying because of a real resistance test. The costumes for dressing as a girl have been made to death, but they are never so pathetic. Corey Haim's performance was usual, Nicole Eggert was not much better. This does not deal with wealth, although you're a fan of the number 1 of an actor / actor in the trash - follow!
