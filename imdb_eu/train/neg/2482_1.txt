(Spoilers galore) This movie is absolutely horrible. First, he has a medium man. I think it's a great career when playing old parents. He agreed that he was afraid of his son for the first time, but 10 minutes later they did it again! Therefore, this film moves in real time with unpleasantness. At one point, I started the picture a few days later, reminding myself that the story was only on the next day ... still in the afternoon. I'm not sure who the couple is in real life. First, Manhattan yuppie is presented as a kind of couple, they grew up and they had a child. They drive an old Volvo blue. These types of Volvo stopped driving a few decades ago. They drive today Prios. But in 2002, I'm convinced that they have not yet driven Volvo. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Wendigo. A "mysterious man" boy gives Wendigo a magical statue and tells his powerful magic. Nowadays ... we are still doing ancient Indian mysteries. To take home, they travel through all the Indian states in their tourist trap, in a small town in New York. The Indians of America are depicted as they have not seen in decades! Oh, and about Wendigo. It's not really a horror cause. It does not kill the child's father ... it's just a matter of killing an ordinary hick, with a murmur and a high-power rifle. Wendigo comes out to avenge the guy who killed his father ... but wait, before he thought he was mad at Wendigo, he might have deer killed ... Wendigo. he should be happy that his father died ... but ... <br /> <br /> <br /> So it goes ... insulting, boring and absurd. There is no way to watch the movie.
