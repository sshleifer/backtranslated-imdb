I am afraid of this movie in my collection. The richest DVD owner is a bonus feature short film. The vote for this movie is great for ZERO. Not misunderstood, I'm a horror girl. but I want a bit of meat under the story, I prefer to make it happen to humans, that is, to see animal-tabacco clips, I prefer to see it permanently. The act of violence causes a heavy silence. If you are compelled to compare it with another movie, the Cannibal Holocaust is the only one. Bad, boring, useless and completely uncomfortable clock.
