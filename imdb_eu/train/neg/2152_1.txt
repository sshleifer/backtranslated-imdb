This movie tries to be very thin and Tarantino <br /> <br /> you need solid basic movies that are trying hard. These include good sound, editing, setting design, etc. ... <br /> <br /> Let's talk about sound in this movie. absolutely atrocious I have never felt that a soundtrack has ever been very careful, before talking about a low budget, films made in Chile, and so on. Note that more than just the desirable sound of these days can be achieved. It has never been. everywhere. and more information about the technique is available before ever <br /> <br /> the sound of this movie is very strange. Especially foley place and inappropriate, the atmosphere is equally terrible. I have heard at least four clicks on the film due to bad sound melodies. The sound of the cars inside is horrible, the sound that closes the car's doors is horrible. The sound of the singing lady is wrong. Foley is in aboard or just like there's no sound boring and giving up. spaces are wrong everything is wrong <br /> <br /> and yet it lets you stop leaving the creative boundaries at the same time trying to be a brave movie. For example, the sound of the aquarium is used in the street scene. When we suppose we do not hear the sound. Sound changes are ahead of visual cuts. Every trick in the book is used, and yet the basics are not there <br /> <br /> We use wise editors to jump heavyweight cuts, timeline, and so on. All these techniques are imitated to a bass standard. <br /> <br /> It's a pure mix of the whole, the sound is pure. so it's just a movie. How can the film take on a lot of important awards and awards with the greatest rewards and praise? New cinematic wave in Chile? The best creative offer in Chile? I hope, and I do not think so. <br /> <br /> <br /> My theory is that it has a better and more selective talent, that is to say, this film has prevented a great deal of content. Likewise, the movie is likely to not accept so many critical movie world creators for the same reasons as critics. It is likely to be misfortunes. The film critics rarely pay attention to technical and quality details <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste bin. It has no mouth or pants and it's worth 6.8 points. The film has a total production quality that produces cheap Tarantino, a new wave inspired porn!
