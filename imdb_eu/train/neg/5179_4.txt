Without indulgence of supernatural or human poem without any poetic motive, all creative groups await the effective use of medium and unusual elements of their minds. "Five parties" has been manic, when it is genetically unknown, there is little interest in roots, because it is a special non-homicidal element because "Wes Bentley" is a secondary fault. In fact, all the performance is in deep skin. Even though dark women and hair are clad, salaciousness is kept to a minimum. No nudity here. The blood vessels are also missing. Teasing all the sensations, keeping a safe distance ... unfortunate fact, according to the director's name, "butcher". The soundtrack, droning angsty alt-country and tense punctuation only give any palpable tension. Sometimes they add attractive low angle shapes that add some static graphic stencils ... but for a movie that I'm afraid, I never squeezed it. Perhaps more attention is paid to social youth through bloodstream, a scene focused on different geometric shapes outside the square, and a family-friendly approach to wildlife, and escapist traps by amorous characters to escape their problem. But this was not a good start through my walk.
