The problem of this kind of film is literally tensed every year. Fortunately, a handful will be given to use a handful, others are directly promoting the video or television, such as this movie. <br /> <br /> The main problem of this movie is its originality. "Die Hard" is one of those formulas, which is somewhat nonsensical, when it's just the wrong time. In this case, he is the character of Casper Van Dien, who performs security procedures that successfully test companies and individuals' safety procedures. In this case, he is sending himself to a cruise ship, which is, of course, kidnapped. This movie can be seen as a mix of "Die Hard" and "Air Force One", and the film does not try to make these two films as the "main source of inspiration". So, really, you can not have an original movie. He uses all of the top-notch clich√©s and this movie does not make any surprise or original. <br /> <br /> Like this one, the movie has this. script very weak Or, in other words, he says, he has very lazy guitars. As I said before, the movie is nothing but original, but the real story itself is far away, and there are probably a few distant elements, and they are really reluctant. I mean, they've kidnapped a large cruise ship with only about 8 men, half of them carrying small guns, and they've only asked for a $ 10 million "only" rescue, which is already a ship worth 10 times. quite hilarious How do you want to split the money? Does everybody get more than one million or more? This is not so profitable for a very dangerous business. And then the kidnapping of passengers takes place. In a way, they get all the passengers in a seized ship and get them from one room to another, with only one type of gun, and it does not seem like they seem, watching them. However, you never see more than 30 kidnappers as if all the people were in the boat at that time. When the Van Dien character is searching for his son and vice versa, whatever the room he runs across the huge cruise ship, they always follow one another. Some examples of the dark writing of the film. <br /> <br /> But, of course, it's an action movie, so, of course, the story becomes second. Once again, this movie does not offer any good action. Half of the actors are never playing a weapon and the film is filled with a bit of movement. It has become dangerous in the points. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie also does not appear in the best actors, although I must say that Casper Van Dien is not really a "hero of the action" as a bad actor. by genre and B-movie circuit. However, it is the same problem as Tom Cruise; As long as he has, he never persuades himself enough to play a teenager's father. Van Dien started as a promising young actress, but the protagonist of such films has not helped her much more. It's probably something better, but it's never been a good opportunity to show it. All other actors work well, but the characters are not really interesting. <br /> <br /> Well, I have never seen the worst movie genre I've ever seen, but it's also not an original or memorable one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
