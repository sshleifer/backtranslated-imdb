** 1/2 Diane Keaton for this farce. <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Mrs. Keaton about your philosophy and caps with Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> This canker is too much. Keat's daughter, Sara, dies in a traffic accident while her boyfriend is alive. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, Keaton could not reach the phone, when he was in trouble with his friend and he came out. The phone cord generates a new way to get it done. <br /> <br /> Everyone in Saranda returns to the summer where they are staying. Cleaning the house, sleeping for two days, begins to reveal things that are not revealed. Apparently, Sara slept when she slept with her girlfriend and the guy who was married to the latter. He also aborted this guy. We blame these trips on these trips. <br /> <br /> Sarak is waiting for a newspaper to be discovered. A friend, a playwright, is not expecting anything in any other performance. <br /> <br /> If the log is found, the Japanese is written. Sara is a PhD in this language. The translation of a newspaper translated by a Japanese chef from a Japanese restaurant is not good at all. <br /> <br /> Of course, in the end, it seems that everything is well connected. <br /> <br /> The title of Shmaltz comes from Oztar's Wizard. Each time they talked to Mother and Sara, both would hand over Dorothy. <br /> <br /> As if that was not enough, Keaton did not say that Woody Allen had another in the route of this curious curiosity. In his film, Interiors, where Ingmar Bergman successfully tried to emulate. Mrs. Keaton also tries to try drugs. Come on, people, do we think that we could deny that way? <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, this film is best summarized in the best way.
