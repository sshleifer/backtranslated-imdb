Poor quality of high quality Albert Pyun. Tim-Thomerson's 13-inch Clint Eastwood's spacial police escapes the ugly wing of the Earth (!) And in South Bronx! Beautifully short, but boring, dull, with the honest effects from the 50Ft Women's Attack. They also ousted the continuity tip: Note that Thomerson sunglasses disappear and appear again in the background. Unfortunately bad, but we see these films, right? Sequel'Dollman vs. The demonic toy is even worse, if possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (from ****) <br /> <br />
