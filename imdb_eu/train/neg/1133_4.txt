I have seen romantic comedies and this is the easiest / worst attempt. Many scenes work in plug-and-play mode when they are in line with the romantic comedy genre. This is usually because we are dealing with a genre, but the challenge is in general, new and inventive. This movie is not done. <br /> <br /> There are no sensible characters who are really, in addition to Sylvie Moreau (who is not a true star with Isabelle Blais). They fit into this three-dimensional clich√© and become more than just puppets that serve as a narration very clear. <br /> <br /> The movie route can be annoying, it's a bit of a rhythm and the edition can be filled. with unnecessary approaches. Likewise, excessive stylized decorations would require some scenes to be naturally contaminated, or, in other words, to try to make it clear. Of course, with that, you have the right capp music, unfortunately, it often does not match. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Woody Allen's remarkable mention is a deceitful movie. . If you expect a light romantic comedy, this is not. Or, in other words, this is a bad attempt. You will leave the theater as well as knowing why this film is gaining praise, the film is over 100 years old, and the director of Quebec is much better than the best films. <br /> <br /> Les Aimants is a good movie. But film art and director are bad as the author.
