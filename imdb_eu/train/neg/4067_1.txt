Is it wrong or is 2007 the original one? I demanded that the newly purchased DVD is one of the worst films I have ever seen ... acting bad, bad editing, etc. Here's the only "exploit" here: how did we get rid of this piece of money to get our money? It's just a soft, thin color ... it's not a real gore, no scary images, a bit cheaper. If you want to watch a great movie of unnamed actors, sting gores and a decent story ... get Baby Blood ... it's a cheap budget but it's done well ... and the story too! I Spit was wasting money, but I'll keep the smile ... it's pathetic! New comment ... September 3 ..... I will keep this movie forever, because they're just a bad thing ... it's a very bad way ... always acting the worst ... a ... the real crap-movie classic!
