FINE efforts by American filmmaker. His knowledge of racism is STAGGERING, and I've IMPRESSED for myself at more than one level. Lee really is a poisonous dwarf who exploits the opportunist Hollywood Affirmative Action system to make films of harmful poems just a small racist. WHITE, it's a mere propaganda of the right wing. To create red-hatred films to create red-hatred in America, it is a real idea that FALSE is boring and misleading the current political correctness. <br /> <br /> Some of Lee's opponents have even come to the point that GOTB is glorifying African-Americans as others say, while other races are going down: there is another FALSEHOOD that coexists in America and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the movie's first interview with rich Republican black and other coaches. The opinions presented by this man are simply wrong - throughout. 100% ENVIRONMENT. It breaks the education, unlike the excellent information that is thrown away from the bus. <br /> <br /> TERRIFICOS AND WRITING INTELLIGENCE have seen an experience from political films made since then. <br /> <br /> Millions of people took up only about 80,000 people with constant stress! <br /> <br /> (And now all you have to do is take the antonyms of words that are written in capital letters ...) <br /> <br /> So what was the message sent by Lee? If someone does not agree with your political opinions, you only have to apply violence and leave the bus. I thought the movie is "on the go"? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> It seems that Mr.Lee is a bus segregation, after all, that is, it is only the KKK queue, the bus is only for black people who are in line with the Democratic Party. So many "slaves release" ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Last credits: "This film was fully funded by black people." Farrakhan distributes and markets a large Hollywood studio that directs Jews and whites ...
