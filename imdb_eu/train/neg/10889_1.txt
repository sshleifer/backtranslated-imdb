Gingerale The worst movie I've ever seen since the afternoon. I think this comedy is horrible. It's enough to announce all the scenes in this movie. The special effects were not so special. Lying around the house, I think I can bring a good result. I want to say something good about this movie, but I'm afraid I do not. Coolio should be embarrassed to even be in the turkey. After a little thought, I can say one good thing about this film: it is finished.
