First of all: I love Splattermovies and I'm not afraid to get in touch with art, but it's a zero quote! The quality of the images is so bad, the sound I have ever heard (!!!!), and the FX in question ... how well some low quality ones will not be so bad in the real movie (this garbage is not here there). It is not a concept, not a milestone, a primitive play and a strange conversation. I think I have counted around 10 films in every movie, it repeats about 20 times ... it's the same for many movie sequences (maybe it might be an indicator) It seems like the kind of viewer!) A young man seems to see his father's rape and kill his mother It needs to be psychologically damaged and when an adult turns, it performs a self-cutting show. So far, so good ... But for a dirty pseudo-art director, this line is just a line that creates cheaper scenes in a row that does not have a message or have any meaning (a woman connected to a hole in the gut through the intestines taken dropped on a bare ... why? and why do you see a woman and a woman in the "bloody" woman and thrower? Alarming? Yes! Patient? Yes! It's necessary? No! Artistically? NO !!!!! Gore This inexpensive storyline should all be in touch with art as soon as possible, or they should watch Pink Floyd's "The Wall", to see how it can be done ... I hope that it was your first and last (!! !!!!!!) film, Andrew Cobb ... !!!! So remember: "cheap" and "sense" are not everything automatically "Art" ...
