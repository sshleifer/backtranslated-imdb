Unfortunately I'm really sitting down and I saw this. I love independent films, horror movies and the whole thing in the area. When you add Nothing, you have crossed the line that is ever going to cross. I hope the people of this movie have been very enjoyable and at least there was no waste. You should never know seeing. Script? You're joking To act? I also think that the trees were pretending. Cinematography? Well, there must be a camera. Deadline I do not believe there is any planning in making this movie. As long as I do not lose weight, I will not prolong myself by commenting further.
