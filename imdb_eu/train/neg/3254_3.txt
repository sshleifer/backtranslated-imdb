Cynthia Rothrock, (China O'Brien), "Manhattan Chase", 2000, watched this movie, and, of course, this tiny little boy burned with his artistic abilities and hot sexy body. China O'Brien is angry as a policeman and has decided to leave and return home from home to his roots and father to return to the local sheriff. His father is growing and the town has changed, the gangsters took the town and exchanged local women and the people of the city went to hell and were tired. Well, guess what happens and you're right, China O'Brien fights for a long tragedy when he loses his life. The bad part of the picture, but Cynthia Rothrock's film brings a wonderful conclusion.
