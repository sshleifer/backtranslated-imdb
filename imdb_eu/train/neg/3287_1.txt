If this movie should be renamed, it should be "The Jackasses of Hazzard". In conclusion, this movie is just minutes from innocent two giants of 88 countries, the famous Dodge Charger 1968 around the country and joyriding country, the girl continues and excites the law eluding. <br /> <br /> I have been one of the characters who are inclining the "Dukes" and the character of the movie are not the key. In summary, sexual references, and excessive drug abuse, the "duke" reputation has become a trailer trash. <br /> <br /> Compared to the television show, the act was horrible. Actually, the only actress was the famous Dodge Charger in 1969. Others have exaggerated the character of the film's personality. <br /> <br /> "Duke" XXI. The Hollywood television of the twentieth century and a great screen tragedy have been another tragedy accident. Skip this movie and just buy on your TV DVD. <br /> <br /> My grade: F
