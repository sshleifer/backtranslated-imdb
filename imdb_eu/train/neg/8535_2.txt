As I said, the book was pretty good and that was the best movie that could have been Melissa Gilbert was not so horrible and unbelievable. What kind of accent was it anyway? When I saw it in a different movie that was similar to its stunning Russian accent. When I opened my mouth I got up. He had 3 essays to watch the whole movie. Brad Johnson was a good head. <br /> <br /> I liked the beach scenes. Melissa Gilbert added some brightness to the endeavor of the portrait. I think that San Francisco's views can be more used, though. The night scenes really seemed SF, but I was wrong. I do not remember the depressing nature of the book. <br /> <br /> Please keep Melissa Gilbert from any future movie that requires an accent!
