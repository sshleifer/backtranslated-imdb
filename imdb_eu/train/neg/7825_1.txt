I think this movie is a tribute to Superman's film, which is similar to the original. <br /> <br /> After an initial scene of dark intergalactic stories, the credits pay homage. Original true credits of the original Superman, though very crunchy. <br /> <br /> Then there are darker things. Ma Kent's rotting sees something in the country house, and a large part of my life goes through, in a cornfield. Then Superman goes back and fails. <br /> <br /> Then, we meet Lex Luthor when the scene of old-fashioned women's old lady dies. We do not see Luthor's face until the end of the scene, an example of the first album of the movie, to stop stoning. Lex Luthor Superman is a man who does not like man. In addition, it probably does not like humans, since the movie sometimes landslide that Lex Luthor wants to kill most of the planet's inhabitants. <br /> <br /> After a while, Clark Kent has gone back to his old job (I had to forget about anything but a five-year-old traveler outside). He then knows that Lois Lane is an illegitimate boy and comes with Cyclops. It so much annoys that he unexpectedly loses control of his super-force by breaking a photo frame unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> We see at this time that Miss Lane has a certain type of jet. space type of shuttle It's an important event on TV. Then, the people in the control room are monitoring this event. There are people who watch TV and the riders are in the cockpit. The film then reminds us that most people are taking part in the summer with each other. <br /> <br /> When they started building events that were not going to be a waste of disaster, I asked for a pardon. I've mistakenly gone back to the theater and see Al Gore's movie about watching the slides completely. I tried to return to Superman Returns, but I went into the Prairie Home Companion, somehow, and followed it twice. Then, it was a short time to make the time. <br /> <br /> I went back to the theater, found my seat, and looked up to see that the disaster of Lois Lane's catastrophe was almost reached us. However, as I seemed to be eternal, I went through the theater, I met a girl, got married, I was born and sent to college. When I graduated from my children's school, I remembered returning to Superman, so I had to apologize and went back to the theater to learn I was not in a hurry. They were still half an hour before Space Shuttle Lane went wrong. When they did, everyone who kept Superman, pretty nice. <br /> <br /> <br /> And then there is a Superplot where Superman becomes really awful and Lois Lane and his family walk behind his vision and audacity. Then he wants to try to beat Cyclops, he looks like a guy. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Lex Luthor participates in some competitions to showcase all possible genres of each film before the end of the film. . I forgot to take them home on my desktop (they give it to the door), but I think eight percent have been very sharp. I hope I earn $ 1 million. <br /> <br /> At this moment, things start the second end of the dark. I think the projector may be broken, because it seemed like a movie because here was a little loop. I remember seeing the dreadful things that came out of the water, Superman gets sick, Superman gets better, returns to dark things, is ill again, without waiting, it's good again. the bad guy moves: the little girl shouts a little. <br /> <br /> Then Superman died and moved back. I thought the movie was over, so I stopped. <br /> <br /> I felt a little nursing when I was ninety years later. I realized that at the theater I left my sportswear and I recovered. When I did, I was a little surprised that Superman Returns was not yet finished. I asked to ask the audience, but most of them now had no skeletons with long gray backs. <br /> <br /> I sat in the old seat and I saw Lois Lane like her house. for a moment. Then Superman appeared and began to mention the movie, and I saw that part of it, I thought I needed to leave it. <br /> <br /> That's my Superman Returns review. <br /> </ p> <p> Or, if you like jokes about a dog that eats a dog or a dog, you will love this movie. There are two jokes like that.
