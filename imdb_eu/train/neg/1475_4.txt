Most seasonal episodes are awful. There is no difference with Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, because these programs were decent lines. Most stunning stories are bad ... it's not surprising at least ... rent or buy the Twilight Zone series ... I've heard much better in Season 2 season. That's why they have also cut some DVDs. Ray Walston pieces that continue to reduce this compilation. In 1985, it was the only thing to do with actors and actors who were younger ... most of the story lines are a good prediction, but the series can be better off losing ...
