I thank God for this film I did not go to. I would really feel the money I gave. I saw it on TV and I could not believe it. I doubt that this film was worse than this. They spent millions of dollars on this movie. awesome performance and awesome stage. I think other people who wrote comments on this film company's staff;) It's a great fiasco! In 2000, can you still laugh at this type of film? embarassing ...
