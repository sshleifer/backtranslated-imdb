"Back of Beyond" takes place in the midst of the Australian desert by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), in the wilderness of Paul Mercurio, who finds himself suddenly in trouble when the visitors arrive unexpectedly. At first, it seems apparently confusing, with his sister and his sister (even better understood later in the film) to ride on the desert in a motorcycle. Later, he is terribly quiet and sometimes he comes to Moody's when they arrive. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain and McGregor's spiritual sense, with the forecasting of his risks and, for example, a bit of a stroke in front of the story, in the case of three-diamond robbers, who breaks their cars and trusts with Tom, their places without help. Of course, Tom goes down to a robber, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly three allies challenge each other. But it is not as much as mystery or action that it achieves good results. In fact, it seems that the whole movie wants to be something significant at the same time, but it really fails. At the end of the day, it's like a story that goes out of the camp (which shows a lot of narrative faults), it's almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It may be worthwhile if you do not try Consider the slow route, but it's nice at least something different.
