Unfortunately, there is no single spoiler in this review that does not do anything about that movie. When he had made humorous and compassion for the work he had done, he did not use Eurotrash as a funny director. But he seems to have lost in the last 10 years. This movie is empty, so we do not wake up from the depths of sleep after 10 minutes. There is no sex, no blood (it is supposed to be around). snuff?), no actors, no conversations, 90 'is as bad as a TV movie. Even his latest cannibals and zombie epics are worse. So, in peace, Bruno, you will always remember us, thanks to this unforgettable experience. as gems: Zombi 3, Robowar, Rats, the other hell, Virus, cruel jaws and others. So, unless you want to see the new film of the spirit of Mattei Jess Franco, give this one. I do not know how to craft a nice career to explore old movies and have fun.
