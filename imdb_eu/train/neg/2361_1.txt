This movie is the worst in the series easily. Although New Line might have been looking for sales, they all know that the only reason was 3D more than before the budget. 3-D was not good either because it was 3D in the 50s and blue lenses (anaglyph) because people wanted to see what they wanted to look like. In addition, this movie was bad! Bad script, bad person, performance, worst director. This movie tries to push the external factor as a "Looney Tunes" episode. <br /> <br /> Really, it's not a horror audience, it's crisp and not terrifying, not funny or comedy a fun crowd. You have only done all the mixes that are still very bad, but still trying to play the campaign. <br /> <br /> I remember most of our enthusiasts. It was only a prayer that this series would end in that point. This is one of the films that he was able to see as a horror movie and a terrifying horror movie that they wanted to really laugh at.
