Gregory Peck's performance was superb, as expected, and cinematography is quite surprising even when it comes to melodramatic "momentum" directly. However, the rest of the films were overwhelming and difficult to see, even for me. I tried to like it, but I had to move forward thirty minutes. I lost good times. If it was not for Gregory Peck, I would last fifteen minutes. 4/10.
