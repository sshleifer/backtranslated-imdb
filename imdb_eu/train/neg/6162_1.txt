"Smokey And The Bandit" was not exactly Shakespeare, but then nobody wanted to. They were lower bends, but it had brains. He has a very intelligent script to collect defining and fun characters. People came out of the theater. This "Hooper" does not provide this. There is no reason to smile. If it supposes a tribute to Hollywood Stuntman, it seems to be very lazy, it makes one of the most credible jumping self-defeating scenes in a badly choreographed battle scene. Everything looks fake, almost shot. The poor Sally Field (as the girlfriend folds her hands) gives her the weakest role, with a fun and elegant line ("If you make this jump, I'm not back here"). Burt Reynolds looks for a camera and makes a gesture, but the joke belongs to an audience sitting around "Hooper". * ****
