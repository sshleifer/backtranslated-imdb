I understand that this movie is a very small budget, but that's not an excuse for Grendel. Deathstalker, Fire of Throne, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, Invincible Barbaro were all shoestring budgets and special effects inadequate, still generating classical worship by adding some scaterly dressed warriors and good mood. Original costumes, dark castles and beautiful scenery gave Grendel a great budget sword and sorcery movie, but the makers were totally ruined by using CGI's very bad effects and unlucky characters. Compare this movie to Beowulf (1999). Maybe Citizen Kane is not but a good example is how to make a low-budget science-fiction / fun adventure with special effects through credible and engaging characters.
