I received this movie as a gift, I knew it from the DVD cover, it would be a bad movie. If we did not see more than a year, I saw it at last. what a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> I almost did not see a bad movie, but it's not correct to write a review for me without seeing the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Confirm me when I say "this movie is ok". I was really surprised if a bad filmmaker financed the bee blame for pathetic film, but it would not cost more than 20,000 dollars to produce this movie. All you need is a cheap camera or a mobile phone with a camera. Non-performing interpretative skills for 15 people, scripts written by two drunken couples. <br /> <br /> The first part of this bad move. A reporter (Tara Woodley) presupposes that he drinks a man to report a hunted nation. They are totally damaged. They went to the house where they were lying, but fortunately, the liquor that came out of the door was almost completely equipped and there was a bottle. It's only for drinking, but it does not seem to be what it is. <br /> <br /> Then the supposed drunken man begins to tell Tara ghost / zombie stories. <br /> <br /> His fist's fist. Lame stories must be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> His story <br /> <br /> Sgt. Ben Draper, one of his soldiers, left his exhaustion (I think that's what happened) when the sick soldier was sitting in private Wilson and tossed a tomb and then left the collapse of the soldier burying him in Ben Bur Draper <br /> <br /> du. <br /> <br /> But the senator. Ben Draper is not surprising. If he knows his wife / girl, and with her lover, Sgt. Ben Draper, to take revenge on private Wilson (next to the tomb that kills next to the murder of the soldier), the soldier will wake up in his grave as a zombie and kill him to take revenge on his behalf. <br /> <br /> The conversion was ending so wrinkled. <br /> <br /> Even though B HORROR has been a favorite, watch the movie
