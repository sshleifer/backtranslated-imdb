Ben and Arthur could be 10 years old. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, watched and produced this film. Sam could have forgotten someone who could write his own ideas, writers, and performers. This is a good example of a person who controls everything in production. There was no one saying, "Sam is a bad thing, very bad." <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett Gabel's performance was the only point, but it could be a better and much better director. Actors to work. <br /> <br /> This movie is very bad, I think that Sam Mraovich had to connect to a chair and watch the movie twice (twice). performance and direction were so bad; This movie became a comedy. you should laugh, and in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> The second good point ... this would be an excellent date. After watching the movie for the first two minutes, you will pay more attention to your date!
