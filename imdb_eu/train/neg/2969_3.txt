The story is very reliable and powerful. The technical aspect of the film is very well, although it is directed. The main problem is castings, which have become a major lack of impact on the almost local and conventional film, and the lack of impression. Rafael (as Dayan had a great role playing father), all the other actors were unfortunately not at their best. The role of the old Blind Girl, Taly Sharon was fresh, but without much intensity. That's why the image it made became a lightweight and low profile. Some times and episodes resembled the rehearsal, the real movie. However, in the future, great improvements and great advantages are made.
