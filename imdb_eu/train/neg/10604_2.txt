This time the hero of the first film has become a human being and this time he uses pedestrian and pedestrian combinations against super-heroic soldiers and is a bad computer and is ready to take over the world. It's enough for Double Team to believe that Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer credible to offer action movies. However, this is its credibility forever bent. Universal Soldier: Return is not so double that it's so boring as Team Biko or Quest, which is immensely original without a star and a star without stars. This sequence is exclusively for children who do professional careers. If you look back, neither action sequences were also exciting, so this movie is not wonderful. In other words, Van Damme's assembly line is another clunker. <br /> * From 4th (bad)
