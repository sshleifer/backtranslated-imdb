The first young John Wayne Lone Star westerns got a little bit more than Wayne's poem running through Lone Star until that time. One, his old friend Paul Fix; Fix, since Lone Star is a much better actress than the standard, it has a great deal of professionalism in the environment instead of the traditional reading lines that are often delivered on these oaters. Soil, erroneous identities, payroll and the murder, would be as dull and correct as the western western dream of the 1930s, but Wayne's good looks, pleasant charm and a long line. to make it more enjoyable. Plump, baldy Eddy Chandler is not quite incredible as a "female partner" of Wayne, and there is a gag about what is happening with Chandler and Wayne. On the other hand, the interest of Wayne's love is Mary Kornman, "Little Rascals", known as "Mary". Now it's reached, it's 20 years old, like a bottle, blonde and pretty. The leading women in the Lone Star / Monogram Wayne B's were pretty cute and unmanageable, but Mary Perky is cute and sexy. There is a scene in the store, where he works and Wayne asks him to request a bottle of "nerve tone" on the top shelf, so he has to get a ladder and climb up. modest Wayne breaks his back as he steps up, as he goes down again, a few minutes later he asked him to go up and get another bottle made in 1935, amazingly wonderful movie. He is trying to see his perspiration surely. In any case, the small "B" is interesting, not great, but not so shaken and randomly as among many LoneStar productions of his time. The last gun is not well-managed, and Chandler reacts a bit afterwards, but it's worth a look, to see a pretty and sexy Mary Kornman.
