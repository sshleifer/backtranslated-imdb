After seeing "Will of the Triumph", I feel that movie very much compared to the historically low "standards" of that period. Of course, it is completely manufactured and harmful. That is, 30 years old would expect German propaganda. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation is also cheap. Also, it is so strange that the modern-day Germans also have to leave the theater in their nose. In a genre known for basic appeals, lacking originality and misunderstanding, this film does not "be bad". It would be a great improvement to get that situation!
