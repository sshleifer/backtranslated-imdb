The Incredible Melting Man acts as an extended section of Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and nudity. I know this movie is a bit bad, but it seemed impossible to me not to be like that. <br /> <br /> Operation and script are not the best. But the effects are beneficial for a 30-year movie, with a budget of $ 50 - it takes a bit of title to really melt, but when it's done it's quite reasonable; We also have a boring scene of death with electrocution. It's also worth mentioning music, it's madness - a tough nonsense cheese variety. <br /> <br /> Highlights: <br /> <br /> * The slow nurse that hangs is wonderful. The glass did not give any reason. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> * Be careful of the humanoid fusion of cannibalism. Steve is called. <br /> <br /> * We will be amazed to have our hero hunts a lunatic melt when he drinks a bowl of soup and crackers in the kitchen complain enough. <br /> <br /> I hate the film as it is 70s. It's rough and trashy, but I thought it was very fun. You can do it a lot worse.
