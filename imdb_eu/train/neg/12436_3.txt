The first house was just enough cinema ... the procession was quite the same in a new arena. This tries to be an original, and somehow succeeds ... of course, the formula is essentially the same, so that the movie itself is just like changing the plot a third time. The new score is quite bad (although the "set traps" were a new piece, which was not interesting or different), especially the first score and almost-quite-good-natured score. the second It (it's) made up of an original non-good music, but it's not the same. Direct land and franchises are franchises, but it is the same as the first two-way movie, a more striking example and a "terrifying nature good". The operation is not particularly impressive. Most of the characters are caricature. New robbers are more fun than old people (and they are spreading almost spyware, as we have espionic fiction films, some of which are very beautiful). There are more of them (and thus, other traps) than making the first two films ... and it does not work. The robers and their role is also the idea ... adults and serious for children's cinema (and it was one or two jokes, but it's not the first time in the series). The complexity is also necessary, as in the overall plot. I have been able to continue, but I definitely do not have a boy. Some of the explanations are therefore clear, although children may be stupid. Animal things are generally not fun. There are fewer siblings, which means that there are no developers, but they have a minimal personality of the first two films. After all, it's not particularly good, or worth watching, if you do not really love it, when criminals are watching cartoons. I recommend this for great serial fans. 3/10
