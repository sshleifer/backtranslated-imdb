After seeing half of this movie, I saw something strange ... I was constantly changing to see what was more TV channels - not so much a good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is like this. I have to be in a variety of genres, and I must say I have failed most of all. I changed 80% of the film to see an old version. Bottom Line: Those who felt the whole movie did not know what to do and did not like to make a distinction.
