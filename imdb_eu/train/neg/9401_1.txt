In this low budget (I have seen films made with a better production value), "Burning" and "Australian Friday" are recovering, a band performs music video at home. A serial killer has been burnt several years ago. Although this movie has never been the "worst movie in Australia" ever, DVD is a promotional material. That's just the point of sale! Full and deep rubbish. Perhaps, they caused some rumors for the wrong movie lovers, but I still wanted to burn my retina. <br /> <br /> Eyes candy: there is hardly any existing jewelry box. br /> <br /> My grade: F
