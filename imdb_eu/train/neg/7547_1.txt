Servant: Honey, here are the prescribed eggs. Honey, like bee, got it? It's called without a name. <br /> <br /> Edward Basket: Huh? (On the road) Cart: Here is your doll, little girl. You really would not have to be so indifferent. <br /> <br /> Little girl: yes, anyway. <br /> <br /> Crash! Boom Whoosh! Disarrer ?? Cart: I think something bad will happen. <br /> <br /> (Then) Cart: Mmmm. Vicodin! What ?? ? (Letter of tear.) Wow! My ex-girl writing really improved. Look, she's like a little girl whose doll is missing her daughter, as I thought she was supposed to kill her unexpectedly. And it has a certain hair. I wonder, should I torture it and will I find it? Let's see what my friends are concerned about. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Willow is a fun name. <br /> <br /> Cart: I think something bad will happen. <br /> <br /> (Island) Basket: What is it in a sack? AHHH. <br /> <br /> Arbolada Red Stars: It's not daughters, though. <br /> <br /> (in the bar) Cart: do you dance? A huge tree-lined bar. Cart: (it breaks a bee). Everything's fine. <br /> <br /> Sensually beautiful, it's been a long time since the actress was playing a promising bar. Honey is not a plant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Looking forward) Willow: Yes, yes, and I was forgotten, I mean, I'm the father of my son, Conan, er, in Rowen. (Yawns.) I stopped and I lived with you. But I did not. I wanted to be a beehive princess. I mean, it does not matter. (Nods off, jerks awake, eyes spreading anime proportions). Mwah, kiss-kiss. I love you! What were we doing Cart: Who smokes? Who smoked it Who smoked it Who smoked it Who smoked it Willow: Edward. Sniff Blink Why. Yes You Shouting. At. Me Do I eat your Vicodin? Sniff Snore. What were we doing Cart: I think something bad will happen. <br /> <br /> Willow: My lips hurt. <br /> <br /> (School room) Rose: What's the man? Extraordinary twins, together: fake symbols, fake symbols. <br /> <br /> Pink: Echo? Echo Cart: move away from bicycle. <br /> <br /> Rose: And I am a good twin. <br /> <br /> Cart: I think something bad will happen. <br /> </ br> (Beehive) Cart: Hmmm. Hallo Ow, ow, ow, oh bother. Old beard Witchcraft <br /> <br /> (Summit in the Royal Palace) Sister Summersisle: You have so much potential. What are you doing here? Did not you play a headset on the monkey's face? (He looks lips.) Cart: he was asking himself. Where is the girl Sister Summersisle: How do you ride drone? Let's talk about my superfluous "s" importance. Cart: look at the truck on our way! Aaaaah! Oh It does not matter. Heck! (He makes another pill.) Mmmm. Torazina. <br /> <br /> (When I return to the bar) I've tried the tabacoid, a great outfit: Jenny Craig, with South Beech, and I got a baton in the last year. <br /> <br /> Tree-named vector: HAHAHA. Better everything better, dear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cart: The cart pulled back the last straw! Take that! (Slugs it.) (Edward Basket is attacked mysteriously behind) Voltuous tavern wench: EEEE! Take it! Exit the island already and take me! What do you need to do? Take it, I say! EEEE! Cart: Take it! (He casts his heart on his face, his eyes penetrate into his mind and go to the X of cartoons.) Son voluptuous: Snore ?? (Nicolas Cage burns at) Ellen Burstyn: And who can forget Basketball's phone sat in the middle of her dress suit and then the call drops. It's like a wireless filter: help! Now you hear me? Hahaha <br /> <br /> Kate Beahan: Do you remember when I took the bullet from Basket's gun? He was so impressed. You should be careful about your stuff, Nick. Hahaha And the chances of your movies. <br /> <br /> Everyone must kill Drona! Cart: (scream) Oh well, you mind? Well, toast will not help your honey chorizo! Aaah. My legs! Honey, (buying honey?), Away from this torch and basket weed. Honey! Smokey bear said he did not play games. Hahaha What ??? Look at that semi-truck! Ahh! Oh In the meantime, my drug experimentation phases are aging in the 1950s! Where is my heroine? Ouch. Ouch. My watch is not fireproof. Ouch. It seems that something bad will happen. Now you hear me? I'm ready for my close. Heck! (Six months later) The dreadful book of today's dirty suit: I told him about the case of that basketball. <br /> <br /> The innocent young Drono: I want to help people. /> Wives: Then take the seach contract! It seems that something bad will happen. EEEEE!
