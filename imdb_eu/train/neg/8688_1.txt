If you ever had sex with a farm animal, then the label line for this movie is still deceptive. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most boring movies so far. Have a nice time to see and try lately. I found it on DVD at my friend's house and I did not make a bad mistake for smoking. <br /> <br /> I can not detail the movie without damaging it, because it's just about 5 details. movie Try to imagine trying to make a movie about c-span, the fiction movie is only 10 times less interesting than the c-span talk boring. <br /> <br /> I think there's a conspiracy somewhere in the movie, but I could not tell exactly what it was after I painted my eyes and they threw Richard Gere.
