I admit that I am the only university student to do this, one of the main English. When I saw this movie I was a high school student. I want to look at that year, but it may be old, it must be remembered. With my quantum physical experience, I have been honored with my honorable physics course in quantum mechanics, that is, I have read about the theoretical aspects of this field and the articles that I can read. Meet and the like. I am not a doctor at all. <br /> <br /> That said ... <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. It is designed for the scientific minds of the New Age scientists, who want to believe everyone who wants to despair. My mother is a person and since she saw that movie, she watched all her friends and tried a copy of the film. I explained the mistakes and problems that I have seen with the logic and science of science - and they are numerous - and he dismissed my claims "oh, so a high school student knows more than just doctors." In this case, apparently, so. <br /> <br /> To earn a doctorate is not necessary if a person is correct or, of course, be intelligent. Basic understanding of physics is enough to divert half of the movie. Leaving behind, filmmakers manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants, when they accepted their beliefs, when they were completely opposed to them. <br /> <br /> I went ahead and I think that the intuitive has made a good movie to disconnect the movie, so read it if you like to do it. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
