Unlike the adventures of "The Buckaroo Banzai" or "Big Trouble in Little China" or "Conan the Barbarian", some cool films make it a sensation of feeling fresh and humorous. It's just a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is not readable, and there are some fun moments. Eddy Murphy's "flip attitude" here simply undoes the feeling of storytelling or dangers. And the special effects are stupid enough to make this tension more damaging. The "mystical secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are not necessarily pushed forward. <br /> <br /> If anyone feels embarrassed or the characters face a real danger, why should we take care </ br> <br /> Who should watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - Who can not help himself with Eddy Murphy? <br /> - I do not think anyone else <br /> <br /> I'll give this film a joke from 10 to 10.
