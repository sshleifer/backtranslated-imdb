I never heard of it, and then I found out that the man with a deadly lens, I heard that, but I did not see it. The presence of Connery pushed me back and it's not good. She wants to be a cross between Strangelove and Mash, but it's not funny, Wombat General name (?) If you do not find it fun. A thriller of the mid-70s is seen as a thriller for the last ten minutes, when it creates a life. There are four scenes in the Whitehouse that have not been vacant by the president and his assistants. It's almost as if it were a long initial cut, and the first semester has been released for the story of the bombing of the Nuclear War and suicide bomber attacks, which I think is to laugh, but they're not fun anymore. It's a great spot shooting, but the studio looks like a cheap TV. I could not believe that what Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did. Only laughter: Connery pulls out the teddy bear before putting on the helmet and leaping on the plane. Never say Never again look so great.
