I saw this movie after seeing other comments on the IMDb, even though my wife persuaded that "the only horror movie" was. I liked this movie, but I could not. <br /> <br /> "The story of love" was good, but the horror look was very bad. The story was about a young man who was in love with a girl suffering from parasomnia. Then the movie would be better. it was pretty ridiculous. The doctor fortunately forgets the privacy laws and professionalism. A nurse enters a room with a habit of feeding a dangerous patient (without safety), and the tray goes down and leaves the room without apparent cause. The court's sick (and the evil of the movie) is dressed up, apparently over the years? There's no sense. <br /> <br /> Some other actors like me, such as detectives, have liked movies, but I still can not recommend this movie.
