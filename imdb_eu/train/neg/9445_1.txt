Shame Shame Shame UA / DW what you do! <br /> <br /> I was scared. <br /> <br /> DO NOT take children to watch this movie. Children are totally inadequate for children. They will be bored and disappointed too. Certainly, * all of us have read Theo's wonderful children's book and, definitely, we have hopes ... but it's just a waste. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed, and he would certainly never give his "little thumbs" in a so intense attempt to capitalize on a classic. <br /> <br /> Pena. <br /> <br /> Give your money back to the book. If you have a copy, buy the book and give it free Toys for Tots software. This movie is NOT worth the visit to "free" revenue. <br /> <br /> <br /> Tighten the book. If the TV cartoon wants a good visual portrait - save money ... seriously. Save your money - The day of Sant Patty will be on the cable. <br /> <br /> Shame they are ashamed of what they do!
