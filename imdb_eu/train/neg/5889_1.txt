First and foremost, I believe that Norwegian films are constantly improving. From the emotional movies of the 70s and 80s, the movies in that place had a sense of humor. Imagine ... real comedies were made! The movies were fun and entertaining, long, dark, depressive and boring. <br /> <br /> In the 90s and 90s, a film director made "a new generation" great films. The following film films were praised by critics and played a great deal of money. Become a norm! <br /> <br /> Then came United ... <br /> <br /> * Small SPOILERS * It's just just not fun. Not once It never happened. But the thing is ... We think it's fun. Because cinemas are fun with Norwegian films. Especially with some funny comic plays with such a cast. But ... they do not do anything fun! Where is humor Show humor! Is Harald Eia a bad man? Is the totally ridiculous football coach absolutely ridiculous? Are Arne Scheie's comments? The movie is not very fun! <br /> <br /> But it's not my main citizen. That's the foresight. (And here I am afraid that I've even stopped the Norwegian comedy in many other films I saw). You know all the time well. All the characters are just like they are at the beginning of the film, and all of them eventually deserve it. There's no place for any surprises! <br /> <br /> I can say all I saw after seeing this movie I had a bad feeling. It was a movie that only made me realize I needed a new blood in the Norwegian movie ... again! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/6
