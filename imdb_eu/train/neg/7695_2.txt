I had a great desire to see the adaptation of a classic story like Arabian Nights. Instead, I was disappointed with a movie that was not saved from the beginning, though I tried to see it twice! <br /> <br /> It was a fund that was in this Caradine movie but it was not much acted out because the actors did not like it. With Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras, something like Fox is something better, action comic, and more general enjoyment. <br /> <br /> Ok, so Dragon of Son has many fans, but if you're looking for something about martial arts and lines. If you want the kids to settle on a Sunday evening, maybe 3 with ninjas.
