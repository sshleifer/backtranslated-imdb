One month ago I rented this movie a day ago on a Friday night. Everything that I describe to this movie is what I'm saying is 'TRASH'. The performance was so bad that I saw children do better at school. The entire cast seems to be reading their lines, not feeling, or emotional, and there is no room for the audience. In another note the special effects are very bad, and all things can be bought by someone who has shot a camera. <br /> <br /> The clown itself does not resemble the cover of the video. He did not even appear to appear in the film near the end, and he does everything to sing songs and follow some characters. There's no real murder, yes, this is not a real movie slasher or something I've questioned since I saw it. It's not the 'Serial Insane Clown Killer' if the killer was not killed. clowns 2. If you lose your friend, why would you go to the forest to go looking for sex? Really sad <br /> <br /> 3. Why has it been at the same time, at the same time, vain waste at one and the same time? Did you finally work hard to work? This movie is as sad as it is. It's my advice to rent if you have not lost an hour or two of your waste.
