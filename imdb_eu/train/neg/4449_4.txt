"Sleep With the Enemy" is predictable, "before being" this thriller does not seem to ever find any inspiration, even if it desperately tries to cast and crew. I do not think that my friend has liked to see this movie sixteen years ago. <br /> <br /> Ronald Bass is a complete lack of originality (based on the novel by Nancy Price), neither Joseph Ruben's rigorous direction nor Julia Roberts's performance. The support given by Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson is little help. <br /> <br /> I really can not say it. Ask. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Friday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center Melbourne
