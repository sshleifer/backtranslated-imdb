Deal Or No Deal and 1 Versus 100 success, comes with a stunning entertainment excitement - Show Me The Money, in which 12 "sexy dancers" come out in bright red shimmer costumes. A competitor starts the beginning of a sentence, such as "Which team has lost." through three options, A, B or C, completing the phrase. The contestants have three options to answer 3 of these options. Hosts - William Shatner, in his most odorless, will ask the contestants "if he wants to get the answer" and if a competitor says yes, he chooses a "dancer" with whom "You have money!" Opens a brochure with a quantity, and if the answer is correct, this amount adds to its profits; If it were wrong, the amount will be deducted. (So ​​theoretically, it is possible for this debacle to make a debacle a money Sakary money really.) There is also a "Killer Card" and a competitor who chooses a vile wheel, but has responded correctly. nothing happens. If the answers are incorrect, the match will enter the sudden Death and answer other questions. If he gets that bad, he leaves nothing. Before going to the announcements, Shatner shouts, "let's dance" and Shatner, competitors and 12 dancers. At the end of the show, Shatner asks "last dance" and everyone will shake them. <br /> <br /> This show will give me 6 episodes mostly, and hopefully pathetic. The excuse of the game will be shown at the door. (It could have been worse, so Cuba Gooding Jr could have been a hospitality, even though I bet the dancer is better than "Shat", as they are now called.) <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> 7/08: Guess what - I was wrong! It only lasted 5 episodes. The world is hope.
