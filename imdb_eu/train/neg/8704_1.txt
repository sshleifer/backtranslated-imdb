In general, I like dinosaur movies, but that's it. No script, no conversation, no performance. And the brave Colonel Rance is hard and, therefore, trying to curve his mouth, his twin brothers are like Proctor of the Academy of Police. So it was a total loss of time (fortunately I did not see a loss of money on TV). And I can not understand that 7 people joked 7 people. My advice, if you see the title from there!
