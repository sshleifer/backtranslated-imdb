After losing this wrong movie, I will say that it is a newer story than the previous versions. However, it is so inaccurate and politically correct that it made me look at it. Davy Crockett was very badly depicted by Billy Bob, it probably would have been better if he could throw it out by Sam Houston, just like the one with two mauled male loves. I think that self-absorbed Dennis Quaid (a true Texan) could be the perfect Crockett and definitely enter into hunger for his worship. Texan and the true believer in Texas's mentality, Davy Crockett's scene was in Texas, though he was born here. Our official motto is "It's not braggin 'because, indeed," Crockett was made. And Croackett, the last survivor of Alamo, has to face the worst offense against Davy Crockett. Moreover, suggesting that this great human being and good fighters would allow survival to be ridiculous. Three dozen different watchkeeping kills a dozen or more dead in the Mexican soldiers' soldiers, no doubt after a generous fight. In the end, the movie that ended the battle of San Jacinto ended, as a battle between 600 Texanos vs. 700 Mexican Soldiers as a battle between the well-trained Mexicans trained in 1,500. Every Texas child who is paying attention to the first class class in Texas knows that the battle was shocked by Mexican weapons during the nap and the Mexican army was so confused that the lines could not be created and escaped, the hands of the borderless hands were not trained.
