Oliver Hardy wakes up with a nurse and will soon learn to see her uncle to see Ollie's wife and new baby. The problem does not exist; Ollie apparently emerged. So, with regard to her and her friend, she is to place a woman with her child who agrees with her family. <br /> <br /> This is not a story that is particularly special, as I have seen at least. With this particular plot a couple of silent short films. The best thing about me was that Bobby Vernon did not make me feel. It's much better than ONE TOO MANY - probably a lot of them a decade later - the comedy became a bit sophisticated and there was little use less. Now I'm not against physical comedy, but some slapstick movies sometimes start shooting with guns, throwing and strangling each other, etc. Unfortunately, at the end of ONE TOO MANY, this is what they do. There is no sense and they would appear without the idea of ​​the story. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not a milestone for recreation. Simply, it's not enough to see it worth earning, if you're an obsessive silent fan.
