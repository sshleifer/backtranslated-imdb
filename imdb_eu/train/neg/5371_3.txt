This movie was pure. He starts to get angry, very lively (and quite gory) after the movie. It leaves too much time for explanations, and I asked what was all about when I got out of the theater. Characters are superficial, the story is not convincing; Most, on the other hand, have a different parody, and they are very juicy ... Like the young police officer must do a body. It's night, of course, it's raining and it's just for you ... Or The Manifestation of the Evil "Nazis" plus "Genetic Manipulation" ... It's original. There are some pretty little ones, such as the first scene, mountain views and some gag (races), such as (although Reno and Vincent Cassel do everything they can), it's definitely not worth it. (From 10 to 3)
