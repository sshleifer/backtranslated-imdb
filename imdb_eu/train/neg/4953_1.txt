I have never commented on the IMDb, but I have to do it after watching Batman's animation. Its absolute garbage! Warner Brothers had a great animated series of Batman in the early 90's, what are the hell with the winning formula they're trying to make? I want to write a complaint letter to the WB. The original animation was dark and marred, as was Batman's way of thinking. The WB had to do this with Batman with a future pickup. Now they produce this drivel. Joker does not remotely play DC Comics Joker. DC needs to sue. I ask all those who agree with me to write to the WB email and use the power to recover the original formula with people
