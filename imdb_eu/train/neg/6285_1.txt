Horror movie ???? I can not believe this movie was bad, what's the point of this movie ??? The movie was almost 1h and 30 min and its first 70 minutes, the only thing that was walking on the face had an accident on her face ... it's not much talk, even if not much action ... Tho I have to say, the last 20 Minuets has been a small little action ... and it was still stupid ....... and at the end oh my god, I do not know where to start, this is also ... the most stupid look on the face ... do not get bad I love Lena Headey, I think it's a great actress, but I do not know what this film has done ... do not waste time and watching this film has no story, because it has no play ... and there's no reason ... It's like this movie has slowed down and it's not like watching it permanently.
