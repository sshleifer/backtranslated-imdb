Actually, a film based on Harold Robbins has not won any awards. This is no exception. "Lonely Lady" is a budget, cast and execution B image. Technically, it looks like a TV movie. The performance is very different. Joseph Cali is especially daunting. Anthony Holland is shy. As a reviewer says about a performance in Katherine Hepburn, his range goes from A to B. Zedora gets G. The rest of the cast is strong (and their roles are wasted). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch were worthy of it. However, the whole thing can be very funny in a trashy way. As with Robbins, everything is about sex and nudity. If you're looking for fun ... and you're not too sober ... this might be for you.
