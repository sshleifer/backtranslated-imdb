Then I can see a good movie movie. I have seen quite a few things. However, this is one of the few films of a grotesque movie. Like the gore movies are fun. I like Wen behind them is a great creativity. The gore of this film is not creative. It's sick It's unrivaled. It's totally unpleasant. That's why this movie is not entertaining. The movie is a horror movie, but it's not afraid. So, the only reason to watch this movie is the only reason, but that's the worst and worst part of the whole movie, and that's a great deal. The play is awful, the plot does not make sense, music is really annoying and even electronic. Everything took me out of the movie. It is enough for the entire film to be long and depressing. There is a terrible shock in a shuttle and he awakens in the hospital to find the melt and melt of the skin. I think then he goes out and tries to try to slow the process of melting the human flesh. There are some strange sub-planes that cover some old dog behind a dog, undo some heads that flow down the stream and a man's electrocuting end. I made a great effort to enjoy it at that time, but it was entertaining because I thought the only scene in all the films I thought was sitting in the beginning, a nurse was immersed in a cellar corridor. If you like evil, evil and unpleasant horror films, this is for you.
