'A Smile LIY Yours', it really does not make sense with a pathetic comedy. I do not mean that the story is complicated, but the whole plot is based on one thing: couples who have not succeeded in understanding the children and expensive despair. People who tried to hard-hearted had to forget about the adoption option, this movie is not like it. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly plays with Jennifer Robertson, contradicting everything that women's liberation movements offer. , with almost no independent exhibitions. The character is boring, because the dream housewife is in her head, but has children. Like Greg's curious comedy love, Greg Kinnear presents her husband, she also has no identity, no independence, and with us, she does not show any interest. <br /> <br /> Both characters are boring and often annoying, and they are practiced almost exclusively on comedic issues, creating pairs of things that can lead to pregnancy. Exceptionally, they do nothing except to go to a fertility clinic, and they make a lot of money to do what they can do in their privacy (except in vitro fertilization). The land is almost casual, but the pair does not work hard to create a strange situation. They go to this clinic. So what? <br /> <br /> Parek's loyalty to the couple, in order to prove the moral element necessary for the story, because the couple intends to think their children together. Jennifer works in a new age shop with her friend (she plays with Joan Cusak) and is working to develop aphrodisiac. Christopher MacDonald plays the buyer and Jennifer is a buyer of a beautiful price for her and her friend's product. Subplot is not much interested (although Joan Cusas is quite funny), <br /> <br /> Danny (Kinear) is an architect and offers you the opportunity to cover money to cover the architect. The bills of the clinic, taking on a Seattle job, his boss is a huge seducer (also a terribly and helpless woman), who tries to make Danny (that is, as mute and righteous) when things are the same with him and his wife (for reasons that I do not want) . Jill Hennesy plays a role, but his character is predictable, and Danny is very formulated as a necessary element for the creation of conflict. He's stupid and it's hardly interesting anymore. <br /> <br /> The overall movie is very boring and it's almost fun (save the scene and save the air flight). The land offers nothing appealing. Although there are two people who are trying to fully understand the story, writers could find some hilarious ridicules for their development. Secondly, the main characters are completely boring. They are silhouettes of silent comics in the 50s without a happy woman and a husband. Therefore, despite the fact that there were no mistakes on the plot, the characters themselves did not offer any interest, much less fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Cuzak would make it a fun story too (sometimes as it is here in its premiere). This is definitely overcome.
