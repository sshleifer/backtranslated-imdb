"Lorna Doone" I read about 20 years ago and I really love it! The western country of the 1600s is a classic historical love that took place during a few days in London, when it was much more difficult to enforce law and order. Unfortunately, this version of the book covers many freedoms with the story, and I think it was very much considered. The production and production values ​​are good, but the story was badly felt. Why do TV adaptations? Why would they think thousands of books would like to change the story ??? One of the great mysteries of life !!! The BBC made a great version of Christmas, beginning in the 1990s on TV, and I'm still trying to find a copy! Take my advice, read the book and do not worry about this modest version!
