I have to admit that the shorts I read with the corresponding films before seeing film adaptation. Nineteen eighty-four cases are rare. The book was excellent. Immersive and interesting is prophetic. But the movie was sucked. The movie I've ever seen is the worst. After the first 5 minutes I did not deactivate the reason to watch the movie that half of a class was half of an assignment. She was dark and grotesque, but she did not do anything to make the right match. The performance was not above the average, and considering that there was not much action, this was very disappointing. The book, for example, did not tell me that Winston could cover more than one syllable. Film, disturbing and visually unpleasant, the book was completely cannibalized. Waiting ... Is not the British?
