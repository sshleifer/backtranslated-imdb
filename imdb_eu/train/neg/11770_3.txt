'P' (or Club-P) should really be called 'L'. Every festival has a great disappointment and fails to fulfill its long-term lifestyle: "Thai lesbian monsters fight." But this is a story of a tale that gives a girl from the American cosmos a story, some extravagant (but accurate) rules: "do not go under a fabric", "do not eat raw" and "do not accept money to get your powers." Well, guess what people, girls move to Bangkok to smash money as 'bar-girls' and manages the rules grandmothers teaches her, which then spoils the evil spirit that appropriately kills 'foreigner John' who warns her to pay her services. <br /> <br /> This film can not be published in Thailand, because it is controversial because the Americans will find an image of ho-hum horror with "Showgirls" and "The Vampire Dialogue". "As directed by Walt Disney. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < a movie about a brothel and one of the actors is a Thai star of real life, in the "Lesbian angle", a short one and a couple of "I love you" to prove that two main stars are the couple (frate) and the only dance club in the planet P-tavern It should be: girls keep their saronxes and do stunts of carnival (a sword is a girl who cuts her mouth in the mouth). <br /> <br /> No nudity, no real monster NO (if you do not count with that Thai eye of four footwear) , and ADULT has never paid any stupidity to the DVD. You have warned!
