When I heard about "Solar Crisis", I received a cast charge, I asked why I had never heard a big movie. Then I saw it. <br /> <br /> I know now. <br /> <br /> An outdoor space, a sun, a wide desert and a large metropolis movie, this is incredibly firm and claustrophobic. ; It seems everyone approaches the camera that it does not have to go too far. <br /> <br /> And the effects are good; planet Earth will be destroyed, if a group of scientists and soldiers can not divert a solar clock. But despite the shining, sweating and glittering glitter, there is no sensation of emergency. <br /> <br /> Do not start me about cast. Anyone guesses that Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle and the movies will not have to try to feel in the movie. You are looking forward to those who have not paid for other Hollywood condos ... <br /> <br /> And to the end, however ... Well, let's say it is tense and interesting but too small. late such an effort. Keeping that pace in the whole movie, I might hear a "Solar Crisis" earlier. <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mostly missed opportunities and bad career moves. <br /> <br /> Why does this Alan Smithee keep this way?
