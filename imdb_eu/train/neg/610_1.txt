I purchased a cheap movie for sale, read the back of the DVD case and I would not lose it, if it was not litter, if it were good ... <br /> <br /> Then I saw ... <br /> <br /> I'm usually a fan of Christopher Walken, but this movie showed a very small screen, even if it did not like it. It seems that the death of a friend from the beginning of the "action" on the ground is very low, and his last revenge is boring and strange. <br /> <br /> Normally it's a movie with themes. Revolution and revenge are capable of capturing the audience and the characters are capable of feeling something, but there are some random events that are mixed up in this film and there are some conclusions that might end up ... <br /> <br /> At that moment I cried ... <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on the eve of the most painful eve. r was suffered, where the pilot sacrificed to jump on an explosive truck because any civilian did not jump to refuse the scene is not so sadly sad that it is terribly and extremely painful, although not bad as injured emergency surgery. The performance was very bad, the script and the story were weak, the "action" was even weaker, and "images" were not just that sight. In short, there are good movies, bad movies, so good movies, good movies ... <br /> <br /> And then at the new level is "McBain".
