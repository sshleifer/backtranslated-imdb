It's like Miike Chabrol, alternating with dreck with art, sometimes mixing two? Does Chabrol meet fifty-fifty / fifty? Did we see too much or too much of Miike? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. However, I could only mention ten thieves, citations and clich√©s of Chakushin (One Missed Call). Others, most of them will hit them, not even Ochiai Saimin (hypnosis), perhaps, to try things out of supernatural television.

Ishibashi Audition retreated into a wicked story, and Dead or Alive's Boss Aoki, milk-drowning and other things, might have been the most likely actress ever seen. So here's a cop.
