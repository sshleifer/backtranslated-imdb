Crow's favorite was my budget, when the car came out of the abyss, "the movie is so bad, even if he wants to get out of the car!" <br /> <br /> This was the funniest movie I had to be. never seen He was happily out, even the funniest! If it were not for Mystery Science Theater I would not be here! :-P
