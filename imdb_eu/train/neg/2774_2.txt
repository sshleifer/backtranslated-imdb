It's just a bad movie. It seemed to be a lot better when it was a nice budget. It was almost over The hero is almost like a hero like Salma Hayek, a heroine like Jackie Chan, just like battles and duels like Crouching Tiger ... just like in music, for example, Conan ... But in the end it is sad and difficult to find something interesting. Maybe not just John Rhys-Davies's heroes of the duel, or the aforementioned tigers, I'm ashamed of old John. In the end, it's a good actress, and it's much better. So, like you - so you still have a chance to see something else.
