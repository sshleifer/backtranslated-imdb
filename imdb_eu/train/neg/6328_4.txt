Why does this movie fall under the standards? In the end, the answer is enormous generosity. I have to say that Travolta is medium and medium (I have to say that I have to look like a black dapper, even if it's a big box) and Gross works well with two 'clad' youth suits, but nevertheless New Yorkers open nightclubs they did not show it. On the other hand, seeing other films is boring. It is totally boring to know that it is not worth it at any level in the incident of the movie. Kelly Preston gave her a sexual appeal, and so her husband and wife Travolta, a sexual dance, is one of the pleasures of the film. Charles Martin Smith is quite funny in the KGB's "Bob Smith" KGB honor. Personally, would the movie be better if I had changed the plot for a bit, if the settings were not changed from the NY "Indian Springs, Nebraska" (Soviet Union?), You will understand that you watch the movie ... It looks like the movie was released in 1986 for the premiere of 1987. Paramount, in January 1989, stopped the movie as a result of alleged plots. They said they thought it was "impossible". However, this $ 6,000,000 film won more than just $ 163,000 more than shameful before it was released just before live video in places like Texas and Colorado. This is the overall quality of this film.
