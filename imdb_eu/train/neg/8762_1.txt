A scientist (John Carradine - unfortunately) knows how to lead the dead man's life. However, they have returned with marble faces. In the end, all this involves disaster. <br /> <br /> Poor, totally predictable departure from 1940. This frightened me a stupid child, but I'm bored now. I had to struggle to stay awake! With an exception, the play is awesome. These boring and boring activities! Extinct <br /> <br /> There are some good things about this: despite the script, Carradine is very good. And there are a few incredible little moments in the way of a fantastic fantasy. There is also one of the worst dolphins in the history of the Festival. However, all this is not so much fun to sit for. Avoid.
