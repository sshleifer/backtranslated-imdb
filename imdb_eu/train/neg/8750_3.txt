Aspiring filmmaker Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi) lives in a NYC apartment deal and trusts him with his mother for a rent. She has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals), whether she is getting married or not, but Aldolph is the star of her movie. Unexpectedly, when a strange man named Joe gets out of his film's hopeful funding, he has done it. That is, until Joe puts an Al Porsche loan into a robbery adventure for a trance of a Porsche. The film will be made before Aldolph is totally unheard of? And will Angelica be the movie? That is, in the viewer's opinion, a horrible movie. The script is abysmal, with a plot of wandering. Beals bumps all their lines and, despite being pleasing, Buscemi does not describe it. There are plenty of unpleasant material to throw and great characters to launch. In the end, the value of production is also very bad, so that the film is at the secondary level. If it is in the hands, it is still a good idea to not miss this movie. But if you are a proverbial glutton of calf, go ahead and see the bad thing. In the end, Beals looks beautiful.
