This movie showed David Mamet more hate of the Jewish race than he found in an American movie. In this sense, the stereotypes are overcome, the ability to continue the observation is dead. I was so disappointed by Joe <br /> <br /> Mantegen was calling a bunch of males, sitting at the Jewish center in New York, where I was feeling good, and I stopped. I am deep in that the Jews are not Americans and the concept of "different". Mr. Mamet, I say, is a cause of no hatred.
