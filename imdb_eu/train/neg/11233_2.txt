As I can tell, though the first comments published by other comments, this movie is available for DVD. I only found a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> It's in the Value DVD label and I've paid more than 98 cents for more taxes. I found them in a 98-centimeter store, with plastic pallets and pallets available for disposal. Do you not even have buff states to tighten the clay money for the Swedish edition of limited edition edition? I thought that way. <br /> <br /> This movie cost 98 cents. 99 cents, I would argue with you. But it's clearly 98 cents. And keep in mind that they pay. Slasher only for the movie maven.
