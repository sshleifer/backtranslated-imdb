Jameson Parker And Marilyn Hassett's unbelievable pair with John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. The direction of Larry Peerce moves uncontrollably between black farts and Roman tragedies. Robert Klein definitely thinks they are the first and emphasizes the lack of balance and chemistry between the players of the film in a small role by himself. Normally, I do not like to leave it so pretty, but Bell Jar is one of my favorite books, and to see what they are doing, I'm completely mad.
