This movie is so scary, it's hard to find the right words to describe! <br /> <br /> At first the story is so ridiculous. Can write a better plot than human beings! The actors are boring and unfeasible, maybe they were forced to play in this cursin movie. <br /> <br /> The National Forest Camera Receptors are the whole movie. I would feel anxious because I paid for this bad image. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, no-one will make a movie or a similar movie that will make a story worse :-)
