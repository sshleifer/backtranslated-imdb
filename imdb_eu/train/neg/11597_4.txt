I'll make it through, as it survives in the previous part of the Nightmare series, finds Freddy Krueger's dead dream again. This time, the murderer kills Alicia's intelligent child's intelligence. His intention is "born again" in the real world. Freddy's only paralyzing person is his mother dead, but is the issue to release his daughter to save his son? This movie was very successful when they saw Alice dreaming that they had been admitted to the room and being raped by 100 Manics and taken to the hospital, but then she was not pregnant, but Amanda was at the time of Freddy. <br /> <br /> Only two single people returning from Alice and Dan's fourth film, and later, they've got some new friends before Freddy starts to die again. The first dead I liked. It's not as good as death or dreams. <br /> <br /> It seems Freddy himself was not afraid of this movie, the nightmare was just boring, not scary or horrible. <br> /> <br /> In cinematic performance, it was good for a series 5 movie, but overall, I think the movie was really dull. (Still not the worst movie in the series), Freddy Dead is the worst. <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
