Holy # #% and this movie was still hot and pile up. I tried to see this pile of waste, but it was easier to throw off the wrists, and the Lysol's floor sweeper was over half of the load on my screen. This I found below what I saw in cinema or on TV, and he says something. Once I saw a cow shit in one area. I saw a steamy battery that consumed an hour and a half, who knows ... maybe something would move. Well, it was time spent better than the time. The play did not exist, the plot is somewhere else than this movie. I think they have seen the first time they managed to escape from the plot and I think that Steven King was hoping to become a shi77er in the back of an old storage truck. Please tell me that the director gets desperately needed medication. It is clear that he needs heavy medication and I would be willing to save the necessary reverse money from his lobotomy. Bah ... I can not have a full punch that needs to be given for this review, because it never hurts to make justice just the word written. Let me tell you to spend some time and see if Chilton looks over you in your car, walk the car, start the engine and then push your fists directly to the fan. your bones are already shaking. Make sure your wallet is available because of the loss of money. You may also be privileged to lose yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw this when a "friend" sent me a girlfriend to see me. It was difficult, too. What's worse is that $% and @ have to see this thing twice! I've heard of married now and visit their balls every month. I'm looking forward to this movie.
