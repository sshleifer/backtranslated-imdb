I loved the original Azumi observation, a live action manga mix, a compelling story, a cool soundtrack, a songwriter (Kitamura rock!), An edition, and not just a part of that beautiful full Aya Ueto. So I wanted to see Azumi 2, but after seeing it, I felt a lotus win and I missed the card: (Azumi 2 is the one left by Azumi, but these are completely 2 different films, the rhythm is slower, the action is not so exciting and Choreographed, and there is a great development of nature, which is apparently directed by the same man who directs the TOHO monster franchise (if that is possible!) Note: I agree with other opinions that I have missed, if only Ryuhei Kitamura continues With this installment, however, there is a beautiful landscape of the Japanese forest, while slowing down the slow action, there are few characters that die a bit, but also bad ones, they can easily die without fighting too much. In a flash of Monkey!) It was about bamboo in the woods and a memorable fight scene. In Azumi 1, we had a scene of a battle camera with a camera camera effect Tell us, Azumi 2 has brought us the Azumi camera camera! In the end, Azumi's mix was not sure, but Aya still works well. He looks great in a cape ... but where did he get it? I do not think this I see again. ... what a pity!
