This movie describes the experiences of a couple of successful men (one of them Burt Reynolds), a prostitute and two afternoon reps over a night in Miami for a few hours. In the same vein, all people meet together in a place and time. The movie was very entertaining, but it was a serious problem all night long and many scenes were literally emphasized to see what was impossible. In a few scenes you can see the "storage" process for storing images. Someone did not know how the movie camera worked. It's amazing that this movie was released too!
