Haunting is another horror remake with a fake exaggerated special effects and a large group of favorite screens and does not have a quality repayment for cinematography. So, remakes are not bad for remixes targeted by Jion Da Bont. I think the actors of the A-List (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) warn us of a terrific plot, special effects ridiculous and awful attempts to frighten audiences. Do not worry about the characters and stories that we are responsible for doing this. The story The Haunting Of The Hill House is like taking a classic novel and it is like extracting four chapters, and then everything that was left for the movie is so boring. and many are unknown. The characters are pretty fine and while the performance is good, you do not care about the characters. Lily Taylor gives her amazing performance and sounds like her 8-year-old. When it's old, it's a terrifying horror that it has not delivered the lines. Lily Taylor is not for the horror genre. The ghosts are stupid and cursive and they look like Casper's The Friendly Ghost and Hugh Cain seems like a serious man dressed as a crash-shaped Halloween. This shit is on the roof of one of the huge worm-mouthed mouths and it's not deliberately sad. It's nice and well-designed, surely, the only positive thing about this movie seems pretty nice, but that does not save everything else. I can tell by the fact that I was wasting the TV watching The Haunting. That's why I thought I'd pay more, but luckily it was on the Scream Channel. In general, Haunting is a bad version of the boring version, which is a bad attempt at horror.
