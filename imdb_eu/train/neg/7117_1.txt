Since the narrative movie begins, it warns us that when SCREAMING SKULL is terrifying, it is terribly terrifying - and if it happens, free burial will be guaranteed. Well, I do not think anybody was afraid of seeing this movie, but maybe they've been bored a bit. THE SCREAMING SKULL is Ed Wood's good looking movie. <br /> <br /> Based on the famous Francis Marion Crawford story, SKULL is about a rich but nervous woman married to her first wife. he died in mysterious circumstances. After installing it in the house, he paints half a gardener, a poorly carved portrait, paws, and, after all, the skull rounds up the room and cries a lot. And in his opinion, the actress Peggy Webber cries out shoutingly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for that it has the ability to film. The plot is quite transparent, at least, and while the expert is really good, the script is awesome and when the movie is so inspired you will be ready to scream. It's true, it's about seventy-eight minutes, but it's a lot more. Add this to a great print quality and you are there. <br /> <br /> There are so spectacular movies. It's true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has roughly a few, but the movie drags so much, I could not do it again and again, and all of you will run your head from the innkeeper. If it was not a scream with Peggy Webber, this is a cure for insomnia. Ask. <br /> <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
