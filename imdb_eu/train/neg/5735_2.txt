First of all, it's a low budget movie, so my expectations were very small. I think those who see the information for this movie want a bloodless one and, basically, that's all. <br /> <br /> Argument? It really is not there Basically it has been seen in China and much worse. Casts? There is no deadline. Special effects? In my opinion, it's totally horrible ... Some cuttings and blood were totally unbelievable, like splashes, splashes, colors, textures, etc. <br /> <br /> I thought that the purpose of this movie was supposed. brutal and shock film. Now, there was a bigger potential for the budget, but there was a lot of script, a bad conversation, a great performance, a videocamera that seemed like a video clip and an incredible "gore", this movie is really awesome. <br /> <br /> There are some movies that deserve some opinions, although the "b-rate" movie was worthy of some (it was worth it as it was worthy of the bloodstream, but it was worth it for the latest reviews). It was just awful. I hope that people who play this movie will read and comment on my comment. <br /> <br /> I'm all in the face of brutality and disturbances, but, in general, it is a terrifying experience that has real and horrible experiences. Save your time / money and other options, you will not be disappointed.
