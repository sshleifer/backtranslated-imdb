What a long, drawn and nonsensical film. I'm sure historically this movie is very enjoyable, but it goes on entertainment, it's not grade. Ralph Fiennes was in some fantastic movies, English Patient, Schindler's List, but this was left unattended. They do not seem to go anywhere, at the beginning it was so horrible that it was so strong and surprised that his "sisters" were never interested. Do not worry about paying for this movie, instead of buying a copy of the English patient.
