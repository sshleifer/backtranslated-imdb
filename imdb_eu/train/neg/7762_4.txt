Taking into account John Doe, I was inspired by the founder of Kyle XY, I expected his driver to be quite interesting. However, surely, I had great expectations, because it was very disappointing. First of all, it was a great idea to showcase its amazing knowledge to the audience in a public space. After that scene, I began to worry about entertainment. But the problem is that it has deteriorated and no other character has entered well. John Doe was too focused on them, this story was not very interesting. Dominic Purcell's performance was also disappointed because I did not find John Doe credible. Another problem was the police story. I really felt deja vu and it was not a pleasant feeling. The worst problem in the set leads us to an episodic format. It seems that the fillings follow each other. <br /> <br /> I was generally very disappointed and I do not recommend anyone. How bad it was, I understand better why I have left the show. To some extent, I have lost its end, which develops the characters, to find their identity. Sad because it was potential, like people who met the club. The quality of production was quite good and the questionnaire was correct. But I do not know if it would ever improve, I probably do not plan on the next section.
