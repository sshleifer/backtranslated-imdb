After watching this movie, I attended a panel discussion, filmmakers pointed out that this was not a movie, but a challenge to thought. Well, my thoughts from me are watching the movie being wasted. The film's abilities (documentary style, future environment) were supposed disturbances of a thoughtful study to discuss abortion. This movie illustrates the problem that people are trying to use as a platform for political films. The film that preaches the choir is usually very boring.
