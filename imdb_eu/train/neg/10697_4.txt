First of all, I thought the story and the script were bad credit for Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the best scriptwriters in Hollywood until his talent became blurred and retired. However, there were Preston Sturges, Preston Sturges, Jr. The story is based on the story "The Bottle Imp" by Robert Louis Stevenson. A good man will give him an evil mind, but he will condemn him to hell. Okay No one has to be original scriptwriters. The actors are fairly well-informed, with the smallest writings they have had on the screen. My main complaint comes with the end. The hero believes that he has found a way out of his problem, but he wants to solve the problem differently in an effort to save himself. At first he seems to have worked, but according to the code of the modern horror movie, they think they should give a horror movie. This is a stupid convention. The oldest horror films came well to win at the end of the hero. There is nothing wrong with it, mindful of the current crop of today's filmmakers. You can give a healthy and enjoyable audience and, finally, make you feel happy. Actually, I think it's better.
