I bought this DVD because it has it in the cart and it said mpaa ratings; "Violence and strong sex, sexuality, nudity and language" R. <br /> <br /> The IMO must correctly indicate; "Violence, sexuality, nudity and strong language." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Sexuality" should come up with the word "comma" and not "and", because of the difference. I think a lot of people who watched this movie will be in touch with me, sexuality and nudity do not exist. If I look at my first impression on mpaa rating, I will look at something like "vivid" films. That's why I was deceived. According to the story, it was so much news that the story was really inside the stunning carts. I know I'm not there. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is my opinion. <br /> <br /> Joseph
