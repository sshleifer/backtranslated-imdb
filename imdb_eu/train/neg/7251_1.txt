Great to say everything you hear about Western! First great effort! Well, I do not know what you saw the movie but it was another that I saw. They have characters that you believe in beautiful Western or any of the genre's, and this film has no one! The act was a bad thing to say at least and I could not care less about all the characters, making the whole movie meaningless. the story was too big for the makers, and maybe they should try it out manually for the "FACT OR FICTION" television fiction program to get a low budget landfill live. <br /> <br /> Please, you're looking for a good movie, a beautiful western or even half an hour, look elsewhere.
