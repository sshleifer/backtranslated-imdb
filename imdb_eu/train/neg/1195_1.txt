This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I can not tell how bad it is. Honestly, I wanted to kill myself several times with extreme experience to end my pain. I suggest you watch this movie, I suggest it is included in the acid, at least it splits pain without scars. <br /> <br /> I had so much hope when I read it on the back of the DVD. The case, and, at the beginning, when Jesus continued to follow me, I was excited ... at last, I wanted to kill myself. I mean access to the oddest characters of the twenty-three-minute history ... JUST PAIN! Monkey edited the bins that could make a better job. At least they poured feces and some rubbish was broken. It would be better not to see a horror. <br /> <br /> I did not get a joke, because they were not fun, they repeated twenty times as they did. times. It seems that there is nothing fun that you do not see a million times. <br /> <br /> Never miss this. People have named "Manos the Fate of" the worst movie in the world. I have also seen that and agrees that it is bad ... but ALA is just the second worst. The "worse" bus is much worse. <br /> <br /> This language must be hard, but I can not write it down, so let's imagine I swore a bunch.
