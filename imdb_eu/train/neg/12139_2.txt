I remember when that came out there were a lot of kids about it. I think I was too old to be excited and I was a fan of true martial arts films and I've always found that cheek a bit. <br /> <br /> In the early 1990s, we were disturbed by these programs. so that children can be struggling and have a power ranger for 3 children of the ninja. I think at last parents and filmmakers have fallen into such diseases; For all the drudgery we had in reality hit him and hit the crowd. <br /> <br /> They make a lot of children's films. and it's nice for your children to see and receive the message, this does not contain any messages ... it's more than a million items in less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The movie contains no visual features, but would you expect it? Playing is pretty bad. Victor Wong is a beautiful actress, but it was shameful to see him ... Until now he was a ridiculous, powerful and expert ninja. The kids played too much and Tum Tum was the worst actress I ever ever saw. <br /> <br /> Before anyone else knows the movie, it also has a plot before reading the review. 3 ninjas ... do you know they can fight bad guys and, of course, win ... I need to say more. I apologize for damaging me. <br /> <br /> That said, KIDS WILL BE EQUIVALENT. The film is aimed at children and children can only enjoy it. If your child does not care about watching movies for children, watch the movie is good. You do not mind if your children have a chance to see real martial arts, real or real-life junk, you've found a movie about your children ... I think children will think it's too much for me. Similar ... I remember all girls with heart-wrenching Rocky. 2 of 2 stars think that you can make a movie for kids and you can still be enjoyable for adults ... this movie was out of time ... it's cheerful and nothing original or unique, and I would not see the girl ... Kung Fu is on the DVD series and there are many great Shaw Brothers. . Why not show your children that they will really entertain themselves and do not make those dumb paths, they might even teach them how to kick the movements and not just the legs between their grandfathers as he did in Ninjas ... no ... Do not throw a man between his legs ... never ... that's it.
