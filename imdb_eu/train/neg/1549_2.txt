While Leon is very nice SNL, he only works for a minute. Like most SNL skits-to-movies, this can not be completed for 90 minutes. It has a nice moment (seen on the trailer) but the actors lose their wits. Tim Meadows does his best, but the plot does not have much. Will Farrell has a small part. Farrell might be a fun, alive man ... but not in this movie. What a shame!
