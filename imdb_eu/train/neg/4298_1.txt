Tremendous confused, wicked and at last playful; "horses, oh God, horses!" Thriller Sometimes it's horrible, but it's one of the worst scriptwritten ever written in the horror movie. Look how in the last 10 minutes everybody makes a "magic" plot on what's going to happen in the "resolution". Bland's performances with Richard Lynch, especially eccentric. Video transfer is a real hack movie, making it harder to cut the scene and make it harder to understand. 0 stars 4 stars.
