Jay Leno himself does not recognize this film for a reason. It's one of the worst movies of all time. The play is horrible, lack of writing direction and the director does not seem to be sure how to make this film. "A friend movie", "action / comedy", "mystery". He thinks he goes across the middle of the road and goes along the route. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated interpreters. It's time for pies and gifts to be wasted by making a mess of a movie. Before collaborating with Jay Leno and Pat Morita, the Hollywood circuit shook hands. Mr. Morita already had a star with himself, continuing in the mid-1960s, such as "Happy Days" and "Mr. T and Tina" worship as the star of television and classic film. He won the American hearts in the "Midway" shorts, "The Karate Kid," and many others. Mr. Leno has been shown in the mid-70s television programs. He was a great performer at America's comedy clubs. It can be seen in many television stations and in big movies. It's a pity, they agreed to see that nonsense.
