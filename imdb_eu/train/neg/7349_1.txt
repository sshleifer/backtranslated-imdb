I watched Polyester's first film, John Water, and I must say that the movie "worst" I've ever seen has been. <br /> <br /> The water "talent" team included several people. I'm sure I worked with food and I wanted to say the lines that Waters had written. It's a horrible thing about the movie, acting, camera, editing and a story about a woman from a book of 300 gods was nonsense. <br /> <br /> That said, I have to recommend this movie because that's it. It's very funny, and you do not believe the poor Francine is going on. His son has solvents and the female feet take away bright foods. Her daughter is the slutest slutest town. Husband Little Francine is ashamed and emptied of a porn-smoker's A-hole. Frank, Francin, has his only friend Edith Massey, probably the worst actor ever. Edith looks and sounds, reading a cue card and never shooting before recording. <br /> <br /> Although Francine's work, Waters generates a fantastic ending of Hollywood and everyone (who is still alive) is always lucky.
