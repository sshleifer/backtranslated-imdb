Here is one of those short films made to learn unknown people about life events. This time the recipients are the girls of prete, the life is menstruation. This animated film created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently by Kotex sponsors. <br /> <br /> The hormones begin with the explanations that grow and develop. With the help of animation and with the help of the woman narrator, it shows how the body works, especially in the ovaries, the uterus and the vagina, and why everything generates menstruation. It's almost amazing to find a comic book here, how to prevent the sex issue. This word is never referred to as "furtilized". I do not know why I saw it, but it is one of the rare short films that could give the impression of innocent time, you might want to try it out.
