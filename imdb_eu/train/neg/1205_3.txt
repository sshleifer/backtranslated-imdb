What is this? A Canadian-produced zombie movie I've never heard before. A wizard recently works in a young man's body. This allows for the retardation of this type, showing how the guy got it. Basically, he and his friends went to a cemetery on Friday, the 13th, and they raised the dead for their strange songs. Cut the morgue into the place where life is given to our body and kill the wizard and owner (who takes their eyes). Last WTF? He shot the funeral owner with a sweater directly and cries out: "I'm not mad!" It's amazing, he's turned to the eye. <br /> <br /> It runs in just 58 minutes, which is undoubtedly a curious zombie movie. It felt like a lot of time, but it did not allow me to enter into a kind of trance that I could not observe. One of these films also has "if you see the image, divert it from the screen". Is the image of an ancient man in the theater (prophetic?) And it will appear (twice only) when blood is emitted. The scenes are very mild for a period of time. There is a giant zombie cutting his right hand with a shovel, but - when he leaves his hand fake in the frame, his left hand is.
