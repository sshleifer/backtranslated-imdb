STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> McBain (Gary Busey plays the name before becoming a synonym The character of the Simpsons) is an orthodox police (usually), who gets the results but thinks it rotates something. At the beginning of the film, avoiding the loss of his partner, the plot takes another turn, and is seen as an assignment to travel to Mexico, where only super smashing super-unbelievable Americans and the smuggling of imagery. kidnapped, along with the crew, by a group of terrorists. <br /> <br /> Search for cheap (also 80 standards), this enterprising short film was a strange career by Gary Busey. Mr. Joshua's hairy light. The movement carries the cardboard character here, always as sharp as ever ("butthorn" makes commercial bad guys), but without material protection. The presence of Henry Silva is as bad as the screen, but it is totally wrong here as an Arab head (in a red cape!) And, thanks to its stunning screenplay, it's really a dreadful interview that looks like a dazzling black wooden wood. The character of the action film is one of many actors, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who will appear but fail in the mix. In the first part of the exciting, without exciting action, things get a little bit at the end, but it's too late and it's not a fun task to manage. *
