I saw the entire movie through the shameless ending, though I was annoyed at what I saw. I felt that the director asked for help, and that was the best way to get it done. Since I was living in the UK, I love this country, but this movie represents the worst way for British youngsters. No need to say, but avoid, angry and ill. People involved should be ashamed.
