Reasons to see this ... Hit ... a tribute to a great movie called Se7: - Your channel is surfing and nothing more. - Someone lets you pay. <br /> <br /> Please, do yourself a favor and DVD on Se7en, rent it, download it to iTunes or put it in Netflix version and skip the Block completely. The same story with the same magazine. In addition, the edition is made with Se7en and it really comes out more than once. The worst thing is that it is probably the desert helicopter shots, the sound of the people who joke on the radio, if they do not fly over these police helicopters. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. knock If you want to be pleased, call a tribute, go, but go on a journey to Se7.
