"White Noise" has been a great potential for "The Exorcist" among most of my films. As EVP believes it to be true, it's easy to get through the terrifying real event. There are not many movies that really suggest fear in people. As I said, it may have movies, but not. The film itself weakened the horror movie of the PG-13 class. Nothing "ring" or "sixth sense" in any way. Someone should really get into the horror film industry and just do a movie that has not been thought of, but we all jump on everything that a horror movie has to do. I honestly feel the PG-13 Horror Genre because it has become its genre. We need old days back, blood and gore days, Freddy Kruger, Jason, The Mike Myers Days. Few films may think that mental thinking is NOT a scary thing. So why try to pull? The great jumping of this movie is the amount of money in the most endless history of the film, without resolution ... do not waste money in this movie.
