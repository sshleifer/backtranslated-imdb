Christmas Survived (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O 'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. With a girlfriend, a yuppie bell does not want to stay alone at Christmas, decides to return home in childhood, which is the functional family that now lives and is thrown out as their family. Affleck, especially with a glittering smile, unleashes his malignant and unbalanced character as a rupture, but Gandolfini and O 'Hara breathe a bit of life into this mess. It's also a fartsa, its dizziness is horrible, scene and scene is not much sensible, and its sentimental messages are as fake as Affleck's fake. 91 min., PG-13 classification. * Â½
