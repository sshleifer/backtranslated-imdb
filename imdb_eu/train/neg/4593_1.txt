As a physicist, I have learned from many stupid teachers and other experts in the field. As I continue with my studies, I learn more and more about real-world physics experiments and people who do good things. <br /> <br /> Then my friends tell me about this "physics movie". to see it I do not know anything, I'm excited, I hope the information will be presented well. <br /> <br /> I have done REAL QUANTUM mechanics; That's not it. <br /> <br /> This movie will be anything that happens with a subatomic particle with a basic supposition, and if you open your eyes, it will happen to you. Think for a moment for a moment. <br /> <br /> Our body has about 10 ^ 30 subatomic particles. Billion billion billion particle! The quantum effects of quantum "mysterious" "quantum" two particles may have the potential to completely disintegrate each other. Adding more and more particles to the mixture makes it impossible to have a quantum outcome. We believe that it is a valid assumption, without which there is no rationality ... it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> My friend, in physics, and I counted 3 events in this movie's career. But they were presented as misleading as I saw. <br /> <br /> I can not say so much for the part of the movie's part because I do not have any medical training. It seems to be a bit more true, remembering biology in my days, but I can not say it. <br /> <br /> At least this film had a passionate quality: the scene of peptides (or whatever) were really). Not to ruin the immense plot that drives this movie, but the main character goes to wedlock, where peptides see all kinds of personalities "guided", and then the movies fall into the dance floor. Among the people who dance, sometimes surrounded by CG peptides, and completely CG scene filled with peptides. At that moment, we were trying to say that the movie was "addicted" to emotions, the whole song "Love Addicted to Love". This scene was freed up, anyone who could go through that scene, and that anyone who still considered this movie ... well, you should open your eyes.
