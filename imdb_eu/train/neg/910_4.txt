The story line was a very straightforward and easy way to keep track of and there was a lot of trivial comedy that was boring. Some viewers find it funny, but I like it more. <br /> <br /> Some well-known Swedish actors are in the movie and their performance is decent according to the script. Lena Endre was as good as ever. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the original movie, so I can not say it's better or worse. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan, this movie might be worth a look.
