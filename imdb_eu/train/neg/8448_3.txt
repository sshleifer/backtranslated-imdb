It's a horror comedy that is slither, horror or comedy. It's a very good scene with a scene, the number of zinger works, but there's little real fear and not enough humor to keep the movie. In addition, the script does not focus on heroes and heroes. It moves away from different places. <br /> <br /> The main fault of this film is that he presents his heroine (Fillion) and continues to do so. Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) is the first to enter and become a monster. This part of the movie is dragged: Michael Rooker's character has not been interesting to us as a person, and it might be interesting if he was watching it for some reasons, if he were interested in monster Grant - Portrait of a man Into A Monster, a horror comedy alien invasion movie . The latest analysis is in the scams of this movie: it is not important how the audience mumbles or how it diffuses. A horror comedy aims to protect the hero in the right corner, and then throw away mistakes, whenever it's horrific or annoying. Instead, we analyze the alien customs and tactics that drag this part of the film. The heroine of the church (Elizabeth Banks Starla Grant) is part of this, but I think the movie has left its narrative track, unless Grant Grant finishes off. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < According to this point, people know - and the characters must know - Grant is not just suffering from a disease, and according to that act (shotguns) - they constantly parley with more and more evidence that "let's get it." to a hospital ", although their reactions are both human and genuine, they are characters from an action movie and they just have to do something they ordered the movie, it has little idea of ​​an unfinished movie scene, which is a mistake. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** After the first confrontation and after the stranger larva stranger (low age) the character and maybe the best movie scene) the script once again betrays the movie. At this point, a character extraterrestrial He develops a vision and takes a vision of the alien. The writer-director (Gunn) chooses this character a completely new character, one of the smallest characters that have already been developed. Why? Why should a completely new character enter into a film that transforms more than an hour into the plot? ? At the time the character is attacked, we know little about it and can not even care about it, even in its spa have a passionate teenager Gunn decided not to use that character and if he used one of the few established characters, he could totally avoid entering his family and save time and money. In addition, the heroine and heroine would be filled with alien planets without any additional characters, and could sooner outsiders get out of reach. <br /> <br /> My latest criticism is based on the appearance of the movie. Gunn is the main writer, or perhaps the budget limits, but this film is ugly and interesting. Most of the action takes place at night in a forest or in a field, and the screen only looks bad. Wheelsy sets (fictional action case) seems cheap. The whole movie seems cheap. Mojo's Box Office said that the movie had a budget of $ 15 million, the newspapers reported $ 29 million and the talent that they did not know, the money would not appear on the screen. The monster is disgusting and rarely lethal. <br /> <br /> The final criticism is based on the reality of the actions of the character. When Fillion and Co began to hunt a scholarship / foreigner, a woman disappeared and we know that Grant is a boy. At that moment I expected the FBI or at least the State Police to appear and kill the Sheriff. A woman has disappeared and is likely to die, and a local is psychotic. The time to call authorities. But basically, I expected that this would happen, because I wanted some character to show ACT. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is a horror comedy that is apparent, the most similar movie is Dreamcatcher. Awesome invasions and monster types and intentions. Dreamcatcher had a lot more trouble with the story (especially Morgan Freeman) and, above all, the end was much stronger, especially since the main characters were stronger, but more important. Although it may be anathema - a film that preferred the overall plot and structural backbone for the weaker production values ​​- shows how I am not interested in Slither's appearance.
