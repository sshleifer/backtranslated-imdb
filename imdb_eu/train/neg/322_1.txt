5 years ago I watched the movie, and I'm still remembering today. I was completely aware of what to think was that this was horrible, so I'm guilty. But like most, I did not think everything was negative. Being a fan of Sandler, it seemed unthinkable that one of his films might be bad. I thought it was just Sandler's haters. I could not go wrong. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a second great comedy that is not fun. That's really pretty full. You would think in a 90-minute comedy, if there were something strange about the fun in the distance. But no, it's horrible. It's not "bad good", it's just bad. You can not laugh, you can cry. Wait until you wait for a joke at least to whistle, but they will never come. <br /> <br /> See the Ring The film? Where do people watch a video tape and die 7 days later? If the film were in a video tape, people would immediately kill him by his hand, and they would smile at his face as soon as they realized the agony, and that would be the first smile they played. > <br /> You will be glad to see what is bad, to see what is not capable of stopping your curiosity. No Please, no. Believe me, I'm doing a good job. There are 2 people in the world, Going Borda is the worst movie ever made, and those who have not seen it yet.
