Warning: this film tells a lot of love stories without coherence. <br /> <br /> The intention of this movie is to show love in a variety of ways. <br /> <br /> Each story only takes a few minutes, so there is no development of the characters and there is hardly any plot. A pure idea of ​​a land. The writer wanted the audience to surprise them in different settings. However, this is not the case, you were not familiar with the characters before or were "jokes". <br /> <br /> It's a movie about love that does not reach your heart. . Twelve times. Or even I do not know and I do not like it.
