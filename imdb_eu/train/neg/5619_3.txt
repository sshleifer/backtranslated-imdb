First of all, I can say that I agree with the basic thesis of the film, surely, that there was no historical Jesus, and Christianity is false. That said, this film makes a pretty bad job of checking thesis. He makes good arguments: The difference between the theoretical life of Jesus and the Gospel writing, that is only filled with Paul's writings. Jesus does not express a historical Jesus, and then he completely fails to argue. Without presenting evidence based on statements, it makes broad statements and clearly sets out the arguments against Christians apologized. There is a lack of intellectual, emotional, and serious disputes. The only Christians we listen to in the film are the leaders of the old filmmaker; That is to say, it is like a reasonable and rational person, who tries to treat him with a shoulder chip, and some Christians apparently found a parking chance. I apologize, but most of all, Christians do not know that their religion is much more than just the exact cause of Christian cruelty. You can also say that Jay Leno has confirmed that Michael Dukakis has existed in his Jay-Walking segment. Interviews with experts may be of interest, but it is full of excessive films, honest, filmmaker being noisy. In the first five minutes, Jerry Falwell, Charles Manson and Left Behind, writers along with David Branch. And finally, the film becomes so self-centered that there is no rational argument, the former Christian is angry at people and in times of childhood malignancy. You know, perhaps this film might be interesting, but it is losing in the documentary about Jesus' historicality and is so happy that it dissipates any sympathy. This is a Michael Moore movie, combined with humor or movies, with Richard Dawkins's book, without any nonsense or intellectual rigor. Jump.
