This movie is like extracting fish in a barrel. It's very easy. So I will challenge myself to accept the positive aspects of Little Man. First of all, I'm surprised with special effects. Marlon Wayans's heads really bind themselves to the body of a small person. I never doubted for a minute. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I loved some of the unexpected cameo. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant, and the interpretations of "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' On Up" did not work. John Witherspoon, by chance, played Gomer's father in Boomerang in 1992 (if you remember "coordinate with the mushroom belt" with the mushroom), now plays Vannes's father in Little Man. So it was fun. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie is as incredible as White Chicks. How stupid does the doctor say that a 40-year-old man and not a child? It has a whole set of teeth! How is it possible that no one notices that a baby is not? Little Man is so bad that Rob Schneider has a kameo. And please $ 8 if you have enough debris in the movie, make a good luck and DO NOT bring your child. This movie is too small sex (sex, joke, eating, etc.) for small children, and I felt ashamed that parents had to undergo projections for their children. If you want to see a stupid movie, your children will respect pain and suffering.
