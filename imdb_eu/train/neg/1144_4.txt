Summary: Dr. Markov has developed a new theory of how to unbalance the world with knowledge. He maintains his codified and secret knowledge and desperately wants it from the Soviet Union. On the other hand, the KGB desperately wants new technology. So they set up a scheme. During an attempt to release Markov, the KGB enters, Markov takes him to a secret location and reveals his secret in saying that he is in Sweden and working for the UN. As an official protection, the KGB kidnapped Markut's daughter's daughter. The CIA now sends its best agents to a team of Ninjas (Sweden) to fight the KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter. <br /> <br /> Comments: Although we have to see that it is not very good. The movie is pretty intense, but it's missing in many areas. First of all, it is very dark, probably hiding locations and bad effects, it is difficult to understand certain scenes. You can not see what's happening. The latter are martial arts that are missing, even though they are ninja movies. There are certain bad quality, but most of all, the ninjas create automatic guns or explosions. Automatic guns also pose a problem, because they seem to have an endless supply of ammunition. And the ninja seems almost like bullets, while Soviet guards are dying like flies. <br /> <br /> What is that then? Main idea and ambition. Some really, and especially, a Swedish movie, a fun action scene if not martial arts. Some beautiful slow movements and blood and noise. A very interesting technology for new weapons that break the heart or brain of the victims. Most of the sections you are looking for in a B movie. <br /> <br /> Because B-movie is not a mistake. But if you expect to see it as a B-movie, it's entertaining. But do not forget, it's not a B-film that is set in the eighties. Some girls, for example, say "interesting clothes" have deadly eye drops and make-up. <br /> <br /> In short, see the worship status and ambition. Enjoy it, then forget it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
