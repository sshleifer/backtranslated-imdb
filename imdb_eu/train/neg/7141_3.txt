Ok, so I went to this movie, I expected so much, I shot it fast and furious. Some nice cars, a decent plot. Unfortunately, I should say that this year's movie is the worst. Do not be disappointed that the cars were nice and the girls were fine, but the film was just a way to put together a blanket. The story never cares about the cast and the movie seemed simply to piece together. In general, this movie was never the longest, but if you're looking for a movie this weekend, I'd like to send it this time.
