Gwoemul (host) - He enters the deep beast mutated due to the contamination of the river Han. The youngest member of the park's family has been caught by the beast and is looking for the rest of the family until the beast becomes the last meal. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love the monster movies: Mutated bears, sized cat litter, packets with dragons of dodgy Komodo. Characteristics of creatures are my favorite horror film. So I really wanted the host, but it was not. <br /> <br /> There were three major problems with that: <br /> <br /> First you can see the quick page of the IMDb page <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br /> <br /> Gender too fucking. The comedy was very serious, and yet it was clear to any message in real message (although, in any case, it tried to make some statements, anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government). Drama was lost and confused with all the other mish-mash messes. Secondly, after the initial monster attack, there is almost nothing in the whole movie. The central family looks for itself The Korean and American governments do not seem to do anything. And that is, they just walk, occasionally stroking one another, supposedly a bit of comedy relief. This lack of action led to my attention, and apparently he did the same with the director, because all the lines are empty (Americans are completely oblivious to the evil mystery that has been invented and never repaired). br /> And finally, the film is a political film. Americans paint like stupid and evil, but they give us an American person that is not deeper than ordinary cartoons. The opening scene is the most intricate moment of America's innocent and wise men. With a Korean morgue assistant, his boss, asking for a coronary, did not throw chemicals into the Han river. The American Coroner helps him to utterly lie down by instructing him to continue forward. In addition to being a racist, he also has shorts and there is no excuse. <br /> <br /> Next to the result, the monster is good, relics and Deep Rising mix. Some of the effects of the movement are pretty cool, and fun at playing the park's early monsters. There are also shorts. Some of them remind me, surprisingly, how Firefly shot it (awesome cameras, spotlights, etc.). There is also a nice scene at the end, where the heroine and a boy who is sitting in the family of the baby. grocery store At nightfall and snow falls, the street lamp is giving a clear light, but the food store has a warm glow. This was totally disappointed by this film. I was looking forward to the films of a decent creature, and instead of a pseudo-political, I get a horror comedy. Commenting on the comments on the IMDb, I can not help, but I think it would have been a US production, if it were to be announced. Being a foreigner does not mean good. In recent years there have been excellent Korean films (for example, revenge trilogy and brotherhood), but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> I definitely go for change. Direct the direction, improve the script and this could be a nice movie. It is worthless for such no one worth any hour.
