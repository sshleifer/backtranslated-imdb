Like someone else says, it begins with a strange prologue about a little girl who dies with a cat. Then the main story: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) casually meet and travel to the mountains. First of all, the owner of the night stays in an inn in an inn, inviting the viewer to a harder and more gaffarian audience. Once they are looking for a refuge in the mountains and invites a stunning lady who feels pleasing to strangers (Hansel and Gretel, anyone). Next, I will venture to sort the viewer to sort myself. t. Now, I like Eurohorror, and it would be better if Artigot (writer and director) only made some essays on historical stories. Back (The Pyrenees) It is an excellent and interesting place in the case of mysterious and hidden cases. Green peaks may become darker and have supernatural powers. Photography is nice I want the whole thing to be meaningless. You can watch this movie on archive.org.
