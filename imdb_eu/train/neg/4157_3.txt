The previous one seemed to me a much better title under me and my suicides, when we decided to see this masterpiece of modern bullshit. <br /> <br /> Erotic, terrifying, thoughtful, well-thought-out, these are all things that are not faulty. . <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's so funny that slow sound effects and bad dubbing are added to one of the greatest comedies I've seen in recent years. However, this film is not trying to be fun, and this is one of the great achievements of the great films. It has become a comedy, even without making any effort to make fun. <br /> <br /> In an old man with an amazing look like the movie. Survive zombies around Santa Claus and the vampires are smashing on the floor. This movie did not believe me, if it were vampires vs. zombies, why did not you fight vampires and zombies? Yes, however, there were more errors for this wage than the title. Like this; A virus has occurred across zombies across America, like creatures that act like your average tourist. However, the entire film consists of four zombies. Another problem is that a store is everywhere that is empty. Surely you see a little zombie in the woods or in the back of the area. Indeed, I think they were walking in a forest circle, because they did not have enough budgets to shoot in a larger location, or the director did not want their precious time to shoot different in different ways. The wooden areas were busy sitting on the trailer, and he was worried about his failure. <br /> <br /> In fact, the director had so much fun that he did not have enough time to hire. enough cast or even editor. So, I thought eight zombies told me that they did not need to dress in different outfits and avoid having to change their name, and at the same time, when they started cutting in the movies, "editing is not a difficult task, right?" This one "movie" feature was the only reason we got into our purse with Freddy vs. Jason, because there is no such thing. At night, however, the gas masks were tightened and the only skirmishes that we were bound to prevent was the bad smell of that nasty. <br /> <br /> Yes, we finally laughed, but I'm sure it's lost ...
