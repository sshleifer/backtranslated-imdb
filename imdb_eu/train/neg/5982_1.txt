I feel very sorry to say that, but "Thunderbirds" does not generate any dust, it will not count thunder. I thought I had to get into the movies one time ago, I was lying in hopes of improving the movie. I had to be disappointed, he did not get any better, it was worse if it were possible. I'd still be thinking about seeing the movie as "usadio". They have had a great opportunity to make a great movie franchise here, they have lost their chance. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be embarrassed to say what they could say about this movie and Jonathan Frakes, ashamed and embarrassed, it would not be far from the truth. When I first watched this movie, when I was eager to see it, I grew up in the sixties with original shows. To say hello, it would be little. The last thing that I'm about to say about the movie was just a bit more wood than the wooden castles that were just a TV show.
