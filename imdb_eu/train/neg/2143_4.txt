I saw the original Disney Cinderella grown up, and I've always loved that so much tape has been spent a bit. <br /> <br /> That's why I was excited to see Cinderella 2 coming on TV and I can see it. <br /> <br /> I'd better find out. <br /> <br /> This movie is only part of the film that he had left behind. It's the absolute charm that is not original. It seems to me that it is quite rough and almost brutal (not) for songwriting. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I remember that a character tells a story through a song, the soundtrack of this film was set up radically and was not included. Becoming a man in Jaq is a great example: where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few here and there, and how tall he was to dance and sing! And in the room there is a country music of the old town of Granada. Writers have forgotten how and when they set this story as they forgot. Without a doubt, the high reliability did not fit. <br /> <br /> Cinderella 2 artworks and animations are also not violated by the original. The works in this movie seem pretty rough and less detailed. And we see a part of Cinderella hoop skirt, that is, it does not feel well. <br /> <br /> The movie may have its own story, I think that's just that. I would not say I hate it, but I think it had a lot of shortcomings. The origin of the beloved cemetery seems to have changed.
