I thought (as I did), with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese, that the movie should be at least a decent one. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have created some of the funniest comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> Really, apparently, I was very wrong, I have only one of the worst movies. never seen Keep in mind that you can joke one after another so deeply. I saw one of the most positive scripts that I wrote for these talented actresses. Based solely on the big names, I've kept my hope for a long time in the film's life, but it has steadily failed to give you any entertainment. <br /> <br /> Normally, I try both with movies and life. leaving aside previous comments and broad generalizations. But with this movie, it's hard to keep it. With one hand, perhaps two or three fingers, I can count this, I let them have larger Hollywood productions than this. This is one of the worst comedies ever made. <br /> <br /> I tried to enjoy it --- I really did. In the end, the outside eventually fails. If you want entertainment well, take the money and watch it while you go into the common roundabout. Please do not watch this movie.
