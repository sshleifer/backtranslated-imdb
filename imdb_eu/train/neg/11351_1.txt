With this MASSIVE advertising Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. He is getting it, and for that reason, my son decided to see it. Among the DVDs and theaters, I've seen almost everything (Incredibles, Shrek) very bad (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But that was the worst movie I have ever seen, no children or no children. Was this "stupid end up?" kind of experience OK, it is aimed at the children (or it's better to overwhelm the intelligence of 3-year-olds), but I have never seen anything that is foreseen, repetitive or slow. Then, when it's finally eaten, after finishing the movie, it's a strange thing if you're finally thinking of a joke configuration, but there's one, it's serious, but it's hard to tell what it's going to be. 3-D effects ... yes, if you have never seen a Viewmaster, there are not much (otherwise, if you do not look at the glasses on the screen, it seems the same process). Although my son finished bored. My wife and I We saw each other and we said "wow" at the end. In every way bad.
