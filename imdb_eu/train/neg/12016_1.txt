If Bob Ludlum wanted to watch this mini-series, he cried. Time and money got lost. I have read the book and, even if the movies are not exactly the books, CBS loses time and money and it is shameful to say that it was Ludlum's work. It may be the creator. Check out Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good this series was. <br /> <br /> Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign up to pinpoint this bottom? <br /> <br /> Horrible !!
