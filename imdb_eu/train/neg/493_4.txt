Dysfunctional family goes home for vacation and murder and despair. At home made the most violent sexy Milligan. It's much better than a home movie (it's mostly Milligans movies), that is, a trip to the 60's style of birth. The ugly film and sex is noteworthy for this film, which is not sexy and horrible, which is now more curious (though decisive). The film has a different imbalance and production is cheaper. (There was never a sure thing for yourself to swear in money since its break in the movies). His bad movie was not worth it, except for Milligan, or because people had good looks.
