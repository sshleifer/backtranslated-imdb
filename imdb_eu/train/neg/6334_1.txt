I watched a movie in 1979, when I was 17 or 18, when they released it. The theater was perhaps 1/4 full when the movie started. We went to see the movie in ten minutes with me and the two of us were friends in the theater. The movie was very curious and he did not have any books or arguments and people asked for money again. We decided to have a whole movie ... why they suffer such as torture ... ... that's why. We wanted to be a true movie critic ... when we wanted to have a standard for all other films. It's hard to say that you saw the best movie (10), which always gets better. However, it is easy to make all the other films in the worst movie (and this is ... a 1). There may be another movie 1, but I have not seen it yet. I base all the films based on a scale based on this scale ... I WANTED A CRITICAL PHOTO ... he.
