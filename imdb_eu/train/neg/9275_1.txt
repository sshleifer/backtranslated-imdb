Omen IV (1991) was a bad T. V. movie Since the end of the 80's, I believe that executive directors experimented with the accumulation (drug chosen in the 90s), because there is no other reason to explain. Why did you worry about that? T.v. movie What did they think of when the ideas came from the table? Even though they thought about this movie a second time. Perhaps they thought they could do it as a series? We never know But I know one thing. This movie was the main reason I did not buy Omen trilogy. They duplicated this two-dollar album rather than putting this "record". <br /> <br /> Omen IV is basically a restoration of the American average family of the first film. Instead of a boy of a extreme boyfriend, we get a horrible girl who lives in the area around her. If there are strong parenting skills, there will not be any devolution events in the past movies. These parents have to put a foot and do some real disciplines! <br /> <br /> It is not recommended, avoid the best price!
