It is difficult to know where this adaptation starts to get worse, because the book is a problem that begins with them. Alexander McCall Smith warns you that you are not the detective stories you read, but that there is an African view that is totally invisible and totally false. He has done for Botswana for Borat, which he has done for Kazakhstan - but not so much as the base. <br /> <br /> When I realized that, Jill Scott left me as an American singer / actor. Throw as Mma Ramotswe. If you want to imagine a non-African land, how is it appropriate to be a black African woman? She is not the only American on the cast; Mma Makutsi plays Anika Noni Rose. Both women are very far away, they are very young for playing roles and very glamorous. Both brutally kill local accents, and both are challenging so much for this brutality, because they fail to offer much more behavior. Scott's Mma Ramotswe is lightweight and soft. Rose's Mma Makutsi is an annoying bitch. <br /> <br /> The result is almost impossible. The Directorate-General rescues Lucian Msamati's presence only, which makes JLB Matekoni's performance a decent one. It makes it more intelligent and more vivid than in the books, but I find myself unable to blame Msamati because of this, it is a bright light in a suck. The contradictions between his performance and books are clearly explained by the yacht boards he writes. <br /> <br /> For me, McCall Smith's writing has always been very entertaining, though it's very bad. Do not want to edit. As a result, his books have grammatical experiments that are limited by scientists, characters that change name in the middle of the name. So, writers around this project have really made an achievement worse. <br /> <br /> The conversation is largely worsened today. The characters talk about "opening up" and "rewarding sensitivity". Mma Ramotswe and Mr. JLB Matekoni. Mma Makutsi cries for not being a computer, but constantly rebuilding hair, make-up and jewelry, I'm surprised I do not have a MacBook in his purse with his Visa card. <br /> <br /> So what are we here for? It is difficult to mess with that pure adaptation, honestly, I like that most of the original books are apocryphal. McCall Smith sings a fictional Botswana, black and non-threatening, full of fun and entertaining knowledge. She reads good reading language, but a kind of white person is like a black look. It's not true. <br /> <br /> Given this, it is not surprising that it is so much the same as this show. However, European and American public will also notice.
