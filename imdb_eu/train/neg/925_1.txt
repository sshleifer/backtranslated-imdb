well, f * ck this film rules. Undoubtedly, it is one of the most technically uninhibited pieces of cinema ever made. It's absolutely terrible, but you've seen it. Rent this with your friends and drink a game or just have fun, it's horny. and shows background scenes, anything you can do with paper and finger. Wonderful. Well, rent for this scene: two characters are really walking around for about 3 minutes. The director (according to the remark) "yes, the tracking is very smooth, it seems ...". yes, the right man, they are walking completely. It's so funny.
