If you live in the first wonders of the movie, if you have not seen the "Moving Picture", the movie is a son of the gods. BUT, but a movie, a TV show, even if you've seen Barney the Dinosaur, you're not surprised by this movie. This Heck Barney dinosaur was more rhythmic than the dinosaur was realistic. <br /> <br /> I like movies B now. I watched "The Gila Gila Monster", before seeing this dirt and much liked the movie. B works as a film. Lamer has conversation, hokier active, cheesier effects and honest to Gosh Monster as a real monster! Carno 3 only supplies B movies too. He has some gore, and Polchi has come up with a funny guy, but this movie is almost ... flaccid. The movies of the dinosaurs could not be a small engine. I do not have to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people feel drying in gutters on a sidewalk and they feel entertained. If you are one of these people, give this film.
