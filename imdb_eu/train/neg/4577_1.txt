I agree with other critics of this movie. I found it terribly stupid (at best) and completely misleading, misinformed and harmful (worst). Like others, this movie was a "real" science and a powerful mixture of Pseudoscientific, New Age propaganda. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, Candace Pert's contributions were particularly painful. It's true, I was not the enthusiast before this film, but the "awareness" discourse of cells was one of the best examples of many people ("conscience") for a term. so that it can be clarified in more distorted ways. The Orwillian teacher is old, the master himself described his excellent essay "Politics and the English Language" so well. In this way, referring to "consciousness", the fact of referring to this film as "science-based" in general (that is, its purpose is clear) is to use the same language when Stalin's language is called. The slave states "democratic republics" and Hitler called his party a "socialist worker" movement. <br /> <br /> I do not really understand quantum physics. I know what it is to know, really understanding will bring a great deal of analysis. Oh, but the Americans love "immediate illustration", and the mockery of a movie tries to do that. If you ask a question, that would be one thing, but it clearly tries to ask, and the RESTRUCTURING movies are far from us, far from the answers (if it really is). <br /> </ p> <p> By the way, the revocation of this film was necessarily a ban with some "expert dictators" association with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (and TM), to name JZ. Knight, who often speaks of the "Ramtha" voice. (I am always amazed by the conceptual and terminology of the 10,000-year-old 10,000-year-old superman in Atl√°ntico, but once again, this film argues that the past, present and future are one, so Ramthak was in Atlantis 10,000 years ago now and tomorrow , only then how did his financial advice get very bad for his followers? Oh, I was forgotten, I'm a "good" and "bad" thinker, so it's my fault, not Ramtha.) <br /> <br /> What's wrong
