According to the comments, I am noticing that the people who are discussing this movie are taking MST3K airborne observations. This is quite reasonable (that is, after all, how to get the most comprehensive exhibit), but unfortunately I would like to share my thoughts and comments with the "Last Justice" in its original form. version <br /> <br /> First and foremost, it must be acknowledged that the original version is a little more consistent than the MST3K broadcast, especially thanks to a scene of an exhibition between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini. instead of the actors, "but I like to write the words" Venantino Venantini ", because Venantini's refugee nature can not leave Malta immediately (it is not a convincing argument, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it.) This scene has only been cut in time or it does not provide a lot of riffs for the riffs. I do not know. <br /> <br /> There's a missing line: Venantini MST3K's betrayal of Venantino Venantini, Venantini's first scene raging is a very unpleasant episode Although this is a reason to fight against it, the whole scenario is really ... it's just that. (There's no other word for it.) <br /> <br /> Some MST moments ("children of a child" forever cuts and the sheriff shot "vu vu"), they worked on the result of the printed edition of the television and there were no original films. <br /> <br /> I wanted to get a scene in the MST3K version: before joining the bar to question some people. Joe Don calls on the Maltese police to stay away, "because they do not see this uniform, they do not cooperate." However, Joe Don wears his cowboy-slash-sheriff ridiculous outfit with a bright plate! I can not imagine why this great opportunity to spend my head passed ... <br /> <br /> Last warning of "Last Justice": why do you feel the need to put Venantino Venantini's butt on the bare screen?
