I need to write a review for this IMAX feature to warn others about saving your money for GANDAR. Desmond Morris's "The Human Animal", in almost all sections of David Suzuki's "The Nature of Things", can be improved by almost any section. The director not only uses the amazing IMAX 65 and 70 mm movie and screen display screen; Not everything on the screen highlights the accessibility of the aforementioned programs. Pregnant Heather, Buster husband and his nephew and nephew are present at the audience. We continue to eat eighty-five minutes continuously, sweating, listening to music, and so on. Even though we get the scene inside the digestive tract, we also know the reflexes of natural diving for babies. Most graded school grades? Is Atlantic Trans-Heather also entertained in the distance? Do we take care? Avoid this movie with all costs. If you want to see an IMAX function, I propose a beautiful photograph of "India: The Tiger Kingdom" or "Space Station 3D" technically. Believe it.
