When I saw the preview, I thought: it would be a great movie. And it could indeed be. The actor who plays the main character is very credible, and the beauty of filming is undeniable. However, conversations make the dark shadow of the whole image. The language was a very popular and contemporary level for an action taken in 1610, and the movie removed a large part of the magic. However, the translator should congratulate me, since the English sub-headings were more accurate and more appropriate with the French's original indicators, and it surely will feature the movie that has been filmed!
