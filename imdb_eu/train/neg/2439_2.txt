Dorna von Rouveroy's "intensive" is one of the worst ever-ever-made horror movies. This Dutch slasher film offers very inexpensive some stupid situations and George Kennedy's horror veteran is completely wasted with Bruckner's teacher. Abysmal, action is slow and the highest point is laughable. A renowned surgeon has a car accident. Coma is seven years after it awakens and blooms bloody rampage. Impact of America's slasher movies. Including "Halloween" and "Friday 13" series. The murders are hilarious and the interviews are painful. However, if you are in a good mood, you can take a look at the trash. You laugh until that. You can believe me one!
