It is the corruption of this premiss of Frankenstein's premise. A famous scientist has died in a terrible accident and his father saves a brain by a brain surgeon. He then enters into a robotic body of his design. His brother, an electric genius, pushes the "colossus" to move his thoughts. The whole project is wrong when the creation is bent. <br /> <br /> The special effects are undeveloped. Script missing. And it's funny that this is not a bit scary. Well, very small children think that's good. From morning to night you're awake and that ... night, night. <br /> <br /> Very well interpreted by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played "Kolosoa".
