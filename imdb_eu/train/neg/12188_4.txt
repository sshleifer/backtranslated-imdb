I can not deny that his films are often entertaining, I have always felt personally Martin Scorses is a little bit abusive in his abilities. He shouts his stylistic style in a large number of his films "Look, I'm not an imaginative director?" The best movie I've seen is the least achievement: superlative "Raging Bull". <br /> <br /> For this remake, however, it seems to be an ordinary business. In the 1950s, the dull film was so nervous that it would be a splendor in itself. The rapprochement of the melodramatic combination combined with the "psycho" snippet of the classical partition is likely to cause silent moods rather than the sense of terrorism. "Psycho" scores were a great rhythm, "homage" seems moving and annoying. Although the magazine may sometimes be decent, it only screams a "caricature"; Lewis has been a remarkable exception to being the intelligent turn in teenage daughter's Bowden family. <br /> <br /> The most amazing decision is that it is surprising that De Niro. It threatens, of course, but as soon as his mouth is opened the aura disappears. Now I am not an expert in accented Americans, an expert in England near Manchester, but surely he would get a more compelling southern drawing? As an elegant actress, this fatal error goes far beyond that. It was inconvenient to me that De Niro was an enthusiast, I wanted to go back to the screen, rather than retreating his performance. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS POSSIBLES.) <br /> <br /> Previously - the main style of the movie is spreading across the end. When will Scorses learn to emphasize the situation, can sometimes tension effectively build the visual and sound bombing of the viewer? Also, I thought it was a great deal of respect that "killer-not-dead" was still cheaper to use cheaper talent. <br /> <br /> Totally ridiculous, a very hilarious 'thriller'. . Scorses and De Niro have done much better together.
