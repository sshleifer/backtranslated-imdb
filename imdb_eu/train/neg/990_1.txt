Do not waste your time or your money in this movie. It has been rented by my roommate room, because it was a different description of the traveler who was trapped in a cave. So we decided to go to see, anyway, that it could not be bad. It was. I can not believe that the movie is actually produced and publicly published. It was very horrible as an accident scene, where you want to look, but you can not do it yourself. I am honestly frustrated. With a semi-low budget movie, a college girl has attacked a boy looking for a porn. And really not good. I began to hate the female rapist, she almost felt it. Almost In the end, NC-17 was definitely a definitive movie. Do not waste your money. And do not let your children see you.
