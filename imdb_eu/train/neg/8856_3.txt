Lee was talking to News of Horror with 100 News for Ted Newsom and he was talking about rough movie theater. He said something, the only brush of Lycanthropy was Howling II, and then said: "At least it's better said about it." Actually, this movie was just like it could be in the whole screen catalog of screenings. Joe Dante's first Howling was an innovative male wasp film whose special effects were incredibly incredible and their style and subject matter. It was a very serious movie. Like good original movies, filmmakers thought it was because of some extravagant reasons that they needed the first time sequel more than they did for the first time (see CHUD and CHUD II point). This movie is a mile and a kilometer away on all fronts. There's nothing awful. It seems cheap and most of the major scenes are black. Lee is the only actor in the movie to be mentioned (okay, I'll also judge Ferdy Mayne). Lee is seemingly embarrassed when he talks in the conversation and makes things hilarious (look at it when it ends with him and Stirba). Lee looks very tired and knows what this dreck is, that is, a little perspective on leaving America out of Roman Romania. The story is not really worth the effort to study here, and you can bet that Stephen Parsons and his group Babel have to play a great part in the cinema, and at the end of the dreadful noise. Sybil Danning is here and, yes, he's got rid of that scene every now and again and again - a reviewer said 17 times (I'll count ten, but it might have been so boring at my point). The movie I gave three stars, but it really deserves zero. I have given three three to Lee and two other Danning's contributions. Yuck!
