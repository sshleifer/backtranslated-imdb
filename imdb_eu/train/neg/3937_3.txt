It's hard to believe that in 1997 David Duchovny was at the top of his reputation, because X-Files, one of the best series of science fiction, was ever considered. Nine years later he was almost forgotten and his attempt to return to the big screen failed. I can not explain why, the actor is correct, but surely his fame casts on him a permanent role that takes great talent to break his great talents. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Angelina Jolie was much less familiar. , and it was really lucky that a movie like 'Play God' did not bring his career to a dead end. Fortunately, "The Bone Collector" and "Girl, Interrupted" were waiting for her next, and when she arrived with Lara Croft, her career began. <br /> <br /> It's not much to tell about it. film Andy Wilson's only big-screen movie, and a reason to be. Everyone is absurd and most of what happens on the screen, most of it happens in a story that keeps a doctor's life private, because it works for the mafia himself. Off-screen voice is mostly bad, with a moralist that kills any film's cinematic experience. You probably do not play the movie in DVD rental shops or on TV. Try to look something better.
