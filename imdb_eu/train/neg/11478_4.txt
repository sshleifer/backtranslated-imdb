I'm surprised, as the reviewers of the IMDb rated this television movie very much. The harmony of a film with two great names in the past is sweet and easy (both made a decent job), but this film can be seen on a low budget day of the day every day. smaller cable channels. I like the love and the love of anyone, but seeing my wife and I - and before seeing the rating - said: "There are people who just do not think too much about this film, to question their brains, faith, comfort level or cultural preferences. Such a good movie can be done (and Away from Her is an example), but this was an amateur time. It's really a long and bad line of bad and bad holiday movies - see the family's stone.
