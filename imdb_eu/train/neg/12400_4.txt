Matt Cordell's return to the dead is a third go-round, although I am not sure that anyone who cared for the moment except MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died in the last film, has revived through the voodoo and is very fond of various miscrean groups who have filmed an official Cordell. I missed part of the run-up of the low budget of the early 1990s, but it was nice to see Cordell awesome in different ways at the expense of the body. The problem is that the overall movie is quite static, and Cordell is just Jason or Freddy. The interests came out pretty quickly, as well as the great masters of Robert Forster B, who was a doctor of the brain. Paste the first movie of the series, funny and horrifying and exciting at the same time.
