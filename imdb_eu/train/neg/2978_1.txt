I'm a fan of a horror movie and it's about zombie movies. That said, Zombi 3 is one of the worst movie ever I've ever seen. So it does not mean, I really liked it, it's the best movie that I've seen for a long time. The story has similarities with Dan O'Bannon's return to "Living of the Dead", but while that film was necessarily entertaining, this is the opposite. I have a lot of unrepresentative recordings I have ever seen, especially for the senior scientist. In general his scenes were hysterical. Also, the effects are unique and in many cases they are wrong, and the scenes of death are often quite stupid. This, of course, is much more fun. SPOILER POSIBIBO - The worst man is the scene that opens the door of the refrigerator and shows the split-headed zombie, which opens his eyes and exits FLIES (that is, a little cord), putting on the boys. to kill the neck. Do zombies now have the ability to float in the air? He defines all the physical laws known to man, and is one of the most absurd things ever shot. That's a bad foolish madman. I can not believe so great a score here. If you are a fan of bad films, do yourself a favor and rent this sale.
