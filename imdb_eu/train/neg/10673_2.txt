This movie was a bad indie with A-list talent. The earth was meaningless to the end. In the 1980s, he reminded me of something taken for the domestic video market. I'd give it one, but it was short times that the actors really deserved to do it. I think the worst thing is that the sea scene is taken off the dock. There was no underwater lighting, and when someone told us it was said that the air was near, this air tank would appear. I would avoid that if there is nothing on the shelf. Good day.
