Edison is an excellent reason to go straight to the video: with the odd competitions that came with the theater. The movie was too long and it was dangerous to be boring. Just over the top of the lowbrow (Freeman and Spacey, they waited for the next two weeks), the bad guys are just like Justin Timberlake's play. I want to knock the guy, but he first realizes that this pop is his rumor, the better. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad ... especially. I like LL Cool J to be the main man. It's worth it. And, unlike his fellow musician and co-star, he can act. Kevin Spacey is almost always pleasing (he can see it several times chewing the landscape), and Freeman has the ability to shoot three stars (that is, ten stars) (not good). <Br> /> <br /> Everything is done and the last error in this movie is the pseudo-action poppycock piece that is everyday and arduous for anyone to not be awake. Likewise, a person can not make a nasty character. In the end, it's boring. That said, rent this when you suffer insomnia.
