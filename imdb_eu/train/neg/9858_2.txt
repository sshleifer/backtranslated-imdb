This movie is not fun. D & D nerd only takes stereotypes and increases them. The main characters are less than 30 kilometers per year; All of them live with their parents, there are all social slums and they do not have a luck with women. The jokes are awful and unthinkable, as a black gamer plays two black boys, one of them being a KCK hood (they were wardrobe) and another boy was rocking John Rocker. It's funny, it's a nerd, so he did not know about sports). You should be a child education instructor to find this fun thing. Bad mockmunters are so heavy, but obviously very cheap. Sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I think the only options with hotties are the first solutions.
