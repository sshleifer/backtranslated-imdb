I like to see a lot of cartoons or animated films that the baby likes to watch TV. I started to see this movie I would like to see my little one ... and not. At first I thought it was a pretty movie that was like Bambi, but that ducky was a homosexual way of insinuating it. They told me that they had fun, because they did not say goodbye to sports, but that was not the case. It seems that a child's ability to be gay is a movie. It was also very sad, just like the fortunate father and everyone. I do not know, I would like to like you would like to go gay, but I do not think I can see it again with my child.
