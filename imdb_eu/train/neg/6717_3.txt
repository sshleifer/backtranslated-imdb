God was horrible. The story was in the whole place and I was not often confused by the great mixes. Nobody pleased them because they did not develop their characters. People with no dimension were very shallow. Cheesy, the cheesy stereotype did not seem to be in sub-squares. Stripper Chick was just a distraction, but he was looking decent. I do not know what was happening, but how disturbed I was when they showed the trash in Sundance? My subscription has almost been annulled. Such channels would appear more quality. There are many gay and lesbian movies on the subject. "The Celluloid Closet" is a great documentary. I liked "Wigstock: The Movie". I'm sure some others think about us this time, but I mean that's not worth it. If you catch on the TV, well, but do not worry. <br /> <br /> It was really nice to have three or four shots (sadly I can count them on one side), otherwise cinematography was pretty crappy. The lighting went to many places. In my opinion, I used some of these effects to try to add anything that they did not add anything to it. <br /> <br /> I can not deny that Johnny Rebel is quite hot (of course, no blondes). Badly, his actor did not do anything to me. Stick with real porn, friend. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3/10.
