A spectacular satirical novel by Tom Wolfe's snobbery life in New York, looks bright but is not well served. The film is not only a result of the mixture of all the southern men of Tom Hanks, Kupppie, Kewpie-doll Melanie Griffith, a beautiful Southern manipulator and Bruce Willis (?!), A favorite of New York literature. It was more severe in the sitting of the directive. Robert Altman could give life to those unknown characters and became an interesting one, but Brian De Palma, due to his visual sophistication, has never been in the eyes of human experience. As a result, the film looks good, but the issue of human dehumanization seems to be in the state. Honestly, if a satire does not become angry at the audience, what's that?
