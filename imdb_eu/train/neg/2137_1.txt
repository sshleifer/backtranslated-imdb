The first 10 minutes of this film were also horrible. It is very difficult to believe that no other person, John Cusack, would not have made any money for that. When the anti-military travel / anti-war movie is being destroyed at the box office, it's almost impossible to link any type of studio with that script. <br /> <br /> At first, maybe Akroyd and Cusack seemed to be politically kind of a Grosse Point Blank. The movie is only about 90 seconds behind DR STRANGELOVE's talents. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie Cusacks so much, because I'd like to see this DVD DVD. I do not know that Cusack could be alert once again to see if another function was being seen again unless someone else was honest. Cusack seems worried about George Bush and the Iraqi war, he could commit suicide. Tom Cruise never disappeared. It's not close
