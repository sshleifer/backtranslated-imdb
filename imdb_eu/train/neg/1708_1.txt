Okay, I do not say much about this film, other than this: I have seen more than 4,000 films in my life, of which 2,300 were horror movies. In deciding what's wrong with it (it's my favorite, George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD), I can definitely say that Todd Sheets' ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is absolute. the worst horror movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can say about this movie, something that is positive. Acting, dialogue, direction, make-up, music ... All aspects of this film are so beneficial, that is, what I think is what I have ever published. <br /> <br /> Even if you are full of fears or zombie movies, please check my notice and DO NOT sink your time in this garbage. There's no pleasure in seeing this. You do not even show any candy on the screen when there is no inept ... Believe me. Please.
