Jennifer Cassi ("Dead and Breakfast" named Gina Philips) returned home from home, died in childhood and her grandmother (Fay Dunaway) still lives. Jennifer has decided to sell as much money as she needs, with her grandmother's grandmother. The nightmares of a mysterious shadow also begin. There was really no connection to this movie. Jennifer seemed cold, distant, sensitive, and narcissistic; Her grandmother was too lazy, sad and narcissistic. The movie is good and well made, but I did not know how hard it was for anybody to find out what happened to him. <br /> <br /> My grade: C-
