No doubt, Axis & Allies played espionage games in North Africa and elsewhere in the world. It's not the best movie, but it's definitely not the worst movie budget, as described in the Class Class collection. <br /> <br /> Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was very good at one of his first feature films. I really enjoyed the performance as Harry Park (Parkyarkarkus). Why does not he ever get bigger roles for me? He played a role as a friend / partner and saved the movie Imho. <br /> <br /> As was said, this film was part of a budget package called Super Class-Mart War Classics. Eight films from eight films, including other non-audible stars that pay bills. <br /> <br /> This script ... well, not so hot. Editing and cinematography ... worse. If you would like to see all this and in the future with Cisco Kid and you want to see a great agent that is unhappy with it, it's definitely up to date! Otherwise you can see other WW2 movies. <br /> <br /> -Thunder.
