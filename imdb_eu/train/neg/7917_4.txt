"Cement" is a bad movie about a bad policeman (Penn), a bad attitude and a bad attitude, the bad guy is in a bad way to his fast drying concrete boxes. We expect the cement to be drying up and knowing what the movie is about, we go back periodically without shooting or without reason, to see events that are brought to cement. The story "Cement", sharp execution, and everywhere in the film's weaknesses; no reason to take care of it. The time to attack the potatoes for a good time. (D +)
