Oh, God, I had to see it when I was only 11 or twelve years old (I did not ask how) I was young but I was not stupid. Anyone can see that the movie is bad, bad, gross, inadequate and very stupid. I have seen some more spectacular effects on Disneyland, I've seen better performances at a school theater, and I have seen some convincing crocodiles in the zoo in the zoo, just sitting in the water, not listening to the baby in the glass. . <br /> <br /> The story is in the north of Australia. An ambitious young couple are testing new water sports, drawn in shark waters. The most dangerous thing is now in water. After learning, they get the help of a middle-class grizzly fisherman, who wants to kill an animal to avenge his family's food. <br /> <br /> In the end I have seen all the latest crocodile films. Fifteen years ago, the best of these is Lake Placid, and it's a worse demise. With Blood Surf, I think he should have been the worst of the second rage, stopping behind Primeval and Crocodile. <br /> <br /> Australia's salt water Croododile is one of the most dangerous creatures, creating more than a hundred. injuries or deaths every year. Blood movies like Blood, however, do not ruin the passionate image of this creature, but rather good hour and a half of the viewer's life. If you do not want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.
