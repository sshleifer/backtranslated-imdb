Not even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could not save this dead fish from the movies. For beginners, the script was written in a B movie, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star-powered vehicle) and Hutton (looking for a "two-punch" search). He hoped to define his career as "ordinary people" afterwards. Cheesy lines, the scene of the big scene on the spot (Come on - who used the 12th grade Wipes after the telecommunications class?), And the old bad old act sank this film. Although Duchovny does not face the evil plague that directs this film. Timothy Hutton only rises above the material. I have to admit that Duchovny paines the lines he reads when he feels pain. That I thought I was laughing when I was feeling frustrated by the director, nothing was prepared by Duchonvey's final line of the voice: "If you need a doctor, be sure to call 911." If the studio was only called 911, it would never make a dog of that movie. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
