The documentary called Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control seemed pretty interesting to me. The documentary has four "mini" documentary about four interesting men. Each of these men was very involved with his work, showing his love and enjoyment for one's work. <br /> <br /> These sad people should be those people who should have worked or learned. . Five minutes ago they were interesting, and then they started to get boring and too long. <br /> <br /> The video was shot very creatively. I liked the enjoyment of a double-voice movie on another. He played brilliantly and the music worked well.
