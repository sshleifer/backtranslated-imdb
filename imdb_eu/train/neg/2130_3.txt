I think I'll be back. This version of Bye Bye Birdy 1995 was only seen on Sky TV. I did not know that he was there and he was absolutely prepared when he was ready to watch the 1963 movie version. <br /> <br /> Now, Albert, I played a long time and showed myself a dream production, I remember to be so much fun. I was not surprised by this newer version. It was not fun enough. It was not colorful. The young people did not have much. The lighting was bad. Nobody knew about that event. This is not a variable, bright and fast music. The lighting decision was a bad creative option. <br /> <br /> Bye Bye Birdy is a farce, a comedy mistake. I do not have any meaning in this version. The lighting was dreadful and it reduced the overall screenings. Dance numbers were also anemic. We currently have music videos. At least some of the dance numbers had to be measured by some of the best ones, or about the best of Broadway. The choreographer seemed to be sleeping on the wheel. <br /> <br /> Although all the actors were very talented, there were bad castings. Vanessa Williams is not Latin, and among talented Latin interpreters there is no one to throw Rosie's role. Vanessa is a African American woman, beautiful and talented, but bad smelting. Jason Alexander's efforts were amazing, he always made intelligent work, but he was just Albert. He wrote badly and I think that most people who see this version are obvious. <br /> <br /> Film support is not a scenario. It must be translated from one medium to another. The appearance of the musical cinema and the flute must be taken to the TRANSLATED film. There's no faith in filming on the scene of merit. The spirit is the essence of production. Bye Bye Birdy's 1963 film production was very bright and livelier for me. The production of 1995 was as dark as the lighting and dance was as dark as numbers. It was a really unhappy effort by many talented people.
