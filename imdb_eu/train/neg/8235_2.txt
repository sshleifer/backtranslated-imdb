As a horror fan, we all know that crap-shoot rentals are boats. Sometimes we find a real treasure, but we often find that our film-earned film is not as bad as the worse awards of innocent opinion and film festival. It's the case of Five Across the Eyes (I am sure that a title is a double writer, both for the film budget and for anyone who sees it, to tighten fingers with five fingers). <br /> <br /> This story, or at least one of those who believe in the writers *, is directed to a teenage group that decides late at night on a motivated forest after escaping after a football match. A mad woman catches a cat and a mouse that punishes them with punishment in girls' parking lot at a gas station car after a gas station. <br /> <br /> The truth is that the idea is interesting. Some of the best fears have very simple lines. In the execution of Five Across the Eyes, this idea is flat. The film aims to be a cross between The Blair Witch Project, a vibrant camera and a cross between The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but the mere approach of the material, but it has not been achieved. We get false scenes, torture, liberation; Chase torture, free yourself, in that order within 94 minutes, spots, lies and non-consistent long eyelids, making a lot of filling bundles between bullying. <br /> <br /> The movie looks very grainy and can make darkness, a better movie, tension and realism. Here's just annoying. The characters are undeveloped and finds something that hardens the viewer. A character helps her to get a first aid kit and go on a few sharp faces, while listening to guns on the back can kill her friends. Another girl makes mutters from the muted line, "Do not take it out, it will take you, if you get it, it will kill you and you are dead." <br /> <br /> It was the commitment of Fangoria magazine and Dreadcentral.com magazine listed in the box. Talk about a fake orgasm! Perhaps in my curate section my hopes could be fulfilled. I'm a horizontally indie little budget, but this is a crap-cake. Give it to four eyes (or FATE, get it?) Password. <br /> <br /> RazorFriendly provides five inpatient FATE 1.
