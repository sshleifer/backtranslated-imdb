Today is a torture. That's all this movie. It's about a good person that makes a bad decision. For his kindness, he becomes confronted with two psychotic women. From now on, it's just his attack. I do not know what you are doing. Somewhere there are wives and children; He has guilt and fear. Sometimes, however, he could act. The movie seems like someone's joke. As a result of Manson's murders, we had something like these. However, why would someone like this movie? What appeals except sadism? The conclusion is very pleased, but it is likely to be resolved. Okay Another hour and a half of my life.
