Swing! The film is important because it is one of the other films produced in the 1930s of Black. Many of these films have so badly worsened as they were not visible, but this is pretty good. It is a great opportunity to see many of the great black talent performers of the old Cotton Club at this time. Forgotten, however, is a forgotten time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some beautiful performances, it is also a mess. The main plot is similar to very old Hollywood musicians: the first woman to ruin the show and an unknown surprise surprise for that day. However, writing is a god-horrible and sometimes trashy - and America's black images projected some might be a bit shy to find. That is to say, before starting the plot, your wife works hard (a popular stereotype of the time) and when caught with a hussy (who, by the way, is not totally captivated) is not a life. this role surpasses), they have a fight like WWE Smackdown scene! And, a woman wants to cut another lady with a straightforward razor - indeed a scene trash! Later in the movie, when her cousin plays, her husband puts his face and everyone praises her! It seems that movies, sometimes, want to call the smallest common name PLUS of the public, they can not do it well - with some of the worst actors I've seen for a long time. > <br /> However, if you can see the wrong production in every way (character trashekin, bad performance and bad direction and bad writing), this may well be a great song and dancing dance worth seeing. - Identification of neglected black culture. I did not even say I did not warn about acting - really, very bad!
