This film was made for lovers of Dani (and Cradle of Filth). I'm not one of them. I think the black metal flag is an imitation dressed in horseback (I'm still not a fan of black metal in general). When I was paying for this DVD case, I was convinced myself that trying to convince myself was the more authentic. So I thought I had a roller coaster with a rubber hole and a splatter with do-it-yourself. Now, I like that. <br /> <br /> I got home. My patience lasted 15 minutes. Fantastic camera and unsatisfied quality. Then (2002), it seems that Hi8 was shot through a camera. I left on the shelf. Maybe a nice evening with beer and Bmovy would create a nice setting for this ... photo. <br /> <br /> After a few months I returned (in the aforementioned areas) and saw it half. Then, the parties mentioned did not worry me. My mind changed. I realized that Dan's fun (1.65 m. 5'5 "tall) looked at his platformer slipping the head of a mumble man. (Yes, it was ripped. It seems, the head was not cranked.) No, no, I still do not Finally, I was not positive. <br /> <br /> After two sessions, I finally got this film over and over again ... Yes, I spent 5.5 years.) So Dani was really funny Satan / Manson / super-evil man HELPER and the movie did not make sense. See our bad people employing Dani to do bad things. Why? Well I think it's very bad, because both are and that's pretty. <br /> <br /> There are two short stories with Dani, my favorite: someone was about a man who was losing his mind, because he wanted to use it himself. Yes, in detail. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The bottom of the portrait, CGI is the worst ever, and the boy is Stinger's CGI player.) The story does not make sense and the quality is ... Let's say it's not satisfying. The only thing that can be seen is violence and violence. Blood and guts are quite well done. Why you can see the origin of the movie and then move forward. (For example: Dani 'The Man' Filth cat is full - it can be fake - and it flushes ... then it falls down, why? We never know. We know, however, that this cat should be about illegal substances , its heart is almost half the size.) <br /> <br /> I think maybe after my comment the movie is so bad that it's good, but it's bad. Movie enthusiasts can add 3 points. I added a gore.
