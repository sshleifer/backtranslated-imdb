Writing on the screen is so muted that I've lost 2 hours of my life, I will never return (before I've heard it). The performance is so. Things keep changing enough to keep an eye on and wait for something horrible. However, in this movie there is not the only thing. The first Cub is a horror film, but in the end it did not have much sense, it tries to recover the same cube and try to recover the same story. First explanation for the details of the first movie. He is a comic, the director tries to recycle specific scenes of the first movie and tries to explain it. But scenes are just copied, there is no coherence. This script is not so absurd. I can imagine that the children of 15 years old have written a baseball scuff and a class that develops a beer. The best part in the end is that they "condemn it", and the first movie is arrested and you will see Cube found in 1997 ('this room is green ...'). Goodie gooodie, clap clap, what a tour. First of all, if you have not seen it first, this is not a sense of direction. Oh, another great idea: instead of identifying the numbers of the x (y, z) coordinates of the room (cubes 1997), this time it is 3 letters, each with 26 coordinates. Duh. Now the permissions are no longer sensible ... it allows the deletion of letters before anyone can use it ... I want my money. <br /> <br /> I have to write this. There are so many bad ideas, incoherent or stupid in this film. Directors / writers have some talents.
