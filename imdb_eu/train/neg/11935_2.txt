Billy Chung Siu Hung (Assassin 1993 Bloody Sword) Love To Kill (Hong Kong, 1993) III. He lived in the HK cinema of the 3rd century Boom is one of the most powerful products. There were strong sex, nudity and violent movies, free and less valued. Love To Kill definitely includes the "more" category that includes some well-known ideas and some celluloid diseases. <br /> <br /> Anthony Wong, the psychotherapist (Herman Yau, The Untold Story, who won the same year). ) A young woman, her young wife (Elizabeth Lee Mei Fung) plays a husband who is tortured, humiliated, and raped, for some reason she has not left and saves herself and her little son with her shaking disorder. The police (Danny Lee, Billy Tang, a well-known (and Leek-directed) feature-length film like Dr. Lamb (1992), and John Woo's The Killer (1989), see the problem. He starts protecting his wife and son, but Anthony, of course, does not like it in any way, and will take everything in a stormy rain in an ultra-average, compassionate and typical graphic. <br /> <br /> The movie is virtually no merit , which is a part of exploitation rather than paying for films of this sort so familiar. Images and events In Western cinema, they are somewhat unexplored, at least in the mainstream, and everything becomes even worse for some western taboos, like a child who sees violence and perversions , they are broken in these movies, often they only read the drawings, and the viewers feel they are hurt, which is particularly suitable for this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is still an interesting soundtrack and i It has a carp, named Dr. Lamb tradition. Full growth began in 1991. Usually, the music and soundtrack of HK movies is interesting and adds images, especially in terror terrorism. In addition, film also has to be mentioned because I had films, especially in the blue colors and camera lenses (as in the case of Assassin), and the penetrating storm in the camera. Otherwise, in terms of the quality of the film, it would be worthwhile to rate something else. <br /> <br /> Actors and actors are talented and professional and, therefore, do not make the movie performing. However, the film has an ordinary HK humor, because the malignancy of illnesses is even worse, the "humor" soup goes into it. That's just a joke about Danny Lee's mock-up ... Something that you would never find in "serious" Western movies. And this thing usually highlights HK movies, because there is a way of humor so obvious and the attempts to entertain audiences and masses. <br /> <br /> The film has a very high level of gratitude. Wong's wife's abuse in many ways. She is raped and bothered by her husband being raped and frustrated. Also, we will see the flashbacks of Wong's childhood, which is why violence has also killed his father and turned his young son into something today. These flashback scenes at the end of the film include, in particular, unexpected experiences as they arrive faster (for example, the hits of an ax) which creates a madness and an enthusiasm. Again, it appears that only HK exploiters are responsible. The ending is immediately and astonishing, the madman uses his ax and includes nails, for example, in his loving manner. <br /> <br /> The movies are really quite "suspicious" in my opinion. because violence and fear are really painful, and it explores things that should not be taken as entertainment, especially when it means rape. I saw the version (I saw two versions), the rage scene is very long and it is totally disturbing to make it as sadistic as possible. I do not know that the likes of HK viewers really like them, but I think that in the movies or in the sense of entertainment, no one in the sense of the sense would never accept or do something similar. Women are brutalized and murdered in a sad and low way, when men are compared to women's fates. <br /> <br /> I saw another version, a newly released DVD on HK (subtitles), this "brutality" scene in the table is much longer than in Taiwan's subtitled DVD, similar to the HK version. I also heard that the old HK Laserdisc is different and the final credits are filled with scenes and images that are not found in the real movie, it's impossible to say how "uncut" versions have been released or shown. They are theater. Obviously the footage has been cut short, perhaps before the release of the theater. <br /> <br /> The movie is written by Law Gam Fai and Lau Wing Kin. First, Dr. Lamb wrote films like The Untold. Story and Gunmen (Kirk Wong, 1988), but from other films I've watched, Love to Kill is free. Dr. Lamb and The Untold Story are both violent and violent, but some critics of men and women generally try to make the beast or the beast as a whole. The Untold Story's torture images, because the victims are criminals, are very powerful and definitely affect the way in which society and police are rousing. However, Love to Kill is not a direct, calculated and fast exploitation of this kind, that is, a veteran director of Kirkko is produced by "Organized Crime & Triad Bureau (1993), Crime Story (1993)". ! <br /> <br /> Love to Kill earns more than 2/10 with me, much appreciated by those movies. (HK) The film is more and more like movies like Love to Kill are only commercial parasites that live among the real pieces of art.
