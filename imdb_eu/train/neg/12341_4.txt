Horror finishes are not XXI. Dependents Before the Scary Movie, there were some examples of this genre, mostly in the 80s. But as a franchise, most of these films are lost. Some people like 'Elvira, Dark the Mistress' are more than just like that, but others are 'Saturday 14' and sequel is not laughed. But one of these types of films is particularly huge, which is because Transylvania 6-5000 loses a lot of time for many reasons. <br /> <br /> Pros: the best is the best. Some of the funny moods are fun. A crisp, but catch theme song. Good location in Transylvania. <br /> <br /> Controls: Threadbare plots. Excessive walking. Most mood just cuts. Monsters are scarce and the screen does little time. I thought this was called monster movies? Audiences end up pushing the audience with the buttons. <br /> <br /> Last thoughts: is this comedy? So why are you so curious and curious between so little and far? Comedy believes they rolled on the ground, we do not roll our eyes and do not hate it, it will end. I can not believe that Anchor Bay released this unreadable one. I have never accepted one of the worst films ever, but it's not worth the money or money, even if it's a fan of actors. See 'Transylvania Twist' instead. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
