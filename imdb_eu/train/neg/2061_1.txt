The only film I ever had. Amazing, since I paid for myself and my date and I'm very cheap. But my brain could not put up the batteries, especially when I had more fun writing and gagged. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, this film is damaging. Worse, it's not fun. Then it was not fun, and surely not funny now. But even worse, this film represents the beginning of the very endless and sophisticated comedy. For young people, really sophomoric scripts and ideas began a time (nowadays) where laughter and sex drive dominate the comedy culture's cinema. <br /> <br /> Sexual Olympics? What High School does the child think about it? End of the beginning.
