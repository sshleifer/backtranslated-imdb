I watched this movie at the Rotterdam Festival, like all other powers in mind. The director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and committed to the project, which believes that it shows, above all, the average received reception and brand. Aussie kids are similar to the "Round the Twist" feature, but they also take the opportunity to take it for themselves. It's the same movie, maybe it's worth watching if you're making a movie tour to visit all of the United States in the world, I can not think of another Filipino fiji, but overall it was general, even if it was misinterpreted. and dependence dependent. As the moral of the story seems to be, the islands will avoid one another, but if there is a white and honest governor, all problems can be solved (leaving the island).
