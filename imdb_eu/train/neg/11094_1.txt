This movie is one of my films list. I saw 40 years ago as a teenager, it was too late to know that there was about 95% of angry friendship about love, 4% everything else, 1% is history. It's called what's called Bait and the movie, an interesting title. The real movie is a scam. This is a topic that deserves a good deal of cinematography, is an insult to those who almost serve this film. The members of Lafayette Escadrille were not illegal, nor were the products of bad houses; In reality, reality wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect that many of them had upper classes as Tab Hunter's character. Flying is not a real control and knowing, a person like this is portrayed for a period of two days, but rather the pedal or the infantry. The French army discipline was often pretty hard. In short, it is another version of a historical section that deserves a good deal of treatment.
