I would bring a child under 8 to see this. The puppets that face the dreaded fear of passing cars and dangerous Cruella buildings, to designate some of these events, is very small for a small child. <br /> <br /> The cartoon looks a bit worse than the cartoon version, and there are disturbing moments that the guys who seem to be disguised, who are worried about it and have many moments of distress. children <br /> <br /> I do not know what Disney people thought, but the story and the performance were not their usual ones. Dogs are nice, but this movie is very good.
