I do not know how to escape MST3K's fury. "Gymkata" is a wonderful hilarious action movie (is it nothing?) Thin paper thin, silent characters and absurd situations. But take me, if you see poor and bad movies, you'll enjoy a lot of "Gymkata". <br /> <br /> The elected by the government agents is located around a gymnast. I think the government agents are the spy. You saw that your father was an almost non-governmental agent. In this game he has gone to the competition, he calls "The Game Theo". So Kurt Thomas plays a gymnast in training trains in this game and missed what his father had missed. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is no hope? Ok, so it's not, but this bare line sypnopsis is not describing the joys of that movie. They can be found in strange details of the movie. The gymnast is like a mysterious Asian girlfriend, who does not speak the first half of the movie, and suddenly starts talking, and does not close all the time. Or a bad man who likes to make rules and rules that are unforgettable as "The Game". And, of course, there is a beautiful joke of our hero through "Village of the Crazies" (of course, the place is a real name!). Nice place to visit, but I would not want to live there. <br /> <br /> But this movie really captivates the action scenes. Since our protagonist is a gymnast, the director was a smart guy at the gym equipment in the back streets and cities of the Middle East, so our Gymkata master would use gymnastics better for evil illness. bars and pummel horses. It is believed that it is necessary to believe. <br /> <br /> Interesting note. Many would say about half of the quarter, because they shoot with an arrow. Interesting because the arrows are the only effects or actions that are credible throughout the movie. If these were effects, my wonderful false note created realistic wounded liars. Films are likely to pay extra expenses depending on how much they pay. However, the "Gymkata" looks worthless if you look for crazy people who are easy to see and admire without paying. <br /> <br /> <br />
