I still have to read Shirley Jackson's novel, something I want to do. I'm sure that this movie should be awesome. I remember when I threw it when I saw it the other day, but I can not remember the scene. <br /> <br /> The special effects are very good and I saw this on the DVD, but I'm sure it was a great show in the theater. After the first special effects, I waited until I developed a story. <br /> <br /> I thought that this film was to be based on at least a classic book, so it should be a good story. , but it was not. I was relegated to the brilliant character Catherine Zeta-Jones throughout the movie, because it was not necessarily a movie. Lili Talor was a great character. I did not like it a bit, something about people. Also, the guy in this movie reminded me of the cartoon Dudley DoRight, with voice and face. I could not associate with the characters. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson did a great job trying to play this movie's performance. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Scream Queenish movies! There is at least one type of entertainment. Unless there is no story, at least they make sensible deaths or attractive mothers. That did not do anything. <br /> <br />
