Ooof! This was proud. It's not "falling somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller", that's it.

Simon Le Bon face up and down in the middle, the rest of the group plays for Roxy Music's last three albums to have stolen their entire career. Barbarella short clips did not add anything.

Durango Durango's 80s DVD video is worth the look of nostalgia.
