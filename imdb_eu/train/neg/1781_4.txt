Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as strong as a movie story. A mother and a son go to a small Indiana town with a secret. Sleepwalkers are feline bees that feed themselves to virgin virgins. This little tale has its own special effects and gores; more incest. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is a remarkable mother. Others are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Find very small roles in John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King became the gateway to the cemetery.
