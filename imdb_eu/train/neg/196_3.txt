This movie is incorrect on many fronts. As a matter of fact, he depicts the history of Alamo's mythology. Production is inadequate, in general, giving an impression of the welfare project of many actors that would have to work at the Hollywood Shows. This is the biggest mistake for me: I am familiar with the general ages of the real protagonists of Alam and the geriatric groups of television actors, because the belts chosen by them to represent them will never enter into a suggestion of credibility. In Texan, I grew up with mythology. I learned more through history. I can accept decent production from two perspectives (although I prefer a more historical accuracy), but this has never been possible to enjoy it. John Wayne or Fess's Parker versions also had much more life than this mess, but they were more accurate. <br /> <br /> Very depressing - Avoid.
