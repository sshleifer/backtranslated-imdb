Films Begins with people starting on earth, their fate that Mars did not miss, but in space he went outside the planet. When recovered, one of the crew is ill, one is alive and the other two are missing. A member of the survivor who has happened has retreated. <br /> <br /> The crew on Mars were attacked by a huge number of stupid monsters with a very bad look. Curiously enough, while the sets were pretty good, monsters were among the most fascinating creations I saw in cinema. In addition, in a bizarre attempt at realism, production used a process called "cinematic". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation made the movie look pretty cheap on Mart's surface. The intensity of my sensitivity was practically clearing my eyes - bad! Despite all the cheeses, the film has an interesting plot, as well as a good message about space travel. For fans of the genre, it's worth seeing. In the opinion of others, it is likely that you will find absolutely nonsense: see yourself and decide. According to today's standards, this is not an excellent science fiction film, which means that the films made with them are quite good at that time. <br /> <br /> PS - When you watch the movie, pay close attention to Dr. Tremayne. "Quest Jonny Quest" looks like a picture taken from the drawing! In addition, he also sounds and acts like him.
