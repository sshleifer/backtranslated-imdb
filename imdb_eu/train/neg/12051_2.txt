This movie is "horrible", but the car crash is a boring way. It's hard to look away. In general, this film is just a terribly responsible social experiment and an unnecessary experiment. The filmmakers are manipulators, and there seems to be no problem to get the lowest denomination. Ted is just about exploiting money. The mere interventions that the filmmakers forced to take part in Ted's participation (called the so-called experts) were empty and there were no attempts to contact Ted. Instead, it is clear that the film director's descendants and those who use the Teden state can be exploited. The worst part is that the filmmakers stop Ted for 6 weeks; and apparently, they were severely cut to the subject that followed so closely. When they looked after them, "experts" were better found to help Ted. If Ted really wants to see what he will do, then they should spend money without any intervention. This movie, in most cases, is a high-level Jackass progress and not a documentary. It is sad to think how many 100,000 dollars could have a life of homeless people, if it had been put in their hands.
