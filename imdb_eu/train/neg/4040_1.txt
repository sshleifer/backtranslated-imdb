I think that in all things I have a bit of snob and even though film experiences have more explosions than dramatic dramas, I also have a lot to do with movies. <br /> <br /> Not all art films are better than King Kong. It may be that Kong's two stars give it a chance to duplicate the movie's transport. <br /> <br /> I think people are so excited that it is almost similar to what you see in the play. At least one art-buff, a movie that looks like a play is a 'great art'. <br /> <br /> This movie was useless. <br /> <br /> There was almost no story, so it is based on great drama. The only drama in this movie was whether the cat came out of the roof. So, deep and meaningful conversation, then? No Great activity Barely <br /> <br /> To be very reasonable: some landscapes were very interesting: communist weight, city views (Petersburg?) and still Soviet tram services.
