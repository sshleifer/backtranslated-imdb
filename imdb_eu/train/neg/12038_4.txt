Will anything happen in this movie? There are only scenes in short scenes where I do not know what hell happens so it is not counted. This movie is boring, it hurts and a movie is created by a person who likes to make movies. Mixed? I was fine after seeing this shit. What was Donald Sutherland, because this was totally lost. And what is the scene of the "pedofile" movie. Anyone can sleep! 4/10
