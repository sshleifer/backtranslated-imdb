Dark Wolf (review) Reason: this is a rotten roadkill that cuts with that cow. It's just a horrible movie. It is a third male film, a story that is as weak as a theater maker in the 80s. It is worse that poor Kane Hodder was considered to be a nasty evil man. Kane f * cking Hodder. Someone strikes Jason Voorhees trying to make sure his film career is high ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the former Playmate, Jaime Bergman, is also a movie and eventually he becomes a boy wolf. He is looking for men in the world who are looking for a policeman. But it has moments of near-nakedness. But that's all. Want to know more? Okay, especially a man's lupus is a fading blur on the knee by drawing around the screen. And when we see a transformation sequence really privileged enough, we present something similar to a video game made in the initial stages of Playstation. First Playstation. This animation CG is primitive. Only for horror hardcore fanatics who want to see small minutes surrounded by naked visually impaired. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
