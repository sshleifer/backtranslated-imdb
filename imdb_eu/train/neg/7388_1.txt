drss1942 really worded the words. I love the first films of Segal, and I feel the only one who still lives. I watched this movie (well, it was sleeping around 90% so I did not see it at all). When I was awake and when I saw that I was in the DVD menu, I thanked him for not having that movie anymore and I did not dare to find it at the end. There was something strange about the rattle and the voice of others. Kinda reminded me that Mad Max's original voice was dubbed, but in the same language (Australian is English, right? :) However, if from 10 thumbs, they would point out at this time for Segal's injustice.
