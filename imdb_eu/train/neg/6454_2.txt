The monster of Enemy Mine was somehow part of a small mountain community and lived there. She wants to get caught by a doctor. This murderer who looks like a refugee from a Motley Crue video walks on a motorcycle and tries to choose a right smack dump on the Big Chill weekend in the monster's forest. There are a lot of operations and blood to focus primarily on the story of Dr. Malcolm's bad version of the island. Yes, it's worse than Val Kilmer.
