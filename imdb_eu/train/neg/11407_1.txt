This movie is an excellent example of a great movie lost in a movie. Jacob I Have Loved is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. There is no story, the plots disappear and the editing is horrible. Finally, it's straight from the music synthesizer and it's incredibly wonderful. Bridget Fonda's performance is decent, but the rest are totally amateur. I'd suggest a movie as a producer to learn how to cut out the movie, the bad scenes, the bad moves, and the rehearsals that had nothing to do with the performances! Read the book and do not miss this time with this movie.
