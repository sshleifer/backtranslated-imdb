This search is a good idea to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's say that each movie has a point of sale, a criminal. Transformers' gimmick effects are superb, as well as fans of nostalgia. A gimmick in Seattle is a state of affairs on their label line: "If you never knew someone you have never seen, someone you never know was one of you?" Many historical love is basically based on these rays and the drawing of some great names. Leap Year uses Irish folklore and prominently famous names throughout the country. <br /> <br /> So now the viewers are in the movies, in addition to the usual elements in the characters, conflicts or consequences. Crisis, resolution and imbalance, stimulating dialogue, years of visiting absorbing situations, interesting sub-plot sites, and perhaps some extent, will be waiting for the best mid-to-late trips. a story that encourages the circumstances of the characters. <br /> <br /> Jean Yeo does not try to get it. If they tried, their purpose was apparently on the other side, in the other stadium, on the other end of the planet. Alain Layrac and his writer have failed to give an encouraging interview. Most of the lines were invented. They seem to have a bag full of lines that he wants to use in the film: "Ok, I've watched the movies or the lines I've seen and the quotes, the books I've read before, and everyone knows well. If they hear me well, they'll be fine, so I have to do all I will share them all. " The result is cathartic. I can not say that the lines are not necessary and they do not play the story and the plot, but it seems that they are leaving nowhere, without mentioning quotation quotes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At personal level, I know that people who refer quotes based on most of our interview situations, that is, we are trying to make themselves understood. I no longer go out with them, that the desire to punch it is overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Second, the portrayed characters are stupid and one-dimensional. Motivation (necessary for driving the plot), except for the supernatural conversation, there was no strong belief. I do not know who they are. They are easy to download lines from regular columns of Women's Magazine. <br /> <br /> The presence of the visor years is not enough to boost this story, because circumstances are very skinny. Then again, there are less movies but better than that, there is no. They formed my first and second points. In addition, subplots are not important (not bad for these films) and thin (bad). <br /> <br /> Jean Yeo and the producers are trying to get rid of wonderful places and wonderful lands. good photography That is why they are likely to understand that it is possible and it is easier for viewers to accept others with the good location of cinematography, soundtrack and filming. These are not spectators. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad that this kind of movie is good. It's bad Ignore this
