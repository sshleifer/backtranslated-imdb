I noticed that this movie was a lot of suggestions. He probably won some of them, but it was not so bad. Well, I will tell you the truth: I never wanted to see this movie again. It was a bad movie. But I do not hate this movie, he tried to tell a story. As a drama, this film will work really well. I think the filmmakers should go through the wrong way (they wanted to add more curious things if they wanted to be a comic book). Writing could be a great movie. But as a satire, the current form did not work; Many scenes were not included in the plot context: for example, the scene of robbery is not very meaningful in the story. However, the worst independent film ever made - Top 10 is the worst? This is questionable.
