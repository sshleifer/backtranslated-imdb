I was surprised when I watched this movie. I've heard the best movie of the novel. I was disappointed for myself. <br /> <br /> What a real fan of Jane Austen can prove to be an adaptation to my mystery. All screenwriters have decided to enter into this hilarious humorous season, although it is shameful at the best time, and it also destroys the feeling of that period. In terms of emission, Gwyneth Paltrow makes a pretty heroine (but then the "hot" American star would be doubtful in the role), Toni Collette is wrong and poor Ewan McGregor is confusing! <br /> <br /> I can not say anything good about this movie. It seems they do not appreciate those who do not value it, but if you want to see my advice, watch TV production with Kate Beckinsale. Believe it, that is to say, it's better for the trash bin.
