Julia Stiles is a talented young actress with a strong potential under the guidance of a reputable agent. Of course, this person was not guided by anything that guards his career. I sat in the theater, surrounded by young people, who found a movie and thought someone would think. It was badly written, the director of the casting effort was one or two minutes between the characters and the director did not care.
