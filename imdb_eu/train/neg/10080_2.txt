I had to make a search for actors in this movie to find a title for the table is now an unexpected love. It's not really worth looking for, but I do not know in both directions and they asked me what they were doing about a lesbian film Lifetime. Everything is slow and you have no idea what the characters are, as the viewer, I could not invest emotionally in the story. I am not a public purpose, but I do not know who it is. Everything is silent and unknown and the earth ... not very interesting. I had a great interest in seeing both women, but I was so cautious that I was disappointed. The best personal rent.
