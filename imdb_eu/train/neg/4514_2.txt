The problems of the book, "Geisha of a Memoirs", had Japanese surfaces, but under these surfaces were all American ways of thinking. Reading the book is like watching the costumes of music, excellent sets and costumes, clothing worn by costumes of original thinking. <br /> <br /> The movie isn Japan or it's a real geisha. It's a story about Japanese and geisha's wrong ideas, filtered through ignorance and wrong ideas. So what is this movie about Japan or geisha? Is fantasy just like many people say? Yes, but why do you become an American fantasy? <br /> <br /> There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture that there are no puritanical hangings, the connotation of the sexual sins. Sex is natural and normal. How to manage sex in this movie? Right. It was dirty. Concerning a movie sex scene, Sayuri nudges his nose and triggers an agitation of about five seconds. The man trying to assemble a man tossed cockroaches on his cross. <br /> <br /> Does anyone really play this movie? Laguia. A character is said to be confusing, but everything that we see is far from being his lover, because he does not want to get caught up doing something dirty. The typical Puritanism of America does not have a Geisha Japanese geisha movie. <br /> <br /> Sayuri enjoyed its first carrier when an old codman got his cherries on the auction? Laguia. On the lying side, it is like a cold plate. Of course, he is not supposed to enjoy it. And this is about this movie. Why could not they give something to enjoy? Why should all sex be sinful and wrong? <br /> <br /> The President of Sayuri's guardian behind Mamehua, and that's why his virginity was at auction. He auctioned the auction and he could win it. Nobu did not even offer. So why did the Lehendakari leave him to win that old codman, and the smell of the elderly man is blowing on his naked bodies? Would a woman ever forgive such a man? <br /> <br /> Let's make sense of this. Behind Mamehana, the president had debts to Geuri training for Sayuri. In order to recover debts, Dr. Crab sold Sayuri. President Mameha sold Sayuri's sexual favors to this young man, in order to get some money out. The president was not his guardian. It was his suitcase! Romantic love story <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a beautiful movie, but it's just like the beauty of a travestite who is very bright and attractive, with every voice, appearance and touch that is exciting. But under this very feminine surface there is a disturbing secret. Under the Japanese surface of the film's surface, a disturbing secret is hidden, heart, soul, spirit and the core of this film are completely American and male. It must not be better than being false, distorted, and grossly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some Japanese and MOAG contrasts: <br /> <br /> Japanese style ?? Elegant and elegant simplicity. MOAG style? Beijing Opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha ?? They sucked their hair. MOAG geisha ?? It would have to get a little hair, surely all gunked sticks that are stuck in white makeup. <br /> <br /> Japanese ice ice - Japanese are quite strict about seasonal filling. Frozen shaving is a summer treat. MOAG frozen beard - The President bought Chiyo, the young Sayuri, who plays Suzuka Ohgo, cherishes the flowering season. Thought my whole body was shocked. <br /> <br /> Geisha Geisha? Trained and trained coaches. MOAG geisha - sluts. <br /> <br /> Japanese wind chime - it is used in the summer, because it has heard the sound of wind, because the Japanese feel a bit cooler. MOAG wind bell - a door bell! If the noise of the wind was in front of a person's house and the wind signals are overwhelming, they will not enter. <br /> <br /> Japan ?? We emphasize human relationships, group-oriented. MOAG ?? "I want my life" American individualism. <br /> <br /> Japanese traditional dance ?? Finite elegance Almost geometrical and mechanical precision. MOAG dance ?? While Martha Graham was terribly fond of LSD, she was dressed in a not-so-auspicious Japanese funeral. A geisha fell into a place that looks like a band club. Ha ha ha! Most research on Geisha is a strip club? Japanese fire in the home? The fact that the fire or even reduction is worse than murder is because it poses a serious threat to the community. Fires destroy hundreds of thousands of homes, towns and cities, and they can kill a lot of people. MOAG home fire - Fighting scene is great but the roots are zero and it is no longer necessary to miraculously put in control of the fire. The film was technically finished here, at least Sayuri would be out of date and would meet his sister again. That's where Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall are to be exiled. <br /> <br /> It's enough. The movies are supposed to.
