A Stinko of a film with a shopworn plot, and a shorter than a Oscar's caliber, to be polite. But for me it was a total mistake for the only bad mistake for me, and, above all, it was in 747. Some of the worst mistake: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No Flight Engineer (or even flight engineer station) 2. F-16 interceptor F-15 (not in any mode of resolution ) Identification 3. Passengers can access the "cabin" in the rear cabin, which is supposed to enter the cabin, this compartment existed, which was much more distant, as the plane's plane was unpredictable 4. The aircraft "did not damage" 5. The balcony was a very bad procedure. SR-71 (from all shots) with a pressure seal with an umbrella 7. An outdoor door opens - in the wind - in flight! <br /> <br /> Ah, nuts, the movie was really wrong. list below 10
