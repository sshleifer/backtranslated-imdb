Bad actors, bad filming, rugged conversation, empty characters, but once again it was a bad premise. Basically, an 11-year-old is a criminal offense because he has little money because he has little money. Of course, 11-year-olds tend to have enough technology and intelligence to buy a home with a $ 1,000,000 check and also bring three foolish foolish words that remind three templates. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake, an annoying boy, is disgraceful, decides that when he writes an empty check by a whole stranger, he will take advantage of that situation as much as possible. In other words, he walks through a bank, lets a writer write a printer check and, with a miracle, he puts out $ 1 million in money. Preston also seems to have a great speed on his bike, because a Jaguar with a Preston and 10-speed driver could not catch him, when Preston jumped in a row of cars. <br /> <br /> Of course, the heroine of every adventure movie must be hot. In this case, our hot hero is a child who annoys Preston FBI for eleven years and promises another date when he is 17 years old. <br /> <br /> However, the absolute aspect of this film was not absolute its foundry. , or even his rugged conversation, for example, "The only other way to sugar can be put on one is to put a hose on the butt and then pick up fur." In fact, he realizes that nobody in the whole movie realized that the FBI did not mislead the random people. I can not explain, Preston uses the "Macintosh" alias to mask it as an activist. Of course, the FBI finds it very interesting and sends our young hero to Preston, when his 11-year-old spirit spends his face on the lobster for the first time, then to treat hamburger in a cement area. water jettison from the ground. Our hero fails to realize that the criminals doing the FBI throughout the adventure is sliding and slipping on both sides, reaching the Preston Limousine, with a driver of a dimension that is ever more economical. Laughter allows all families to be overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> Generally: 1/10 is very helpful for this movie. I do not know how it only has 4.4 / 10.
