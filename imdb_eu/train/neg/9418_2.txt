Films with weak cuts and redistribution history. It does not work. First of all, dramaturgy is completely wrong. At first it moves very slowly and then moves quickly and softly. But there is a movement between genres (which may cause cuts). The result begins with a valid thriller and then becomes an agitation rather than a satire. The end may be fun, but they are so sharp, I have almost felt that they have insulted my mind (how little there is). So the movie wants to be everything, but it does not succeed. You can also see it in a highly unstable character development. Connery only prints three roles.
