It's hard to call Grudge a horror movie. Mostly, for a moment he jumped to surprise me. <br /> <br /> If you (horrific) forget the enormous dimension and if you look at the other aspects of the film, you are disappointed again. The play is fine, but it's not great. The story may be quite interesting at the beginning, while trying to get what's happening. But, in the end, he understands that there is not much understanding. Sometimes "Scary" seems to have been added without script ... <br /> <br /> So ... (tried) See if you do nothing more interesting about this movie, like carrots trimming. or looking at the clouds.
