I'll keep this short, I know I do not have much to say. It's a strange little movie, "Alive", of course, which attracts some people, but it seemed like moving. almost from the beginning. The movie was very pleasing to the characters, and sometimes the story was so confusing that I was totally interested. As I said, I know others have enjoyed it, but I have found Kitamura's "Alive" image but not - a drama that is flexible and very boring as a thought-provoking action mask in the film. I felt that I was feeling to see this movie, based on its interesting premises and a more wonderful cover art. <br /> <br /> My suggestion? Let Kitamura's "Versus" or "Godzilla: Final Wars" rebellion against the endeavor made in 2004. <br /> <br /> <br /> ... And do not get bad, I am always up for man's good thoughts on movies, but it's definitely not that. For a moment I did not really care about a single incident in a movie's great predicaments and conversations. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about boredom.
