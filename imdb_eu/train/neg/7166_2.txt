This movie can be very good, but it's short. Cheesy special effects and so-acting. If the story I look in the past is so wrong. If you have more background history, it would be better. Soil is based on a nasty Druid witch attached to this woman who gets a migraine. It activates and activates the movie and never exposes something. Christopher Walken takes part, but it is completely absurd, like most films. This movie has a potential, but it seems very bad for television. I would avoid this movie.
