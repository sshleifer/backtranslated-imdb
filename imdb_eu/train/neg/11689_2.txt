I have never seen Spike Lee's previous films because their trailers never have any interest. I've seen and admired the work of Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster, and has some DVDs. However, I was completely disappointed with this movie. If this film indicates the capacity of Spike Lee as director, my advice would be "getting the job" and losing talent and time. <br /> <br /> I ask that other reviewers of the IMDb have watched the same movie I saw. I can only assume that the worship of Spiker Lee has blinded the divinity of their works by this piece of work. I paid only $ 2.50 in a "Second Run" theater and I still lost money. <br /> <br /> "Curiosities" IMDb says everything .......> <br /> * "Filmed in 39 days" - How can you expect a great budget blockbuster (in fact, the media as promised by the document) in such a short time? It's not surprising that they all had a bad performance. <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard directed the first movie ..." - This project may take some justice for more time. so, of course. Although it was made with a frightful writing, there were some merits in the premise. <br /> <br /> Okay! maybe not. Sorry! This movie was so annoying with compassionate villas, insecure scenes and shameless characterizations, maybe it did not do much. (Hey Ron! Be kind to thank Russell ... Good call!) <br /> <br /> * "Jodie Foster has filmed her work for three weeks." - And he showed it! A portrait of "Fixer", which moves away the problems of people, was very credible as the script provided. Would you like to be here? <br /> <br /> Other Peeves: <br /> <br /> * How many bank robbers did they get to the door and told the uniformed police to steal the bank inside, and would it be better to get away ... or else? <br /> <br /> * Frazier "Detektibe" (Denzel Washington) enters the bank to not even verify corpses, how many bank robbers, guns, police officers would be "much" "leave" a cop back In front of the door, allowing the police to walk behind? <br /> <br /> * Det. Frazier later claimed that the robbery was "every reason to get me out". Why, then, in his short struggle, did not he reveal the face of the thief? The answer was being sought ... a thief shot at him to identify later. And why did he take "Steve, Stevie, Steve-O" (robber's complice), so long to come and help? <br /> <br /> * I know you were not bank robbers. They had another agenda, and they did not want anyone to hurt anyone. The police had no reason to think they did not want to. The situation for them was disappointed. Why did they then evade two bad guys getting "pizzas"? (First of all, how many thieves would come out without using a kidnapped as a squire? Is Spike Lee's NY City or SNL version?). Moving down the bad would reduce the number of jokes, tilting their plans and probably robbing the other robbers. If not, at least it would be bad. (Give something to SWAT or send it to your home!) <br /> <br /> * The police department in this country could introduce Madeline White (Jodie Foster) into the bank and discuss it. A thing of robbers, did he not first tell them? He had no authority, no governmental credentials; In addition, this is eventually hostage ... add more? <br /> <br /> * Why was not the Bank's CEO (Christopher Plummer) destroying crime documents for some time? Screw sensitivity! Diamonds could sell. <br /> <br /> * Who was this "schmuck" (character, not actor), with Jersey's accent, comfortably, as a volunteer, and said he knew the recording. It was "100% Albanian", but he could not speak ... SIR! Put your hand down! And his ex-wife! What was "schlump" !!! Both were absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> * When you ask about suspicion, why do not you tell me? Frazier, persistently persecuted people who were constantly disturbed? (That is to say, she could go to the elderly woman, and then she could not, then could not?) Give me up! <br /> <br /> * Who, when the robbers saw robbers of bank robbery when they asked for jumpers, could not escape his plan from the banks he was leaving? <br /> <br /> * Next to the end of the movie, the false wall was thought to be in the supply room, behind which Clive Owens hid a "week" ... where did the materials come from? from? (drywall and see). Likewise, it was supposedly cut off by emptying to ease it. Did the staff of the bank not complain about the smell during the whole week? Hello! <br /> <br /> * After a debacle; When the documents fell into the hands of the "robbery", what did the "referrals" expect from the managing director of the bank, seeing that it would now be a charm, because it is a failure? <br /> <br /> * In the end, but not least, what is Denzel's "Electric Glide"? HOW MUCH STUPID! Did he suppose that he meant "his decision" to make these men justice? Otherwise, he looked like he was a man in the shopping cart trying to avoid the bowel movement. "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Exceptional territory. poor script; bad start; and a brilliant management in general ...... yada, yada, yada. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it will give you an overview of the film to help decide who decides not to make money! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
