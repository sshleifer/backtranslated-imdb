This was not only the most expensive Canadian film ever filmed in BC but the easiest worst ever without ever seeing the daylight. The director is not even Canadian, but British, and the boy shows. We all have to be a bunch of sexual abuse and morons. What is meant by being Canadian is lacking, and this is an alleged reason to finance this bunk. British is a normal character, of course. The rest is the sitcom's stereotype crop - "Norm !!" can you say Cinematography is among the beautiful postcard figures, dark inner silhouettes. The actors always seem to be reliable. Are they bored as an audience or they are the idea of ​​film directors? Avoid this mess and look at some Bruce McDonalds. A true Canadian boy with cinematic originals. You can spend 10 minutes without leaving your movie.
