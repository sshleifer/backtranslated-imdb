I do not know the trilogy, but I was in Showtime. The film performed very well on stage and cinematography, but the script was made of solid wood and wood. The play was pretty bad - it was thought that two women carriers were useful. You never really think anything of what the supporting actors say. There were stereotypes, biblical trumpet, reverend, clear nuances, authoritarian captain, hot head, etc. I forgot that I was based on shortcomings directly in Canada, without knowing it. Telefilm has finalized the Canada end credits. I know I'm a great person. <br /> <br /> Maybe I lost something at the beginning, but the hostility to the girl never explains. Here, they are besieged in a fortress in Manolus, and men lose their time and energy by brutal brutality of two young women. Pay attention to people. Above the walls, the pressure situation is a little bit more due to the fact that girls are lesbian or not, that is, their hostility to them. If you turn on a gun and turn on the fire, it might be nice to them. Their question of "immortal soul" may be solved later. <br /> <br /> Also, I believe that it is linked to the rest of the trilogy, is it supposed to be the protagonist of the girls? One of them killed the Indian guy, when he finally saved a life. I believe that no one can blame for his conduct, but the other is just a murderer who is not happy.
