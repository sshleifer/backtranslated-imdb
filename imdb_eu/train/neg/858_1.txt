I hate this movie! It was not like the book, and I think it's crazy about it. If you watch the movie before reading the book, yes, it's a good movie. King's book was AMAZING and the movie was not like that. I mean, the overall meaning might be similar, but the majority of the movie parts are quite different. For example, the end! So, the book is very intense and Danny and Wendy escape a few seconds before the hotel explodes. But in this horrible version of this film, the Jack takes them through a foolish maze ... yes, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason. I was angry that Mr. Jack was killing Halloran! What the hell is, basically, the hero of the book and just kill it as it was not as important as it was. In general, it was very bad that the movie was so horrible.
