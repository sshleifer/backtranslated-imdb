I finished this movie three times, but it's a god. In this case: mother and daughter go out to bed and hunger, mother's gas stops, when the crazy gas station is attacking her house, she ravages her house to run. He fled, goes to the BIA and wants to call the police who wants to call him, the story is only in his two parts. Wow <br /> <br /> There are many other actions logic imbalances. It's a crazy act, and the neighbor's warning on it is a very strange and misunderstood moment. <br /> <br /> The moments of imbalance and death entered into the intense interplay between interactive characters. br /> <br /> Focusing less focus, humor, and more attention to the story.
