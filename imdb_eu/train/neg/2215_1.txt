This sad movie about a woman who thought she loved her so much was probably killed, but she really gave her scientist father a spell to become a truly shark guy. Like beauty and the like. It is possible to use an auditorium scene, perhaps some candlestick songs, but instead some pretty thick plants. They make this girl really cheerful; so the shark feeds instead of scratching his whole movie. The scientist is a fierce father, trying to get his son's shark fish, trying to get married at a private time with his wife, but the female woman is very strange and she thinks it. The fonts are ugly and horrible and have nothing to do with it. He refused to love! It was a shark! It seemed sad to me how he should do everything he needed to do it and it would become normal and he would always have lived happily, but there is no such movie.
