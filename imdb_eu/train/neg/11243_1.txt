In short, this movie is not worth any. <br /> <br /> The film is made from the point of view of the future in the early 1900s. An interesting idea, but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from hanging our disbelief, so the idea is just flops. <br /> <br /> Apparently, we made the whole film in front of the green screen actors and we're supposedly surprised. But as a graphic person, he tightened the sharp problem of sharp eye tightness on the smooth surface. The color has been cleared primarily without visual effect, even if it does not reduce the visual quality. And I do not understand why he would think of breaking down any given thing in this movie. In any case, the funny graphics of the rheoliths have dropped graphic bars to get bad graphics - they are not rising among ancient Jurassic graphics. Robot models were so simple, common and very unbalanced. There was a bunch of prehistoric animals on the island, but they did not appear in any way. <br /> <br /> The story is a terrific opinion. Indeed, I can not believe it I left out of this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is motivated, and the whole film is based on mistrust and deceit. Why is the character Morris Paley too? We are not convinced that Joe is heroic, I mean that he does an airplane, and he has kept a person (Polly) for personal reasons. Yes, your hero is great. Dex has a very small screen time, so why do we take care of Joe to save him? Who were the Nepaleas blocked with Joe and Polly, and why they did (remembering Totenkopf's whole operation as a robotic)? <br /> <br /> Plot holes: (1) Why did Bai Ling's character (a great fall of "The Crow"'s great character) stop the robots that stopped Joe? Fiala was looking for it and they did not find it. (2) Why should Dex should not be caught (did not know or know the skinny ones, and bad guys did not know that Polly had video clips and Joe and so he connected to Dex?) (3) Polly does not know about Totenkopf, but he has a secret source about FBI that seems to be quite a FBI-style file. (4) The empty space in the Nepali map - if you know all about this mysterious field, why is it your fish's empty map? (5) At one time, Polly and Joe have to give up their clothes (they're burned) - they give Joe old clothes that were the same with their old clothes, and yet, Polly has to wear dresses and extravagant dresses. Suddenly in the same line of follow-up, Polly has her original outfits. <br /> <br /> * sigh *. How far is it to think about changing my brain? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> And act out? Would we be surprised with a series of English accents? Which character is not annoying? I think Ling Bai's conversation is probably the best (it's not a single line). The interview was not a campaign and it was not up to the cheese market. It's bad and annoying. These people are not heroes or credible; When you are really upset you are the kind of people you do not want to avoid. IMDb. IMHO has to compete with "Forever Batman" every 100 seasons.
