William Cooke and Paul Talbot share director and writer's credit in this horizontally entertaining movie budget on horror magazines with camping on three forests. Fires and peers shake hands ... and a ridiculous town called Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... called Leatherface Fame) walks and exchanges four stories in exchange for food and fire heat. . <br /> <br /> A story is restored by "The Hook", a lover of two teens who has been attacked by a deceased king to tie his hands. Another story to get some baskets. They start looking for a guy who knows the unfortunate character. When the bags are burnt, the skin becomes gray and green before it is flushed and before falling. One of the best stories is about an unhappy return to Christmas, because his mother can not wait for the deceased and enjoy her nephew and nephew Satan Claus. According to the fourth outer story, he cleans the seafaring seaman with a treasure and escapes into sea zombies. <br /> <br /> Without a large budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALK gets points. Crossing it could be much worse. It's a bit crispy, but it's fun to watch it as a sailor story. The operation is not understandable. Here are actors: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
