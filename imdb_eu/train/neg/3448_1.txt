I checked this movie when it was 6 votes and said 7.2 or something similar, but this serious movie is horrible. Let's let it. The first thing that you notice about this movie is that it has filmed a digital camera with a new student at a community school. You will notice that the next actors are friends of this new student (they probably met at a bar at night). You will see that the editing of the third album is horrible in the third list, and they try to eat a lot in this movie in 30 seconds ... Likewise, all digital editions students They're made in the home computers of this new ... probably by the window creator. This movie was awesome ... I continued. I would not recommend the movie to anyone I know, but I'm saying the writer and director to watch this movie forever in hell.
