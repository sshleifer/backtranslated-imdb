THE CRIMSON RIVERS is more than ever targeted, it's one of the over-the-top mess I've ever seen in France. There is nothing worse than a French production trying to make Hollywood movies. The horror action / action / flick of the CR is an excellent example. I stopped almost half, I knew that it was not for trying to try to show French. <br /> <br /> The film begins with great promise, like a kind of horror movie, but it quickly changes genres from fright and action to flick files to x files. In the end, CR is all that is and not at all. We've got a lot of clich√©s, somehow I thought it was a comedy. With this painful conversation and silent silence, with explanations blurring and disappearing at the right moment of explanation, he cried. I thought they used only this used technique by Hollywood-made movies. <br /> <br /> Vincent Cassel's access to the killer is directed, and this is more beauty than that. The peak of the mountain, such as the stupid revelation of killer and murderer along with Cassel and Reno, such as Nolte and Murphy in the 48s as HRS, completely deviated this small credibility. <br /> </ p> It is difficult to think that the director of THE RIMSON RIVERS has also directed GOTHICA, even if they were part of the problems, even if they were approaching a confusing and confusing movie.
