Actually, I'll regret all the second minutes of the time I lost watching this movie. Unfortunately, I always see it difficult to turn the movie off. Especially when it uses a classic or a class to call it a classic. I think one of these films should see at least once a lover of a movie, that's why I saw it. Do not go wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall as a couple and actress, but this movie was a great deal of deception. There is not a good plot, not a spy movie or romantic love. Well, not even two of these genres are convinced. The only thing that caused the tension was that it was doubtful whether 'Bogey' and Bacall would stay together. "To Have and Have Not" has been overcome and Bogart has been a feature film in the 1940s.
