A parody of the family, "An Officer and a Knight," "Heartbreak Ridge," "Full Metal Jacket," and (definitely, I do not remember other films anymore), with a brilliant film. Gag is always there when you expect it, and the lines of Damon Wayans, well, can be predicted. As I said, unfortunately this movie never gets you astonished ...
