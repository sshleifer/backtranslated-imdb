Nell Shipman had to pay a large sum of money to promote Maxwell automobile's full career path. The movie plot is very simple, it plays a writer with a bad case of Nell writers and needs inspiration. That's why it will visit Mexico to absorb the atmosphere. He will meet the hero (Bert Van Tuyle), a cowboy who drives a car, rather than riding. While Nell is visiting his father's partner, in his mining camp, a local band kidnaps him and they will take him out to the desert. The hero must immediately get it, so he decides to drive on the car. That's it, he makes some strange films. Bert can be imagined, huge rocks, small streams, heavy brushes, crazy trees, steep slopes, etc., continues to drive the most part of the film, trying to overcome obstacles. Now, keep in mind that today is not a current ATV, it's a Maxwell automobile in the 1920s, so it looks very much like an off-road vehicle. And, clearly, it has no limitations to some of these encounters, which we see more than once in this film. The filmmakers made an effort to overcome the annotations and eventually overcome all obstacles. Once the hero is hidden and the girl is saved, she will jump on the car with her and go on track with the bandits (on horseback), and at that moment it has been a hysteria fun for me. To see this car gently rolling over gigantic rocks, gravely and brushy brushes, to move forward and retreat to get enough boosts, the bandits were to have a long time. But they never do it, even though you think this wild bullying goes all night long. And in a stupid fountain, the car climbs up a hill and Nell and the hero help push a giant rock to crush the bangs. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, you should invest in the army Maxwell automobile 1920s, because they were better off-road skills than Hummers and Bradley tanks combined. Look at this movie, it's just laughter, it's worthwhile to watch Nell's car grill, "Say you've done your best and daring vehicle".
