A horrible film with a curious part about Ramones. A poorly-formed comedy that comes with some innovative low-school comedy lessons in the 1970s and '80s. This movie is horrible. The land consists of a girl who enjoys Ramones and a fight against the oppressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something with Wild Zero with Guitar Wolf, if you want a fun movie. The enormous influence, the imposing writing, the Ramones admission seal, probably because they needed the Ramones admission stamp, they said yes. That is the only logical thing that can be thought of as a movie.
