Let's start with saying that this movie is very funny in the beginning with the narration and George's interchange: Narrator: Huh? Wait for a minute! Who are you heck? George: My new George. Studio cheaper to pay for Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get the part? George: I think the lucky New George. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's the only fun part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was still entertaining ... But again, I am easily entertained ... <br /> <br /> I would not say I have never seen the movie worse (this title is a huge disaster movie ...). This movie is downloaded from my list # 7 ... <br /> <br /> If your little child is easily entertained, you will enjoy this movie. If you want a good and entertaining movie that you would like to watch movies, you will end up filming yourself.
