I had to review this website, and I saw it as optimistically, that it might at least be ridiculed and entertaining, and that's not good enough. <br /> <br /> "666: The baby" is one of the greatest supernatural thriller I've ever seen (worse than "Godsend") scenes that are screaming "The Omen". At the end it's similar to the one ending "Omen". <br /> <br /> The play, the writing and the story are completely lost. If these films earn money, I'm sad to see where that place is. It's shameful.
