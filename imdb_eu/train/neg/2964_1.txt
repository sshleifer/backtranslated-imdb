He laughed a lot - it's very bad - sorry for the people, but one of the worst movies that I've definitely seen ... I know it's a small budget, but anyway: actors play a soap, they're interviewing. It was absolutely crappy and last seen, such as the image bit was a trash in young video festivals ten years ago. I really appreciate people gathering together and filming shorts, but at least getting a certain amount of quality. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the film looked very interesting and good - and it is worth listening to. It has ordered a lot of DVD covers, but this is definitely the best offered by this film ...
