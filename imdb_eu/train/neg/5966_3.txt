wow! I saw the trailer of it, and even though 'I prefer it, it's not for me'. My husband and our friends saw the faces along the trailer, and knew that this was "a boy movie". I mean, hallo! Chick Barmaid dancing a lot ... another striptease? <br /> <br /> Then I started to watch, I did not look bad. so I continued watching. I saw it at the end. what a great movie. Anyway, this is a Chick-Flick. these girls have a stance. It's a really sensitive movie, and a little love story. it really pleases you. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a story of a city of a small city in the city, after passing to the typical big city, c ** p. They were a couple of them, it's almost a legend of the city. But think about your life and what you get. well, anyway, to me. I think that everything in a bar scene works is very popular not only for me but I know it for many people. Do not make that trailer confidently; man is to bring men.
