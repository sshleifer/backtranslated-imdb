First, I'd like to say I'm a fan of Chris Rock. I like other movies, but this movie is like my summary. The greatest of Crap of Sack ever. Initially, Chris Rock plays an aspiring comedy that frightens her in a comedy called Apollo. From a concert, BIKE sees her favorite, and has been attacked by a truck. Shortly thereafter, he chooses the body of the white and selfish pride. Afterwards, Outkast is dressed as a music band, trying to repeat the origin of the jockey's origin. Secondly, he returned to Apollo and attempts to be a common comic attempt in the previous body, and the white population begins to dising and wants to be black. Do you get my wandering? This movie is awesome, it tries to make it as hard as the original and it's like a sack that comes out of the process. Get my advice, do not miss this movie too.
