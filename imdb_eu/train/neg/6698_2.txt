Say Funky Forest: The first contact is a bad movie, because they are incredible proportions. I'm going to come into a really good movie, if they add surrealistic and twisted plays such as El Topo, Naked Lunch and Survive Style 5+, they debate something that really deserves their credit when they cast their credits. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In every FFFC essay, This movie is badly executed, the images in this movie are not inspiring, the conversation is worse, the music numbers destroy this movie. I said the guitar-brothers, I joked, but this was totally useless and irrelevant. I think that it must have a deep and meaningful thinking, but its imbalance is just like that. Fresh non-camcorders can not do something interesting. <br /> <br /> The usual routines of Guitar Brothers and Skits get 1 for each point, all the rest of them are bad rhythms, pseudo-creatively, with hands-on attempts. Good as good as Sogo Ishii, David Lynch and other Jodoworsky film directors. Give me a break. I am sure that people who make people about the FFFC do not know what they see, because, here and there, they are here with lightweight expressions, mixed with stupidity and disposing of your shoes. <br /> <br /> This movie has been very disappointing, Survive Style 5+ was the movie of the time, that is, a truly meaningful movie, landscape, cinematic, catchy dialogue, fun moments, good soundtrack, great performances and excellent Stimulating and flourishing. The FFFC has a detailed aspect this year, a boring landscape (which looks for a 20-minute horrifying beach on the night, a totally white stage, aliens floating in white space, the school corridor and then ... the school corridor?), Horrible. cinematography, neglected conversation, anything funny or humorous, you just save your life for two hours, soundtrack, love shows, irregular, imbalance, and often flat dragging pacing, zero flow is saved fact. <br /> <br /> There are those who say that it is excellent for the FFFC movie, so it's so unconventional that it's a genius in every turn. Apparently, this is a way to stroke your ego situation, because "surprise" can be a good quality for a movie, unless it's "boring", "innane" and "terrible". Personally, when I talked about the FFFC theater, I talked with two people who gave me a terrific sign, but the elitist houses of the arts made a great pace when they saw the movie and then returned with me ... "Hey I was pretty good." <br /> <br /> I'm going to put my foot down, the movie is slop, I do not care Roger Ebert says that this movie is the best thing I've ever seen. He lost his virginity. "I'm new to the emperor's outfit", I say ... the last 10 years is a movie that is not a sign of other Japanese psychedelic and tripod films in Japan. Taste of Tea, Party 7 and Kamikaze Girls are much better (although they have low budgets), and no one can honestly compare Survive Style 5 +. Check the FFFC if you want to make a bad estimate of anything that does not adversely affect your stack.
