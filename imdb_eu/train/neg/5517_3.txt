I'm only worthy of three films. I like to praise a big movie and I'm not inclined towards the "masculine" film. Legally blonde was a great movie. Georgia Rule, on the other hand, was inadequate, weak, poorly written and realistic. At the end of the film I did not care who was lying or something resolved. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in a movie is a good story. This story is weak and never developed (because it is a profound topic, it does not mean that the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is the one who has a great character change and is prepared for this change during the film. In Georgia Rule, character changes were violent and undeveloped. Second, there were too many PROBLEMS of dynamic characters. Really trying to get a good dynamic character is a tough job and it takes time (just a couple of hours in a movie). This means that too many dynamic characters will try to pay little attention to their personal change. Although they neglect the storytelling and the fragile dynamic character, I can not tell anyone who liked it. Each character was wrong. It's good if you are writing your American Beauty, but not when you try to play a dramatic comedy. The mother of Georgia was horrible, her daughter was a great mother and daughter, and Lohan was a great excuse for man (I'm not stopping being an attack, everything happened and we are all in charge of our actions). The "Dudley Do Right" Mormon boy had to compromise his religion and compromise ... and Simon, I mean, is a type of illness that can leave a 17-year-old girl from time to time. actress or politician). This movie is worth a good movie!
