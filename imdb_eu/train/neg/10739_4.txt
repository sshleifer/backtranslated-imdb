'Iedereen Beroemd' has everything we expect from a live video movie. Her daughter is a story of a man who might be a star. The only thing that is needed is to buy on stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan has to be kidnapped and blackmailed. The problem of the movie is not a basic argument, but how it is done. Everything is fun, but it's not. It is evil and clumsy, the characters are skins, and the last sequence is completely out of touch or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene that you laugh, but the pathetic one is full.
