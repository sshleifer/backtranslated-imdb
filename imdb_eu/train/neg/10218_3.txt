** Spoiler ** ** / <br /> <br /> I heard several sources that this movie was controversial and that the end was particularly terrifying. I did not expect the whole change I expected a minute ago. As a cowboy / west western typology, "Honor" (the title of Soldier Blue, interpreted by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Berg) escapes Cheyenne's attacks on the "committee" in a romantic comedy. The biggest part of this film is romantic comedy. Then Donald Pleasance becomes and attacks both, without apparent real reason. Then they run away and both raise (one by one) the base of the cavalry attack against the Cheyenne base. When Cresta married a Cheyenne leader, the base of the cavalry escapes and matches them. Until so common. Then the end comes. After a period of more than one hour of break, it will be a topic that does not match the topography, then the movie becomes a top-down exploitation, such as smoking and the baby that fires on the back. Similarities can be drawn with Wild Bunch at this time, but Wild Bunch kept the same pitch and did not give extreme violence. Somehow, Soldier Blue reminded me of Frank Perry last summer, which also changed completely due to a stroke of blow. Soldier Blue did not hate me and I did not find a particularly disturbing end, but it seemed to me to be a rather violent agitation. If you want to see a movie that is really worrying about the murder of innocent people, I would recommend Elem Klimoven Come and See.
