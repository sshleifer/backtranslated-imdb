This is the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters. It was just a collection of recycled materials. It's not fun to hit the head with people. The people that are playing is not fun. After the third time, he started throwing a guy, even though the youngest was not surprised. He's quick to get tired. <br /> <br /> I went with my sister. She really laughed at the King of the Hill, but this film is bored. I am not impressed. The story is pretty lame. Thirty thieves steals a huge diamond that was a horrific horror in Hollywood history. He then conceals himself with a family pretending to be a baby. I know it was wonderful, but it's a whole story. Say these two lines will get 1.5 hours and you will get the image. There are lots of planned jokes. When I saw this, I felt it torn out. I did not expect much, and I was still disappointed. Keenan would hire some decent writers to write jokes and / or the next script. White Chicks was even worse if that was possible. I have watched higher and cheaper plays. <br /> <br /> There's nothing positive about this movie. I do not like my entertainment dumbled down.
