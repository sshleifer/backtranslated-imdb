If you look back at a bad nightmare like Freddy's Revenge, you should give yourself some credit when you try something new. And despite the nice Dream Child, the series does not offer anything new. Yes, the deaths that are commonplace, like the boys in a comic book and the "Super Freddy" faces, but these scenes are not all their potential and the pieces without Freddy are boring. <br /> <br /> This marked the official death of the horror of the series. Freddy seems like a relief for the comedy ... but what? <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
