This movie is a traditional Bollywood rate as the star power of emotions, feelings and triangles. The mother of the lawsuits in charge of the makers of those who were really worried about this movie was absurd. When the child is a child's descendant (with a family that is looking for a child), a slut who thinks of a child is not a substitute mother. Also, he is not a good candidate for his mother's representative. I've seen Indian movies and TV show shows for 10-15 year-olds. The whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and totally impossible. I know that most of Bollywood films are not credible, but they do not guess either. This film aims to make the emo with the characters, but this can not be done with such ridiculous and inventive conflicts. I'd be better off with Abbas and Mustan.
