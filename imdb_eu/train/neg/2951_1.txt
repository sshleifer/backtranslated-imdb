Do not see the movie if you value it. At the end of the collective approach, I and my friends estimated that each one lost 5% of ours. The only person who was not clinically rooted was the only designer. <br /> <br /> Most movies leave your taste in your mouth. Now I realize that, instead of the feeling of neglect, the movie has created a hatred for me. I hate this whole movie very well. <br /> <br /> Some people may say that the movie should not be taken seriously. If he did not take it alone, he would take it seriously. But no. The plot is a renewed version of the Blade Runner-esque universe, with rubber clothing and muffins that are so popular in the midst of dinosaur movies. The interview is not childish and meaningless, but it's often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg does not try, but George Newbern's Theodore Rex voice is like the nails of the soul. And if his Juliet Prepared again with his British accent or Richard Roundtree (Shaft) once again considered as a noisy curator, the feeling of disbelief and disillusionment is becoming increasingly important. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see human beings who can fall into the depths of stupidity.
