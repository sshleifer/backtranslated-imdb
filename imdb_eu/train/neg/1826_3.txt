This weekend I watched the movie and, even after a couple of beer, I noticed that it was actually watching when I first made this movie. in a word, it is uncomfortable. Unfunny. I fully believe Jack asking for forgiveness for making the wrong wrong black jack black. I can not believe Barry Levinson did not throw this script when she read the first page. Besides, I can not believe that I've seen more than ten minutes. <br /> <br /> I gave him 10 to 10, I'd like to see Kristo's wonderful Walken icons to see wonderful movies from paycheck. It is also very ridiculous that the film "corky" is only a character in this film.
