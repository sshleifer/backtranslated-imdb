If Cranky has rated it, I would be tempted to copy the review and put it here. But I did not like it, I have to give it. <br /> <br /> Instead of replacing 0 for 0, Malcolm McDowall's performance is superb. However, this film is not saved for disaster too. The director had to really deviate when he started working; For example, some of the scenes that reminded the 70's of bad films were just thrown together. Even worse, the agent and the director appeared, probably, when they showed that the original script was bad. <br /> <br /> It's not about discussing the story, even if it's futuristic. This corporation is called Proxate Corporation and collects a group of unknown people to carry a dangerous cargo ship in a container / slave ship in Nigeria. The ship's computer is a baby that is kept in the glass container and enters a crew with a USB 12 or something. The company should be called Prostate Culture, paying attention to the same name as the entertainment of this movie. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not find a scene well to say. In the film context, he has made a real sense. At last I only saw the bird flu touching me and this movie reminded me that people were worse for me and especially Malcolm McDowall. I will not deny it to the contrary, it is an excellent actor and every good actor has the right to take a bad film on his career and this is a doosie. <br /> <br /> So this is your only movie. It hires shops or you're a male doctor and you do not have prostate tests this week and you feel somehow bad. Then, give this one a very large number, if you are in charge of reality, buy it. Use a copy to help Malcolm and then drink it as a coaster.
