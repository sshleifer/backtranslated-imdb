After purchasing a DVD on a Bargain Bin, I've squeezed it with a DVD player and it's been well-liked. Pleasant animated menu and a lot of extra features ... but when I played the same movie, what was left. The worst thing I've ever seen is I've seen bad movies in my time. The comment that praises the movie made in the IMDB is really for the people who made the movie. So do not believe that you want to waste your money!
