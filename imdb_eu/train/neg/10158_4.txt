I could not imagine it behind the mask: I see this as the rise of Leslie Vernon (a massively amazing film) to realism and even an innovative idea. It could be a great movie. The performance is good for some actors. from others ... it is immensely awful. <br /> <br /> This is a great idea and a great format. The story is also pretty good, though it often leads to big blows suffering from logic. After all, it's a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I want to confirm again ... I really want to be a fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> However, (and you can not really blame the sense behind the movie) this is obviously based on the shoe string quote. and fx really hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> Great movie. ... you would play it for a better performance and a little better fx. <br /> <br /> Anyone who writes should follow their own ideal ideas.
