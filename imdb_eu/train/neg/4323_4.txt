The holiday of Europe (Lampoon's European Vacation) is one of the weakest among holiday films (first and third of the first film). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are returning to Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new actors Russ and Audrey Griswold's role), this time we get a weaker screenplay with a full interview. This suffers suffering, jokes are not very fun. To be more precise, we are really suffering from this movie as "jokes", when stuck together with a structured script, rather than serving a central plot for another 3 holiday films. Well, they can not win everything. 10 to 4
