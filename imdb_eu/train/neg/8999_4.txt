Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon and SCTV alumni have come together in a short sketch. <br /> <br /> However, it's very interesting to watch now in 2005, thirty years later, this movie is supposed to happen, look at how much of their gag has become completely true: There is no mock movie trailer, probably It was not too quick at the time, "The Pregnant Man" Arnold Schwarzenegger's mutual truth is something called "Junior" movie There is no commercialization, there was probably no light at that moment, Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis called "Celebrity Wrestling" with a popular show called "Celebrity Boxing". There is a mock movie trailer, there was probably no light at that moment, in a movie about John Cleff's head. See this trailer and look at similar plans and plots with the Frank Hellenlotter basket case! And finally, there is a documentary about the late late show "a dead dream, only two left ..." Documentary name ... THE BAST HIPPIES! LOL. <br /> <br /> The four prophecies become true!
