(Spoilers) A truly memorable little and noisy piece of British cuisine will clear Steiner's henna in water, one of the worst color ever. This, and the stinking eyebrows on the evil old man trying to steal the invention of Steiner. MST3K makes a wonderful job to make the movie gray boring and funny gray. I particularly like Crow killing Mike with his "touch" of death, and when he rebounds in the theater, Mike shouts "Guys, I died, I saw the eternal truth and beauty! Oh, this movie is ..." That would be a lie, He had to return to life to see the rest of mankind's projection. The movie is sold as a sleep assistant. Some of the dark movies in the movie were cunning: the police inspector ... "Electrocution!" Crow- "Shocking, right?" police inspector - "LOWE, well" Tom Servo- "Very low, down the ground!" police inspector ... "I am before?" Tom Servo- "It's dead, but you're injured" MST3K is definitely the only way to see this snoozer.
