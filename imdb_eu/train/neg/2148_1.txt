Possible Spoilers, maybe. I have to say "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" one of the worst movies ever made. First, the film was made during the sequel to Disney's debut album. It was created during the "Sirenatx II", called "Jungle Book II" and "Peter Pan II". All of them liked classic original films. (Disney also made "Notre Dame II Hunchback" and "Atlantis II", but I'm going to drop the theme because the original movies were not really classics first. "I'm going forward and said I'm passionate about the Disney movie, I'm very fond of the "Cinderella" original. "Cinderella's sequel", however, was a waste of time. Cinderella was not so original as the girl at the sequel, I looked at her. Original, Cinderella was nice and loving. He was very curious about the words of the current era, for example, "This banquet will make my way!" The new Cinderella (as I have called for love) says: "Ewww!" That's Cinderella anti-theater. I try to find the best, but follow Anastasia is a good guide, why? Families like Lady Tremaine and Drizella were terrific for poor Anasta. My question to the world: people from Disney originally Or did you see "Cinderella" doing this sequel? Well, it probably does not seem. If I remember correctly, Anastasia Errauskin was disgraceful to Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I'm all for salvation and forgiveness, but there was no money in this movie for Anastasia's payment. In the first place, Anastasia was evil. In the second, it is good. Can not leave such a story. I hope that Disney realizes that he is embarrassed by the name of Walt Disney. Maybe Michael Eisner is gone, things will be shaped around the Mouse House.
