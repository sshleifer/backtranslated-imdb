It's a movie that says 2 things ... 1) I can do much better than this (acting, writing, and correcting) 2) it's so bad that I have to leave the review and warn others ... <br /> <br /> It seems my They shot the flip video. I think my friend told me that seeing it is also a sale against me. I have noticed some positive messages for this home video; They must leave crew or crew around this movie. The worst film I've ever seen. I hope the writer and the director leave the business. Although not talented enough to make commercial!
