This film was a fantastic fantasy movie through a horrifying hell. and I think they were just as scary as the pulse and IT and tributes, but comes with a fatal right on a great movie? RIGHT! This movie was flawed. I mean the ghost is going back in a cuttlefish house, and now I think I can say that I can do it and think it's a good time. is not it? wrong my ass! I do not care if the ghost is Satan, it will not happen. It's a movie either, but the bad movie or this is nice to be a movie, but it's not. It just shows us what I mean and people do not think anything about it. someone please tell me why you do not know everyone that part. For me the movie was finished at the hospital and that's all. look at the number 3 as much as his kick ass
