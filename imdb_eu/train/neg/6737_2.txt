If Deborah Messing was not called "Grace", this could be tolerable. However, a problem is just a story of a frustrated criminals hired by a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney), reads in an article in a magazine and goes to London for her sister's London weddings. How much is this plot? <br /> <br /> It's not fun or even romantic. Marriage dates back to the bride and the deceitful sex of the story, and paid for four films like honey. Hugh and, definitely, the dead end is expert in not knowing about the sexual history of his bride (Amy Adams). While Messing improves the repression princess, he failed to relinquish the history of his relationships with another beautiful neurotic and drunk, re-use his TV series. If the woman is an actor, get the reuse of something that is already in use. <br /> <br /> Drinking women, cricket jokes and Mulroney towel (nice!), but the movie is boring with a happy ending. Expected messaging succession: Divorce.
