I do not know why this movie had a great opinion. <br /> <br /> While on the night while watching the "Bang" television, I was bored with the bold and absurd plots that were on the screen. The whole movie is nothing more than the nonsense of the filmmaker and the powerful self-indulgence of art. Only the director / writer who starts with a single name reinforces the pretentiousness sense. <br /> <br /> Those who are interested in indie flicks are looking for a better written and bold saying, more entertaining than the loss of time.
