Nowadays, it is a tendency to see all the early shows of the 90s (people often blind us today with nostalgia), and while some of these shows are definitely good, this is purely empty. I saw a lot of this show at that time, since it had received a lot of TV shows and even though I did not like a child. An 8-year-old girl will also see how much the people of Power Rangers have, and then how many sucked FX suits. When the show does not play a bad fight scene, it is horrible for some teenagers and a small age group and occasionally they have small social problems. I do not know for you, but I do not give any of them a rat's butt, and they must basically be filling up with a "fight" in a full-blown costume, with fireworks or some toys. -robot With this show you feel without feeling any way, and most actors act like they do not have any interest in it, because the wallet gets better. <br /> <br /> There's nothing memorable about this show, and so many spin-offs are surprising (Beetleborgs is a good example). It's just a quick way to make money. "Fan" questioned what they say about what's so good in episodes, so I have not found a bit more attractive for kids. In my opinion, most of the "fans" of Power Rangers will say "I do not get it" or something in that line. I do not like it; then it was rough, and it's still nasty now.
