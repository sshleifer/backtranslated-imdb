The return Cabin by the Lake does not respect the original at all. Only returning a single main character (Stanley), the film does not cost 2 hours of your time. I'm a fan of the first movie, the story and the performance were very good, but I will never see the movie again. However, they are like Urban Legends and Blair Witch trials, but it's a lot worse. I've personally seen a soap opera with a better performance, it's so wonderful that you just laugh. I do not recommend this film to anyone, I do not see any obstacle.
