With such movies, you know that you will get jokes about ghosts. Eva is a pretty funny ghost. The other actors also work well. They lack the direction and the story. The jokes that could be overlooked were better. The problem is that there are not many jokes. I'm sure I laughed. Not only did they talk about papas, but there were no creative dolls in the movie. I am guilty of not using the premise that the director is using the premise. Eva certainly has more comedy skills to show off, but she has not got the chance to do so. In general, the movie is ideal for Sunday afternoon. In addition, you can jump fully.
