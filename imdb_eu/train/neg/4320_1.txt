First of all, let me not say that it's a movie that is pleased and delighted for these holidays. The movie is cold, wild, and it's just trouble. In Mary Steenburg, she is afraid of her downgrading mother because her husband has lost his job, she is losing her house, can not buy Christmas presents for children, and so on. You will get the idea, happy holidays for the holiday. So comes Harry Dean Stanton Gideon as a Christmas angel, in his dark hat and long coat, more like a pedophile goes out, like a pedophile hanging around a child all day long. What best way to teach the Christmas spirit in Mary Steenburg, than to kill her family, and then give her a refund if she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is a blacksmith and his Christmas workshop is like a refuge for Nazi refugees. The movie is so bold, when it's not what you do not care about happy ending, the rest of the movies are so painful and unbelievable. I am sure that this film wants to be something like Capra, but the holiday film has ceased to be the happiness and feeling of what it is.
