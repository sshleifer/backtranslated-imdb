This horrible trash is really awful. Yes, we enjoy beautiful naked women and enjoy sex. But when this will work on a porno movie mechanism? can even succeed as a porn movie? This makes it a "movie" scene, to say, real emotion and struggle. It is not. Some girls are a nude and an excuse to have fun. I'm convinced that in this particular movie, all these women and men could act properly in the 1970s movie porn business. . . but not in the real movie business. <br /> <br /> The performance was bad, it's very bad. Writing was even worse. Can I not blame these agents? they did not have to work. The very broad structure or composition of the film can be done with good writers and actors with competence. The broad structure or plot is a psychotic man who is shooting people remotely as a sniper. These shots were motivated by men who respect their women. If there were more inputs - better writing, much better writing - and we would be less likely to have sex pictures. <br /> <br /> We would shoot, make and market this movie for a hardcore movie. ; it would get more money. Hardcore porn is almost a film, and I see that I have not seen the only pornographic movie that shows the male penis standing up.
