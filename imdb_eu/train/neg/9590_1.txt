The film focuses on the real novel of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The journalist Colin McInnes wrote a series of three "London novels": "Absolute Beginners", "City of Spades" and "Mr. Love and Justice". I have read three. The first ones are excellent. Lastly, maybe there was no experiment. McInnes's work is very acclaimed; and guess it. Music is the last nightmare of the novelist; the fruit of one's self, the chapter of a film that captures the spirit of London in the 50s, to become a submerged apology of low dimension and adornment. <br /> <br /> Good thanks Colin McInnes was not alive.
