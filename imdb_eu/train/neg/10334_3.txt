The story of an amazing difference "Dies" repeatedly kills. Characters and plots are very uninteresting (Fulci's stupid camera, which is often a shocking factor in his films), and in no way finds suspense comprehension. It reaches a totally unblemable level. In the end, you are not excited, but you will be disturbed by boredom (and perhaps, perhaps, like I might sleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves a better job in a better movie. Fulci gorehounds be careful - there's just much to follow in "The Psychic".
