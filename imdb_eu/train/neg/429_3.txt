I like to watch this movie with his starpower, but at the end it seems to all. It plays much more than modern thriller on the city corruption. The biggest mistake is its prediction and suspense. We know who are bad at the beginning, and just follow up as the dominoes fall. In terms of credit, the film avoids sex and violence, but it has been forgotten in a different way, instead of love or enthusiasm. Good and tasty Caffeine Glue Diet. New York also "Q & A" occurs and a better alternative is "LA Confidential".
