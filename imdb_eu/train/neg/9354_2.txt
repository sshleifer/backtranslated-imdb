It seems that the key aspect of the film has been forgotten by Jobson - if you want to tell a story, you're going to show it. You do not have to think about the audience, because they will see it. The action here is divided with the highest-intensity narratives, the fifth most sensitive purple prose. And it is not necessary to have a beautiful cast here and beautifully formed and visual images. Perhaps Jobbo believed that the basic story needed some help. It may be straightforward, it lacks fundamental credibility: In the 70s, Edinburgh was not full of gorgeous girls, for a terrific trend for Velvet Underground and for a transient partner. Characters wearing outfits and new outfits, all the characters come out of the intellectualism of cod that tries to unite together.
