I was attracted to this movie when I looked at the movie list, but when I saw it, I felt a bit disappointed. The main problem in this movie is that the actors do not keep this film back. Why? Because of bad guides. Although Dillon, Lane, and Jones are hard pressed to take on a different level, it's not an innovative story and the direction is common. So Matt Dillon is a great movie for lovers, like Diane Lane's lovers. The legend of Tommy Lee Jones is always great, but it's not the same movie; its level far away. So, if you see that you are connected to that great cast, do not expect anything or expect much. The only thing you remember about this flick is the Diane Lane scenes; the rest is very unforgettable.
