They bring a couple to their home of their dreams, they do not know it, and they build on the land used as a cemetery by their neighbors. The film is said to be based on a real story, even though it is not possible to understand the truth. The plot is not the only one. See the Spielbergen 'Poltergeist' (1982). In a short space of time, they experience supernatural phenomena - from unexpected shadows - from the mysterious shadows, from the grave illness of their daughter - immensely ridiculous - to continual cleaning of toilets and garage doors without control. The story is inadequate: once the land has been used as a cemetery, we do not learn anything more. The plot does not develop. The characters are not particularly well-traced or memorable, nor particularly special. The movie can be disturbing to some viewers. No postscript or any positive message.
