I never wanted to see this movie, and then one day I saw a joke that I saw it was a bad thing; my budgets were confirmed. <br /> <br /> To start, I'd like to question cinema's policies. Women hide themselves behind the masked "big city", but the only way they can have women is their sexuality, rather than intelligence or skill. These women are not wells. Did not little girls be really attractive? This is not the only message on the right-hand side of the movie, there are hundreds of American powers and huge cash. The strongest thing in America is the excellent example of capitalism and spiritual, moral or artistic value that does not look like this movie. Money is represented as an important asset for young people. <br /> <br /> The director of the bar says that he does not let his drug users go to the bars, and then goes to the bad lice. his neck and then the neck of his staff and customers. Anyone who knows anything about poison pads knows that liquor could be as dangerous as heroin and much more dangerous than illegal drugs. <br /> <br /> And finally, why are the protagonists interested in the point of a sexual character to the viewer (whether he is dissolved or with his boyfriend)? We look at the fact that she stuns her camera, almost caressing her legs, while she is her father's phone. My father made an auction at the auction as his boyfriend. That's strange to me. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is immoral, fascist, degrading and truthful for women, alarming. But what do you expect with Jerry Bruckhiemer?
