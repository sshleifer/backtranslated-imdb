It was a much easier time (the seventies), a simpler place (San Francisco), where a man could make a simple movie about the innocent psychotic reinsurance of Christ, without ending dream sequences as an acid-like woman. flashbacks in multi-racial genres, regardless of financial responsibilities or moral influence. <br /> <br /> This movie, boring, slow, boring, is generous because of a heavy school art. It passed like in the mid 70's. and I love it! Once you have finished the licking of the heavyweight echo of the slow motion of the lower and lower motion movement, you can not get rid of your eyes until you're ridiculous and absurd. The superstar Jesus Christ, beyond the valley of the dolls, is a kind of crossing and a great journey with your parents in a water bed. At the same time, the train is sinking, totally brilliant, as well as the b-grade photo of the worst-case genres in the seventies (<br /> <br /> on the plot <br /> <br /> <br /> I'll tell you about the plot, they could hardly ever know what happened, perhaps through the constant reproductions that came with the characters that could or could not be produced, and the hippie face painted. The nickel-like performance performance art level mime street theater sequences like trivial. < <br /> <br /> "Logan" is an iconoclastic filmmaker who is a truly iconic researcher who is the one who casts people and cries out, especially if they are always surrounded by a silent film crew, and they look like an orgy. Richard Dreyfus plays an accountant It seems that the film team seems to hate for some reason and harshly laughs, maybe to torment him. Nature of "Suzanne" The owner, empty space without empty stairs and completely insults the insanity of "artist". No doubt, the "artist" is completely mad. either overacting his hamstrist or his immense horrible painting. All the awesome nudes of Susanne. There are other characters that are randomly created as a "man" character. Suzanne is also very hot. has a monologue I never could sense what he had to do with the story, because everyone did not know how to hate the "man" and could not do it without making a movie. There is also a silent girl. The mutual girl finally trusts me, very stupid.
