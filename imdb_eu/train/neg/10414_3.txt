The movie about Western Slaves is very nonsensical and little is seen and Puddy is star of "Seinfeld" show! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in the theater, and it is considerably more thin here. Oliver Reed got the most brilliant billing, but it's hardly ever in the movie. Warburton plays a white slave and it's fun to see all the young and ridiculous wives of a wealthy old man because they want to do sex with him. He is the owner of Eartha Kitt Bordel and there is so much nudity in the film. If the orgies that are not drunk in Bordeaux are not the wives that go with her. Then, of course, the slaves make a riotous rebellion and bloody. A true political message like "Burn" is not the invention of another plot to carry out the story. They made a terrible success and Warburton and all the rest came again! I hope you paid a lot of dough because this first movie is pretty bad. She keeps nudity look and Warburton does not give any accent. I'm very sorry but I have to admit that I want to watch the episode.
