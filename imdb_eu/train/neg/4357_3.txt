A group of friends go face to face with the family of cannibals in the beautiful countryside of Germany. <br /> <br /> The concept of 'Mutant canine families' is almost like the hills between boys. He is often called home; So what you need to do to direct any new director in the genre is that you need to be curious enough to be curious. With Barricade, Timo Rose wants to routine the rhythm with a teutonic twist, trying to transplant the Black Forest and splatter treatment of the German low budget. The result is a very bloody effort, but it is completely relative, especially through some decisive management, with the use of wonderful filters and the use of irritating editing techniques. <br /> <br /> Had Timo Rose chose all those naff-tricks that offered her editing software, then Barricade could be an entertaining gore-event: he does his unprofessional experience; bloody effects are a rotating abdominal fit; And they are not one or two fears and some well-thought out moments. All of this, however, is totally corrupted by enormous work of cameras, sharp editing and visual gimmickry floods, to give a brightly-watched popular look to today's filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I give it a barricade from 10 to 10 for a strange gore, where a guy drinks acid, an evil wound that causes some sharp tools and some decent shotguns.
