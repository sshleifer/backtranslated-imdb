Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and Kate's faithful lover, (Eva Longoria) are looking at last-minute relationships to welcome them. The wedding is in the morning and Kate is awesome, giving food to the demands of the presentation. But horror of horror, the sculpture of the "angel" ice, prescribed by Kat, does not reach the wings. In a fight against the sculptor, the "ice cream" heavy maid falls to Kate and sends it later. A year later, when Henry's sister asked a young veterinarian to tell a young veterinarian, Kat wanted to come across another woman and move forward. However, beautiful, Ashley (Lake Bell), Henry, is very interested in being in love with her catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns to Ashley for the sake of destruction, because another woman does not intend to leave Henry. Can something make Kate come back to heaven? It is a deep romantic comedy, the worst ever seen by this dedicated fan. No, it's not thrown, because things are trying to do things right. Longoria is beautiful and fun, fianc√© and Bell, whose style and humor are also infectious. Biggs, also funny, is totally lost. Rudd, in the case of highly talented interpreters (see Anchorman, Knocked Up or Clueless, please), is trying hard and, in fact, the main reason to see this clunker. Its charm, looks and easy to take a long way. But nothing is a headless script and a tremendous direction to become a winner, nothing. So, if you're a fan of romantic comedy, you can think long and hard before saving money. Despite the fact that it is a free entry to your lap, it has warned that this movie is a death experience for those who love and laugh at movie-makers.
