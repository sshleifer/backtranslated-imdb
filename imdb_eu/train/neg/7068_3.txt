Boyd's script does not necessarily have to do any work like Chillers, that is, the last round of the round mile and every story is a mud. The first one is completely absurd and it does not look like an end and the best thing about these anthologies is short accounts. The second story is predictable and, once again, simply ends without winning. So Chillers continues to see that each story is very credible, and they do not have any rewards for it. Character and conversation are poorly written. Stories do not have their original ideas and, in general, the movie is sucked. Each story lasts at least and I like the idea behind the linkage segments. Boyd's director worked with a small budget and, of course, shows. All I can say is that if you want to see a small 15-story full set inside a pool, Chillers is for you. Stories are not clear, scary or tense and nothing builds up. Having said that it has beautiful scenery and sometimes some amazing abilities shine. Violence and sensitivity do not occur in Chillers, like a little heart, like a pinch of head and a dirty man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < impression of anybody Basic cinematography, bad music, special effects and average production values ​​below. Chillers also has one of the songs of the closing theme. The performance is very low standard. <br /> <br /> Chillers has made a lot of effort as a low-budget film and at least filmmakers have attempted to do so at least for that. but that still does not stop me thinking about it. Similar anthologies films (Tales from the Crypt) (1972), Asylum (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973), Dr. Terror's Horrors House (1965), Creepshow (1982) and Tales From the Darkside: The Movie (1990) are much larger than Chillers, so watch one of them.
