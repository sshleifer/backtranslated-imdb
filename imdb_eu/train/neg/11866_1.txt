He created the first film, according to the film, won the "Best Film of Texas" at the "Worldfest" film festival. Hmmm had to be a quiet year. <br /> <br /> He would not call the movie anymore, but it's horrible, Aussie B's "Body Melt" is just as incredible as another slider. The movie did not look like it was shot in HI 8 video. <br /> <br /> I think that my producers have seen a lot of Troma movies, and B grade Gore films are very bad, they think they can even break the business that publishes this film. <br /> <br /> I am not wrong to write, I love films that I really like, some characters have put fake stories, most of them have more opportunities to sell in states or something. Fully disappointing is also over, it can be a showdown in more exciting ways, and some fight scenes. You can completely see filmmakers attempting to copy a whole "Bad Taste" copy, a car explosion, a rocket launcher, and many people who are constantly running, but the end is "humorous" or "bad". liked it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
