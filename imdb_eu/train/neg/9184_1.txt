F * ck Me! I've seen awesome horrors of my time, but it's p * ss! <br /> <br /> I can not honestly say this movie is really bad. There is not really a plot, a comic stroke, a terrifying excuse for zombies; You know what, he could go through the day. Every little thing in this movie is stupid, absurd, insignificant, or shameful. I tell anyone who wants to watch this movie ... no! <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to say, I have it in my wardrobe. It is hidden under a large pile beneath God. I could not even have a horse-sh * t excuse for a movie away. That's a bad thing.
