When you thought it safe to go back to the water ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Another computer created a changing skin for human food, that is, it released one of the other stupid sciences. Gereco Biotech is deceiving a growth hormone research, releasing a baby crocodile that is evolving rapidly. <br /> <br /> B-movie cast adds to the fun "genetic defect monster movie". Costas Mandylor remembers works Mick Dundee, Aussie accent, hat, big ass knife. Gereco, as the Croc's contracting executive director, Joanna Pacula (... the role of the executive executive has been stereotyped, freeing innocent people). Charles Napier is a town sheriff who is in danger and Jane Longenecker is her hot daughter, who works at the animal shelter. Soap opera star Matthew Borlenghi Longenecker's love is a local artist welded by sculptures ... he is a victim of his brother crunch. Obviously, this skill will be very useful when our heroes create a trap for the crocus to poison it with carbon monoxide. <br /> <br /> Krok himself never reduces his conviction a bit. The special effects of a low level variety through a reserve that is looking for food. Regardless of the productions of Roger Corman, I'm sticking to Carnosaur based on Dino-monster-related products. Here monsters are a crocodile standing leg upright, often standing up for the victims. Mandylor and filmmakers felt I was a fan of Crocodile Dundee, a huntsman, and that imitation could be mistaken for the monsters to fail. Borlenghi and Longenecker really have a pretty good chemistry on the screen together. As expected, Pacula gets ridiculous (gulp) fashion.
