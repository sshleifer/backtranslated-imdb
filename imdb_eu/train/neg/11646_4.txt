Kojak is in the mafia. The people of Telly Savales seem to be quite unforgettable. I never thought the show was very good. This is the single-character characterization of the crime chief with very unforeseeable results. If you hit the car's claws and show off, there's a lot of land development or action. The Mafia movie will find it sad, I have no respect or interest in ordinary criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case, the Italian film, treated them as heroes of these men. I saw the movie and I did not remember it in a few days. Takedowns, innocent dying, betrayal and loyalty. The movie is pretty well photographed and the play is decent. Duplication is so bad (for voices that can not be extracted from those bodies), I began to look for Godzilla Bay.
