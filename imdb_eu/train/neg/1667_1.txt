I really liked the movie until the end. Of course, he was cursed and quite difficult, but he still kept his attention in a rainy evening. Until it's over, that's it. Regarding the latest performance in the prestigious classic conservatory, he has struggled to meet other classically trained students, what is the protagonist? Wow these in their hands and execution the music tradition of that time? No Carmen tortures and senses the great Sensual Habanera and makes Brittany Spears completely unforgettable. Melt my ears! And, at the height of the horror, the teachers gave him a little applause. A fantasy teacher from Spears would fail immediately. Save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!
