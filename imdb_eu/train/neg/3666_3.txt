This is a very confusing movie. The film is very difficult to follow and the plot does not make sense. Wolfman Fury was made in Spain and I think that any film that is dubbed from one language to another does not mean, first of all, as I said. Perhaps this is part of this problem, but I can doubt that it can respond to all the problems that can swear. Duplication is pretty bad and the voices are not very well suited to the characters. The scenes are noisy, they are extravagant and irrelevant characters that make the viewer even more confused. Wolfman himself, who liked this movie, was the appearance of the scenes he had attacked. Now if they put together and make sense, they might have something. Do not miss this time.
