I apologize, but maybe this was a horrible fear when it came out in 1978, but it's just kept in modern times. Michael's sister, Judith, is wearing her Halloween mask, the only interesting scene in the whole movie. The most amazing moment in the whole movie is that when his parents take out the mask they will kill his son to kill his daughter. This movie goes down and does not take up to fifteen minutes, but it's too late, the viewer has lost interest in the story. There is no development of any character, and people are always mad at Laurie for being so extraordinary, because he does not really have much. I'm sorry to hear that no one is terrified of this movie, but if you want a terrific movie, watch Shining or Rosemary's Baby. The two best horror movies ever made. Halloween is definitely not its highest. I can not believe that Roger Ebert gave him four stars, because he could never see the greatest valuations worthless.
