I sent an email to a friend at the film school. One thing that must be avoided is that film nonsense, when they overwhelm overloaded monologues, is ultimately fascinated by the dull and persuasive monologue. If the film has an attempt at social realism, these verbal links are so high that they were built as cinematographic cinema and effectively neutralize this intention. Is it affecting, or is it bad, or both? <br /> <br /> The protagonist is also very incredible in terms of social realism: he is able to produce and produce such canonical English literatures and high bible or crows. deep poisoning while soliloquy? And does the majority of women who meet in a few minutes for meetings that can not be attractive, unclean and harmful? (When he got his applause on his side, he was applauded, applause and shamelessness, though). <br /> <br /> The audience will find references to ancient Greek literature in the Nostradamus and Apocalypse book. . The latest event of mankind, featuring bar codes that are printed on our eyebrows or right-handed with barbarian bible, is presented to a character depicted as a guardian of pure space. <br /> <br /> This Flick is overloaded with the scriptwriter and is on top - a man who has a pedestrian "philosophy" confused about life, etc. It is evil, abominable, and boring. <br /> <br /> There are very good English films with a similar content to this film. "Nil by Mouth" is a great excursion in the lives of individuals, in a similar social environment. Ditto "Warzone in". And even if the comparison is not justified, check out Peter Greenaway, it is much more intense conversation, spirits and absurd characters and situations.
