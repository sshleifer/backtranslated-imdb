I'm kidding! This was one of the worst movie ever I've ever seen! It was so bad that it was horny. My friend and I rented it, it seemed so bad. Cheesy ancient horror movies are always some laughter. The stunk of the soil, some voices were doubled, the quality was horrible. But I'm sure I saw an explosion!
