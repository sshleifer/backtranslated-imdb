Yes, I was lucky to see the original production of Michael Bennett's great music. It was an amazing experience and I saw the movie that hit theaters in 1985. It's terrifying. Almost everything fails. First, Attenborough (the actor, a good director with a good material) is a bad choice - as John Huston Annie contracted mangrove. The camera is always wrong - cut the songs and CASTING !!! It's terrifying - the power of acting were the dancers: these talented and talented performers only wanted to show what they could and when they got their chance - you could not get their eyes removed. But this cast gets dance, it makes the work "pleasant", but none of it is blown up. Actually, look at the distribution of the IMDb - no one has ever done anything. (OK, well, Janet Jones Gretzky - sheesh got married). So, this film does not capture a second train of magic, disappointment, the passion of the stage. Total gorge! (But while trying to break the music, excellent music still climbs sometimes and reminds people of a good score).
