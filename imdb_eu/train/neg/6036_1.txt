As a protagonist with an unknown cast that will continue in this way, this "movie" is a slasher cheap movie that surprised me how it was released. I'm not afraid of any problems, especially slasher, which are my favorites. But when they do BAD HORIA, it really takes the monkey and it's not surprising that the genre is so difficult. The story seems to us as possible and without any imagination, this zombie / ghost goes to the woods and works with corrupted forest people. It is not the story, performance and dialect that most likes it, the correct domestic sound and the soundtrack. No need to mention the laughable effect and a few short films - These fogs are bright daylight, do we still think it's still night? What did the director think of this movement? What, just one day to shoot all this? Was the dark afraid? (It's horny if a policeman looks like a black purple line in the daytime) <br /> <br /> I look like a positive part of the actors in the local supermarket. So they can at least escape this movie without ever realizing it. I'm sure that "teens" play bingo in the local bar - but it's 40-45 years old. <br /> <br /> Anyway, laugh, but also the movie and more time.
