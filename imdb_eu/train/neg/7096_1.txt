It's incredible that it is so huge at many levels. Screening, playmaking, directing and casting are awesome. Clothes, sets and pseudo-medieval language are also horrible. I swore I curiously, when I accepted that it was not really good. I find it a shame that when people create something that would give them so much time and effort, they could really make a real thing from this premise (though not very credible!), But we're quite naive and cursive. The story of dragon and knights, who have no charms in other fantasy films. Let's hope the Lord the Rings is a little better! Oh, and looks like David Thewlis's hair is cut. It is not!
