After I saw the book I saw the movie, I knew what would happen. I had a great deal of hope for the movie, due to the rating. The only reason that I gave 2 of the 10 stars of this movie is to be a movie. I have two main points to not like this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Casting Jack Nicholson hardly agrees with the character of Jack Torrence. Also, I would never have met Shelly Duvall for Wendy. Wendy seemed to me differently. I look at why Jack Nicholson was picked up, smiling, sharp eyebrows, but he does not think he's "wicked." It seems normal and makes the wicked. They also make one of the worst pair of movie pairs. Danny was well, but he needed more life. He started Droney way. <br /> <br /> 2. Screenplay. All things that were in the book were cut and things were added. Some of the things that were looking forward to being deleted, changed or manipulated were wrong. Some of the items that were looking forward to it (hedge animals, roque mallet, elevator) were not a movie, it was 2 and a half hours! I was very angry. <br /> <br /> 3. Finish. When it was completely changed, Halorann was killed, Jack froze, Wendy never hurt ... Overlook did not blow. The ending book was very enjoyable, and the movie was so horrible, that they were so unhappy. Hallorann was never supposed to die, but Jack was killed with an ax. If you want to kill them, you must use Jack's beak at least. No one ever saw the beak in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I do not like other things like the movie, but things are fine. The angels of the camera were very cool, the blood from the lift (which was not in the book) was cool, but maybe I was very angry that the movie was not in the book, without fear. I recommend reading this book before watching the movie. Stephen King applauds Stanley Kubrik for not signing a contract. I would never have done that anymore, I would take all the rights that the girl could call me all day long. I can not wait to see the 6-hour version, at least the coverage animal. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2/10
