The words "Swedish" and "Action movie" are not mixed. This becomes increasingly noticeable in all genres. This is another attempt failed. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works with secret computer systems in an aerial military base. One day foreign criminals threaten to say they do not hurt the family. They want a secret equipment and they will get something done. <br /> <br /> This movie has ups and downs. Swedish movie action is usually not just "downsides", "downsides". So, in this movie, he showed something good quality. In order to start a positive note, I can mention that the movie is technically sound. The footage of airplanes and helicopters are shot well and looks very nice. The performance is a very different quality. Shanti Roney makes a decent performance while Maria Bonnevie is a regular and natural (I'm wondering how many Swedish directors will continue to use, even if they have plays on the Wooden Table?). Stefan Sauk is keen to investigate "the" special force as "cool". <br /> <br /> And what action is the scene? Well, as I said in the airplanes and helicopters aircraft above, it's nice. But apart from that, there is not much action to talk about. This is a common problem with Swedish filmmaking. There is not enough action going on. Maybe it's a quote problem, maybe it's a cinema culture. I do not know, but experience negatively. Actually, the story and the performance are not good enough for the movie to be trusted for that. <br /> <br /> I value this effort 4/10.
