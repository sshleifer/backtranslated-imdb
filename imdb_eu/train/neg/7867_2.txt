Okay, I tried and tried it, but I still do not get this Guy Maddin. The stories of the Gimli Hospital I had cold, the Austrian people and the Ice Nymph had a great look, but it was lacking in the story section ... and this abortion and hockey movie is boring. I am glad that Maddin considers that silent movie, but I do not like his films for the same reason, I do not like the films of Quentin Tarantino: they are just better films and more imaginative homage. New land - and all styles and no substances. Jump cuts and double-angle cameras do not play David Lynch's disguise, but it has an advantage to Tarantino. In general, he does not write interviews, since most of his films are on top of the intertitle. It's the bottom line: Maddin's schtick is a top-of-the-art film lightweight film.
