I saw this more badly sensitive. Why does God, like Ian Hunter, want to help the people escape from the Devils island? And what did he do first? I mean, God works in a mysterious way, but by helping thieves and killers and prostitutes, we find salvation, forgiveness and heart change in such a bad location ... In any case, it's not a nice movie. Unlike any kind of Gable, this portrait of a man who is selfish is still missing, but Crawford is just as fascinating to me, not at all, and the whole look of the movie seems to be 10. a few years before. Compared to the temporary "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", it looks prehistoric.
