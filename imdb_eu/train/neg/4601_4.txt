I do not know anything about the work of the writer or the director, so I did not prejudge films. Based on the description described in the TV Guide plot, it seemed very interesting to me. <br /> <br /> But it was impossible it was impossible. Every turn of the plot seemed like an excuse for more blood, make-up or special effects. <br /> <br /> It was a professional score and it seems that Kari Wuhrer is a decent actor, but bad for the rest. . It was absolutely compelling. <br /> <br /> I will not go through the narrative, but I will give an example in an excessive way of explicit gore. <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna goes to an isolated house of the ranch and throws himself out of the frozen body of his first victim (Wendt). McKenna Wendt was killed in her neck. He now thinks he must destroy evidence of Wendt's disappearance. (What will the police do, bite the radius?) McKenna Wendt cleans his head and neck in the freezer bag, he takes an ax and wraps his head. Whack Whack Whack The pieces of the axis remain on the neck of Wenden. The air is filled with chocolate with frozen fried poultry, one of which falls on the head of McKenn. (He threw it when he finished.) McKenna then leads the frozen head to a small fire that leads outside. She is sitting on the floor, she is standing next to him, taking pictures of a woman who has died, and shows them in Wendt's head. "Remember? We could really do it if you are not you," he told himself. "Duke, you always liked the fire, right?" he asks. Then he puts his head on the fire. We only make a picture of smoking, but we hear the fats that appear on the flame. <br /> <br /> I will not cause the litter to be censored. I wonder what I'm looking at. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to continue watching other movies. Well, I will mention an example of "applause" since I came up with the idea. McKenna is removed and locked in a dark cottage. He knows that he will take him to death for the next few days. (He's literally heavy) What would you do in this Poe-like situation? Here's what McKenna does last night in his life. Finding an excluded calendar and masturbating there (successfully). Give this man the medal of freedom! <br /> <br /> Pizza Hut is a monster that resembles unnecessary flashbacks. The camera is often manually shaken. The dialogue is as follows: "Life is a piece of ***, otherwise the best of all is possible, it depends on the perspective". The use is a wide-angle lens that converts ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. A house explodes at the end of the fireman, while the heroine McKenna while walking through the foreground. <br /> <br /> A hero as well. First, he kills a man for 13,000 dollars, knocked his head several times over a heavy statue, then a bold plant, before it spills the fridge upwards. (This is a bit disturbed, but it is not enough to stop paying for the payment.) Then I hope I'll get the order, it will kill Wendt to extract some of his neck. Afterwards, he murders his first wife, the victim, who accidentally and heavily denounces, has had nothing to do with any moral calculations. Next he heads the champion (Baldwin). Then, after two smaller weights are disabled, it deliberately knocks them up, even though one of them does not seem quite like that. And we have to be roots for McKenna. <br /> <br /> These are not the cartoon deaths of Harry Dirty, such as: bang bang and dead. These are slow and painful. The first - $ 13,000 murder - is clumsy enough to make it look like it happens in real life. It is not easy to kill another man, as Hitchcock proved, with Torn Curtain. But this scene has no place at all. <br /> <br /> Some would enjoy, especially young people who think of things that happen solely in pain and death. Here are some meretricious screens.
