It's worse than the original game of death. A confusing and incoherent language falls into the ground below the "Billy Lo" helicopter, we've killed, Bobby Lo to follow his brother. So we start off with the Bruce Lee clone, the movie kills one and thirty minutes to keep up the story. The main reason to see this is when Bobby Lo is fighting a lion, of course, a type of lion dress. Jang Lee Hwang is also wicked, it's usually quite wonderful, but the screen time is very small. Especially because of this and the original Death Game because you saw Bruce Lee in a boxed set. It's not surprising that Lee's works come together. Nobody would buy any.
