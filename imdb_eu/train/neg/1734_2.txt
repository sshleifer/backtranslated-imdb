I am a great Western hobby of the past, and I do not think Hollywood is capable of getting its old glory. But neither Ronda Fleming nor Stewart Granger can contribute a movie that has almost all the features of western western arms in 1957. a fallen but virtuous woman, who must recover the firefighter, etc. I can not help recognizing the names of young writers and "actors" who help Granit child's child. Is there no nepotism? I have seen a better performance in high school theater theater. Chill Wills is a cartoon character from Chill Wills. I still got 1,000 words?
