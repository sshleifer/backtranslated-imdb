I saw the bad DCOM. Then Well, maybe not as bad as Smart House. This was a bad thing. The play and story was OK, but the consequences were SUCKED! <br /> <br /> They were so fake! The only fight scene was between brother and Shen. I was probably the only scene I was most excited about. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie seemed to me very boring and the movie suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> I will give a fourth to Brenda Song, a very entertaining actress and a fight scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
