According to some comments made on the IMDB, I expected the action movie - it was perhaps dramatic or stupid or a simple one or a comedy, but it was basically an action movie. <br /> <br /> I did not know what it was like, I definitely did not like the movie. The story is straightforward and straightforward (although the preface is a complex one). Take three interest groups: 1) government 2) rebels 3) a group of killers. <br /> <br /> Now remove the first one (they never appear in the movie). Then just let princess killer turn to revenge to become a rogue. Add the awareness of the riot of love with the guilty conscience. And you have ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they still will not make a story or film. Random action sequences and low budget sci-fi among strange images is a feeling of gap. The movie is not like a movie, but the dream is strange, unconsistent and boring. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10
