I'm sorry that the horror movie lover is just about warming others around this terrific "horror" movie. Do not waste time or money in this movie, the performance is bad, the story is just the worst thing I found and the script was awesome. Nothing was good, you finally think why I'm seeing this empty. The plot had so many holes and at last they never cleaned up, it was so bad, I do not know how to make such a terrifying movie. I love horror movies and I said, as I said, I was 18 years old, but you see a little blood and it is not afraid or leap. That's why it was terrifying what happened to the stupid things that happened in the movie, like brother and sister, as they kissed, why? I can say everything. Simply do not worry, there are far more horror movies out there, just do not waste your life a short time.
