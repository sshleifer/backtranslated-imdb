Surely it's happening in the west, but the title seems to be a bit of a western one. Instead, the sheriff is a woman's movie. Do not make a mistake about a bad movie about a woman sheriff. Sheriff becomes his husband when he is dead; That's why it's a bit annoyed. His main goal is to follow a woman, but he will hire the evil man to kill him. That's why it happens, the hero falls in love with the murderer and vice versa. Absolutely stupid, anyone who is killed in this movie will be given a new one. He had little chance to pursue the killer behind him, but I think he liked it, he did not do it. The murderer is also mute due to the mayor of the town. This movie is very boring and it's not really worth a look ... it's not one of the best MST3000 episodes. I can not imagine it without seeing anyone, because it would be much worse. Corman is a low budget director, but he should know better that people get into the same place and get another.
