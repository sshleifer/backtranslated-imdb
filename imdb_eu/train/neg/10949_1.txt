I'll be entertained at the cinema. There's nothing entertaining about this movie. From the beginning to the end, there is no gray and agility rhythm of this woman's life. It is a simple rhythm, without any changes of mood. I stopped until the end, I'm sure things are better. They do not know, and I do not think I was the only one, when the rumor around the movie was closed, according to the many reflections on film. Honestly depicting deprivation of society is not crime, but your audience is bored not the way to gain sympathy for the people. Horrible movie
