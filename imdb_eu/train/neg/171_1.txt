I thought Hedy Burress (because he had managed to escape the plains of the first part) would not have guessed that it would be part 2. I think they should die on Friday, in the second half of the second half (I know what I know). <br /> <br /> This film, like Scream 3, and Urban Legend 2, has followed a movie. /> <br /> This was PURE CRAP! Full movie inside a movie crap. <br /> <br /> BAD STAY AWAY!
