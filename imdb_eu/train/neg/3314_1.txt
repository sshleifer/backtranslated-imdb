I realize I was reading through these positive reviews. How did you realize that so many people liked Jane Aust's second favorite favorite second novel? There are a lot of problems with the movie, mentioned in some reviews; Put simply, the open, excessive, blurring begins when you open the bubble. <br /> <br /> While many characters put mis-cast and Ewan McGregor and Toni Collette are not performing. Those who deserve it, the farthest thing is Paltrow. I have been very pleased with the role in its operation, but here it is abominable, self conscious, nose, poor and completely disconnected by its characters and around them. A very enjoyable effort - although Emma was not able to save this movie.
