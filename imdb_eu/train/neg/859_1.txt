I recently caught a smell of a movie's smell on the cable channel and reminded me of how I thought it was first published in 1980. There, many reviewers do not have enough time around this film and the fight between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. Renowned novels had a passionate legion to see the alleged "master" director. A multi-layer supernatural story was put on the screen. "Salem's Lot" has already sank in the late 1970s with Tobe Hooper's famous "Chainsaw Massacre" TV series "TV Chainsaw Massacre", and it was badly handled, the book's leading criminologist turned to "The Chiller Theater Theater "a real vampire with no threats destroys all the premise." The fans expected a successor to a Kubrick stunt manager to avoid the success of Hooper. It did not happen. <br /> <br /> Surely, this movie looks great It has a wonderful sequence of openings, but after a few successes, everything goes down. Jack Nicholson can not be excepted by Jack Nicholson, he is always mad and does not bring anything to his role. I do not like many reviewers think that this is the clinker, "Here It's Johnny! "However, a bit ... it's horrible in this movie, so it's also the rest. Scatman Crothers's character, Dick Halloran, has been a key part of the book's plot , but Kubrick kills one of the most difficult sequences of "shock ever". I recall the audience in the theater, in the last 45 minutes I've seen it repeatedly, as this was booing, those who were left ... a lot left. King's books have never been shooting well into the movie; For there are many of these narratives within their characters and often in metaphysics. Kubrick abolished the tension between the lives and the dead here, and as a result the end of the mess ends with the origin of the material, in short, we really do not care what happens. <br /> <br /> Still this film is still sour and why they think so much a horror masterpiece for me.
