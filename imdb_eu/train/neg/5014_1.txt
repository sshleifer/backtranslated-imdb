The longest end of a movie that I have seen for a long time, is tortured and wretched. Unfortunately, it begins after initial credits. January Jones looks like a wooden play, I was surprised when the movie began to come close to the candles. Actually, I do not remember the film that he himself makes (the blessing to be believed, I do not criticize the actors' critics as there are too many things that can affect the film, but this is so bad in this case, it is really worth mentioning. With Meryl Streep, it sometimes swears to others who read through a card set, and they will be as bad as they'll ever see, as they'll never see, but there is still no excuse for the director. I'm sorry for the rest of the cast Indian Indians / Breakfast clubs were taken to a rotten burrito and then rebuilt by a school graduate.
