This is an interesting idea, it's bad. The hidden lyrics of the series of the series are intriguing with a serial killer, but the execution of "Anamorph" is very slow and without much interest. There's no way to describe the movie except boring. The traces of death are the only interesting parts of "Anamorph". Everyone who relies is boring. Willem Dafoe provides a compelling performance as an investigator, but has nothing to do with a script that extends to the limit. Several assistant actors are wasted, including Peter Stormare, James Rebhorn as an art expert, Paul Lazar, as a medical counselor, and Deborah Harry, especially in the back of the DVD case. Crack the pairs of lines that speak through the door. It is not recommended. - MERK
