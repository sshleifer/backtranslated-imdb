I really enjoyed how it started, it has been especially worthy of the special effects of the film for 50 years. There were beautiful landscapes. However, the film is quite beginning to begin with some mute conversations, because the men try to flirt with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius". <br /> <br /> After a long absence, this was seen in the 90s. It was fun to see Francis again, since most of his television shows had been released ... and he still plays. It's interesting to see a young look at Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams"), I did not know if I had a voice that I did not know about. <br /> <br /> I saw half of it. The boring was almost completely immersed in the movie before and I had a hard time sleeping. I confess to putting this VHS tape in stereo again. but it was an effort. This is one of the thought-framed "thinking" and "thought" thinking of "elites". That's nonsense. "Intelligent" appeared in the 1950s because science fiction films were so stupid! <br /> <br /> The first scenes were some of the great screen, but I did not have the time to write. Perhaps another look - this time I would change the review with a 2.35: 1 broadband transfer.
