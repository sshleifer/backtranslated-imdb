This movie is about a police officer (Ching Wan Lau), who is trying to capture a thief (Ekin Cheng), an insurance company that manages Kelly Lin. Basically, the police trying to try, in a way, the robbers know beforehand. Beautiful filmmakers, actors and Hong Kong scenes are not covered by good films. It's all flash, and the flash becomes too dull. All of the interests I lost the video in the third, after which there was no dismissal quality, except cinematography, that is, good looks. Think of this movie for free. Also, think about watching the movie 20-minute movie, the same as the end: BORING. 6/10
