** SPOILERS ** I rented "Thesis" (or "Thesis" in English) by the effort of "Alejandro" Amenabar, director. As a brilliant and effective movie, I thought that previous efforts would have a similar quality, and I had an incredible extravagance. Instead, I saw the German film "Anatomie", which I saw with the harsh and nonsensical excuse I saw (this reminded me). <br /> <br /> The plot has the potential but it is thrown into the first 20 minutes. She is a student of innocent psychology about Angela (Ana Torrent - Jessica Harper Deadridgeer), a thesis about film violence. Through a series of distant circumstances, two men torture, mutilate and torture the young girl in the cameras, get the boy and kill him. Angela and her horror Chema friends (Fele Martinez) are astonished, despite the fact that the ribbons are fascinated and decides who is responsible for it at the bottom. This is ... well ... nothing. <br /> <br /> They want to find out why they want to find the girl killers (they refuse to talk to the police about the incidents they encounter, even if their lives are at stake), Graham Norton is as mysterious as it is, In a room with bunny girls. There is no single "trace" (the type of camera used by the killer is found), which is very weak and b) the first 20 minutes are rounded off. It happens through the blind luck of 'Unraveling', plots are more and more ridiculous and weird daisies are transparent and absolutely breathtaking, instead of throwing away just the execution time. <br /> <br /> Seriously - Amenabar knows his fantasy stories, but it's clear he never reads a detective's life in his life. The key to a good seal is to have a large set of potential suspects and eliminate one by one, with intelligent deduction and more and more evidence until the last turn. In the "Thesis", * SPOILER POTENTIAL AHEAD * the murderer's identity is appropriately directed by amateur detectives almost immediately and then we will get 100 minutes from the writer to get rid of the aroma until the idea is exhausted. her hands up and say "OK, ya me got, it was after him"! Any logic or motivation attached to the crimes, such as no luck. You're watching the wrong movie when you're up. <br /> <br /> The "thesis" that is far less than the written thriller, is a way of really trying. There are some playful and confusing 'points' on violence in films. I do not know what the attitude they want to pursue, but it seems that the deviation, the tone of psychopathic disorders, the equality, and say "look at me! I am politically!" The "last scenes" in the "point" of the movie are so absurd and stupid, it is impossible to ask anything, if this Amenabar is embarrassed to see it now. If he does not do it, he definitely needed it. This is a total "amateur night slasher house is the home of things. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not believe I've missed two full hours (it felt like at least six) about it, something that might happen is something 'Tobacco movies' (and that's basically everything), although this film suggests a criminal phenomenon that caters the world, it's a terrifying area, movies ("anyone with a" video course?), but it's so easy to overcome the line just like a child. It would be wonderful! ' territory "(ie," My Little Eye ") ... The" Thesis "is all the time lower for the" snuff movie ". At all levels, it's better to be dead and buried. I've given it eight times to be nice lighting, but all of this it's getting it.
