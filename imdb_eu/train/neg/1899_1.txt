I saw this, because I thought I had a lot of cars and a lot of cool cars. I guess I lie. This movie is very boring. <br /> <br /> The movie Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) starts sitting outside a Porsche dealer to find out if the car is right. If you confirm that it is the best, Kip gets a brick in the trunk and opens it in the window, it breaks down. Porsche gets his friend while he gets the keys. They start the car and get the night out. He can continue after the police in a warehouse. So all the crew steal all the cars and divide their way. Then we will get to Memphis Raines detection. Go-kart will give a small talk for children on one track. Then Atlee Jackson (Will Patton) faces up. Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip plays deeply. Memphis is one of the most important cars in Los Angeles. Memphis goes to the landfill and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclest). This man threatens to kill Kip if Memphis does not provide 50-hour 50-hour auto. <br /> <br /> There are some problems with this movie: <br/> <br /> 1.Story: In the first 48 hours of film Cage and Duvall are looking for the crew and when they plan everything. In-movie last 12 hours are a waste! <br /> <br /> 2. Cars: You see more than 50 cars in the way that the movie announces. So where are there 40 other cars? Why do not we see them? <br /> <br /> 3. The Chase: The end of the movie was a harassment joke. There was no suspense. <br /> <br /> <br /> 4. Dog: somewhere in the movie, the dog eats the burgers and swallows three keys too. This is impossible. They opened the keys. The key may damage the dog's esophagus, the stomach and the large intestine. The boys recommend laxative dogs. This will not work. He will get a lot of diarrhea, but not a stick. Jackass stated that Ryan Dunne was stuck with a car. Take laxatives, diarrhea, but no car. In the same case with the dog. <br /> <br /> 5. Police in Chase: When Eleanor breaks in for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage desperately tries to start the vehicle. You see a police boat behind him who does not look at his car. But when Nicholas Cage starts the engine again, the policeman turns to the right, looks at the car and starts chasing him. It's stupid. So when he heard the engine and when he saw the car, he found out that he was looking for a car. How do you know the proper car? See only back. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is boring. No action There are few cars. The movie is stupid. I have never seen the original, but I plan on it. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a star from the 10th. Get The Fast and Furious.
