Why do they feel that people feel good material and how to change them? Two years after reading this book based on a well-founded film, I can say there is not much in the original book. I entered into a movie with little hope. I know he would have a stupid telemetry, but he did not meet them. <br /> <br /> This is not a prequel - it has only one relationship. It is the original name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante; The character of the same name is completely different. On the face of each of Carlito Way Way they fell on their faces; Adding an injury Luis Guzman, who plays a decisive role in the original film, has thrown it into another role. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that when this film is made, there will be no other movie. To meet the original material of Carlito's Way. I'd really like to see it. I felt the same way about Chopper: they have four books, as well as conversations about fantastic fictional material, and could make the most horrible picture of Australia's most fearful. Instead, they liked it, but they made an amazing movie. A pathetic low season (despite the fact that Eric Bana's performance was in detail). Now we will not see the real downfall of Carlito. <br /> <br /> If you look at the three stars as just the toes, it's not so horrible. (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito but it can be good for other roles) and the story is not very bad. Even if Puffy Combs suits his role. They misunderstood the nature of the world in that period (I am a little bit of a crime non-fictional) - original movies and books have been correct (after this lawyer and Edwin Torres have written the judge). . <br /> <br /> However, in truth, it is not the only stand - the worst case ever shot.
