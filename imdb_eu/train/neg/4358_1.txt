Well, I've spent 95 minutes and 47 seconds, I will never get back to the trash. Someone mentioned that this online movie I described "subcategories of human canals", and I thought that the hope was that it would be similar to God. WRONG! The psychic Descent thriller was a dynamic character and a strong argument. These criminals are totally realistic and some of their performance is not spectacular. This movie is not so controversial, I have seen this level in many movies. This movie is awesome SYNOPSIS: Blonde who thinks she's really hot (but not that), her admirer and friend of her friend (I do not remember their names) into the woods. It breaks the cars. A noticeable man warns him. Blond is reasonably hysterical and the next morning they can not find admirer friends. Admirer crushes his foot. Do not worry, it is much annoyed that the car does not lock the nails locked. After a nanosign of Koaxingur, the blond leaves help finding. I remember events. In this film and throughout, torture scenes are shown grotesque, without substance, including a gag. Blonde admires the cannibal's house (although they are eating intestines), that is, the ultimate opportunity to be the ultimate choice of food for logically real food. Blonde is a great admirer and works very hard (unsuccessfully) for tears. Then you can get a good laugh at the blonde who can announce that she is "think". Mark (let the men leave them) has a marked change in character when the cannibal informs his family. Then there are some filming, they leave the house, the film continues, and then a random guy will appear and tell him that he is watching. Before kicking, other scenes of dying have been inspired by the acid travel inspired. Blonde or her admirers did not help her. He dies a lot, admires the love of his blonde. Then, a mysterious hand covers the camera. What does that mean? I do not know, fortunately not a sequel.
