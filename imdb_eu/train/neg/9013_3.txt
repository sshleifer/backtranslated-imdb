It's hard to praise this movie a lot. The CGI of the dragon did well, but there was a lack of modeling suitable for light and shade. Similarly, footage is used more than once in the corridors of the whirlwind dragon. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see "Marcus Aurelius" in the credit of the actor, asking what was a former Roman emperor. Empire was making these films! Like "Whoopie Goldberg", it should be a nickname, and it may be a fault if one is to use one. This stuff would appear. <br /> <br /> The story may be interesting, but the play is flat and the direction is boring. . If you need to watch the movie, go to your friend's house and drink it like that - it will be nice.
