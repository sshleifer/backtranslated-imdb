In the first 10 minutes of this film, you do not realize that the main character who writes the life consultant's column, that is, must have tables, so clearly activated and learn some life lessons. then probably something is wrong with you. It's setup to predict the movie, although it's a good movie (though it's not) <br /> <br /> There's no chemical between Steve Carell's stalker-ish. behavior is shameful, it's not fun. It is hard to imagine that Binoche's interests would be of interest to him. Then, in the end, everything is wonderful and everyone lives happily. Is not America wonderful!
