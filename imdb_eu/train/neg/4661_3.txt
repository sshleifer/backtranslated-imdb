This film has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. WW2 is a curious movie that serves as a statement about racism. It is worth watching while watching Movies when it comes to understanding when we think about what we do not think about, and it's not the time of portraiture. That is, in the 70's a movie is not a 40-movie (WW2). However, seven good seven action scenes are guided by a white Captain white captain. Stories Captain is that these men are soldiers and not only learn a service company. A movie in the Civil War and not a WW2 movie might be the scene. Lt. The black man gives a innocent wife to the dough, and the white Capt is angry. From a curiosity perspective, I enjoyed the movie because stars and genres were of interest.
