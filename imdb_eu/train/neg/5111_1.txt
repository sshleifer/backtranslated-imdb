I was a passionate spectator, until I had been helping to build the White House's house, until a long time ago, to condemn myself to see the house one year later. All beautiful rocky landscapes have been removed, beautiful rocks and beautiful fountains have been removed, all pine and sugar crops have been cut off, the sprinkler system has been removed. A catastrophe seems to be. They no longer live ... they live in the town and only get off for the weekends. The poor Oklahoma gave me these people and thought to see the result every hour. The story we all saw on TV was not entirely true ... do not believe in everything you see and hear.
