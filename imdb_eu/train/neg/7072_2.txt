My title is roughly the amount of this junky whirlwind I would have to take a tip when I thought it was Fred's film Ray - but I thought I could be better than 'HEY, YOUR CONSTRUCTION' boy, I was wrong! It must be the worst film for children. The play was awful, the mood did not exist, the Directorate I ever saw was the worst, and the special effects would not seem like a place in Disney's 1950s movie. <br /> <br /> WHAT DO DEE-WALLACE STONE DOES! Who was once a promising route in the 80s? The veteran movie and the oldest children's actress was evil, and the budget was so small, as a kid-movie as incredible. <br /> <br /> I did not watch the episode in 1999 and I do not want to see the good movie of the girl See 'HONEY SHRUNK / BILW children / son' or any DISNEY FILM <br /> <br /> MY RATING 19 YO : - 2/10 <br /> <br /> ACCORDING TO ENTRY: - 3/10 BEST!
