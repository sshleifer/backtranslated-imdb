The film uses avant-garde titles for short stories. Kill Kill, it would be nice. The movie brings taboo scenes to the audience to retreat in their chairs. The scenes are not necessary and noisy. The movie is something that can be a beginner writer. Just filions props and network money in vain. I have to write 10 lines of text to criticize this movie, although I do not want 10 lines of my time, but I have to encourage people to know how to avoid nonsense. If you tell people to choose a good movie on film tonight, select something else. If you have an soul, do not harm this dirty dump.
