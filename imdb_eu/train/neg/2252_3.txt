So, a few people heard that the movie had tears in the theater. When I first saw it, I expected another movie and other teddy films; The way we were like something. I was definitely wrong. Esther Hoffman and her John Howard's two main characters do not exist, and it is impossible to bring them to the characters. There was nothing romantic. Streisand's character was not considered to be a drug dealer who could not sing a single note. At one point, his character finds his husband in bed with another woman and pardons him five minutes later. There's nothing romantic about a rock star lying and it seems like a woman who does not realize it really dies. The parts of the film seemed to be dragged, and when I had finished I was asking to continue. <br /> <br /> John Howard's death was completely predictable. It was clear in his film before writing his strange behavior, and I felt no excitement when he died. It was not a tragic accident, it was quite a fool. I mentioned all over the film, paying special attention to his bearded beard. <br /> <br /> Streisand songs are the only parts of this film that they deserve. This movie was my reason for the third part of the movie "The You Look More / Watch Closely Now" at the end of the movie. Only 7 minutes of the film I felt an emotion rather than anger or anger.
