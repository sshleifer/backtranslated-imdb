The movie was awful, the first movie was not very big, they told me it was hilarious if they were not enough with the first five movies, you should add another, why just do it in a series like James Bond. Why do you say that movies are very good, and I just understand these films? Thus I suppose, crossing between horror and comedy genres, that my nephew a year ago would not have been afraid of a horrifying attempts at horror, just like those who fear horror movies in some way. Please do not get more of these movies.
