I have rarely been so talented and unlucky. There is hardly anything to do to build a film without a dirt fracture. The film shows, at the beginning, little attention to the film that reveals it. High-level cast actors - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - they are spreading in no-way roles; Occasionally a genius director creates a film that is shot by a dyed coffee camera; A writer (John Grisham) has never merit, finds a new depth of incoherence motivated. The film has a cheap and faithful feeling about it, but hardly at the level of commentaries - it's really a part of aesthetics. Normally, I will come to the IMD to write balanced notes. I want to create an endless and pernicious product that is a huge disaster of a movie. I do not want to, but I have never occupied my "intelligence" with this bin.
