Ever sit in a movie and finish "wtf!" It's like a big one. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Decoy. <br /> <br /> You can watch or watch live streaming directly from the video clip, do not watch it. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick starred and quickly wasted today's mercenaries and rent. In it, the story is a pretty bad story, and it's a horrible action, and what happens if an action is to watch the movie if the action is broken? Robert Patrick, in particular, drops into a new sequence of actions that hangs on a buggy bus that fights a machine gun. Co-stars feature Charlotte Lewis and Canadian Scott Hylands (TV's Night Heat fame).
