I'm listening to rumors that report "Leonard Nimoy Blu-ray Disc." With the advances in the past 25 years, from the camera to the CGI, it is interesting that the franchise can be consolidated again. I hope that Magnavision's full flaw demonstration helps to get rid of the bad taste left on my mouth. <br /> <br /> And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy shows Betamax VCR" was a milestone in the history of entertainment. "Honest Leonard Nimoy, a solid caste," and "Honorable Leonard Nimoy 8-Track Tape," who would expect this great part of the movie? Right now I'm crying.
