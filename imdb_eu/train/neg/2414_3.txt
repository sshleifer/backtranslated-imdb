I found it on the shelf under "New Releases" and the idea of ​​a hip-hop zombie seems to be very interesting. That way, he was billed in the kutxa, however, and I thought: "What a wonderful idea!" Also, the "Welcome to Oakland" signal is also on the cover. How can I deal with it? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part only lasted on the matter. Hip-hop music and hip-hop culture did not play much role in the film. After living in Oakland, I know there are many hip-hop hip hop artists, so the low budget of this film was not an excuse to have a good soundtrack. The number of artists that are scrapped would give this option to help this fluent. Why did not Quiroz Brothers take advantage of it, it goes beyond me. <br /> <br /> When the movie is playing hard, the zombie movie was completely typical, so it was completely black and Latin. It might be thought that this would bring an unusual trend in the film ... but not. In a way, Quiroz Brothers, according to the "urban culture" view, shoots shooting and f-bombs in every movie line. The use of the word "fuck" is probably the most distinctive feature of this film; There was only one line three or four times with the word, and the lines were not at all once. I'm not talking about filming about the movie, but it was a sense of the writer's idea (this is Quiroz's brothers) and the script was very poor. <br /> The film was generally a disappointment. It would be interesting to actually see the "urban culture" zombie flick, but "Dead of the Living Dead" was not counted accordingly. The characters in the movie may be white or scythes or anything else. There was no different film taste. It has other low-run run-of-mills, bad performance, malicious writing, amateur direction, plain cinematography, cheap soundtrack, and nothing is recommended.
