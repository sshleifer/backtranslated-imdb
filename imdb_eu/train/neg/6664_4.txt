It starts with a smooth story that transforms innocent and pleasant romantic tales into Edward Norton's startling charming Harlan gradually reveals himself as things stand out and things get bad, since the movie changes southern modern and modern wild romance. western <br /> <br /> A nice Grenadier (Norton) walks through the city and charms a young girl (Evan Rachel Wood) and apparently regains her vile whirlwind with her mumble mother from the dead end but gradually becomes evident That cowboy looks more like that. <br /> <br /> Edward Norton ?? a real camel player (matching facial hair) that plays a hicky country, a little bit unhappy, but maybe he just tries to play it without worrying about accent. Without a doubt, it does not make little effort to make adjustments, as we learn more about Harlan. However, small changes mean that they are not sure where Harlan is coming from, and when it seems that Norton's good performance, it is gradually confused. Evan Rachel Wood is always fond of Norton's apple apples. <br /> <br /> At the bottom of the valley, it's a bit different because the events change its timing and the characters of the protagonist never clearly show the characters of the audience, the sensitivity of the characters is still uncertain. Do you like this? It is also clear after the dramatic turn of events. This ambiguity is at the expense of the film, the writer could not think what story they wanted to tell and something to do with poison. If one or other of the films were kept up, it could be a solid movie, but it remains a bad film. The lovers of ancient love will enjoy part of the movie, but they will be frustrated by the dark tone. Additionally to Norton fans (or enthusiasts of the rich landscapes of the San Fernando Valley), give it up.
