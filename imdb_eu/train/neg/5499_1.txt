I saw this bomb came into theaters. I laughed all the time. Why? The stupidity of this seemed to make me mad. I look back and realize that there was not a single fun thing in the whole movie. Leat is not deliberate. It's so funny that Lizzie cn chews a piece of Nurplex and becomes a huge carnivorous demon ... but her little little dress is full, though she's been even bigger than she had ever been for the first time. Or a man who can be surprised by a deflator and the type of film he is not aware of, and without paying medical attention to consciousness. And do not let the misfortune that they decided to create "conflict". <br /> <br /> <br /> Everyone who complains about Disney is just for kids. This part of the film seems to exclude this expression. Do we really need Daryl Hannah to tell Jeff Bridges about kinky ribbons on the accused? If you're on Disney and you have no ideas to attract the previous 8 mobs to the movies, without writing a more intelligent script! I'm sure of the ratings table paid by Disney to escape the death of the movies and still get family ratings. <br /> <br /> What DVD format is wasted?
