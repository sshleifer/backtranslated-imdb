How can I get 4 of the 16 previous voters for 10? How would the average half of voters over half be given? Who has voted here? I can not only suppose especially the children - very small children. Actually, it's a bad way for every movie. The story is stupid; acting is difficult to even imagine; the characters are not; and the conversation is horrible. I saw this rainy afternoon in the Sci-Fi channel. In the sad event that comes back, I suggest you read a book.
