When I do not know the US television channels, I thought it was just a low-science science fiction movie in the cable included in my laws, and then, in a few minutes, I started to think about it. the satire with the most exaggerating fundamentalist of Christians, and then it seemed to me - good pain, people are serious! It's been a bit since I've been ridiculously mistaken. I questioned this I questioned because I fear believers in crime, but then I have seen other opinions and I thought, well, they can take them. Strong philosophical difficulty: how do you make a movie by criticizing movies, if you do not show what you are criticizing? Answer: Do the only people who esteem that hate movies that criticize you. I think many liberals (that's the saying !, when you say so) could have an incident with the audience fan of non-obsessed J **** C myths. Do not think about it, it was so fun!
