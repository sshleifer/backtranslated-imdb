When I was 13 I remember this movie (it seems a lot of reviews say the same thing at AGE 13!) With a group of school friends. First of all, we wanted to see Billy Crystal and that it was a great commercial comedy that was said to have fallen into traditional commercial ads. We were about 45 minutes away and we all stopped playing the theater. It was grotesque and pleasing, and Billy Crystal was far from the laughing ability, we were not laughing. I accidentally reviewed it accidentally and I decided to register what other people in the rest of the world could say about the debris of waste, and if you rent this, you deserve what you get, You have warned!
