This film was promising, but it was really bad. It was a Premise O.K, but the plot was awful. The actors made the best of the limited material, but they did not exceed the average university mood. Jason Schwartzman was once again terribly angry - even more than Rushmore, the rest of the cast were not very different. The scenes to be fun were shameless and very original. He wants to be Road Trip / American Pie, but fails at all levels. Wasting all the time.
