I could see the preview of this movie early and I hope to get the best time to edit it before you can get it. Saturday Night Live's Andy Samberg is the star of "Hot" Rod Kimble. He plays a teenager in a small town, in a town that wants to be a bit like a late father. When we meet him, his truck is skipping over the boys, both a mo-ped and almost everything. This would be worth a movie 'Jackass', if he did not want to do this. Isla Fisher, Denise, is older than a girl and older. It seems that Rod is enough to join his crew. Jorma Taccone (as well as SNL) plays her half brother, who documents Kevin with a camera camera. Sissy Spacek plays Roden's mother, Marie. It was interpreted by Ian McShane, Frank Powell. Frank is a tough player, dragging Roden in real generations. It's clear that Rod will not be able to beat Frank to beat him. We know that Frank needs 50,000 dollars. A heart transplant and Rod decides to raise money to "cure himself" after healing and he has proven a man. A long fall down at the bottom of the mountain convinces Rod himself in a single mistake. Rod intends to get seed money, recharging stunts that could actually cause him to see it in real life. As a human lantern in a children's birthday party. They were amazed at the show to showcase people. When hope and money are lost, it comes with a sponsor that sponsors 15 buses a day. Rod wants to jump. It issues exclusive rights of emission and sets free phone lines for donations. She wears a new V-neck and a real motorcycle. The whole town becomes and the world adjusts. Does it jump? Does the girl get it? Do you raise 50 thousand dollars? Frank has won his donkey by Rod? Wait for this 90-minute movie to find out the video.
