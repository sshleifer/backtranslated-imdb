One of the many wedding movies you will see. It is immersed in a great space of time without updating it before arriving at theaters. Ethnic stereotypes are like a joke by Henny Youngman, except here they are just a little fun. Molly Ringwald, well what else to say. Take away a clue of lies, it destroys $ 10,000 in a wedding dress, "I'm just going to do it" in that rag, straps and a hat, and everyone smiles like moxy, shaking your neck. In her cast, look how heavy Ally Sheedy is. Wheeeew!
