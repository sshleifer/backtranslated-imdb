Well, so ppl thought that the movie was good in 1955. <br /> <br /> I'm pitying the fool who still thinks ... Its absolute rubbish. <br /> <br /> It's just a story. ridiculous The characters are caricature absurd - but this film does not satirizze, is it sure it wants to be a serious drama? <br /> <br /> Dean and others are too old for their parts. People say that Dean is excellent in this movie, and well, maybe he could play his part, possibly, as he might. Its character must be 16 or 17 years old. But Dean was a 24-year-old man when he made this film. When he saw him, he detected and killed 4-year-old boys ... his pathetic. <br /> <br /> Natalie Wood is beautiful, but the initial scenes of the tears and weeping commissars are very convincing. It gives you a great background for the movie ... and you feel that everyone else comes to one of those emotional scenes that is badly interpreted. <br /> <br /> It may have been good for him. It's time, but really, its drivel. <br /> <br /> It's just a rumor about Dean's death, which has ruined the popularity of this film.
