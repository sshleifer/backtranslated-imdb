It's true a bad movie ever made. I feel like a fan of filmmaking in the area, and I usually admit that I have a bad performance, "loose fuss" and "secondary effects" on the side of the movie, since AS LONG offers a good atmosphere / story / suspension or offer. That is, basically, it does not have a positive side and the third or fourth rate is perhaps worse. We made some friends and myself a small film for a week off and we did a better job (no zombie films). <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny, without saying anything. Special effects are very bad and redundant, normal people seem like zombies (except a white complementary face suppressed), a fake blood (I like realism, the combination of realism and zombie cinema is undeniable, but it's just a foolish gore presented). The camera has a long time with food scenes, it gets boring and you can not wonder, why use zombies (!) To kill their prey. I will not go into the duplication details (others have done so). Although I was from Germany, I find it a bit strange about the original version, with this movie I will not lose much time. <br /> <br /> Keep it aside as possible.
