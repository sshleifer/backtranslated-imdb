Enforceable and inevitable fall. Diabolic script and conversation and it's really shameless. The movie I've really seen is worse (in film). In my opinion, this movie is not a total disaster. I saw it when I got out of Brighton's cinema. People were walking around and people were getting more out of public toilet. In the end, the boos and contempt were excluded because the crowds of one of the main actors were very sad and they seemed really shameless. However, it was a bad movie, I was not really sensitive to them. Everyone has to start everywhere and their son has started his theater career with a great "Tartanism in the UK" session. It's been 5 years, but sometimes I still feel bad in this sad night of these films! This is a free feature film! I gave him 0 was not available. The movie would have to invent a "shameometer" for anyone involved in this evil. I know some of them are better, so that none of them is smaller.
