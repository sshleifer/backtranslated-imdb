The book that is based on this film has changed throughout life. But this movie means saying disappointment. The play, direction, cinematography and story were awful. I would never recommend this film to anyone. I've been telling people about the book, but now I'm going to tell you that everyone does not have to watch the movie! I did not anticipate that he had to continue on the book's plot, but they left too many of the essential components of the book. The film tried, but failed, offered a powerful and inspiring message and only forbid the main subject of prophecy. While I was not in the position of reading the book, Celestine Prophecy B.S. I saw it as a false bundle. Redfield is totally disappointed to find out how this movie has happened.
