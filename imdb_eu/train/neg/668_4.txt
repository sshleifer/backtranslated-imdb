So, Prom Night was a horror and thriller movie. I'm a big Wuss and at first I was afraid to see this movie, but seeing it, I'm afraid it's not a thrill. <br /> <br /> Basically, I was sitting down in my film, the movie was so predictable. Next you have the opportunity to predict what would happen. Young actors played well for their characters, but I should say that the killer was definitely at the top of the game - to blame. <br /> <br /> Yes, I'll give the offer to the plot, it was good, but it's not exciting or scary. Nearly the "zero" "scene" scene almost existed. So do not miss ten dollars at theaters, wait until the DVD.
