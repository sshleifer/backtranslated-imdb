This movie started well, I felt watching Seinfeld's adult version. Soon I began to question the circumstances and actions of the protagonist, and they did not find why they did it. The performance was excellent, but the short moments that were just a few scenes were really fun. Dan Cortese was amazing. I loved this role. His agent should feature a cast to the casting agents. Check out the first scenes, then find something better, or else you will get lost in this mess. I found a video store in a bucket. It cost me two dollars and I think it's a good price due to the sensitivity of this movie.
