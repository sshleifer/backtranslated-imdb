I want to make the name "Holmes with Doors", but I can not connect them together. ZABALA and the edited WONDERLAND give it a role that Morrison simultaneously jumbles, but this movie about 14-inch celebrities! Crimes from Australian crime all the time reflect, and instead violent graphic violence ... As one of the once famous US standards in the film industry has said: "A kiss is a kiss and an X is the neck and its action is PG 13". WONDERLAND is 14 minutes too long, and in the end we were delighted with the spiral tawdry to get away from the movies. How many films will we give to WONDERLAND? It must be six decades in the last decade. The puzzled violence and the ignored color set a false tone, but the shift camera becomes tired, always seeing nose holes. TAKING THE DOORS and TAXI DRIVER components becomes unforgettable the next day.
