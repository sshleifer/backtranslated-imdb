This movie was horrible. The script is completely realistic, but it is written in the real world, editing and lighting effects are worse than the majority of the first projects in film school. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film: A) knows about the police or hidden operations. B) knows about film or estimation. <br /> <br /> I recommend that this movie be below the average and the average. I think it would be nice if I were pale. If you take this into account, I recommend that you have an abortion <br /> <br /> It is a completely broken productive value.
