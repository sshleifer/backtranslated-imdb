In many films I have seen in Warren Oates, I have reached a specific conclusion; this is an individual talent. I saw Mr. Oates in the 1960s in the Stoney Burke series. From here, I tracked his career, and I felt that he was focused on important roles. When it happened in 1974, when Sam Peckinpah gave him early screenings, he directed a movie called "Alfredo Garcia's Head". Of course, the biggest claim of his reputation was his horrible role in 'The Wild Bunch'. I always thought that a character was able to bring a certain magic, that is, until I saw this flop. The film is called "Chandler", a tribute to the 1950's Iron Fist created by Raymond Chandler. In fact, the synopsis said that the eye was a particularly hard, and I was immediately interested. However, I sat down completely in the whole movie, and found the saga dull, uninteresting, slow, crunchy and confusing, if it were a matter or plot, in a dark back room. Collectively and with some of Hollywood's greatest media, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo, and Scatman Crothers, the film has enough force to reach Mach Mach. no As a result, my favorite actor has gone into a bad vehicle that does not stop on the ground. **
