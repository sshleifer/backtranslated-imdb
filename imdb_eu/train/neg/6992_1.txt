Soil is about an Anna named nurse. It is caught in the midst of a chaos around the world, which begins to eat meat as a zombie and overcome the world and attack lives. It escapes to the streets and saves a black cop. So far, so good! I usually enjoy horror films, but this film is not called horror. It's not exciting, just ridiculous. Although "Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" will give you more excitement. It's like watching buyers who do not want to go shopping in a non-commercial shopping center. Heroes that do shopping, to avoid outdoor eating outdoors, are no better. Although they do not drink, they give an impression of mental disabilities. Save your money instead!
