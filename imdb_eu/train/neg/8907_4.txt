I rented yesterday this DVD and I did not realize that "the study of the characters" was a kind of movie. That's why I stopped to watch about an hour. Stop button before pressing. <br /> <br /> Even with the subject of a character study, I could not get into the film. Maybe I wanted to see something else or perhaps I had other expectations, but aside from my efforts to finish the observation, I gave it up. The actors played well, but the overall combination was not my interest. The sergeant's gun was stolen about an interesting thing, and he bought another one soon, and painted the black man to appear as a police officer. I think this movie "Who Stole the Sergeant's Gun?" He had the title. The scenes were made well, but I felt it put together once more to steal everything that was stricken to me. <br /> <br /> If I do not see it, I would like to say that it is worth the rent of this movie. maybe ... For me, he lost sight of effort and good times. I will leave the test I want, but I do not recommend it strongly.
