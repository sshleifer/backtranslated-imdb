In my time I have seen a lot of horror films, which are completely absurd, but no one pulls the trash in its depths. This movie made me terribly and poorly worse, as I saw, I tried to find out what was happening around that movie. After seeing it, I understand ... what happened and why, but the movie itself is also very confusing to be enjoyable when you are watching. Yes, there are ordinary scenes of generous violence that show their disturbing agitation of people ("Roads for me ... ME!") And enough nudity "enough to get out of the plot." "But you're still leaving this movie and taking advantage of it, you feel like a puppy you do not want, and you're left in a box next to the road. Blech.
