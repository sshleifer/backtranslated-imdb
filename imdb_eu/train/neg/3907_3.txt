I'm glad I rented this movie for one reason: its shortcomings read Allende's book and I wanted to get the whole story. <br /> <br /> Pros: The movie is beautiful, the time is well-defined (at my best in my knowledge), and Meryl and Glenn do some good work. <br /> <br /> Cons: this is the worst thing I've ever seen with Jeremy Irons - I asked him something wrong in his mouth. (And I hate English in "Transito"). Winona Ryder is nothing incredible, unless it's the look of young and idealist. Most other shows are fine, but there are so few things in the arche of the characters and in the development of the relationship, I was frustrated and annoyed at the end. <br /> <br /> I'm really curious about whether this movie is the feature of Bille August's work. Maybe I should drop a couple of dollars to keep Smill's snow.
