When I was a kid, I remember this when I visited a friend of a "uncle". We're back! The story of a dinosaur is a stupid drawing about a dinosaur called Rex (which is what John Goodman says). The dinosaur tells the little boy dinosaurs to return to earth. He explains to us that he had returned with some friends. I think that this director of the film is responsible for what could be bad, but I do not care. The kids would like this, but it's a personal song. John Goodman was probably the only thing. Poor!
