I will accept it. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman in the planet, and has been a great accomplishment to see all of her films (unfortunately the great Batman and Robin movie, The Avengers) and to see this. And that. <br /> <br /> The movie I've ever seen should be the worst. (It's even smaller than the Avengers). Everyone has lost their looks and is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> As I think is Uma goddess, though, please do not swear to this movie. The next day you hate to do this.
