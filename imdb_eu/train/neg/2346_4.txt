I watched this movie for the first time in TCM's "Essentials" series. The eye of the viewer's eye was never proposed. This viewer is not in this modest value. I was surprised by the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. When Bacall was given, she was a beautiful woman, but in this film her character is drawn more than attractive. In my opinion, men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley could not have realized that Lucy's immediate fascination has fallen. In defense of Bacall, the film was made during the last illness of Humphrey Bogart and could be affected by the deterioration of the deteriorated health. Certainly, Lucy had to contrast a part of this rumor with Marylee Slutty, as Dorothy Malone killed and beyond. A scene that frightens a dreadful dancing father, while the heart attack is rising to the stairs of solution, the best movie scene moves away. Malonor's performance emphasizes the rest, although Robert Keith's tedious impact on Jasper Hadley's weary behavior of his two children. In general, however, I should say that I am not a fan of melodrama. The cartoon character behavior is a story that is not very pleasing.
