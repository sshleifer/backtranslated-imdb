Jean Seberg had no active talents. Like all his films, "Bonjour tristesse" does not suffer from his appearance (although perhaps the first of these modern women, Tom Wolfe, describes the "boys with breasts": publicists, of course, use the word "gamine"), but seriously The dull, monotonous and deadly voice of Seberger is suffering. In every film he had to be angry, Seber played, listening and paying attention, when he was bored with his dumb monotonous words. Oy. <br /> <br /> Preminger is just for emphasizing the adaptation of fantasy theater to young adults by Françoise Sagan, in the case of his film industry, but this is difficult for funk in the Photogenic Riviera of France, and perhaps his apt, but definitely. It's not an innovative and black and black job today's scenes, which sends us to the past of the bright colors of Seberg's narrative. <br /> <br /> Juliette Gréco has a short moment, like a nightclub singing. black and white focus, with a dull voice of Dietrichhesque, giving the existentialist lyrics of the title song. At this time, back in time, this moment is more than a drôle. Of course, if you are French, especially if you are a French solution to the glorious days of the Sorbonne roundabouts, and your children maintain sinecures throughout the entire French life. economy: then you still believe in Sartre and Foucault, and as such, theoretic and unimportant. <br /> <br /> David Niven has the most difficult task to play an old hedonist who is still not a lifestyle. Sagan's hip ideas, cool, swingin ', "mon copain!" Papa Deborah Ker offers her usual professional presence, probably playing a woman who is suffering from jealousy, a serious adolescent in Sebergen, who can be the only Queen Bee in the fantasy fantasy teenager of the classic goddess Sagan. Indeed, Kerr's movie is a great and memorable moment. <br /> <br /> It's a natural conversation - I mentioned earlier that it was said in French "bad translated". Combine the unknown scripting Seberg's monotonous dull and boring, and you can save this Valium for another night. At that time, the duplication of post-production voice is almost completely clear and, therefore, much worse: this is, in particular, the duplication of Mylène Demongeot, because of a very slow shopping experience. <br /> <br /> Hunky Geoffrey Horne's short head sticks here; a young man with a very good look, when he underwent a creative voice that was not beautiful or not. (We could say, Horne, "Bridge on the River Kwai", perhaps because his ending was the excellent professional film series William Holden and Jack Hawkins, because he did not accept Seberg, unfortunately). > <br /> "Bonjour tristesse" looks beautiful, but it is a shallow and immature soap: a thin pepper.
