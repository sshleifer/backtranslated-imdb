$ 9.99 dollars budget quote. A very useful set of miniature visuals, a story about foreigners who use flesh and banana from a meat store. The movie has a bit of blood (it's not quite disturbed) and a character replaces one of his hands with an egg. (Yes, you read it correctly.) <br /> <br /> A "rescue" was the "talent show" (how is it for irony?) A song made up of a punk / new wave band. "Looking for heat". In addition, this is not worth your time or "bad" level. Look at the movie you're very happy, but everyone else should be clear. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 to 10
