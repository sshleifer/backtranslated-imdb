An immoral and disgusting landing is definitely a clone on Friday (13th, 1980). The poster of this movie seems to be a cross between Jason and Freddy, which probably attracts movie enthusiasts. No movie about this movie is good or entertaining. I feel sad only, thinking people will meet in Sleepaway Camp II: unfortunate videos or unfortunate camps in the DVD (1988), and they will miss out on this sad, cynical and depressing film. <br /> <br /> Angela Baker (Pamela Springsteen) is a Foreign Minister of Camp Rolling Hills. The other camps hope that they will be as pleased as they expect, and they remain unhindered. On the other hand, the other camps find out that people are disappearing one by one, and should have sent Angela to the house with an excuse. Angela was a murderer, who was once a man, who had been an operation of sexual intercourse a year earlier? Who knows? Who cares? <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, there were many crosses between the genres of Mad Slasher and the Adventures of Dead, where the dumb murderer worsens. Some have a plot, some do not, but they are just as bad. Sleepaway Camp II: unfortunate camps are included by 80-year-old youth, and then piled up, frozen, hacked, split, alive and boy. That's all this movie. Violence is just shameless and bloody. <br /> <br /> When they saw this movie, they reminded me on Friday, the 13th, movies, where the audience was the first message of teenager's message to death. . Sleepaway Camp II filmmakers have the right to be appalled. Imagine the poor message that this movie offers to adolescent audiences: "The world is a very bad place," says this film, and will kill you. No matter your dreams or expectations. It does not matter if you have a new boyfriend or a new girlfriend. It does not matter what you think, what you do or what your future plans are. You can forget about these plans, because you just went to a dead end. "<br /> <br /> It's just the worst thing, and if you do not give too much, it just creates a room for a sequel to the movie. Well, why not? Probably and they've already been taken to the trash for three or four of these films already on board.Sleepaway Camp ( 1983) I missed and after seeing its second track, I hope I will not be able to follow any other tracking, even with the original. And for parents, if you know children who really like the movie, do not let the kids send.
