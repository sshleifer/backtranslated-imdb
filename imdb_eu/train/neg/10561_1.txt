When I saw this movie in its time, when a baby was not married, you would only have to ruin your life, but marked your children as punished. These days, "single mothers" seem to be very rare, but it was very true. And I'm not mad at someone who makes a murmur laughing. Between these two problems it was difficult to find this movie. At that time I did not know who led or whose fabulous reputation. I know who was Betty Hutton, and she felt nervous because it was so frantic. I loved the "Bringing Up Baby", but this movie seems embarrassing to me. I am sure that some drillings of church functions were certain, but I needed a drink after drinking it again. The idea of ​​getting pregnant and getting pregnant was added to the misfortune. An entire town could turn you on, so the result of this movie is really fun. Of course, shoot me, I do not like "Wonderful Life."
