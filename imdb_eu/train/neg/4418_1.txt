This is a digestive film. On the one hand, we offer a sturdy outer shell, a story that does not only emerge from the Catholic Church, but it does not make you foolish and does not know it. In the inner layer, more than orthodoxy is offered a story of orthodoxy, and when people do something they do not understand, they do not understand faith. <br /> <br /> At first glance, this was supposed to be a comedy. If so, Mr. Durang must open a dictionary clearly, because he does not know the meaning of the word. The jokes are pale; humor is difficult and badly delivered. In particular, Mrs. Keaton looks great and is below the quality of Annie Hall and Sleeper days. Jennifer Tilly is a stark model again with her sweet voice and strange style. All of this would be forgiven except for the last 20 minutes of this film, of course, it was a play in controversy in 1981. <br /> <br /> Before being careful, disasters *** <br /> </ p> <br /> When four former students of the Ignatius Ignatius of Ignatius appeared (Inazio, male, male, and a nun should not be he will consent to this event, just to show how boring the initial project is the research.) When his dad confesses that they do not fit in with their teachings, their sisters become irrational and abuse them in this way. He has believed himself to return to the flashbacks of shiny sepia shades. When one of them admits having two abortions, the monk makes it worse, until a student gets out of the gun. After fighting on his side, the nun dies at his own, presumably self-defense. He then screams, because he has killed his usual accident. The last image is a female student lying in a pose like Christ, hanging the shadow of the cross. Do you say "heavy"? I know you can not! <br /> <br /> I know that in the past there have been abusive worms, and I know that many people are affected by emotions, but almost all of these images are thrown on a train disaster in almost every sword. I've heard about the writer and the director, this is a movie about hysteria and why would not orthodoxy be followed by religion, it's not a coincidence. This explanation is hard to swallow, but we simply do not give an unauthorized viewpoint, because it is not a way to counteract Catholic faith. This movie is a triumph of the Catholic soul, in the name of fairness and equality, sour and hateful. <br /> <br /> This is a movie I recommended to a Catholic to wake him up. These are the realities of today's cynicism and ignorance. If "Rabbi Ray explains all" or "Explain all" Imam Muhammad, it would be in distress in the streets and would lose all Showtime subscription. But, unfortunately, this is because it is a film that is perceived by the majority, it admits and even applauds the people who share the same overwhelming vision. <br /> <br /> I definitely hope that he has been a Catholic who has been a member of this member, so he has only brought in ignorance that he does not know about making this movie. <br /> <br /> I give 5 stars of 5 stars, but not because of its abusive nature, but it was poorly written, misguided and, in general, a bad movie. Do not waste time too.
