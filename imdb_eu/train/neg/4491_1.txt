1/10 and that's because I'm not getting my ratings anymore. <br /> <br /> Just skip this "movie" and wait, buy or rent the latest movie "Trilogy". Trust me, you do not miss a thing. The architect does not bring new information: _ (spoiler) _ NEO have been more in front of him, like nr.6 or something. The first movie could detect something like this: Agent Smith's first created matrix did not work because it was perfect. Trinity died and brought Neo "love" back, where did I see it before? Now in the first movie, reverse roles! just like scene of action than opponents. We did not see the BIG group (perhaps Revolutions?) That we did not see in the action scene (20+ ships), someone complained (hmmm, maybe it was Neo's desire to screw up the knife)! The EGM button soon. <br /> <br /> Everything to earn money (especially boys who went to see more than once), shameless charm, very shameless.
