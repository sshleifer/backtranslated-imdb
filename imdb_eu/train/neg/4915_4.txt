One of the previous reviews wrote that there was no basis in the reviews of Love Story; He loved or hated one. But it seems that the distribution of opinions is clear from 1 to 10. For me, this movie is 4. There are scenes and beautiful locations, and Ray Milland makes Oliver's father a wonderful job. But the movie did not have a passionate piece of work to tell his story, and the story was not so special to guarantee multiple views, at least not for me. It may be a bit of snob, but I avoid the movies with Ryan O'Neal. I have not seen Barry Lyndon, most of them, but not all, because they ruined their presence. The only exception What's Up, Doc? Da In it, his direct performance is highlighted by the protagonist of Barbra Streisanden's goofball - and, casually, he has shot Love Story in good measure! McGraw and O'Neal move their lines rather than playing them. <br /> <br /> This film highlights the beginning of a great career: Tommy Lee Jones was the first movie.
