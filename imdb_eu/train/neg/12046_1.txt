I have had great expectations for Troy, and I am very sorry. The movie was so wrong, it caused my abdominal pain. Pacing was very slow, with the speed of dialogue and the movie - as opposed to the beautiful fight scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana). The rest were superficial. <br /> <br /> And why, why Hollywood always demands stories to adapt to "consumer acceptance". Agamemnon was not killed in Troy after a war that lasted 10 years, and Akiles died in Paris outside a Trojan wall. I'm surprised that such a classic story has become a soap. <br /> <br /> And do not start talking about the "lack" of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was a woman who fought a war and did not look much about her. It is not a spark, an emotion, no hope. <br /> <br /> In the movies of Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O 'Toole, I wrote very well with the bad script, but it is not enough to save this terrifying film. <br /> <br /> Is there anyone telling me about a 200 million euro quote? It is possible that all the trees used in funerals - where did these trees get? <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed.
