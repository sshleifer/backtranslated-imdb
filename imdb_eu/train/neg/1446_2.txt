The movie is a long story of the classical novel that completely breaks the original adventure spirit. Patrick Swayze, a terribly horrible American, is Allan Quatermain, a British hero, despite revealing nationality. <br /> <br /> The film continues with the story "Hollywood-ise" in the plot and changing characters. It adapts more appropriately to the approved model. The movie is predictable, even for those who do not know the story, and the bad performance and the fighting sequences are so distressed. <br /> <br /> However, it's already a great addition to the King Allian Quatermain's legendary King Solomon's Mines.
