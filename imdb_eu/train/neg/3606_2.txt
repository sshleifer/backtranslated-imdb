This movie is the worst movie, but for me it's the highest. Slasher must be a movie. It seems that there is only a handful of students in a university. Teachers are more demanding than smaller hammers. It is filled with a good Catholic priest, sexually repressed. Bad hair, bad clothes. The interview is so clear, it's hard to believe that I was able to predict budget lines. Mixers have little or no creativity and they seem to be genitals. Because the soundtrack and the dying characters are not so bad that they are so bad, I recommend this movie in a fun time. Get some cheap beer and some friends, watch and laughter.
