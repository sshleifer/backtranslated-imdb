Girl, a flick-type guy who is looking for a boy, a boyfriend next to the girl, helps support her best friend to help her help her (comedian relief, not?) To help her deceive the girl, and so on. It's done for death. and except with a few approximate departures, it has been better done. <br /> <br /> Aside from a landless plot, the leads are attractive and there are good times. Jonathon Schaech has done better, and his behavior has been called upon. It's not a complete loss, but there's nothing new here at this girlfriend.
