It is important to insult from the logic or the sense of insanity and those who are "gray subjects" agree that this film does not work. <br /> <br /> They corrected the problems, they were thrown out. Selection and lack of depth in the character's construction. The word of comedy is very hard when I hope to laugh when the word laughs. Check the directions / script problems. <br /> <br /> The brothers and sisters seem to be well-adjusted in the mid-30s. In a park they will find the whole unknown and Heather Graham approaches the character and makes intimate interrogations, even if half a sane person would otherwise run the police or at least scream them. He then shakes and does bad conditions and will fall for him. Then, after one ONE date, they all went in love with him and decided to marry Vegas a week ago ???? Hello, does anyone look stupid? Thousands of women go out and find out about 10 words that we will see on the screen and wants to get married. There was no chemistry that was not sensible. Surely I want to believe that it is a romantic comedy, but the direction was completely flat. <br /> <br /> Now, Heather falls with her head and Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (very little). For kisses or more, the sloppiest kiss could ever be that chemistry. Suddenly and uncomfortable, and many say that Heather can not answer, I think that reality was a bad character in Heather. <br /> <br /> This was the debut of the director Sue Kramer and she masks me too much. This work and the best IMHO writers would require a lot of craftsmanship, casting and management.
