Everyone involved is a kind of film that is ashamed. Poor management, a plot that goes beyond high-level theater and violence. I thought for the first time I saw that maybe it would be a satire of the media and how to strengthen violence, but not. I do not know what the movie makes worse. Oliver never does his worst direction. Woody Harrelson's faces were unreasonable, or Robert Downey Jr was a huge challenge for Wayne Gale, since he is a reporter of a pretty bonkers, the movie is wrong.
