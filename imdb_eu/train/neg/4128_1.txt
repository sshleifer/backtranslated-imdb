This movie is one of those I've ever seen. The conversation is awful, it never ends. You think it's over, but it's not. How long does it take, 140, 160 minutes? I do not even know. I know I did not see it again. Like a romantic comedy, he decided to take down the comedy and then minimize his love, leaving the snippet he managed to reach the screen. But do not take my word, know yourself what this film is horrible.
