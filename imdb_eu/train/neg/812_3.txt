I am very disappointed with "K-911". The original "good quality" of "K-9" no longer exists. This is like a sitcom! Some of the drawings of the original film were thrown back and my memory dropped back. Captain Dooley now wants to be like a scene similar to the old comedy show. It was a crazy person. What is the change in the police? It seems now they are LAPD! Not San Diego PD It's a completely different movie "
