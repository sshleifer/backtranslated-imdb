A bad woeful Christmas movie, Vince Vaughn alone offers her usual little girl, but this time she has a movie for children, but her charm and charm with R. Vaughn seems to be in an autopilot driver, although most of the films and when he loses his performance he continues to enter the walls. After 30 minutes in the movie, you will get in touch with your inner evil and you would say "Bahumbag" to make this movie look great and after another 30 minutes, you want to see what you can do in that movie. From all the actors involved in this mess, only Paul Giamatti and Rachel Weisz bring a little bit of life on this paper with thin paper, which is a humanity, because they are very good actors in these films. Paul Giamatti brings in depth and warmth to the character of Saint Nick himself, but Vaughn's youthful behavior forced him into a fight between relatives. As you can see on Giamatti's face, it's not fun for his role, and he shows it in some parts of the movie. Rachel Weisz gives her a great deal of fun and spirit, but she does not really work for a great character, and you'll see on her face what she knows well, because there are so many indications. movie Fortunately for him, he is not able to save the whole movie and face, like Giamatti, who looks like that agent looks like the movie is over. Direction also feels boring, because there is no feeling or flow, this seems to be a holiday film, but at the same time it seems that you are looking at the widening screen that is going down. > <br /> I do not know what happened here, but with only two actors involved (Giamatti and Weisz), they try to get at least something at the table with the script to write. The feeling that is about this theme (and everything is Christmas movie) and the actress who is not responsible for her performance (Vaughn), is a very painful film to watch.
