Ok, where do we start with this weird little gem? Extreme slugs begin in New England (?). The only man can stop ... and that man ... he's Mike Brady! Now, if that was not enough, be aware. <br /> <br /> Sludge footage is called stock footage. It does not matter who is attacked or where they are attacking, they are the same as the witnesses everywhere. Please note that this special film occupies at least half the movie. <br /> <br /> Hit the movie, drag, steal the wallet, kill your girlfriend, kill your dog, BAD. I'm sure it's a bit worse, but it's hard to find that. It was only a gem ... you guessed it ... MIKE BRADY! He had to take classes in the YMCA in the night, it was the best. <br /> <br /> In a horror mode? This movie should not be taken seriously. No fear! The clumses are weeping crying. The entire upward action can be avoided with one or two sawmills. See this film in an MST3K environment, otherwise it may be damaged by the brain.
