It's a 1974 German movie, related to some women who come to a castle and beyond women, I can not really tell you what the movie is about. I will tell you, it seems that many women who publish castles as wizards, paint and paint their body and blemish gyrates, when it was Goth Kit-Kat Klub, which seems to be a good part. Duration of this film. Yes, it seems that there is something about the devil and the vampire, and a girl with boys, etc. It seems, but it seems that babysitters are painted children who are basically in the basement. I preferred to remind one of the main housewife / devil's worshiper, to give her the authenticity of the procedure and make her look even worse. Was Wanda a bad lesbian (as it was billed in credit)? It does not matter. If you are not thinking about your lesbian demons, worship the movies, maybe you would like this; Otherwise, they are strange things and I could not finish it, I was so bored. 10 to 3.
