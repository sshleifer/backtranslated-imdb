The Bangville Police made a debut at Keystone Kops, according to the study he worked on. In this, however, they do not wear their bags in their stupid clothes and drive their pace with a commercial brand. However, she is a girl from Mabel Normand, who asks her a calf for her father. Later, he saw a strange man in the barn and quickly called the police. One answer and persecution is activated. Then Mabel knocked at the door as someone is entering. It turns out when the robbers arrive at this mother! So, while Mabel locks the door, her mother and father try to fight on their way! It may be part of the short film more fun with some police car explosions. It's been 7 minutes short before it's done so quickly. The only true character that has been developed is Mabel, who tries to make the face and eyes big, and it seems so optimistic and cheerful, of course, when it is scared. It's easy to know why he became a star. Above all, for this reason, I would recommend that you check at least once and why I give it 4.
