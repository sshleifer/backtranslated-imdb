My comment is the Russian version called Space Race called Bitva za Kosmos (Battle for Space), which was shown on the First Russian Channel from April 10 to 13, 2006. The bad translation prevented some details but I have doubts. The number of true defects is impossible to list, especially in the first section (first missile development). The movie also has a number of faults and gaps in the US half. US V-2 / A-4 presentations are not visible. Jupiter C will launch three different rocket series in the 'EU'. Apollo 1 will be thrown to the moon, etc. Half of Russia, every person is playful. Korolev is afraid of the NKVD, Gloss's sabotage and treacherous, Mishin alcohol, and so on; He has no motivation or alive. Uniforms and decorations are awesome. Gagarin sings a frivolous song (which I think is especially true for Russian version).
