What Is Jamie Foxx fun? Do you really think it's fun? Well, it's fun to watch his fun. Man has no personality ... you can immediately see what his idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he tries to imitate them in most of his films. The only problem is that it is bad, it's different, and the ones that leave are part of what Denzel looks like. attitude, and suddenly it's Martin Lawrence, funny and clumsy comic. There is no such personal touch, I mean I do not know the identity it wants to sell, and I'm sure it does not say personally. It's really Mr. Dull-boy person. <br /> <br /> I really waited for Hollywood, and the American black community would make someone better to enter stellar stars, such as Don Cheadle, but perhaps the pathetic Jamie remixes of the old remixes.
