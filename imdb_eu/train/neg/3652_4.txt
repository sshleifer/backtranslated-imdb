I watched this movie in DVD format. My copy may be damaged but I lacked the DVD DVD screen. I would say that Claire Forlani was the first reason to see this movie. While watching it fun, I feel that I have not found the hopes of other films so far. Actually, I was glad to turn around Arkin. I did not know other two actors, so I can not compare their performance. However, it was quite enjoyable. Playing is, in my opinion, the most pleasant quality of this movie. The story line, while some might say it was more believable, lacked leadership. The main problem is the direction of the script and not the direction of the movie. If you enjoy any of these actors, partly, I recommend this movie, but I will leave it otherwise.
