First of all, let's say we have to be in the boring film list. Nothing, and I want to say nothing about this movie as a distant exciting. Mostly it is very confusing and you would end up moving forward! Many people want to "think" the movie, through all the things that I say ... "More in power"! On the other hand, I want to be entertained. That brings me back to me, this entertainment is not. Stupid movies and loss of time. Mostly, they agree. This one did not make any sense, and when you think of a scene, another scene would come along and ... you think well where that happens. Avoid, this sucks ... bad !!
