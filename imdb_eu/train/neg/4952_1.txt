Okay, I've always been a fan of Batman. I loved the animated series, and even Batman Beyond. I read a Batman comic book now and then. Therefore, as I can imagine, I had a little excitement when I heard about that series, and then I was disappointed. This series is nothing. It does not even start comparing with the original series. TOY is like a long trade. No depth. And what happened to Joker? Who, in my low opinion, is the best of time, and TAKE PART. My design was the worst part. Actually, I would say that it was something about this series remotely creative or interesting. In short (I believe, I can say a lot more) DO NOT waste your time on this show or your money.
