First of all, I would like to say that if I shoot the movie honestly from 1 to 10, then I'd give it 4. It's not a tough critic, the movie is bad. Everything about history, direction and editing is horrible. The story is not good at the beginning (it is not expected that much is based on a video game, but something that was not included in the movie), but management and editing have been even worse. The film is cut into difficult points and goes to the scenes that are unrelated to previous ones; Some, like the fast scene in the middle of the scene, do not make sense in the story that the characters do not show their feelings to each other. It was hoped to see a stack of stacks of one and a half stacks on this screen and you would still be disappointed. True, if you pay for watching the movie, you're wasting money and you do not pay, you've lost your life for an hour and a half. So, make the opposite go away and do not see it.
