Do not get wrong Write - I love it as David Suchet Poirot. I love series and movies, but it's enough again: Death On The Nile. Everyone has done this! We know who dies. We know why they die. We know who is the murderer. We know how it was done. So I say enough! Mr. Suchet could use a wonderful tale in one of Agatha Christie's novels. I'm going to say that all the actors are excellent. They were brilliant and realistic. He really liked David Soul, but I was surprised how he looked "horrible." I hope that it does not look like this in true life! I can not honestly rememebrate other films if the end is the same. Somehow I do not think so. I thought that it was so bright that Mrs. Christie wrote or not. I would rather end up losing the prison!
