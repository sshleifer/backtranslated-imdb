About 15 minutes, he had to leave his wife. Not so much material, but lack of it. Fun things had to be filled with voices that could be quite common in language and conversations. When this was left (very strange), we would sit and watch (do not laugh, it matters) and wait for the next gross or offensive note. After 35 minutes, both got up and left. Everything we read was great. The trailer looked good and Roger Ebert called it a "smart" and was not said to be a raw sexual comedy. Did the movie go on? Along with Be Cool, I'm the only other movie I have ever watched ... and I do not regret it. I try to watch American comedies.
