I enjoyed it completely to see this movie. They were waiting for a year in New Zealand. I would not have to build so much, because they were so depressing, and definitely Clark's worst film is not so much wrong with this film. First of all, some of the performances are excellent, especially Nick Stahl 'Bully, and a curly little girl (I can not remember her name), but most of them were so touching and incredibly incredible. especially Leo Fitzpatrick. Clark's film is a veteran and has been brilliant at the hands of "Kids", but the letter "Bully" makes shows to make his theater a parody. The script was felt as if it had been written by a first-year film student. Do not Feel, a High School Student ... a movie that has never seen. And I did not realize Clark's intentions. Would you like to emphasize the nonsense of the existence of children? He surely did not stop him anymore. I was not able, but I did not see teenagers and buttocks every 5 minutes. Still, Clark's best movie is 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's fantastic and I do not think he'll ever find it.
