Well, I saw last night and I was not the only thing to be the only thing to do. There was no guess that this boy was Anti-Christ. However, the movie was badly written. For example, they never explained how the dentist's incident was made about the "accident" or, finally, the police could keep at home, even without calling the police. The scene of the death was very bad and they did not have any entertainment. The child who played Anti-Christ was boring and the baby was better. Simply do not miss the time to watch it.
