I was looking forward to this movie. It's a good family movie; However, if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team had a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. Many scenes out of context. I hope that it is another movie in the series, they are very good. But if I do another, I ask to take care of the drink better. This story was all over the place and there was no center. It's unfortunate because other series's films were superb. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; They are two great models. In addition, the romantic side of the audience enjoys a good story that always loves.
