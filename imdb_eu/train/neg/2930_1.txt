I like British humor, I think it's the best in the world. I like British sitcom almost everywhere (okay ... maybe not a Monthy Python, some jokes were very good, but I did not understand them.) But this league of these gentlemen is a good thing to be sick. This show was somehow good; It helped me a little bit because I was feeling that I was seeing this piece of garbage because I'm no longer. This is a really bad, sick, and even funny television show and I'm wondering who is really laughing. I saw about 10 minutes off and off. It was so annoying that the woman dressed as a woman with this tooth and urinated in the car ... I mean ... what's so funny? Like puke No humor, disturbing and cheap images, the toilet laughs ... I do not know ... if you like things ... you're on ... see ... but honestly, people see and enjoy. We have to have some emotional problems. Garbage.
