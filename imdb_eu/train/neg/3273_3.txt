Is the Duke of Hazzard a great achievement? A $ 53 million movie, worse than a section of a 25-year-old TV downmarket. The plot is worth enough, but it's a very rare fun, and the quiz is pretty serious: actors like Johnny Knoxville, M.C. Gainey's Sheriff Roscoe is soft, Michael Weston's reluctant Enos, apparently looking like Willie Nelson, who looks forward to clearing Burt Reynolds's check, is involved in a purgatory, where old movies play back her old movies. , it's a weird choice to say Boss Hogg, but it's a good time with a heckler and a hundred dollars bill. Do you know the movie is that Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screens? It's worse than a script or question, Jay Chandrasekar's promising director: apparently comic born without concept of season, he can not do much more than two basic shots and how to shoot car harassment. The stunts of the movie seem to have resolved before the film's life signals were made. There are a couple of postmoderns that revolve around the stereotyped role of Confederate Flag and Daisy, all in all sections, but Hal Bird's thoughts on things like Hal Needham's (and wrong) things would not be good.
