I love all the books of Tom Robbins, so I was very excited and I am interested in seeing a movie made after a book. I know the movie would capture half the magic of Robbins, but after watching the movie, I did not want to read the book again. Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does not fit into eighth content in the book, and it seems that Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy's love connect more than anything else. With the very weak lines of the movie line, I think the actors would play better on the characters. I thought the actors in the movie were adapted to the descriptions in Robbins' book, they were Julian's friends, at the beginning of the movie in five minutes. Those who do not read the book can enjoy the movie, but being a fan of Tom Robbins, the movie was just a desperate one.
