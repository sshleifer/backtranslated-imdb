Now I'm not wrong, I enjoy Christmas movies. I love the wonderful life and I'm delighted to have a Christmas song with george. scott and sim alistair But this specific movie is horrible. I think that I love songs of life, especially when it comes to the ghosts of Christmas gifts. albert finney Annie sings pretty well. I do not know what is going on in this movie, but it seems that someone is trying to sings through dead jails. The only thing he saved for this movie was to turn off the sound and dance numbers together with Christmas cd at the southern park.
