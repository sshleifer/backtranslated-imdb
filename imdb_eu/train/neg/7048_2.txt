I chose this movie with a bad move on the cover. He was not very funny and the main characters were evil. The girl was beautiful, but the story and the performance were awful. He had nothing to do with surfing. Awesome "horrible" horror movie that has no surf and has no real surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the movie's protagonist, probably Gordon Gekko and all others, will probably resurrect the movie, but if you do not see it, you will not lose time. GREAT surfing, REAL surfers and AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL cinematic film was a bad movie of GOD'S HANDS.
