This film is one of the best novels of all time, by George Elioten Silas Marner. <br /> <br /> The details of the movie that appears in the film are acknowledged by the original author, but I did it. Do not see at the beginning of the film, only saying a credit at the end "Proposing Silas Marner Books." Suggest? It was just the scare of all the key elements of the story: <br /> <br /> Old and sad, craftsmen, poor and lonely, stole everything. One night a child walks through his mother while his mother dies outside the snow. The husband and wife (or a wealthy politician here) who brought men home to him and a day is asking for the adoption of the child. That year is the birth of a baby in an illegal affair. The conflict will be understood as a legal guarding of the child. <br /> <br /> This is the story of this and every other part of the film. I can only find a difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy, but perhaps Martin Martin's ability to act was far away. On top of that, it dries the hair foods of carrots juice (it seems younger, but it also looks like clown). We also add foolish jokes, this comedian offbeat can not enter into the story and it takes away the depth of the story. As the baby is crying in court, it may be happy to be happy with the man who has created all of us this year. This applies to the deskongest nose in the film, which applies to tears in a nose on the nose! <br /> <br /> I allow the film industry's legality and integrity to make this film work. If it was directed by George Eliot, then I would pay. I was going to send Steve Martin profits to this real estate or to the poor. At least S Martin Marner is called. Or better yet removed from the archive! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this story - and I hope - dismiss this completely and see Silas Marner. Or read the book! BbC made an excellent adaptation in the 1980s.
