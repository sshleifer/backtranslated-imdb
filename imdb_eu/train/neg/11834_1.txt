Let's say in simple words, which can be understood by the makers of this film: this is a stupid movie, a sharp script, a hand-made animation and a writer. Do not Worry - Unless you have a way to find a way to find a retired mentally ill or a very slow child. They can laugh, especially if they're out of the doctor. In a ridiculous movie, there is a special kind of humiliation: filmmakers do not only think that their children are an out-of-the-box effort, but they are hardly foolish to break their sweat. Gag here and there an adult can find fun. Actually, this movie has been marked straight away. Do not panic so badly.
