I like to keep my opinions short and simple, but this is quite summarized. You can not win two original, some of which are directed by Chris Columbous's talent. <br /> <br /> This movie covered a dreadful performance with a bigger performance. I do not think these people are considered actors. <br /> <br /> Enjoyment and sit down. Storyline was a secret chip and a complete joke about Russian terrorists, back to back. Exciting, rent an original forklift and enjoy it! <br /> <br /> The movie was not even set as Christmas original. Home Alone became a joke or plain joke from a great Christmas comedy!
