As the number of malicious video cameras continues to decline, this little rubbish appeared on my "rented" list when I saw that it was available. <br /> <br /> The premise is a model of fashion or something kidnapped and carried away in the jungle to get rid of a fast-paced team. He hires another goof to take it back and earn money to use it as a trading chip, even if he returns to the girl and all the money, he gets a big reduction. He has brought a helicopter and a rider with him, and wow, the worst actor ever! When they're done, they're really terrifying and you're going to cry twice. After entering the jungle, there is a canopy cave in the vicinity, and accordingly the goddess who plays the land walks through the forest as King Kong wants human beings to swallow and devour wild animals. Now, this boy is a man with the naked bass, who has ping-pong balls in front of him, and that's enough. He plays the head and head of the musical band, and I change a lot of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Oh, have I forgotten it for almost constant? This is probably the main reason for this movie, although there is a certain scene, when a second lasts, the god attacks a girl and takes her away, but she is not a rich factor. In addition, Jess Franco surpasses the usual T and A and shows the long-term approaches to female genitalia and, unfortunately, is also male. So, if you want "fair" in terms of exploitation, you've got it. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend it to anyone. It's not a bad movie either. Simply, the only fan of malicious video games will be visible and then if you're on the list, leave this one. If you first see that this list is the norm, this is definitely not true.
