If you only look at the cover of this movie, it's really nice. NO. The film itself has fallen asleep. It was a slow pace, with little violence and suspicious use. The play was a groundbreaking food and, despite the fact that it was fascinating for the movie on the plot, it was not here. The only nice character in the whole movie is killed too! I give 10 out of 10, the only thing that was good was the plot. In addition, you want to save film from the trash.
