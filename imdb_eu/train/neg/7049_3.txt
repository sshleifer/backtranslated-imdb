Surfers with waves are worse than surfers without wave surfers. The surfing footage will be a huge despair for viewers who love surfing for three minutes. <br /> <br /> The story is not part of the life of the surfer's beaches. perfect wave, but for all waves. J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is a super-surfing surfer with his commitment to Chloe's girlfriend (Catherine Zeta Jones). As she likes to meet with the woman who is so fond of love, surfers of three old friends will be shown and she will convince her to go to the beach in search of the Bone Yard's wave monsters. The problem is that there is no wave at the end of the movie; so most stories are wasted on the consecutive succession of disconnected beach events. <br /> <br /> It's mostly a period. Sean Pertwee has little comedic moments but, above all, the actor was his world. Ewan McGregor was a respectable man of drug rescue, the most interesting and unique nature of the bunch. Probably Peter Gunn made Terry a more entertaining performance while constantly watching his corporeal body. Catherine Zeta-Jones was usually sexy, but her character really did not have enough meat to show much ability in acting. <br /> <br /> There is not really much comment here. I was worth 3/10. It's a real beach joke.
