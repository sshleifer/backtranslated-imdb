Recently, I have been filming this movie and "King Arthur", while others are choosing DVDs on "entertainment" for one afternoon, and they get together to get more and more ideas that grow, I have a modern cinema for the public. It lacks discrimination and the content gets "action". Both films were rough. <br /> <br /> What happened with the development of the character? What has happened with a meaningful conversation? What happened to JARDUNARI? And, seeing something historically "compulsory", there was an attempt to make some measurements of precision, a realistic idea of ​​the "political map" of that time, even though it was a slight taste of the time, especially social attitudes. Why should XXI show? A set of century-old America? I have read in the message boards of many expressions that it is "little-known" in the dark age. It's not like that. Large amounts are known, with the scholarship that was learned at the time, but these pigs can not do any homework. <br /> <br /> I can only cast 0/10 votes.
