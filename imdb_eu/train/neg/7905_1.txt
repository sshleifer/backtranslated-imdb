Munchies begins in the darkest part of Peru (seems to be a dirt road with me) Simon Watterman archaeologists (Harvey Korman) and Paul son (Charles Stratton) begin an expedition. Simon believes that the ancient Aztec buildings were really spaces for controlling the spacecraft and it is a mission to obtain evidence that the aliens have visited the Earth. Once, he finds a strange little creature that enters the wooden backpack and drives it home. Sweetwater, a small American town in California. Simon thinks that he seeks this creature and decides to leave reasonably incomprehensible as a reason to stop at home while sharing his discovery. Simon asked Paul and his wife Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde) to look after him. Meanwhile, Simon's brother and fast food businessman Cecil Watterman (Harvey Korman again) stole his brother's money, but his idiot stepon Dude (Jon Stafford) has a fight and split the knife together, but individual breakdowns between citizens they will turn into small creatures that cause much ... <br /> <br /> Bettina Hirsch has been one of the worst horror comedies ever had. the worst Lance Smith's script is very painful. Munchies's joke never fails with the proverbial mile, no doubt the humor of this piece of shit seemed to him as a child of the past. There's nothing remotely funny or even more fun in Munchy's, I'm not. The basic story is pure, they discover this creature without explanation, why they have never seen it, learns English so quickly and learns how to drive. The whole thing is Gremlins (1984), a great movie with elements that have not been so good. He is a slow character, stupid deputy Charlie and his father (Hardy Rawls), Cecilio wears bad luck and fake mustaches, and his wife's wife Melvis (Alix Elias) and more. They're just shameless and ridiculous, I challenge anyone to find that funny stink. Basically, Munchy fails to be comedic or afraid and at the end of it, you've just guessed it, crap. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hirsch, It is made in two houses, in the desert, some caves and a miniature pitch. This is actually a cheap and incompetent movie. The special effects of Munchies are horrible, if the only doll that does not move does not have someone who does not shoot the camera behind. I can not stress how bad the consequences are, that these things do not convince my four-year-old nephew (as yesterday and he proved himself!). Absolutely wrong, this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> Technically cinema is horrible, it's bad effects, generous production design, garbage sets and just everything. The play is wrong, police will arrive at Korman. Both roles demonstrate that he can not play and it's not fun. <br /> <br /> Munchies is a bad movie. If you're trying to get it, be sure to watch it, I do not stop you, but do not say it was not you! My advice would be to see Gremlins again, but the decision is yours!
