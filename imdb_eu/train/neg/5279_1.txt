My friends, usually, can expect many unpredictable movies, but this too was too much to be watched until we even saw them. It was so boring and strange. I still could not keep watching the "hot" girls who were the protagonists of this movie. Everything was predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> The play was good at times ... but bad times. The most annoying character of the movie you want to kill is to be the best friend, it should be the protagonist. The more I saw it I wanted to break my screen. (You know what kind of fat I am doing) <br /> <br /> So many times we've made land that other film companies should sue them. OK, it's a good idea, but it's been all this. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie can only be seen on your car to save your friends' abuse. Or if you do not have to do it.
