<br /> <br /> "Slugs" is a unique movie, because rare qualifications are the scary story of this terrifying nature. You know, through the pollution of evil men, the poor ends have mutated and do not want to do any wrong; They are slugs with sharp flesh and tooth, which they eat meat and poison, but they are not slugs. True bad men are human, when they try to destroy our beloved lovers or try to make them exaggerated. <br /> <br /> For example, the meaning man places a man-filled glove. They were hanging on a hand-operated glove, when they were excluded from these hands, they reacted to the instinct, defending himself and bending the boy. Now, instead of asking the doctor instead of his slug bite, this guy runs like a fool around his greenhouse as a fool, releases some very volatile chemicals, starts a fire, knocks himself and then removes his hand. and the volatile chemicals and their house breaks down. How can you expel slugs? <br /> <br /> This movie paints a portrait of the favorite of humans. The characters in this film are the silent sheriff, who hates everyone, means a drunken hick for his dog, and a rugged friend, a wife with at least forty-five years of wives. There is also a group of teenagers drunk <br /> <br /> who are attacked, and we have long-haired hair extensions. Meanwhile, Leslie Neilson says there is a guy who seems demonic: "You are not happy to proclaim a birthday!" for some reason. In the end, this unequivocal parade will consist of the classic "Pod People" type of MST3, which explodes after a face explosion salad (which is easily avoided by another fate, which is helpful and harmful). <br /> <br /> Humans are lovers, stupid, racist, alcoholics and, in an amazing scene, portray themselves as rapists. In the climatic scene of the film, men are trying to smoke the slums that are being slaughtered by evil sneaks. Well, because they are stupid, man flows ALL COUNTRIES. They only make more damages than creams made only! <br /> <br /> If you hate humans, and I know, I appreciate you, "Slugs". If you are a fan of filmmaking, you will also enjoy the gift of "Pieces" and "Pod People" director. There is enough representation, stupid conversation, special effects without logical plot, meaningless scenes and poor duplication to focus on.
