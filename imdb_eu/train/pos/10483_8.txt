Yes, the movie is predictable and definitely not a reward. But then he does not try to do anything. With funny and entertaining crackers, Peter O'Toole's terrific and fun performance, with Joan Plowright's dirt and downfall. The performance of the group was in detail, each playing its role in a sharp and comical way. It was a good music, but not very good, but it worked well. From some negative comments I conclude that the moods of some of the moods passed their heads. A good example is comments on "weird games like baseball", as well as my beloved American, which was derived from cricket baseball - and the explanation of the ignorant US band was fun for those who know cricket. . Also, you were not supposed to have Wince when Carle broke a window; It was fun Lord Foxley said "yes!" For more money to be broken, the director also said "no, no" money. Well, it seems that jokes have to be explained to some people ... I like all-in-all and I've had a good laugh! She deserves to see it well.
