OH WOW. This film I saw on March 12, 2000 at the Irish International Film Fleadh in Manhattan. Two stars attended and then asked. NUMBER OF BIG FILMS! While Irish is still among the Catholic / Protestant antagonists, the story may occur anywhere between the two hate each other. The horrors of horror that can be quickly diverted to people who hate people and hate them out with an emotional story full of humor and fun. If it is not received in the United States, it would be unfortunate. <br /> <br /> As for stars and companions ... THE FIRST PRICE. I called Orla Brady Meryl Streep Irish, I heard. I think it's better than Meryl Streep. Meryl Orla Brady should call the United States! And, Liam Cunningham was a steady and powerful portrait of a simple and private man who was involved in a political war. <br /> <br /> SEE THROUGH THIS SHORT BREAK
