This section of Twilight Zone captures silent (1890) silent section melodramatic and visual gags, in honor of the first Buster Keaton films. A lot of slapstick: Buster slows down the door, falls into a puddle, runs pants-less around. A snooping scientist who invented the helmets, remembering Flash's idea in the future. Cheap prices, like women's hats for $ 1.95, or 17 cents for cattle for making cows. Highly resonant with Buster. Although in 1890 the world was too Buster / Mulligan. How amazing it was when he was transporting the "modern" 1960s to the world! Buster wanted to go back! The "scientist" of that time wants to go back to a more relaxed world in 1890, studying and admiring it. They go back together, and Buster / Mulligan is now happy and "scientist" does not have electronic equipment, modern beds or electric blankets. So, Buster returns with a mad helmet. <br /> <br /> This Twilight Zone does not have a heavy message. Since his death in 1966, Buster Keaton is one of his last efforts. That's enough. <br /> <br /> Another nice thing - Maytag Man is a repair repairing the Jesse White Time Time hell for a long time - predicting its washing machine.
