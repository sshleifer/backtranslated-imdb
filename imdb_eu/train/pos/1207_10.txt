I still love the age of 17 for the first time since I saw it, I lost a copy of it and I was very annoyed. Although it does not match with the original (I never noticed a child and I do not like adult), that's what cartoons should be *. Just enough to be dark, interesting and light to enjoy everyone. I am glad that my parents grew up on this kind of thing, because they only have cartoons we see today. It's a great music and it's definitely in your head forever ... I have downloaded the whole soundtrack at one point or another.
