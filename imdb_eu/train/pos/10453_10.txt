While traveling by train throughout Europe, Jesse Americans (Ethan Hawke) and Celine French (Julie Delpy) meet together and decide together for the night in Austria. The next day, Jesse will return to the United States and Celine to Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before sunrise" is one of my favorite loves, one of the most beautiful love stories ever seen. A low budget movie is a very simple and real story, but Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are the perfect chemistry, and conversations are amazing. Direction is amazing, transmitting the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. My review ended with the number 1,000 on IMDb, and I've chosen this "significant number before the sunrise" for me, a very special movie for me. I can not understand why this film was nominated for an Academy Award, with script, director and excellent performances. Yesterday, I probably saw this movie a third or fourth time and I still love it. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Before you Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")
