One of my favorite shows in the 80s. After the first season, they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to the slope. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and fun was her and Ernest Borgnine's nature went hand in hand. He was one of the favorites in the second season. Unfortunately, these days blacks did not watch long-term television shows. In the second season, some episodes were good but in the third season, more was the character of the man than Airwolf, and it was not until the show was over. When he went to the USA, he liked it!
