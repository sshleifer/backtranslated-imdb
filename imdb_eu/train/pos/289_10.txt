I love all the Michael Landon Jr's movies. And Michael Landon Jr could not have found the cast of "Clark Davis" by Dale Midkiff. Dale Midkiff casts this character. <br /> <br /> This film directed me from the beginning to the end. The baby Missie & Willies had time for Clarks Clarks. visit was just God's time. How they made their death and how they helped Clark was the love of his parents. <br /> <br /> Even before this movie is 3 [Love Comes softly, Loves Enduring Promise & Loves Long Journey]. You can see this movie and I can easily understand it. However, let's see and watch the previous 3 movies thanks to the history behind the characters you want to see. <br /> <br /> Michael Landon Jr. is a great director <br /> <br /> I hope many of his films will be in the future.
