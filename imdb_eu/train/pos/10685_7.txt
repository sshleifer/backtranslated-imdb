This film has a clear story that is not very common for the genre of music. "Cats," "Phantom of the Opera," and other Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals can be considered metaphorical, as literary works are used as their own. Screenwriter "Biarrin Bintang Menari" (BBM) is the core of human relations, especially for Indonesian people. Although the movie was based on a "fairytale" story, it is actually a "child" fantasy in Indonesian adults. Dance sequences are not perfect, but they indicate how Indonesian songs express themselves. I think the choreographer should explore Indonesian dances, because Indonesian dance development is still in the West. Dance sequences appear in different ways and are not synchronized with songs and / or music. However, I still love this film and is a new wave of new Indonesian films that I hope to improve the future I hope to improve in the future.
