Thirty years ago, the author Numa Sadoul published a book-length interview with Belgian book comic Georges Remi (Herge, creator of Tintin). This movie hits Sadoul while he remembers conversation, while listening to the cassette (Herge died in 1983) and see the photos and photos of the man. Some parts of the conversation were not published in the book at the request of Herge, and we now know that they were separated from their wife, after having had a relationship with one of their colleagues (later became his second wife). An interesting thing is that the film is not well-corrected by Tintin Books for the first time from right-and-imperialist books (Tintin Kongo, Tintin Sobietar Ground). Generally speaking, I have learned from this movie some things about Herge and I see it a bit less than when I go to the theater.
