This movie is excellent. It seemed very interesting to me. I thought Wendigo's story was pretty fun. His performance was excellent, including clothing, production, photography, direction and script. <br /> <br /> A happy family, on holiday, is stranded in the center of nothing after a fall. Then a hunter appears and angry and angry that one of the deer breaks. Then they attack the family and they will come up with strange things. <br /> <br /> See this movie. It's worth it. Happy cast, crew and filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up!
