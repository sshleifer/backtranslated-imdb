Manga is the same name (Tramps Like Us in the U.S.) but you can also enjoy manga reading. The tail is a different type, showing a strong and independent female, like the others. However, due to external strength, he is afraid to show his inner feelings and, consequently, he is intimidating by his convictions. He who really represents him and whoever plays it is his new pet ... man ... Momo. If you want a different J-Dorama (Japanese Drama) to be different than a normal boring actress, this is definitely the series and read it!
