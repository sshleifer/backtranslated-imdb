But it's horny, at least we grew up in Weird Al, as I did. He is a documentary about his life and career, starting with new stars and continuing their origins. It's a different place, but some segments are still fun, especially when it's going to Japan. Although he is not an emotional text like Lost in Translation, he also finds a strangely peculiar mix of Tokyo culture with a street-life that is not fleeing love. <br /> <br /> Maybe Weird Al is not allowed to be a comprehensible comment about culture; Maybe it would smell a sweet pink smell of any other name. However, this is a funny movie.
