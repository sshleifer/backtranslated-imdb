This movie is very big. <br /> <br /> Now, my movie is like a story and a tough conversation, but occasionally something like Moonwalker will come and there are many mistakes. /> <br /> This movie is not very entertaining Michael Jackson's ad. Starting with the video that started with the video 'Man in the Mirror', he shows his achievements and parts and baskets of his career, crosses all the heights of his life and then transforms into a truly entertaining segment that acts. The fun music of 'Bad' and 'Speed ​​Demon', following MJ's adventures, starts with a manic stunt, and eventually dancing against a rabbit costume. Stalking movement is not so bad as everyone thinks. It's just right <br /> <br /> Then, we'll see the video 'Let me stop by peace' and directly on the main character of the feature film. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is not horny. Very horny We see Michael go out of a building and thousands of soldiers are fired. Then we hit the flashback, showing MJ and three children on an underground lair. 'Big Big' (Joe Pesci) is a malignant criminal who has a plan for everybody's "drug" to adhere to children (age is not mentioned). MJ and the girl caught and then escaped ... yada yada yada. On the ground is not really important. Two very cool sequences make MJ a car, then a robot spaceship, and, of course, the amazing Smooth Criminal sequence. <br /> <br /> So it's so a movie, but that's wonderful for those who like MJ. It has its greatest successes and extravagant features, and it's worthy of special good effects (especially the Robot / Spaceship sequence), especially if you can get a quid on an ebay. Some children will be relaxed for a couple of hours, and when the first 20 years they were released, they were released for the first 20 years.
