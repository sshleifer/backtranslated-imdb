This story was probably one of the most powerful ever I ever had. John Singleton definitely went through the gathering of this educational masterpiece. Great performances with beautiful performances, but one of the best convents of Epps and Rapaport, the youngest actress. <br /> <br /> However, as a college student, Singleton took on many issues. at the end In a sense, despite the many issues faced by many university campuses, they will not be presented as openly as possible in this film. In some cases, it almost seemed to be that something hilarious of this kind would happen. However, as it was a bit more than dramatic, it was a great movie and I was amazed, could not talk, just think. One of these photos I will always remember is Lawrence Fishburn's character quote: "Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you can not see your power." Excellent, it's just great.
