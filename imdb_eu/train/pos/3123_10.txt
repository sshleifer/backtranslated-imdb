Any 10 to 10 first movie I gave. What made the movie so good for me? Continuous action: there is no slow part, great performance, intelligent writing. Also, I liked the shooting style, where there were only vibrations and different angles that you feel as if you were a scene. In the end, I can see the action movie that is not like all public sectors (for example, forced love). <br /> <br /> The first two Bourne films liked me, but I loved this. . <br /> <br /> Warning: after watching the movie, you will be full of adrenaline and want to relax a bit before driving the car!
