Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is very good, but I think the writers have used the word. tribute to "too much 1. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strong and the film is very well-interpreted and shot. <br /> <br /> It's an exciting action and a sword that is very realistic but not very gory .The story is good and you really want to win Rob. <br /> <br /> It's all just a classic.
