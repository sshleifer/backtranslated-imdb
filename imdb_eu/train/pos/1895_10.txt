I saw this at Christmas, I do not know why, but Christmas reminds me, so I saw it, so we are not. <br /> <br /> I see Arthur's whole movie, a silent smile on the face and a mixture of special performances, wonderful music and sour spirits and charms. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore creates a character that can be very hateful (drunk, rich, lazy, lazy, who pardons himself), but makes someone who loves you. Liza Minelli is wonderful, Linda Morolla, a queen's servant who pulls soft and gentle intensity in the interior, leaves Arthur almost to his side. John Gielgud gets and enjoys all the cute little lines. <br /> <br /> I can see Arthur repeatedly, and I always feel that I feel good, check if you need a beautiful movie for a lift.
