I've personally seen a lot of Disney movies in my life, but there's no connection to the Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Personally, I was not cross-curled with live animation, it was an improvement to dress up as an animated character. They are sent to a silent and socially clumsy country in which the three violent violations of the two wars around the world are suspended. I had to say that it was an excellent question. Angela Landsbury made Miss Price the perfect one, while David Thomilson made her happy to entertain. The endings have always impressed me and there is no exception. He was neither happy nor sad, although I do not know that it was deliberate. The dialogue was not very good, but considering that it was designed to be a child's movie, it's ok. In general, the screening of nine ten, six interviews ten, the interview ten times, and ten outfits ten.
