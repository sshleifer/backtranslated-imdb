I really liked the movie. (That's why I was surprised to find that a lot of users in this site got a low rating!) I'm not saying that cinema is a masterpiece, but it was a great way to spend snowy and snowy nights on Saturday night. Funny, changing and pleasant women tell us about the bad things they do together in difficult times and their friends. Bill Paterson shines with Reverand, and Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell prove their role as an actor. (Actually, this movie is the "best wedding escapade" ever seen or dreamed of, the more courage I've ever met!) You laugh and shout --- ignore marketing campaigns. and how this movie is being marketed ... It's a hidden treasure that is made at the box office at TONNES. (Now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
