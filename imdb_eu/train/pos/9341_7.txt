Sandler is again amazing ... I've become a fan of Sandler. This movie is Sandler's story. His statement is fantastic. By clicking I cried more, but there are some similar points. The loss is a great deal of truth in life, to examine and lose the value of the family, and to say, "I love you," ... It is tough, real ... and in truth, there is no real success, Binder. I do not think any other director could give them such emotions. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also amazing ... Cheadle Crash is one of my favorites. Do not laugh or have a positive atmosphere ... If you are not ready to face the reality of life, do not miss this movie.
