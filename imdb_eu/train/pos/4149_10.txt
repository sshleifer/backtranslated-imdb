When reading some comments in the message board, I had the whole movie look, but when I saw it I could not laughter! Officially my favorite movie has become. <br /> <br /> I do not know what a hate is, maybe something like this has never been around. I do not completely name feminine comedies. Many comedies will be one or two actors, but there will be many male characters. This was almost ALL female - except for the brief appearance of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and Will Arnett ... and she worked. All the actresses gave a very entertaining show (especially Missi Pyle) from a strange and beautiful writing. <br /> <br /> The charm of this movie, for me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message: who is to admit it, in women's success in the public sphere, by breaking women's friendship and gender roles. Although it is a clear heart, the main characters face a challenge, with their attempts to be "more entertaining" with feminist values ​​and who were in conflict with them. <br /> <br /> Missi Pyle proposed that this was due to the loss of theatrical film due to the distribution of women and that was not a great actress to get the studios behind and I agree. I recommend everyone to this movie, and I think it's a shame that the comedy that celebrates women's drama is not accepted and successful. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to be the love or desire of the comedy for women.
