Personally, I like Cut. I was the first time I saw the Australian slasher film in theater. The genre that usually limits only the main Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> Australian traditional cooking and antique plays, a horror movie outside of Australia, did not break anything. I did not think it was an event of other films. At night, I was terrified of horror issues, it was horrifying like Elm Street's Nightmare, or Scream or What You Did last summer and, as a result, it was more credible suspension. I think that the Australian film of that time tried to penetrate mainstream genres. <br /> <br /> The cut was original, it was pretty scary and ultimately fun. I'd give him seven to ten and I'm not taking it seriously. What I wanted to do was entertain and get bored to meet enough. I liked it
