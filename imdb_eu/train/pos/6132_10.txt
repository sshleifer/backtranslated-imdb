I'm glad that the users who like this movie (from that date) are moving forward. I did not understand people who did not like the movie: it seems serious (?!?!) Treatments that were the ones that were waiting! Well, what kind of hell can you take the premise of a snowman seriously? The filmmakers knew that the premise was bad, and they did not deny it. It can deliver live scenes really fun! Yes, it shows low budgets (for example, this explosion setting), but I think the expensive look could get rid of the movie! So if you like B movies, and if you like stupid premises, you'll definitely like "Jack Frost".
