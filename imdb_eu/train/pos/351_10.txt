Slasher is a colorful film. That's it. <br /> <br /> SCREAM has a mystery element that is so popular in slasher movies, but I do not care about that. Knowing who is kind is not very interesting, given the trace of being misleading. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the death were inventors and they brought memories of the 80s horror film. <br /> <br /> Another nice thing about this movie is that it's difficult to determine how to survive the girl, unlike SCREAM and IKWYDLS. <br /> <br /> Slasher films do not like the movie. That's as easy as that. I really enjoyed it and I want to see it waiting so much again. <br /> <br /> --MB
