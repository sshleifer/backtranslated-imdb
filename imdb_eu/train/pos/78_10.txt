Despite being one of the standard "Revenge Price Plots", the movie is a favorite of Vincent Price's work. Gallico has so much quality in the horror movie characters. When you look at it, you feel it, you feel his frustration, his injustice against you, and encourages you to go to vengeance, even if you are afraid a bit from his original fury. As the film progresses, his character becomes tragic. He has murdered, but now he is obliged to die. And cover again. And again ... in your stomach your soul becomes sour as its spiral goes down, as my beloved brother turns into a cap. Although the story of Mendekes is old, the plot devices themselves are original - Gallico uses his tricks to make them more and more inventive. This penalty is not available at home.
