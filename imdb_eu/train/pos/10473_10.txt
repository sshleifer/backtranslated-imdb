When I saw the first movie I had a bad head. For some reason, he clicked on all my levels, the tension in a family, the loneliness and someone who shared your life. There was not a pretty girl like Claire (Cyndy Preston) who shared your life with someone. I bought a soundtrack for this movie (very difficult). I love it and I hope one day it will appear on DV
