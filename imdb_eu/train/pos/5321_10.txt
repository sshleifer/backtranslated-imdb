This movie really shocked me. At the beginning I had doubts, but the film got better and better every minute. <br /> <br /> You may not be looking for audiences, but a curious criminal, man, husband and husband, is like an explicit portrait. If you are not a bad language or sexual content, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> The story is sometimes difficult to follow, but, in the end, I think everything has improved. It was an unexpected ending, it was almost impossible for you to think otherwise it would end. <br /> <br /> In regards to the action, I think it was good. No Oscar nominee will be given, but at least my eye has been received. Gil Bellows's portrait is not always perfect, but it's so funny. Shaun Parkes, Clowsquek's prisoner's widow's partner is very strong and very powerful. From the point of view, I think Esai Morales will put Markie's portrait. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and see this movie, you'll love it or not!
