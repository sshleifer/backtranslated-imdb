Adults are a great movie about the characters of the swimming class, interactions, problems and relationships. It should achieve a broader distribution, which is much better than a large-scale theater studio at the same time. <br /> <br /> An instructor for swimming is almost an Olympic discipline, an adult lesson that is less educated and often focuses on the attention of its students. Trying to test more or less using different results. <br /> <br /> Students are the main people of the U.S.; teachers, police, university students and retirees, who for some reason do not swim. It includes friends, relatives and romantic conquests that cross film classes. Several sub-tables provide fun games that include a teacher during divorce, some high school students make a documentary, and a girl who only knows the boys. <br /> <br /> This is a good date for the movie. Or you just want to watch it when you want to be a romantic drama of reality.
