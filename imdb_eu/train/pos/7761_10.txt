*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** In 1956, and posting that it was very cruel, Douglas Sirk is a superb candy melodrama that is still a great thing. The plot works in a rich Texas dysfunctional oil family that is surely, weakly, wounded and very alcoholic, including Robert Stack, with a touching and touching touch, and played by Dorothy Malone at a faint sister Marylee. The performance of Malon is transmitted through our eyes, used to show emotions, most of them lust (Rock Hudson) and jealous (for Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actor I have ever seen in films that penetrate the room. Now I'm not writing bad, its performance is the least, and it's one of the highlights of the 1950s championships. But it's horrible too, because Malone is so pleasing and attractive, he's not a good actress and is not capable, very fine or shameless. Its performace is a note. Mambo makes a foul, and Robert Keith, in a wonderful father, who has always been well-dressed, like a massive ladder on the stairs, Sirk makes Malone almost mad when doing an orgasm dance. Stack (which should win an Oscar) and Malone (who won the prize, but it would not have been) are real stars of the movie, all hysteria, whether sexual or otherwise, that move. The "true stars" movie, gray and brown Hudson and Bacall disappear. These are the colors that mainly cuts. Hudson was a better actor and then struck as Stack's childhood and best friend's plays and stalked. Who loves Malone's interest in Rock's rejection and intimidation. Hudson, however, does not want his part, instead of Bacall, married to Stack. No one is very happy and no one is happy long. Stack-Bacall's marriage falls for a long time, and Stack makes an effort to think that the effort is sterile, and can not prove that he is a baby to give a baby. Sirk was a smart man and had a long and happy career in Germany and in the theater. In the mid 50's, he finished his career in Hollywood, with "women's films" or melodramas with a bright color. Mainly tailored to medical or trash sources, Sirken became the genre masterpiece. Sirk had a wonderful sense of color and design, which brought with them a wide range of contributions, with characters that played with strange combinations of colors and lighting, with lighting, shadows and mirror reflections. In the "Input" section, the characters are drawn from the windows, listening to or walking around. So finally, after a great deal of violence, an unexpected murder, abortion and more, Sirk finishes with a stunning scene with a "revival" and ends with a Malone film that is renewed in a male suitcase. .
