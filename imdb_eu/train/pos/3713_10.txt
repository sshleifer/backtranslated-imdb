With this movie they are style, atmosphere and theater. To be honest, I did not believe the whole development on the plot, but it did not matter, I had a great performance, unexpected sketches, and they drove me with wonderful spots, and they took me on the path, and I also had a good time. Kenneth Branagh is not an excellent actor, but a master accent, and proves the perfect accent in Georgia again. He's just roused by talented roles (Robert Downey, Jr., Emeth Davidtz Schindler and Fallen, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah and Robert Duvall). I recently bought a copy of this movie and I have never seen it anymore. It's just one of the best thrill of the year. You have discarded this movie (and you have the option) to check it out.
