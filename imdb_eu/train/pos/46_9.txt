After finishing seeing this sixth or eighth movie movie, we watched the Blockbuster for the first time a night and I really liked it, so far I've shown 4 people and have enjoyed it. With Hollywood glamor, special effects and "shock factor" avoiding stress, this independent film by Paul F. Ryan puts it in his head to illustrate the effects of subsequent traumatic situations in illustration. After a high school shoot, two characters Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen) are in a difficult relationship. Alicia, a little girl with a heart, a Gothic attitude towards lifestyle, helps Deanna to overcome life and death issues and live after them. Meanwhile, Dean tries to help Alicia to see some of the softness and light in the world. Noting the shocking events of the event, but the relationship between people who survived this film is distinguished by this film. Despite a small budget and a short film, this movie is far from it. Ryan looks at the situation he has ever suffered and tries to approach the human psyche. With a brilliant and stunning actress of Philipps, she adds the necessary dramas to the overall conversation and feeling of the film, and Christensen helps to balance the feeling she can have. In general, I recommend this movie and if you enjoy school abuse and violence and learn more about it, I also propose a documentary "It's a Girls World" published by CBC in 2004. In Montreal, Quebec, and another by a boyfriend of 14-year-old Dawn Marie Wellesley, Victoria, British Columbia, after a confrontation with her, the comparison and comparison of two girls' boys.
