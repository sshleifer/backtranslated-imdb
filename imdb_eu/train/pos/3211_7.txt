This movie is fine if you want a strange action, a vibrant play and a little plot! Special effects are worthy of this film due to the director of the film "Event Horizon". Costumes are like some of the movies that are rousing. No soldier speaks, so others tell him what to do. In the end, it is considered as a giant movie, making explosions everywhere. I personally liked Russell's "tang and money" and "executive decision" "tug and cash flow." This movie is to be seen without a head-to-head science fiction movie!
