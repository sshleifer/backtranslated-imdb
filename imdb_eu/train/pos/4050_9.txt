Anyone who is bored of this movie is a whirlwind that sticks to the movies behind the car and romantic comedies. This film is exciting and does not mean a boring moment. Why? Because in a crisis moment, it makes the intelligent dialogue between real people and their details to maintain this crisis. Repeat - smart conversation! Therefore, all Rohmer films are almost completely differentiated and, therefore, they do not like many people. They prefer action. Well, let's face the rest of the life movies, those who are fond of discrimination and are looking for such a movie. <br /> <br /> Rohmer has always been accused of being "talky".
