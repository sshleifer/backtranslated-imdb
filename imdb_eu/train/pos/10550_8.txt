I saw this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University, which does not seem to me that this distributor in the UK does not have it. Well, actually, this movie is not because it's not a Hollywood movie - original, creative, curious, and humorous. It seems that today nobody wants to see this type of movie, in the simplest terms, that most young audiences do not agree with the general conventions they seek in a movie. <br /> <br /> My opinion on the protection of my rights was not age enough, but I felt the desire to give a special mention to this movie, even if I had a 30-minute break. Basically, there is nothing, the two main characters in their world are immersed in their personality through the hatred of the world. Shine is here, the director maintains a longer time of interest with the two characters, and the only staging consists of a semi-empty seat and empty space. This is largely due to the star-show of actors, both of which offer ridiculous laughs and, at the same time, their roles to increase dramatically their emotional depth. <br /> <br /> I love writing more but I want a time limit. However, I encourage anyone and everyone to try this movie. A special concept is taken to the screen in a consistent and well-executed way, we combine good performances, a solid script, pleasant sound design and (quite) visual images, creating a fun movie. <br /> <br /> It's just a shame, so people know little about Nothing ....
