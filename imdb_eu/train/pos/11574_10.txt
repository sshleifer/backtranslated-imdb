This movie is a semi-documentary ... it's quite interesting ... <br /> <br /> This is a good movie ... it's based on how to stop the Norwegian sabbath set. Rukjan (Norway) production of heavy water and heavy German water supplies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not perfect and it could be a bit better ... it's only a few sabotaged films. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in World War II and the history of the film, it is a movie that deserves a look!
