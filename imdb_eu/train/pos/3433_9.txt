I first saw it at the foreign festival. It's a great rhythm for a plot of land to alleviate the treasure of Estonia over a million dollars a year. Hollywood is rarely shot in a short-lived style. But the atmosphere of the emancipation of the new Baltic states is beautiful (note: Tallin was much worse in 2003 when it was there). > <br /> They are also a lot of humor and love. I do not want to ruin many astonishing but logical surprises, so this generous man starts with a great script and director and performances are top class. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is the fastest and most nervous example of its genus: RAFIFI, TOPKAPI and a thousand miles ahead of the OCEAN'S 11, though (intentionally) not glossy. RENTAL OR CONSTRUCTION.
