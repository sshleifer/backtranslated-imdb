I recall that this film was given to the Academy Awards and did not win in the category. In my life, I can not remember what it was against, but I can say one thing: it was one of the best films ever I've ever seen. Steven Spielberg's film did not convince me a bit. <br /> <br /> Basically, the tests and difficulties of a black woman are like a girl growing up as a woman. There are many worrisome and inspiring inspirations, but everyone is required to see what this woman has done. Along the way, we have seen other women who have had difficulties and had to ride with them. Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie. Danny Glover also nominated at least one role in that film. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this movie is that it treats its themes to humanity, unlike the latest "Loving" latest shows. I encourage any race to watch this movie. 9/10
