Come people The movie is better than 4. It seems that this is happening ... wealthy people have made things stupid. It was fun <br /> <br /> I want to see a comedy, run away from the pressure in the world for a while, and do not have to take anything seriously. The purpose of this film is to fully adapt. I judge a movie with its own merits and I do not want to talk about Merry Christmas Blazing Saddles. I saw people totally dysfunctional in order to make them pleasurable and pleasing to people, since they were easy to live on the street from my street. "Watch the holiday season ..... stay on the list". If you want to be fun for 90 minutes, see this.
