I really like to see this picture until now. Surely, animation is not the best one, but to be honest, I prefer that this cartoon style be quicker and cheaper than the old style of fast and inexpensive (that is, it was happening more and more ... when it's time and effort to look good It's just a style, there's nothing wrong with the angular lines and the smallest black eyes - I think it's really nice. Like children, I never thought Scooby-Doo's design was particularly adorable, but I think I know better. <br /> <br /> However, Shaggy has always been my favorite character, and believe it or not, but I think that it has a great depth. Surely, the show does not deal with the "Mystery Solution" issue, but The old formula, however, was tired. I did not write it wrong: I am sure some writers are more interested in Mystery Inc. (as it is too late), which would bring more interest. The standard deviation from the show's funny deviation laugh at it. Shaggy and Scooby is still fun, but it's no longer the only relief of comics. He is still a coward, but in the end, the mind (shock!) Seems to have the chance to use it. They are always identical to ancient food, but now it seems that Uncle Albert helps them with inheritance. <br /> <br /> I found original Scooby-Doo templates. It's a pure and ridiculous cheese, but this show really gives a real sense of humor. Also, I never liked Casey Kasem Shaggy, so other new actors did not abuse me like others do. (I still think that Billy West was the best) <br /> <br /> In general, though it's not a great cartoon in the history of cartoons, it's still a great achievement among other Scooby incarnations.
