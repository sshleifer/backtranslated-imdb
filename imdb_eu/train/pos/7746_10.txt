If you know DEUS, meet singer Tom Barman. As this music produced, it mixes everything. This comedy, especially nonsense and cynical, is a drama, one of the main characters is not saying happiest happiness, and really does not aim. <br /> <br /> The movie started on Friday, in Belgium, in Antwerp, with a scene of several people, some of them have nothing to do with it, but they will interact with each other overnight and day. There are several main characters: a teacher who writes books does not read, a young researcher with a malicious taste of death and his sister, the owner of galleries, who are in direct contact with two young men, a man who works in the theater theater and two young women. There is something about the wind involved in the whole movie. All characters have problems with their family, their friends or just their lives. <br /> <br /> The film is located in Antwerp, where you can see beautiful city and port planes. The events of the day are not easy to explain, I only recommend watching the movie, but it's too much to say. But I can say that, Barman has a great use of the camera and uses a lot of music (especially dance music, not really rock) to make a mood, especially when it's full of amazing music. <br /> <br /> This movie is an experience of itself, it does not leave a prudent life, you may need to live and do not waste it, or you must have false moral truth. <br /> <br /> In the end, see, it's worth it!
