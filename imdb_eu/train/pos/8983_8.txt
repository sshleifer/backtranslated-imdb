The car shot through the wind of wind, someone plays another song, another does not react by voice. I wonder how this was done. I asked him how I had a camera with too many scenes in this movie. If the scenes filmed by Warhol after the end of a BJM were true, they would not be supposed to be supposed to be exploited, they were totally complete, they made me feel uncomfortable, was that the goal? Through this movie I continued to wonder how the footage happened. Really enjoying a portrait of the genius we truly believe.
