"Margarita and cock ..." <br /> <br /> <br /> This entertaining and entertaining movie brings you back to the beginning and never laughs, giving you moments of surprise and unexpected. I was more fun in 2005 than "Matador" in 2005. An unforgettable film that is perfected by Pierce Brosnan. Pierce Brosnan perfects it. <br /> <br /> Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a dynamist. (hit-man), specializes in high-level corporate concerts (dude kills rich). It also experiences something like a mid-life crisis. Undoubtedly, he has entered the Mexican hotel inn for a night without a real housekeeper, while in the future, Danny Wright (Kinnear) has entered. <br /> <br /> Danny is down. A lucky family man, who is about to abandon business business, to turn things around. He loves his beloved wife, especially a few years before, when he lost his young son. <br /> <br /> Two men are chalk and cheese, they are almost not in a deserted place. overnight And to some extent, there is a conversation that will start a chain of events that will change life afterwards. <br /> <br /> The friendship that make up Laurel and Hardy reminded me a lot. The right man is a permanent fool who creates problems. The interaction is highly adapted and consolidated due to the Brosnan and Kinnear performances. <br /> <br /> But do not make a mistake ... This is Brosnan's movie. One of the most memorable and delightful characters of the decade. Your mother was shot and immediately asked for forgiveness and you would probably be sorry. Brosnan may be the ultimate charm of cinema, but it's the most appealing performance yet. I would not care to see an Oscar for this assignment. <br /> <br /> See a scene, because the girl in high school is thinking about inflatable, and gives the line: "All blushy blushy ... No sucky fucky." He makes the famous Bond smile and helps him escape. He manages to say to a young boy: "Tell your mother about losing 30 kg and 20 years, then return to me," it will not be difficult. In fact, we like it even more. <br /> <br /> However, the film is surprising that the scenes are really touched, most of which come to an end because the movie takes some unexpected turns. However, when Julian talks about someone born in his notebook with little black book, or Danny and his wife (Davis) console themselves in each other, the night falls into an unexpected emotion. <br /> <br /> "Matador" is elegant and energetic. It's always fun. And Brosnan has a role that defines career, usually looking for friendship and at least one good thing for his or her life. It's a jewel in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> <br /> IndependentCritics.com TC Candler
