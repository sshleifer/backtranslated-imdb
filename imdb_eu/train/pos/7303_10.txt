A few weeks ago I saw this classic for the first time. About thirty years ago, I thought that the scary moments would be a bit like that. The boy was wrong. There are great moments that have slowed down the spine. Although the play was very good, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was great. It does all copiers, eg. The nightmare on Elm Street, Scream looks very dear. I can not say that Carpenter is the best, because I have not seen much, the only one I remember is Starman (I think he has done it). Halloween is the ultimate achievement of the horror genre.
