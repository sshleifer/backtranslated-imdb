A friend recommended this movie to me. I never saw an advertisement or trailer, so I did not know that Clooney was there and he was not worried that his role was so small. I thought the whole piece was good, and it seemed to me that the movie was quite enjoyable. The opening scene, with little crew of standing up side of the road, looking noisy and stinging, immediately focused on my attention. He had a way of saying, "Do not go, this is not boring," and it was not really. Comedy was interesting and soulful enough to bring your seat to the end, but when it came to an end I deceived a bit ... a little. The events continued to be built, they had to continue construction, but at the point where I can not define, it creates different levels and it is a light end. I think that I expected a higher congestion, but it was the bottom line. That is why, if you see a movie that lives a bit without George Clooney, this movie is very entertaining and worth it. Now, I'd like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it's probably a strange discovery in the United States.
