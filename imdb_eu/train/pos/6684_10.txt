The movie is excellent. I love each other I see. Most comics can get pretty lama, because you know all the gag, but mystery men have so much in their writing and characterization that they are seeing again - while Ben Stiller tears the limo's hat design, or Hank Azaria said goodbye to Louise Lasser , or Geoffrey Rush reflects his fierce choreography, or Tom Waits is amazed to see the news report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss by Paul Reubens. This is the perfect shade. The story is developed directly and consistently, action sequences are creatively and not overly dominant, the final results in general. Seriously, if you've seen it and have done some time, check again and do not start, just start. You can not see it again until you see it first. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, scene of the test, good things!)
