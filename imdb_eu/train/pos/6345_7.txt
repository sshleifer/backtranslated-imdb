Clothing and make-up were great, some lines were very fun and Jim Carrey played the role. Carrey did a good job as a scriptwriter. Surely, this is especially a movie for kids, but if you want to spend a lot of money on a movie, you should give yourself at least a story out of enough body to go beyond Dr. Seuss. I expected more from Ron Howard. It deserves sight, but unnecessary quality is lacking in any class.
