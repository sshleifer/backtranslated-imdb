I expected that the Sentinel movie would be good and good. I had a perfect story. First of all in the novel, and I thought that this was an original story, but I think it was not a very passionate story. Michael Douglas is a very good movie and Keither Sutherland, but it is very difficult for him to return to the role of Jack Bauer at the age of 24, but you end up making it very different in Sentinel's 24th year. Another person trying to eliminate their role for television, but failed. Eva Longeria. He was not good at the movie and the whole thing had a back seat. After watching the movie I have had constant dreams about Sentinel and I could not. Overview Sentinel is a good movie and I would recommend it.
