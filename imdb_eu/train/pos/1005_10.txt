Verhoeven's movie was a deep and full garbage. It's a director's hacking and should be ashamed. According to his acceptance, he read two chapters in the book, he decided to start to scratch everything that he had bored and decided. <br /> <br /> Heinlein never had to push him to the bin to see if he was alive. It basically stole the name, the book's policies (that is, it's a good part) mocked and T & A sometimes throws it, so it does not get bored by the giant American midfielder. <br /> <br /> This anime is not perfect, but at least it's mostly correct, I can say better.
