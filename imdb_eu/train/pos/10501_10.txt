Super Mario 64 is definitely the biggest game ever created. It's so addicting that you play for a few hours without a break. I won the game four times, but I've never gotten 120 stars (I got 111) ... but I hope I'll get them in the end. I did not officially play this game until the age of seven, though I liked watching my sisters play. I'm 13 years old and I'm still playing it before I delete games and start again. <br /> <br /> The graphics are not incredible in the early N64 game. The behavior is addictive. The controls are excellent. The levels are hard, but not impossible. Bowser's struggles are challenging. <br /> <br /> I'd like to tell you more, but why not just you? Put the X-BOX 360, PS3, and Wii away and go find yourself in Nintendo 64 and play a wonderful, wonderful game.
