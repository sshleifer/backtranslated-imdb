I love this movie. The film is an excellent English-Indian theme for individual cultures, such as men who want to make sports reserved for men. The fight against the Indians, who want to leave outside of cultural barriers, and show off women who want to break out of the sports restrictions in sport, especially at that time in England. I emphasize cultural struggles over the rest of the issues. <br /> <br /> Unlike other comments, I do not think this movie is like Dirty Dance or any other lightning. This movement loves men, men and women alike and young people alike.
