* I mark the spots that are damaged! General comments: If you can make serious movies, watch this. You will be open and enjoyable in mind. Do not leave the theater, because you are confused. The film fits well in the second half. I'll take my mom to see her again when she's open the movie. <br /> <br /> I saw it lucky a couple of weeks ago during the show, when Will was promoting the movie. It was great - a lot of time spent with fans. Thanks for the picture of Will! About Willen Performance: Sometimes you watch a movie with a very popular movie / show actor, you always think about current activity, as you think of past performance. This was not the case with Will Smith. When I was watching this movie I did not paint a fresh prince (lol). It was absolutely and completely credible in this very and very serious role. The actor has grown tremendously. I think that at least Oscar will be offered for this performance. <br /> <br /> About his character: Ben is very conflicting and tortured. It's sad ... on horseback ... very accurate, but afraid. It's very true to himself. He has a great depth in his character ... and to some extent, Wille brought life. taxes. It may not be the bright star of Will, but it was very credible. I think that his character did not have to work with Will '. <br /> <br /> About the Earthquake (without disaster): I agree that I do not like the movie until the second half. I've never known anything about the movie, and there's nothing meaning in the second half. But when things get into the end, wow. Stunningly written and well thought out. The movie that really is with you is very intense. <br /> <br /> It really takes a lot to see. I was in the theater, most people were crying at the end of the day: even older men. When you realize what is good, why is it a very powerful moment ... <br /> <br /> ******* Small spoilers ***** Why is it really difficult to talk about the things that are important in the plot? not giving up I really ruin knowing too much about this movie. Although I enjoyed many symbols in the movie. Here I will mention some (without trying to get away). <br /> <br /> -Here kept the fish in his hotel room. At first it does not make any sense. Many people talked about cinema in the theater when they realized the reality of fish. <br /> <br /> -I really annoyed the movie at the beginning. In the end, I loved it and I hated it. That was convincing Will. Ben was convinced that Mr. Benori Ezra was a giant, he was trying to make his way in the world. Because he treated it as much as Ezra, he later became clear in the film. Wait for it Everything in this movie: wait it. <br /> <br /> -It's basically a good person and does not forgive a great mistake that he'll forgive himself. They still do not know that he was doing it because he was trying to get rid of his guilt, or if he really wanted to help the people. I think it's a bit ... I think that he wanted to help the people, but also to get rid of his past. I love his character. You love and hate it, you realize that what is happening is not surprising. You hate him, because he's doing himself (being a good person), physically and emotionally. Will work nice.
