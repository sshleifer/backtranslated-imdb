I watched this movie at the 2005 Palm Springs International Festival, and I would see that there were 14 of these films I would number 4. 900+ theater was full and eventually received ovation. If you were a fan of Falk, classic Peter Falk, they showed a great deal of chemistry between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser. The title of the movie is long and very curious. I'm surprised, this was not released in general. It is much better than most garbage spoons that big students. It may be more mature to baby boomers and senior audiences. Many people may be linked to the situations in this movie. This will surely enjoy the fact that when cinema is recovering the cinema, it is a curious idea. 8.0 and 8.5 would value 10 scale and I would definitely recommend it.
