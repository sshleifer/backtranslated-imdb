XX. This superb black Fox in the Middle Century is a maze of despair of the metropolis, where calves and prey survive together. Surprisingly landscaped by the city, the bins of mankind lay below the dark expressionist symbolism. <br /> <br /> A prostitute caught her bag in the subway. It has a microfilm and a communist spy will recover. Two parallel research extends as spies and police capture coveted information. <br /> <br /> Pickpocket against hero Skip McCoy Richard Widmark plays a dull warranty. The police are aware of their equality and lower intellectuals, and so it is wrong: "Go ahead," says Dan Tiger captain (Murvyn Vye), "the unification of the load. You have done it later. You've done it before." In this brave world, police in the streets It's just a group. Cute Candy slows down as Lightning Louie's head, so the police are paying for pigeons coming out of the effort. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that when it was early that age with Widmark. . The 39-year-old star, when Fox's contract ended, jumped out of miscreant when McCoy jumped. Today, perhaps, it is not acceptable to puncture the romantic line into unconsciousness in love and then revive its beer on the face, but the tradition of that period has been hard pressed. br /> <br /> Candy Peters is as bright as Jean Peters. Here, in the middle of the five-year explosion of the B-movie, it's lovely and it's a punch with the golden heart. It is the victim of the story, the martyrs of its beauty in any other way. It means good, but cynically men are constantly manipulating it - Joey, Skip and the police. <br /> <br /> <br /> The real protagonist of this movie is New York. Because the vast panoramic city and metro station is a city's claustrophobic force, it is an intense and evil force. Cheese rotting like cheese, human figures cross the city's paths. Lifts, metro tournaments, sidewalks - braiding men also ruin humanity's corruption flux. People retain any high-security niche: Moe has an unhealthy room rented, jumped into a hollow cottage on the Hudson River. As characters move and interact, they are placed in the background of the bridge architecture or the belts, or are divided according to the hanging distribution of the winch. The city's identity is constantly imposing. The angle and cross of the ship's timber are echoed by the grid street plan, and the cabinets of direct card cabinets mimic the image of the Manhattan line. If Joey's departure from outside the subway is forbidden, it's like the mischievous steel city is attacking him. <br /> <br /> The amazing proportion of that film is approaching extreme. The character drives the plot as needed, and the foreground is used to increase the character. When Skip asks Candy, proximity captures sexual energy between them, because it has an ignorance of the words of Skip. The beauty of Jean Peters is clearly painted, in a smooth and magnificent spotlight. The device is also used to increase voltage. The sequence of openings, pockets, has no conversations: the drama is fully approaching its powerful effect. <br /> <br /> People on snoopers and snoopers snoopers populate the movie. Moe (Thelma Ritter) is an informational way of life, and her place is allowed in hierarchy, even her victims. When he's skipped, he's "supposed to eat," he's making a repetition. Likewise, lamb chops or yolks from the "pieces" collection in New York comprise information on the traffic information underground. <br /> <br /> And yet, chairs are better than Joey and his communist friends. Joey's Moeen's bed bed symbolizes the violation of the basic moral code. Joey is pale. Moe will not market with Joey, even though he has saved his life: "... we must also draw on our business crime somewhere." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Cold War was held in the depths of "collection". When Richard Nixon was nominated as the only presidential candidate of the Republicans, he renamed his name Alger Hiss - a false communist microfilm. McCarthy's research trials were a reality today. The police in the movie could see the police "traitors who gave Stalin a bomb". <br /> <br /> New York is seen as a giant receptacle, which kills, complains and kills the human kidneys. The container consists of a leitotx in the whole movie. Moe carries her box of boxes of brands, and the candy bag, the microfilm container, is a plot engine. Skip maintains one of his only goods under the water box, which symbolizes his street wisdom secret. The dead coffin, which descends to Hudson in a bargain, is more than a load, ships that are shifted around the evil metropolis. <br /> <br /> It is a masterpiece of the composition of the film. Candy discovers that he leaps over the raised cabin passage, showing his moral rise. When the gun is placed on the table, the extreme view looks bigger than Candy - it starts to pity violence at the gap. The lovers are immersed in the shadow of the whirlwind, their love is not absolute or absolute, it reminds us, but it will depend on the whims of the malicious city. The communist Enyard is a shadow of a wall, or cigar is a wrinkle. The litter is just like the single alley, a ghost of nightfall. We are constantly trapped in our metropolis from the camera drawings from taxi shirts, kiosks and hospital bedside bars. We are mulch of civilization.
