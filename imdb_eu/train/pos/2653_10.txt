Kubrick once again demonstrated his brilliance in a Stephen King-based horror movie. Jack Torrance, aged 40, is married to the child, and has problems and alcoholism. The Colorado Overlook Hotel is in winter due to the extreme weather conditions, and in five months there is a well-paid care facility; and Torrance, who wanted to become a writer, found the perfect one. But the director warned Torrance on Saturday in this place that could be dangerous, and told some of the past doctors that he was mad and killed his family. Prior to his arrival, his son, Danny, has a shining imaginative who will light up in the future, knew that this place was not good and he did not want to go. After installing the hotel, things started well, but in a matter of months, Jack started angry, angry and depressed. At this time, we know that something will happen, but I do not know when and how. Scary things happen, for example, when two twin girls talk to Danny and violently attack someone. They are not only in this place. Later, Jack started to see other people and immediately felt next to them as if they were his family; Among them, Delbert Grady, the famous psychic guard. Grady told Torrance that he should kill his family because he is "strangers" in the hotel. In order to offer this request, Jack was one of the worst things I've ever seen and the one I've ever seen here. The end is spectacular and the viewers are interested and surprised until the last minute.
