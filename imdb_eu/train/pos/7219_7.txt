Tinseltown-in HELLO, DOLLY! With respect to the release, Jay Presson Allen's adaptation of the successful Broadway thriller of Ira Levin could not wait to put an apparent closure on the silver screen, so the wise producer decided to take a long time. White Way Run! The opening and closing scenes of the film are shot at the intimate New York Music Box Theater, where DEATHTRAP played for almost five years. In the theater folder, the latest leaks are also a version of the famous theater's logo. (Even if marketers decided to make Rubik's Cube icon more for the movies.) <br /> <br /> Now, in a low-cost DVD book, DEATHTRAP seems as fresh and more astonishing. The cast is appropriate (better than the theater opposite) and the researcher positions should be applauded for our house, finding a house suitable for making a "two-room thriller". An exciting, simple and innovative way, Sidney's director opened. Lumet marks the beginning and end of the new "new" material written reasonably and leaves Levin's iniquity only in the middle. <br /> <br /> The final scene of the film is one of the leading table in the Hollywood table, and slightly weakening Levin's drawing emphasizes in the previous film [Helga (about a dagger): "Another woman will play." In Robert Altman's "THE PLAYER" mode, however, thanks to our new ending, the film helps to fold itself and fading the stage, screen and (perhaps not) real life!
