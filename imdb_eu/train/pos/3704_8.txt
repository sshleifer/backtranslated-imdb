In general, it is difficult to cut and paste those films. Some segments may be quite good while others reduce the overall rating of the product. In this, for example, the medical scene at the office was very exciting ... one of the best (limited) viewers in this history. Then, there is an Asian segment ... the lady is always entertaining. The whole story that connects together was an interesting concept. The swap scene that closes the offer is not bad either. Technically, the production values ​​are quite high. Recommended.
