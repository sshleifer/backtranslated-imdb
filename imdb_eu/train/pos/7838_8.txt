If you are a fan of T-Rex / Marc Bolan, we recommend that you see it. With Marc Bolan and Ringo Starr, he shows some of the extravagant features that seem to be a good time for some of the pieces that are not part of the concert, but seeing it is very funny, making sense to make them known. Only people, and when the concert plays a talented musician, this toy and professional is shuffled and the girl screams. At that concert, you never knew that being a rock star was a job, but we had a good time playing with some of the best songs, featuring Elton John and Ringo Starr live performances. Actually, there are some songs that I want to see there, but it can not be like any album. I bought it in 2006, but if I wanted to know it in 1972, I would definitely buy it. It was sad and strange that a man who had so many songs about car loves never learns to drive and he would die in a car accident!
