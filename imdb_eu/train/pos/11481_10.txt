Friends of Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare a war against their friends and organize a massive high school attack. When the deadly change begins with its latest revenge, the videos start a diary to explain their feelings and chronicle their role. <br /> <br /> There is another movie called "Elephant". Why do I bring this? Compare two movies, of course. I have to say, though I liked "Elephant", this is a much better movie. What's the difference, you ask? For beginners, this shot is different, called "Cloverfield", in line with the "Blair Witch Project" and "Diary of the Dead". This is a better film because it is much more realistic. <br /> <br /> But they made me win the movie to show "the story to the other side". You know these two shots, unlike "Elephant". I really took care of the tyrants and understand their actions and why they did. This movie makes you feel happy with these people and that's good because it does not always white. <br /> <br /> To be honest, that's why I cried in this movie. True characters for logic and reasons. You understand There is no one who wants to pay attention to the people. In general, this film is emotionally hard and very attractive and is much better than "Elephant".
