This movie is great. He is back in the 40s and fights Meg Ryan's "intelligent" character. Plus Tim Robbins is so nice in this movie. And everything about it has a magical feeling. Every time I see it, I feel happy. Definitely the girl is a movie, and I'm a girl, so I like it. I love music The violin is wonderful. But I also think it's a nice story and everyone should see it.
