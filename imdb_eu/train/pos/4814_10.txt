I saw it on the big screen and it was embedded with it. The era of the younger years of the queen is a mystery, and this is a great description of how young girls describe one of the biggest roles in the world. <br /> <br /> The script is perfect, the play is amazing. The history and attention to detail is out of this world. Emily Blunt Victoria is great. It's fun as his mother plays Elizabeth 1 and William IV plays Prince Albert! (Think Blackadder). <br /> <br /> This portrait of Victoria shows that she was a rebellious young woman, I'm sure she might have been around at Jeremey Kyle Show: "My mom and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life." <br /> <br /> <br /> A great part of British perfect and Commonwealth history.
