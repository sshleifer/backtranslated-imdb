This is one of my favorite kung-fu movies and at the end of the 70's is one of the most popular Shaw Brothers. Plots are interesting and twisted, each character cools their style - apon, serpent, lizard, and so on. Action is limited to other Chang Cheh / Venoms films, but it's interesting with different kung-fu styles. display from different characters. I would recommend that all Shaw Brothers in Chang Cheh's films are the same, most of the films focus on the 10 Tiger and Shaolin vs. Manchu conflicts. This movie is breathtaking fresh air.
