Uggh! I'm not really impressed by this film, although I have to admit that it has been technically done. It achieves 7 high production values, but in terms of entertainment, it is poor. I think it's the worst movie of the fifties. He won the Oscar for Best Picture, but in some of the movies, it is boring to do dances and dances and dances. That is why, unlike many music tracks, such as MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, with strong story and theater, this movie is almost dance and singing. In fact, this film has the longest number of songs and dances in history, and if you're not there, the movie gets bored quickly. Give me another story! As a result, as production numbers and a weak story, this movie is like a steady-state syringe: it's not satisfying in the long run. <br /> <br /> Let's think ... this is the best picture of "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun"! And, even worse, "The African Queen" and "Ace in the Hole" were not even nominated in this category! Even more surprising to me, he lost the script for the best writer Ace in the Hole for almost all the "Parisian" American films and almost danced and danced by the songs.
