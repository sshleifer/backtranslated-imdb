I've seen the actor ScareCrow I've never had the funniest Killers! Also, he's really turning around when he jumped most of the time, this was so wonderful! He also told me he had a great voice, it was perfect for him. Stories were also great. I like the children's soul that I like ScareCrow. I like it! Besides, I had to kill him, I mean, after what people had done ... I'd be angry! ScareCrows looks good! his appearance to this person "OMG!" he gives it when they see the reaction! What was horrible was stares that were fun! These people were stupid, looking for a long time! They had to look at them and flee to themselves ... even though this would not be a difference!
