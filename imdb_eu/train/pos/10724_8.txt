This feels good on Saturdays afternoon movies. There are other motorized flights, such as the Flight of the Navigator retro. The worst thing to do is to justify a movie with a fine comedy. And it's funny how the stars have been making stars for stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson for 20 years. Joquin Phoenix without mentioning. <br /> <br /> Personally I like movies like this from time to time. Nothing is too deep or scary. It's just a nice story. And I would never have known that Mr. Phoenix had not read much of the credits. She only made a baby when she made this movie. <br /> <br /> Then Kelly Preston was a young actress. She and Lea did a great job in this movie. I agree that it is not an Oscar movie movie. But it's worth watching. Especially for children of 8 to 11 years old. Or those interested in the space program.
