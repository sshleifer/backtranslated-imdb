Life Begins is a wonderful pre-code movie of some of the best. It is located in the maternity room of the hospital, especially in the women's room. She is an elderly woman, a hard-flameless mother (Glenda Farrell), a young, humbling woman, an Italian woman, and the main character (Loretta Young), who is being imprisoned for 20 years in prison. Her husband (Eric Linden) is in the hospital every second year to find out what's fine. Aline MacMahone plays a nurse with her work. <br /> <br /> This film is very interesting and entertaining. In any case, it is not a huge blow, but it's interesting to see it as neglected on a silver screen. The play is excellent around. Loretta Young is wonderful here. Eric Linden is out of nowhere and honest. His innocence reminds Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is always good as precoats and basic reasons.
