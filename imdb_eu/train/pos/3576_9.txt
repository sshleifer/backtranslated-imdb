Honestly, this movie seems to me to be very sad for my abuse. It's very slow to almost the finish line. I do not want to justify ways to justify any character I do not want (well, except Fredrick Forrest's favorite character). However, it is still so frustrating that people are watching this way. In a nutshell, they surrounded the walls, they just made a word to frighten ice and cure it. <br /> <br /> An immense tragedy is a Montana family. They think they have lost a child, but they lose it. They are lost. The key is that if they just communicate and face their pain, they will not lose their second son definitely. <br /> But they can not. It's something that family can afford to share their torments. Some families retire silence and resentment, while others are guilty of their being guilty (and then their poor wives are cheating on the deceased beautifully seducing the deceased girlfriend ... Andy's a character is really a snake!) A family that does not threaten Arnold, a grandfather (Wilford Brimley) gives. His father feels that he is not able to talk with the boy, even if the children are also gloves. It seems that the child is thinking about it, even though he does not say much at this time. It is truly a blessing to have someone who can give someone a poor child. No one understands that Arnold's reluctance, denial, or misrepresentation would not have the same style or speed to be the same. It's very easy to be judged and angry, and because someone feels that they're "made up of stones" because they only feel that they are not disturbed. <br /> <br /> The story is very calm and naturalistic. You do not get a spoiled narrative or a good Hollywood appraisal. I was very worried that the child felt so embarrassed that he felt he needed a hundred kilometers to drive his wife to Andy's pigment. Arnold unexpectedly killed his brother, but no one was responsible for the end of that marriage; however, he was unhappy, however, except for two married couples. Arnold does not luck in the car with a pedophile or killer car. <br /> <br /> Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are frustratingly effective, somehow like parents who can not communicate with their son. , To find out what Arnold is doing. Jason Presson, I did not see anywhere else except his favorite childhood EXPLORERS, and a terrific ghostly story called THE LADY IN WHITE, Arnold did an excellent job, a great performance for a child actor. <br /> <br /> Being a slow man, THE STONE BOY is an excellent movie that is very depressing.
