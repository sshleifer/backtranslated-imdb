myself and 2 sisters have seen all Tenko 3 series and I agree that this is a better BBC series. Everyone was surely portrayed in the sections and the 3rd series was slower, it was compelling in my afternoon. Certainly, it would be the same. Without a doubt, we will see it again, because it is a series that I never want to see. Good visibility and brand-name series for BBC and excellent smelting. In all the first sections. and we recommend the series to anyone, even if age limits are considered material for adults. Thanks to BBC for this series on DVD and Video.
