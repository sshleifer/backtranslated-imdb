The HK movie is very strange in many ways. First of all, many action sequences are not really fun. The first gun in the film was just a stupid battle. It's not a fool, or stupid, but stupid. This does not mean that there are no great scenes of action, but most of all I do not see at the level of other films I have seen. On the contrary, this film is not only for people, but also for the people. The main characters are very interesting (bad head, except as flat as a billiard table) and most of them work quite well. Watching the stars of this film is very funny. The conversation is quite fun and it does not seem like a lot of money back. This movie is worth seeing, but I hope the Americans do not believe the best offered by HK.
