This is undoubtedly one of Jet's greatest efforts. Few actors act tightly like Jet Li. The action is fast and the special effects are driven by intensity purposes. As a result, Americans can take a little guard. A small break in credibility is in the mood of Jet Li. I think Jet is an excellent entry and we hope to see the masterpieces (especially the Legend Fist) in the US market. The pleasant mix of physical conflicts and conflicts is one of the most passionate action they love.
