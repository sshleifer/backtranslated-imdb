After You've Got Mail and after feeling disappointed, I decided to see the original store that inspired this, The Shop Around the Corner. I was surprised by this movie. It is a real treasure and one of the favorite movies of the moment. The performance is so perfect, the story is so beautiful, if you have not seen it, I ask you to see it today. I'm not playing back again and sometimes I like the new version more than the original, but this time you have to admit that Mail Got you is not a bad adaptation of this classic. Do not miss it, go to your video store and rent it around Shop around!
