Starting in 1988, I first saw "The Ronnie and Nancy Show" (Austrian television). At that time, he was already a fan of Spitting Image (since he won the Montreux Film Festival's bronze rose in 1986). Of course, I recorded all the shows of the tape and I saw it again and again - especially "The Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember that scene when Ronnie was in front of a painting by Abraham Lincoln (thinking he was a mirror) and he told himself "I need a beard". Or more fun, when his dog played the ball - but vice versa! <br /> <br /> It's a shame, It seems the image image is forgotten; It was one of the most fascinating and intelligent television shows ever made. Compared to other satirical broadcasts, it was all the best. <br /> <br /> Since then almost 20 years have passed and I can see it again. Is it possible to buy somebody somewhere?
