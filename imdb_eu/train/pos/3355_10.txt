May 1938 Hitler Italian. Preparations for historical events with Mussolini. Emotions, tensions and self-assertion. an empty town, housewife and journalist. Meeting of two different worlds. The refuge of a mother with a sad life. Classic victim's short filling. A story about loneliness and silence. The desire for a different life and shape. Great character, a springtime book. This film is a poem that highlights the art to describe the tone of the loneliness. A bet for an ineffable relationship with reality. And with your interior. The photos of Il Duce, the wickedness of Antonietta, the patience and weakness of Gabriele, the director's art, the two protagonists of two great actors, this film is sublime, with an amazing hypocrisy and a brilliant movie. arbitrary judgment, about the essence of life and the denial of tyranny. Loren and Mastroianni are great actors. Lightwork
