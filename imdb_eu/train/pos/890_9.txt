This is an excellent film by Sammo Hung. Actually, this is a great part of Hong Kong's action movie. The story tells the story of a guided tour of Maca's peddler in search of love and confusion. The performances are excellent and the characters are well-liked and well-defined. It involves the story and suffers enough romance, theater, comedy and suspension with a fight between scenes. Sammo Hung demonstrates that here is probably the best choreography of business. The action is simply amazing. Lau Kar Leung's fight and end. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are amazing. Any necessary action for fans.
