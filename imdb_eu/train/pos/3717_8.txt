I only remember when I saw Napoleon Dynamite with Cracker Bag. It's just a beautiful feeling and, nevertheless, it never hurts. There is a huge cinematography and a great girl. It takes more than the nostalgia of time. He has a real heart. The baby's baby is elegant and painful. A simple story is always effective when it's done. Glendyn Ivin has a great future and, for me, I am looking for the next project. Tracking is always the most difficult thing. For many people it's like the second album blues. <br /> <br /> I hope that his next movie is not like a shark movie. Cheer up all Enjoy the movie.
