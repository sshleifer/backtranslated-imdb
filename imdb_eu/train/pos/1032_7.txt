A message film, but pretty good. Throw high, upside down. It's interesting that Bette Davis's line line is basically going back! Very negative reviews (names of the script / playwright, in other words, linking comments about 'Angles in America', etc., etc. Etc.) The film's preaching to the whole of Germany around World War II. Sadly, this is too sophisticated, for me to understand morality. <br /> <br /> Theater and movies, and plays vary over time, and, of course, 70 years later, there was no such movie. that way. Yes Casablanca is a better film (I think), but despite the fact that they were both the same year and both of them with the Nazis, Casablanca is a love story. The love story of this movie takes the second seat in the spy plot - a thriller. Both are actors with tasty accents and wonderful characters. Kids are boring and can be edited
