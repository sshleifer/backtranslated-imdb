This erotic thriller with low budget features good points, but a bad thing. The land accused a woman who was trying to clean a lover around a woman lawyer who was trying to kill her. Have a soft-core movie, hidden in a hidden chatroom and become a suspect. Plots go to this type of genre, not bad. The script is okay, and the story makes it quite sensible for anyone watching it from 2 onwards, this will not make you feel too much excitement. But everything else in the movie seems cheap. The actors are not bad, but all the helpers are bad (it seems that a girl drinks and / or high). Cinematography is badly lit and everything looks bitter and ugly. The sound is so great that what people are saying is what you hear. The worst thing in this movie is why you see sex. Because of these reasons, people in Red Shoe Diary have very hot girls. The sex scenes are not hot, they are noisy and they're filmed in film style, it's just the main shot in two-person games. Women also seem to be a hospice for pornography. I do not know how to be dirty or here, but they all have breast implants and a burnt-out / retired look. Although the title "Deviant Obsession" feels like a hardcore movie. I do not have a pornographic one - I really love it. But I want my soft-core and my hard-core. What happened to Shannon Tweed, actors like Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Who could act and who would turn you on? And what happened to B thriller thriller like body chemistry, eighteen and even stripped to Kill. Of course, none of them masterpieces, but at least made them feel like movies. They also encouraged letters beyond Hollywood, sex, sex, obsessions and rejection. Now hard-core movies only have hard-core sex.
