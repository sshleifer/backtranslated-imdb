Does Vincent Cassel play Paul's role, a section assigned to a job secretary who has found a secretary written by Carla, who wants a deaf person when they have no hearing? when not (played by Emmanuelle Devos). They help each other together as a person to develop. <br /> <br /> The complexity of the characters that were particularly interesting about that movie? There is no stereotype in obvious adaptation. Paul appears uncomfortable in the office environment, is it just not cut off the job? This belief is eliminated when he gets a job at a bar. <br /> <br /> The film has a certain love that seems refreshing to me and proves how easy it is to perform criminal behavior, although it is not harmful or justified. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a feature full of stunning and humorous moments. When one carla is in the kindergarten and is trying to buy a baby scream. Does he continue to do it? But he listens to his hearing aids for his comfort.
