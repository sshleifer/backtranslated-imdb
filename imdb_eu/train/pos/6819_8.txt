I found the Fun and Stimulating Time At The Top. The operation, though not brilliant in general, was very acceptable and sometimes good. As a film aimed at youngsters more demographically, there is no doubt that the genre's work is better (Children's Sci-Fi). Normally, I would say that Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia have produced best movies and television shows for kids, and 'Time At The Top' is not discounted! I do not think continuity and good practice is important for young people. A good land and imaginary script are very important for them. Both are very much in this film. Special effects are good, without depressing the story, or closing the audience's imagination. It was difficult to inject the excessive load of SFX into this movie, but it would have completely destroyed his entire 'Raison D'etre'. <br /> <br /> The camera settings and works have a very high standard in this film, and to create a fine wardrobe and historical accuracy. In general, this film is very encouraging, and I recommend to all audiences who can see the world through children's eyes, or with me! Now, I have to read the original book as soon as possible.
