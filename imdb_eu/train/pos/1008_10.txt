During the fourth season, I joined this excellent program and since then, I have watched all parts of the DVD episodes, and they continue to improve and improve with 9 and 10 seasons. With Ben Browder and Claudie Black, the show has gained more strength and originality, even after 10 seasons. Unfortunately, this science-fiction channel today has stirred up an unforgettable show for 11 seasons, two live DVDs, and we hope to get more out. Atlantis is still strong in its fourth season. Stargate franchise is by no means a third spin off of the dead. This TV series is a must-have for science-fiction fans and people because it has a lot of attractions for all ages and people of all kinds. IT IT !!!!! 10/10
