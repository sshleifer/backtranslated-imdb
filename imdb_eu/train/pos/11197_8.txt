Hitchcock's silent film, a triangle of love, not a mystery, but very English, very pace and photos. Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) hires a boxer-like "One Round" boxer Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) to be a pair of sparring to keep Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis) nice and very versatile. There are many actors and grotesque characters of Jack and Mabel, who are standing upright on the side of the church, seeing tall and very short men, strange ladies, conjugated twins. Of course, discuss what a side-by-side seat is, and it's a fun wedding party. The rest of the film, Jack has lost a path to returning to Mabel and his heart. It was totally another era, evening dresses with the audience, and even boxers to dress up when leaving the ring. Camera angles, rhythm, use of symbols, cutting - very exquisite and masterpieces. The camera's work and the latest boxing edition are very hard. He uses Brisson's good looks; His smile is not so happy about him, because he is in Hitchcock's Manxman, so it's not annoying. But can boxers blur?
