Jane Austen would definitely accept this one! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow makes a wonderful job capturing Emma's attitude. It is fun to be very absurd, but elegant. He places a very credible British accent (British is not myself, maybe I'm not the best judge, but he deceived me ... it was also an excellent "slippery door" ... I've forgotten the American one!). <br /> <br /> Shining brightly are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (Emma Thompson's sister and mother) Bates as a woman. The show has almost been stolen and Mrs. Laws has no line! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
