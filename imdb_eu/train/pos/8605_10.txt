Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy are the stars of modern musician who shows MacDonald's comic abilities. 40s surreal music seems to be making a fun 40s way in the current fashion. Eye-shaped outfits and sets (both B & W) thanks to the surrealist film. Many good songs animate the movie, "Twinkle in Your Eye" with all the numbers, including the fun jitterbug between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Likewise, throughout the HOUSING, there are Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys. In Extended Bit sections you can also see Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many others. <br /> <br /> Very fun and enjoyable to see the wonderful MacDonald. In her jitterbug / vamp habits. It can do everything.
