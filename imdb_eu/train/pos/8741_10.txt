Candy's "A Bug's Life" is a favorite. It has a lot of curious bits that add something very tasty. <br /> <br /> The story could not be better; It's fast, it has "heart" (emotion), and all the characters have a "nice" "bow" (growth or change). Comparing the unique characters called "Toy Story", Buzz is the "arc" that loves being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes Buzz's resentment. There are hilarious and hilarious moments in "A Bug's Life". All actors activate voice activation, and the animation, both movement and details, are great. <br /> <br /> This serious filmmaker does not throw light "10" on it, but I'm definitely worth the money "10".
