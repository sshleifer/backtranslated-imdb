One of the most terrifying geriatric illnesses in today's age is this film that explores this film. As with the potential of Alzheimer's or those with families that are in educational stages, I would suggest that each healthcare worker recommend this film to any family that is suffering from the trauma of this illness. The film mainly talks with the patient's family and enters the heart of the fight. The casting is excellent and dramatic portraiture with a very commanding line.
