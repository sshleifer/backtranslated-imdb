Being an old school year, and almost four years after studying Shakespeare (which is very good for any writer, how good I was), I did not expect this English teacher to enjoy this movie; I thought it would be a typical movie of the students: a bad performance, a terrific shot, a badly edited and terrifying debut, so you could say that I was ready before going to bed. However, I saw it and, in the face of my disturbances, I found much attention, but I also enjoyed the movie. Hamlet's production is one of the best drama dramas I've ever seen and looks much better than Shakespeare's own theater (I mean, as with cinema inequality). Perhaps my English teacher was working on text. The story is good, the conversation is suddenly bored (although it's a bit tough to use if you're not using Shakespeare's language) and even the smallest part would have the ability to do it. do not expect; above all, maybe because of the surprising amount of cameo with this film. Brian Blessed and Charlton Heston are both great expectants of these veterans, even in small pieces, but Robin Williams Osric and Billy Crystal really stand out as Graffigger, giving an unexpected flavor to small parties. , as well as offering a comical relief between the tragedy. <br /> <br /> The main stars, of course, are also wonderful. Kenneth Branagh highlights Hamlet, asks for confusion and pain in the roll, but also sardonic air, which makes the comic scene more and more visible in the film as a whole. Other major players are also good, but Kenneth Branagh is the head and shoulders the rest above the title role. <br /> <br /> The pieces set are also very surprising, giving them a refreshing change. In Shakespeare's productions we have seen the drifty corridors of old castles, as well as the true sense of the surrounding town. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie, taken as a film on its own. It's not a mistake, but not the main one (the intermediate way of thinking is the only real problem, as well as what I have said, Shakespeare's language), and, above all, a similar Shakespeare productions, as well as being able to see it as excellent. Even though I think about Shakespeare's adolescent adolescents, its a boring theater (I have concluded that there are no plays, only teachers who recite classes). If all their plays have been made in these films, English-speaking students can have a great opinion on Bard. <br /> <br /> Generally 7/10
