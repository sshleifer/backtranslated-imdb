I watched 25 years ago on the British TV movie and I saw it again in the last week on a ebay DVD copy. I recalled the music sequences, the color and the fashion fashions and the clothes, but the plot is much weaker than the previous Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding, Spring Park Parks and Maytime has not been so successful in recent years. But Michael Wilding is the joy of the movie, charming, funny, debonair, very funny and on its shape. She only looked worthy of him. Anna Neagle appeared matronly next to him, and part of what plays an old theater, but at the end of the 1940s, cinema collaboration was well established with public cinema. Park Lane won a great success in Spring in 1947 and earned money. In his autobiography, Wilding told Herbert Wilcox about the significance of the director of these films in London and the developer.
