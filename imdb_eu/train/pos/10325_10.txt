I was born in Doc Savage and petrified green deaths, but I found it as entertaining as it was now. I have made a lot of friends and colleagues in this film and I've seen a lot of reactions. I think, above all, that I'm odd, but there it is. "I do not know what the doctor is, but the girl always gets them" is the last line when looking at her sad group of men. This movie is a classic mistake about the genre of super heroes and it's time before, it's not to be taken seriously, it's over in Austin Powers. Ron Ely is God. It's unfortunate that this movie has not been published on DVD in the UK. I do not think it must be renewed and bastardized, as it is a classic, it can not be done without Ron (like Mini's and Michael Caine's Italian work). I give 10/10.
