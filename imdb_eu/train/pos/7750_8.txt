Barman directed Any Way the Wind Blows while singing a dEUS song. Anarchy regulates the logical and ordinary thinking thinking. The story of this movie is how far the wind blows. And that's really cool to see if you're ready, that's it. Storytellers are right for the audience to say anything they want. Who says Windman like that? However, I really liked this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful place, noisy and lively, and Any Way catches that feeling. Likewise, he speaks of the seemingly polite, racism, bureaucracy, dependence and violence that reveals itself in the city that is seemingly respected. The movie is fun, funny and not very clear. Barman's screening debut will not have much effect as a debut. Some of these lights may be disappointed. But then again, the "Worst Case scenario" would be subtle subtitle in any way to make wind blows.
