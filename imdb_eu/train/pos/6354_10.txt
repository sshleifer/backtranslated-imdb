Jim Carrey can do anything. I thought it would be a mute movie for children, and it was not. so funny to all, adults and children. Once I saw it was out of theaters, and now, at last, the DVD comes out on Tuesdays and I'm excited, as you can see. You should definitely see it, it was so great! <br /> <br /> Liz
