Ashanti is a 70s movie (in detail, 1979). The Wild Geese reminded me one way (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore in Africa). It's a very good movie and I really liked it. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Caine) is a medical doctor working in Africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman named Anansa (Beverley Johnson). He is also a medical and medical American. While practicing medicine, one of the slaves who work on a slave trader in Suleiman, one day, is caught (Peter Ustinov plays the role of the general public). The rest of the film is trying to recover David. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is an excellent actress, of course, and she decides to make something for her and a ready-made character. But they are unwanted with gun and action things. First and foremost, the Englishman has contributed against a slave trade campaign (Rex Harrison!) And then a short by a pilot helicopter (William Holden), then an Arab named Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has a score to set it up with Suleiman (she's very lively, a very entertaining character), so she walks with David to find Anansa and get him. The scene is wonderful, because David misses his mere camel. . <br /> <br /> Then there are many adventures. We doubt the morals. The progress of the story is somewhat predictable from this point, and there are some freedoms to move things faster, but everything is quite horny. The question is: Does David come to Anani to sell Peter Ostinov to Omar Sharif (yes, of course, Omar Sharif!)?
