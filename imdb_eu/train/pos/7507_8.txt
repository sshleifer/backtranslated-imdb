Greet again from darkness. The list of films that give Mary Heron a look at his specific age is quite large. His previous "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho" were the seriousness of the society in that era. Even though "The Notorious Bettie Page" writes to Mrs. Page, the 50s photo shoot is a peak in the world behind the curtain. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun to watch from the story's perspective, as well as the technical aspect of shooting and gathering. Pikodun B & W movies and photos take pictures of time and pictures through Miami Beach Bunny Yeager photos. <br /> <br /> David Strathairn is a powerful supporter (with his new Edward R). . Murrow role), Chris Bauer (Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The film's protagonist, Gretchen Mol, is very talented and underestimated. Mrs. Mol always works her role. The view was incredible, Jason Alexander directed "Just Looking" in 2000. Here, Bettie Page is popular. His smile is brilliant and his body is perfect. She seems to enjoy this mission and helps us understand that the little girl near the Tennesse is to become a world-class queen of pin-up. <br /> <br /> As expected, the sound of that era is terrific. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just great performers. Although the film has been dedicated to the history of this industry, the third part is struck by avoiding the magic of the movie. But Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page's magic make a great show, and in the near future they will give a great deal of HBO shows. Now someone will please Mol's star?
