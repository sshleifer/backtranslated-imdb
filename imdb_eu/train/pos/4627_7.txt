Do you want to put a play on the wall of prison why you are not the main playwright William Shakespeare? And if you choose to cast lots of criminals who do a lot of crime, you can be sure to get rid of the most dangerous crimes, there will be a lot of rehearsals. In a Kentucky Correctional Prison, such a daring project was performed with amazing results. This film shows how to do tests, rehearsals, costumes and the latest presentation of Shakespeare's "The Tempest". It did not happen to me before, but there is an analogy of theatrical theater and prison punishment. In play, shipwrecked characters are confined to an island that does not interact with the outside world. The life of Prison is also very similar. <br /> <br /> With a simple backdrop painted on the shores of the surrounding area, the characters with a nice set of clothes look at their lines to an admission audience, they might not be quite the same. Shakespeare's intention, but good heart and surely honest. <br /> <br /> The play was more interesting than every man behind his character. A prisoner saw forgiveness forgiveness for the sake of others for his sins. It was very emotional to see a man tear, kill, shoot, and wonder when he was surprised. They would like a feeling, however, that they would like the clock to go back and review their violent actions. However (as someone has said) the past passed, and today was the beginning of a new future. At least the play provoked disappointing thoughts of ancient performances. <br /> <br /> The prison authorities should apologize for the play. Such events would be placed on the Kentucky map and other prisons may continue their good example. It seems everyone is beneficial not only for the imprisonment of Kentucky, but also for prisoners who need to find trust and self-esteem and have been prepared for the day of parole.
