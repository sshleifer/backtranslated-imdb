When I saw that I had died when I saw the movie coming out on the verge, I thought the movie was a good soldier, and it was said that the male war was given. The language moves in a good pace, showing a group of men behind the enemy lines, and tries to return to its lines with an enemy prisoner. The characters are well developed and credible. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings is a good actress and believes that the protagonism, like Alan Dobie (like Helmut in Germany), I was impressed. Find out this movie on VHS or DVD, and I feel like it has become a forgotten movie, because it's sad, because I've exceeded the other war movie I've seen.
