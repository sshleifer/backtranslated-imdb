Compared to what Brian De Palma had to do with the entertainment of the 1980s, his films continue to look better and better. "Dressed To Kill," "Blow Out," "Body Double," "Scarface," and "Carlito's Way" are excellent works of a craftsmanship, while at the time of their powers, the guy was better than a feature film, which is Hitchcock's pure, perverted 80s Underground, affectionately told the story of lusting and murderous twists, a great help style, an amazing score Pino Donaggio, and trashy, giallo-inspired plot. Camera works and impressive blood flow help to overcome logical holes Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (good conductor ), Nancy Allen (wife of De Palma of the time) and Michael Caine, a special scene, let the virtual world take the surreal, horrifying and erotic odyssey, and enjoy all the "Dressed To Kill" frames.
