When I first saw Romeo Division, last year's reaction was BRILLIANT! However, in the future views I was much more than the mastery of the movie. This image has a special voicemail in the history of cinema ads. <br /> <br /> This initial installment offers an excellent palette for JP Sarro helmsman to use his art in the canvas of entertainment. <br /> Sarro camera is used as a brush in the form of a giant film that surrounds the audience and goes beyond the traditional format and the betrayal that goes into deep revenge. and the importance of support. This movie is a dream of any director on his axis. <br /> <br /> However, Sarro was not only in this epic engagement. Writing by writer Tim Sheridan was a unique handwriting. <br /> <br /> The conversation was so precise and correct that the actors presented their presence and charisma on the screen. Indeed, Vanesa writes the last scene that reveals the coalition and the wicked for a season (NOTE: SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!!) because it is one of the most coolest of the darkest tone. I see the endings. Sheridan Robert Towne is next. <br /> <br /> In a final note, it is clear that production is not bad. <br /> <br /> That's why it's a lot of praise for Scott Shipley. Create creativity and genius by Jerry Bruckheimer. I never had ever been so focused on all the details of a large production spot. The work of the producer is one of the toughest movies in any movie and Shipley is easy to look like. <br /> <br /> This movie combines totally creative writing, spectacular production and direct management. This is film art its best. When the end of the movie is reached, the only thing you want is more. <br /> <br /> Romeo Division is an innovative, masterpiece and, above all, Romeo Division, indeed art.
