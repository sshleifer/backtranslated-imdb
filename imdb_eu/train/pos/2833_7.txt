I saw the movie again after twenty-seven years. I was eleven years old and I caught South Beach's film at Washington Avenue Theater. In 1969 I thought where it is! The movie was very good. But now, after almost forty years, it's not as good. Time has changed, old film war between the generations is tired. However, memory was preserved in time, but a memory. It is really interesting that mod modes, old Vegas, Don Rickles thin, chain burning and a hip-opening song. The performance was decent, the script was obsolete but still fresh memories. Where is there, maybe it's not where you are, but for me, it's still a pleasant and entertaining trip down the memory lane down.
