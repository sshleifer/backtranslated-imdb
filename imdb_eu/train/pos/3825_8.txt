A young woman will come to her husband's house after an accident. In this little town it is hardly established, but shortly after, his little son loses all kidnapping and hope ... All this may be a normal plot: finding a new partner and being happy at last; or to fight with enough depression and eventually to kill himself ... He tries to kill himself, but not with a series of serious battles, with God. He trusts in God, God seems to forgive everyone, even the murderer. Well, I should be careful here about God, the movie does not mean God. The way in which the film's theme has been devised is interesting, not from the perspective of the woman or from the point of view of God (this would be a lot of grasses, I suppose that the clouds fly in perspective). But from the eyes of third-parties, we have noticed the movie and we do not explain. <br /> <br /> The film would not be so interesting as the woman. She is in love with this man who is around this woman, but in her own way. It's a guy, like a clown that I should have said, hanging around our hero's madman. The combination of these two, a woman full of tension, weeping and always throwing away, and the man, smiling and stupid, speaks of the good balance of emotions: nothing is wrong or boring. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
