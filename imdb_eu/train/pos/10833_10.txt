This film finally cried to me! I have watched at least 3-4 films a week. I've seen loads of big movies, even crap - even more. But when the scene is over - it's a charming nucleus - I've come to pray! And if you do not have serious problems! The story is archetypal, nothing new or original. But it's real, because things like this really happened and people really exist. Glam is not my type of music, but I admire it in the early 70's ... Sometimes it directed me to Velvet Goldmine! Dokudramak never worked well. But this movie really believed in the belief that everything ... because they do not try to go full of wonderful concerts, girls who are superheroes, musicians, stupid and emotionally confused. and alcohol will be recovered and recovered 20 years later ... An excellent movie again. Since leaving Las Vegas "since then" I have never been terrified by movies.
