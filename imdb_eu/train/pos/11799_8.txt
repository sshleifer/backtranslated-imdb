A good summary of a real event! Well, actually, I was not there, but I think it could be that way. I think that there are two American states in the film: "Communistophobia" and Adolf Hitler's parallelism. These should be obvious to most independent observers. However, Boothe makes a great performance, and many other well-known actors. The last twenty minutes in the film are overwhelming, and I mean! Then it is abnormal that you can sleep well. (That's why it's so horrible - everything happened, and it probably looked like it). But, actually, this last scene on the airstrip really happened?
