** Silent service ** <br /> <br /> First, let's say Rob Roy is the best movie in the 90s. The participation gained has been amazing, especially those of Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones painted a wonderful portrait of honor and imbalance for men to represent themselves. But oh! ... <br /> <br /> constantly, and gets it wrong with "Braveheart". Two films are quite different, probably in the history of Scotland, both Kurds. However, this comparison often strikes me, it seems that "Braveheart" is a better movie than "Rob Roy". I like the "Braveheart", but I'm somewhat overwhelming with the idea of ​​comparing "Rob Roy". I just love "Braveheart", but it's a pale shadow that I love how "Rob Roy" is. Here are my special reasons ... <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is about real people. <br /> <br /> Please, in William Wallace "Braveheart" is not a real person. . Myth is the legend It is higher than the head of life. For these images, it is also a perfect person, who never fails, and basically shows in the ground prescribed by his Scotta people. When it finally fails, it's not his fault. Like Jesus, he betrays the people he most trusts. The worst kind of torture also makes freedom because he wants so much. <br /> <br /> Wallace's image is very good and effective. But it really does not inspire me or enter. Human ambiguity is much more important than human perfection. That's why "The Last Hope of Christ" is a better movie than the Royal King, "I think Rob Roy is better than" Braveheart. "Rob Roy is heroic and courageous, but it's not perfect. He has made several mistakes the life of many of his beloved ones. Now, surely, the false claims against Argyll was a noble and courageous act, but also an act of selfishness and self-centeredness. Let us not forget to have forgotten that they had been backed by homeless guys for the end of the movie. She's the best she could do, and she could ask for it all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rob's Wife Mary is a normal person and an ambition. Let's start with what she looks like in this movie, It's beautiful, but it does not wear makeup and basically show its natural beauty. Compare this to William Wallace's "Braveheart" with two love (or your point of view). These woos are hot, but they are hardly aware that women look at it at the time (especially seculars). It may not be a fair comparison, but Rob Roy's accuracy accuracy is just one more effective example. <br /> <br /> Throughout "Rob Roy", Mary has to live with her lying life, with Cunningham. . Rob feels obligated to fight, but he does not know that Rob requires rape to get rape. However, this revenge means Rob's death and Mary is not ready for such a sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The criminals of "Rob Roy" are also credible. Although the "Braveheart" enemies are well-written, they are barely original. Robert the Bruce, a brave and cowardly man, is full of moral decisions in the fictional area. Should he take him as a Scottish king or should Wallace ask for the safety of his family name? Bruce is the brave character of "Braveheart", but Brutus's "Julius Ceasar" is called Fredo's "The Godfather Part II", these types of characters are almost original. Longshanks, despite his credulous evil, is a very dimensional one. It's an epidemic of evil and its tyrants have direct contrast to Wallace's heroism. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < First, start with the Marquis Montrose. He is a man obsessed with the image of himself, so that an innocent man suffers from it. "Look I'm not stupid" is their "factor" favorite words. Power is an obsessed man, angry, as a man of great nobility like the Duke of Argylle was considered more proud. Luckily, the car is obsessed and safe. The aristocrat is evil, but he gives it special. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cunningham and Callarn are the conspirators of "Rob Roy" . Callarn is so wicked that cowardice is almost comical. He will do anything to keep the good will of Mark. Cunningham is a credible character, seems to have raised everything he has done to get the affair and Mark's love. He needs dad, he knows little that the marquis is a real father. That's why the possibility of wealth comes from Callarn, without questioning it. The wickedness of the modern man is very similar, that he is so focused and lazy that he cares about the effects of his actions on others. <br /> <br /> Many have criticized Tim Roth's performance as an abuse. I say Hogwash. It's clear that Cunningham is not only an evil person, but rather a psychopathic movie. A world in which a man and his children can shoot random people, Cunningham is not terribly charged? People seem to have diminished the value of human life. "Rob Roy" only teaches us that only the circumstances of this reduced value have changed. In all human history, it is a serious problem that the vainity of the human heart will not be able to pity. Rob Roy and Mary give us hope to hope, but snakes will always be in our world. <br /> <br /> Another fascinating character is the Duke of Argyll. He is a true nobleman, whose values ​​of sincerity and kindness are directly in front of the Marquis. He appreciates the courage of Rob Roy and Mary and has a direct pain in Mark and his factor. The world gives power to hope. Fortunately, people like Marquis are an exception and not a rule. <br /> <br /> - The last twin "Rob Roy" is more exciting in the 10-scene battle of "Braveheart". <br /> </ p> <p> I am tired of saying that people are saying that "Braveheart" is a better movie because of the battle scenes. First of all, the battle scenes are almost original. From "Spartacus" to "Gladiator", Hollywood has had a long tradition of historical battles in Europe. "Braveheart" has the best performances that it plays ever better, but they suffer a major problem. These combat scenes have no context or freedom to fight for freedom. <br /> <br /> Now, do not be bad, it's not nearly all. In fact, there are probably 10 times more duel films, because there is a battle scene. But the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy is a beauty. It's one of the biggest scenes in the history of cinema. Explain why ... <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the fighting styles and the challenges of both characters describe their characters. Cunningham is real and dangerous, Rob Roy is strong and daring. Cunningham uses a fence sword, which Rob uses. Cunningham soon fights against sharp movements, while Roy's fighting style is more pronounced. <br /> <br /> The whole movie, the first half was deliberately slow and exciting in the second half. It is a powerful thing, and it is clear that Rob is an evil that has disturbed his whole world from breaking this threat. When Rob finally gets the key (literally and figuratively) it is one of the most important moments in film history. Rob has won, because he wants to live longer, and his homage is stronger than 10 Cunningham. The use of music is totally cold in the scene. The good against evil realities is stronger for me when I take out "FREEDOM!" To cry out But maybe that's just me. <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is more realistic than "Braveheart" <br /> <br /> I do not know that people like "Rob Roy" talked like aristocracy or writers, but I feel clearly an attempt to get their talk patterns out. Many people are bored with "Rob Roy" because they do not understand what they say. If this happens, read some Shakesphere, or place nearby titles. "Rob Roy" is one of the biggest films written in the 90s. Many of the conversations in this movie are clear, but maybe you need to watch the movie twice to understand. <br /> <br /> Interview with "Braveheart" is barely interesting. Of course, what do you expect when the main character is a Scotsman who plays an Australian? This is a legend, and there was clearly no attempt to get the talk out of that era. This movie is "Rob Roy" a few centuries ago, and now it's like people. So, many people like the reason. Today's audiences have become increasingly involved and do not want time or patience to understand the complex things. So, as with many epic films, villians see a famous English accent when heroes do not speak Basque in our American language. I'm sure, it's clear that Wallace is Scotish, but with Scotty with Star Trek and a couple of "Aye" sounds like a statement, Scots in this movie is part of a traditional Hollywood tradition. br /> <br /> So these descriptions prove that "Rob Roy" is a better film than "Braveheart"? Barely Although one thing proves, he shows he hardly knows that "Braveheart" is a better movie than "Rob Roy". Simply, it's a "Rob Roy" movie that is very close to today's world. "Braveheart" is a movie about an inspiring legend, almost realistic. You can decide to put better ... <br /> <br /> Grade - Score - 9
