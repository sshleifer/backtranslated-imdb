Special movie ... one of the best. Performance, screenplay, Quincy Jones score, cinematography, edition ... - wonderful. As most of the spectators know, this movie is based on the Truman Capote's book, through a bad book based on the famed killing of Kansas farm families (Clutters). I have never seen a movie that has made a true story into an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> All the actors are strong, but Dick and Perry are the killers and the police team. Scott Wilson, Dick Hickock is amazing. He will find me so charming, shy and compassionate, so charming, greedy, and compelling. As with Perry Smith, Robert Blake is very curious: lonely and at the same time empathy and cold blood. Who can fold these features into one single individual and buy them? He has done it, and it's great! A key point in the book is how to create a critical mass to create a critical mass to create a critical mass for these two sociopaths, creating a commitment to this foolish and nasty crime, and these two actors work well. Both were moments of their careers, but these performances are high marks, and it's time to play it. <br /> <br /> The police are wonderful. The leading researcher is John Forsythe, but three other detectives too. As opposed to current movie producers who feel like the superhuman police officers or foids needed to provide them, these are real flatfeet, working on the determination and capability of the case. It seems real I have never seen the police being so powerful in their veracity; and I've seen most of the classic criminals back. In that sense really one. <br /> <br /> WE ARE A PARTY SPOILER (this movie is unique, you already know what happened but I notice the record). <br /> <br /> Of course, the best scenes of crime shows and best films are interrogations - intellectual scripts between police and skeletons, Mano a Mano. This movie manages the best scenes of interrogation that you watch the movie manually. Check out Dick and Perry try to bluff their way through and slowly clarify, they do not know the police have goods on them. But the police have to prepare their own suspects to break their alleviates and confessions. This is one of the best performances you'll ever see. Think Glengarry Glen Ross without showboating. <br /> <br /> To return to the dread and horrific angle of this real story, ICB was shot in Clutter house, and I heard that Clutters had filmed movie students to give them a real feeling. It works These people seem decent and simple. The crime becomes so palpable and sad. <br /> <br /> I will stay here. It is not a sensitive film, but it is one of the best films ever made, and so special, it is a must-have for all filmmakers.
