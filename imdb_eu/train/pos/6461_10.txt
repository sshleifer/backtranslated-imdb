First of all, I was completely careful of the first lyricism of the film and then I was completely enchanted when the story was taking place and I was involved with excellent management. The characters were fully developed, more than life, but like people who live in anywhere in the world, in Sweden, Turkey or America, with all the credible human beings, weaknesses and nobility. Hollywood learned so much from this beautiful movie. This shows that there is no need to include all the small details behind each action, which shows the brightness and brilliance of the director's brightness! Thank you to Kay Pollak and great work for this great gift!
