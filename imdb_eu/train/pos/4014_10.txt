Anyone who can ever watch this movie spoiler (so it's not really a spoiler after all). When this movie was released, I remember some parts. It is located in a small village in the West, or in that town. It resembles ghost town with little people. Among them is the pair, whose wife is particularly bad. He leaves the man to die at the end of the film and leaves the village, but he must cross the desert. We do not know what happens, but before leaving for death, he shoots the man behind him and does not necessarily kill him and instead supplies the water. He is not aware that it will soon be thirsty. Mark Damon kills a couple of bugles in a fun boat - but I do not think of another story that is too much in mind. The rest of the movie I saw for the first time when I saw a woman who was an evil movie, who wants to be evil - can not compare it to the wise Snowwhite, which is easy to compare. He is very absorbent with the main western western characters.
