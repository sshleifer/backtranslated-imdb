I watched the episode 1 or 2 times when the show was originally in the air, but when I saw it in part 1 of Netflix I was also a fan. In 2 days I saw a similar series. :) I liked Gary Cole's character. First of all, it is disgraceful when you start to like the character ("These things have thousands of uses")! His character Andy Griffith and Charles Manson know Satanas know. It's charming, charismatic, proud and dangerous and I really mean "really." I want him when I grow up. Lucas Black is also great. Accents are also excellent. In any case, I think it was one of the best television shows and you see yourself.
