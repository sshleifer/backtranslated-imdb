It seems that this is the first short film by Shempen Stooges. (This overcomes many years with its previous upper case). But threesome's comedy is the best pace here. Apart from the scenes of live slapstick, there are others more subtle, but funny. See Larryk Shemp asked to look at the camera to get a picture. Or see the real object of Moe's astonishment: "Gentle Mahogany!" <br /> <br /> Emil Sitka is her most gorgeous goofiest. And the dog can be terrifying, but it's somehow fun. It seems frozen and confused with Stooges as "regular" in other characters. <br /> <br /> Shemp lovers is an indispensable episode. It did not disappoint
