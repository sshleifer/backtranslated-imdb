Midnight Cowboy knew me the only reason for AFI Critic's 100. Because he was there. The top 100 is not a very popular movie; In fact, to find a copy that I had to make a difficult look, I got a DVD version about half price. Surprisingly, it was rated M15 + only (unprocessed). <br /> <br /> I will note some doubtful review (a friendlier comment), so I will shorten it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There are many things I still do not understand in the film (I've seen twice), and it makes an emotionally confusing movie. <br /> <br /> Movies and performances were very good, and that's it. Being a memorable film is more than life-sized characters. The protagonist is Joe Buck, a cowboy from Texas, to become a prostitute male to New York. Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo finds himself in the monolith and, of course, he becomes a friend through ordinary trips. The film is interesting because the two characters are so different. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film did not develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo so that the viewers had real emotional connections. It's pretty sad and tragic. You probably already know what happens when reading reviews, but it's pretty clear from the start. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think films beautifully and poetically, studying their main issues. The deprivation of humanity (shows the darkness of the city's streets, which breaks down). Most of the movie characters are above the law (conman, giggolo.etc), but you can not help. Joe Buck is very friendly and so naive, but while Ratso was compassionate, we started to film. <br /> <br /> I think that the movie was so high that it was definitely very serious. its time At that time (and now) there was no typical movie (art house). Tired of film Western, Musical, and Theater at a time when Midnight Cowboy had a movie about the unusual issue. <br /> <br /> Personally, I have to say that I am very fond of the movie. The images transmitted the quality of dreams. I particularly like the scene of this holiday season, keep music, images, etc. so long after watching. However, I was lacking in emotion as a recreation movie (not my own movie style). It's just a tasting and an estimated movie, but an emotional action movie. <br /> <br /> Although I thought a bit about looking at this film, the characters and their reasons were quite interesting. Since I understand Flashback, Joe Buck has been sexually assaulted by his grandmother, although he still does not seem to be in the story. He is a lucky happy young man who takes away the darker memories. The religious connotations of the film are also awful. Some have suggested a homosexual relationship between Buck and Ratso, although I have not got any idea. In general, he addresses homosexuality in more than one conversation, and later in a meeting with a lonely old man, Joe Bucken, but has nothing to do with the main story. <br /> <br /> Without a technical point of view, one of the best films of the decade (it has been in the 60's for more than 70 decades) and the revolutionary about other films that dare to venture. It has a simple and sentimental story (hidden in harsh edges) the beauty of the film with strange and often psychedelic sequences.
