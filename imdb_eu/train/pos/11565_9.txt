SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell best people". In "The Odd Couple" section, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau prove their exact nature. Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison make two good friends who decide to live together with Lemmon and Mattha. Both begin to grow slowly in each other, the laughter becomes thick and fast, before Felix leaves, Oscar changes and cleans herself. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon, Ungarre, is a superb neurotic, an obsessed divorced obsessed, as a single man as a single life. Compared to the character of Walter Matthau Lemmon, he is a good slobbish writer, as he wants to make money for his children's benefits. <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau are excellent in some of the selected parts, some for Neil Simon's beautiful screenplay, and at the same time they work well. Like two friends of a particularly different kind of life, even though older women and their relationships with children are similar, two great actors, at the same time, create a partnership for regeneration. It was so great that the world was screaming so much, that Matthau had killed two years earlier before Lemmon's death, the characters gathered in a sequel below. Following this strict obsession with Hollywood tracking, this idea could have worked somehow, but at the same time could never repeat the genius of the original film. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's not really possible to say something else. With Simon's legendary script, full of humor and laughter, the creators of this movie had a great success. The films by Felix Lundon and Walter Matthau, Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, are the most important part of this film. "The Odd Couple", with a traditional soundtrack (in honor of "The Simpsons"), is an excellent screenplay and a leading male, a movie tribute and a memory history.
