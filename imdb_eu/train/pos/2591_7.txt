It's a nice and funny tie that has two very different brothers and sisters who are not called "the beginning of the fire" (think of Stephen King's snore party in a book of the same name), but also always together with another woman. It's a bad habit of being a pyromania! Good special effects (especially in the end), excellent performances with talented actors and a truly interesting and bizarre soundtrack, you can finally see a movie "Wilder Napalm" ... if you can find it ... from! In my personal note, I was fortunate (in other words) from a two-dollar store in my local video rental store. (*** outside *****)
