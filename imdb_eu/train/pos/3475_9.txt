As well as being a Beatleman, I combined both Fear and fascination with Two Of Us. After watching "In His Life: The John Lennon Story, I was pretty worried. Two Of Us would not have any better. Aidan Quinn and Jared Harris do not see anything like John Lennon and Paul McCartney? also with make-up and hair suitable? He did not help a little. <br /> <br /> But I was surprised. Probably, Michael Lindsay-Hogg, was the director of Let It Be in 1970, and it was probably his involvement with John and Paul, who persuaded the characters and interviews. (The two credits of the writer are given to a man named Mark Stanfield. I do not know anything, so I think Lindsay-Hogg has more than one scriptwriter.) Two Of Us is not one. Beatles biography; It has a small farm, and it's one day in New York. What he does to imagine a meeting between John and Paul in 1976, while he was living in New York. This meeting is absolutely fictional, of course? although it can not really be reminded that this meeting really happened. But, through this imagined dialogue, it tells us the personalities of these great musicians? their intelligence, humor, a different reaction to the star's existence and their relationship; What they did was a great group, and they broke them. <br /> <br /> Because it's a talk movie, except for a dialogue between two and a half characters, it's probably true, but it's true that Beatles fans; but it is a wonderful storytelling and storytelling, as well as information and touch. For those of you who are interested in these giant musicians, will you get a quick look at how the actor looks different and that John and Paul live up to it? so intimate and convincing is the script, and so the actors are committed. Two Of Us offers you a great view of the life of two geniuses, as well as a sad and funny story. It is definitely recommended.
