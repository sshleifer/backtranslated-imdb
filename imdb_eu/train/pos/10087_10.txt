He painted Edith Head's awesome costume at Liz Taylor for her best outfit! <br /> <br /> SFX is very good for a movie of its time, and double stunts seem like actors, even in the type of body. An incredibly strange antique movie. <br /> <br /> Nice movie, with wonderful panoramic views, even if you split and scan.
