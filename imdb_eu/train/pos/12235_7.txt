"The Incredible Melting Man" is a bold, rough, and energetic production of Z, that every camp itself has to be self-respecting! This is a great way to describe this little treasure trove in 70 minutes, like Hammer's "The Quatermass Xperiment", a shameless copy ... a thousand times deeper! The astronauts Steve West is the only survivor of the mission of space mission, but it's a radioactive carrier that is radioactive and ... it melts! Looking at the face of the mirror (is it a fault?), Steve pulls out of the hospital with shock, sticky pus and falling behind his body. Dr. Ted Nelson must immediately find that the disease has also been eaten by human beef. The premise may be stupid, but this movie is very fun and it has excellent effects from Rick Baker. His face is like a rotten pizza and his heavy breathing is like Darth Vader. Another great advantage William Sachs's scripts will not waste time on boring scientific explanations or emotional lectures. The dissatisfaction begins immediately and lasts until the last moment of the film. Enjoy this horror gem and try to extinguish the activity of your brain as much as possible, because if you begin to contemplate all the stupidity of the script, you will lose all the fun campy!
