Although this series was only one season, it has been with me for 20 years. My favorite cartoon was far more than ever. I would give anything to DVD or any format. If you find a way to see this series, we recommend that you take full advantage of it. This series was the first one (in my opinion) that it had a really consistent story over multiple events. I was really interested in the characters and what happened to them. Rest assured that some of the Goose characters sometimes frightened me. It was amazing at the time. Also, the team's head reminds me of a combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. In any way that you can contact the creator / holder rights holder in any way and on DVD, please do so !!!
