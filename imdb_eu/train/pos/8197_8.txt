**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Right <br /> <br /> ** Fair <br /> <br /> * Poor <br /> <br /> `Go ahead, do it my day! ' <br /> <br /> The fourth series of the series directs Eastwood himself (led by the majority of Magnum Force) and brings about a violent society of the first two films. However, the film still has no impact and credibility. This movie was released in the 80s, during the time of Regan and the young republicans. The premise of a woman raped by her rapist is not time to come. This plot would be better if Enforcer would really make a good movie. This sudden Operation was a plot like Wall Street, but Harry Dirty. <br /> <br /> STANDARD: 3 STARTS
