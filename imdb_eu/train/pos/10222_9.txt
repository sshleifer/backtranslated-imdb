The pair Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte is very difficult to play theater and subject. It's an interesting tour of the Wonderful Life theme. <br /> <br /> Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky, both of whom are a class of poor Jewish people from New York. Mostel was a seamstress and was proud of his trade, but he was not able to go back and work on arthritis. Most of Kaminsk is a bed. He asked for wellness. In desperation like Jimmy Stewart, he cried to God for his help. <br /> <br /> If he got someone like Henry Travers, things would be done differently, but Stewart also admitted Travers. But Travers gave him one thing, a deadly mortality of more than 100 years, and all the connections with earthly objects vanished. God sent something different to Mostel, who was recently deceased, Harry Belafonte, to give them at least basic training before giving an angel a task. He still has a lot of problems. She also has a wife, since Gloria Foster did not know when she was shot at the start of the car. You put on his subjects and Mostel issues and you've got a good deal of trouble, Mostel can not believe that he is believed to be a black Jew in Levine. <br /> <br /> The performance of the Poles / Jews was greeted. Actress Ida Kaminsky has been nominated for the Best Actor a few years ago on The Shop on Main Street. Milo O'Shea is another important role played by a pretty medical Jewish Irish actress here. Remembering O'Shea's Verdict's brogue, I was surprised to take and read the part of the doctor. <br /> <br /> Angel Levin poses interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society. It was created by a star of the famous writer Bernard Malamud. Be sure to catch it on the broadcast.
