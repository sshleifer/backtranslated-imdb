I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier, it's a great fan-fiction movie series and I can not wait to see more. I only saw this week and I did not have enough. I also recommend people to see others, because it deserves a worthwhile view. I have already seen each section several times and I am waiting for more episodes. I rated ten, but I think it's worth 12 days a day. My accessories make Star Trek an excellent job for Hidden Frontiers. If you like Star Trek, we recommend that you make this star-fan fiction movie. The details associated with this series of films are excellent especially for used ships and planets
