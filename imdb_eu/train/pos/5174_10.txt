I swear this movie on every weekend of my life and never thought it out! Each aspect of human emotion is so magically removed from the theater, script, direction and in general of this movie. It has been a long time since I saw the movie that mirrored laughter with the murmur of murmurings, I feel sadly reflected and feel every feeling they achieve! We need more video like this !!! Mike Binder: Do you hear?
