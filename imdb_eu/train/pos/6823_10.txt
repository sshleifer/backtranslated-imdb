Last week I saw John Cassavetes movies - when he finished "with a woman under the influence" and "opening night". I totally blur, especially with these two films. From the first minute to the last 'full night' I was completely absorbed. Sometimes I have lived more than once, but the feeling that was a perfect movie was about two-thirds until the credits were created. Everything about this film, as it filmed, incredible performance by Gena Rowlands, credits, opening, music, argument, depth meaning, rhythm, tenderness, originality, characters, deft. small moments .... it's really wonderful for me. I could not agree with the previous commentary about moving to a lonely island, it's something we can see in the depths of this movie. If your home is burning you have enough of your fortune, if you want to make sure you save money instead of making a last attempt to save money under your bed, you'll recover a copy of your movie.
