Paul Reiser moves away from comedy stand-up, writing a familiar story to make sweet and tender tastes: what we see and what we do not see, what we expect and what's surprising to us. With MY FOLKS, the movie is not setting new standards, but a very well-written story, which reminds us of the important links that this family represents. <br /> <br /> Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) was a work-stroke, sometimes his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), pushing his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) in the background. One day, Muriel warns him that he has left his marriage for years afterwards! Her daughter, along with her daughter Rachel, Elizabeth Perkins, immediately finds herself looking to find her place, bewildered and injured, and has left Sam disgrentle to sort things out on her road trip to Ben. The journey becomes a time of two men and means that they are themselves and their father and son and family members. Sam relaxes for the first time of his life and now presents his career in Ben's work for pleasures and fun. The trip ends with a telephone call on the location of Muriel and why he left it and recaptured the story that closes the story of the wisest family reunion. Everything was not what it seemed: it's better and, well, it's different. <br /> <br /> Falk and Reis interact with each other, but in many ways, the film is the shortest time Olympia Dukakis. On the screen, it reminds us that it is the strongest matrix in our movie. Enjoy viewing. Grady Harpa
