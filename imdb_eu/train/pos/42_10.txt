Occupy a performance of Phillips, both comedian and dramatic hell. Erika Christensen was good but he stole the busy show. With The Smokers, it was a pleasant touch, a busy movie, which was not very good. If it's not busy getting a nomination for this movie, it would be a disaster. Forget Mona Lisa Smile, see Home Room.
