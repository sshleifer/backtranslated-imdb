Take what this movie is, not a remake, but a completely different view of the same concept. It's not an original theater, popcorn is a thriller. Visually impeccable. Everything else is ok <br /> <br /> What I think is that the movie is wonderful, but I like everything that Burton did. People need to be relaxed and act like the end of the world of this movie. It was not a remake, and it's not. <br /> <br /> It was a good end. . I took it as a parallel universe.
