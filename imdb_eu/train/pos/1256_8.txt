This is a very dramatic and suspensible film. Plots and lots of turns. The story or director opens the alleged crime of death row or blacks. This film is directed by Arne Glimcher and James Newton Howard's sound is excellent. A solid performance by Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you liked this, do not miss "TRUE CRIMINAL" or "HURRICANE." My wife and I were given 8/10.
