It's a very nice movie and I'd definitely recommend it to everyone. But there are 2 points less: - The level of the stories has a large spectrum. Some scenes are great and some are boring. - Many stories are not self-contained (if you compare coffee and cigarettes, where each story calls a point, a message, a hole, or whatever you want), but most of the stories are very good, some are great and, in general, this year's best movies sure one <br /> <br /> I'm going to have to go through at least 10 lines, I did not say any more, and I did not start by looking at simple sequences ... <br /> <br /> Well, I think that!
