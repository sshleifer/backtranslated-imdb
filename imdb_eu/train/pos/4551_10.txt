I never saw the play stunning, when I played Daniel Day-Lewis with Christy Brown, when I saw My Left Foot. In fact, the role of the scene was not over. He played the role of Christy Brown or, at least, he was disabling himself as a film shooter and needed the surgery because of the damage that his superior had caused him to go back. This is noteworthy, and with all the pain to accomplish this mission, I think it's true that he has performed the most deserving performance of the Oscar scene. That hard part of that was so prevalent, I think that nobody can do better or make more impact than him. I can not say that it is the biggest movie of all time, as this could not be possible, and if it was not yet performed, the best actor ever saw the best actor. Probably a man too.
