I watched this movie for the first time while drinking in a Canadian motel. Flick through the channels Easy Lube was found. My friend continued to flee, but I told him to go back. Something about the simple name is not well heard. I saw the rest of the movie, it was really fun. He wrote a few names of some credits and came home to look for him. Chevy Chase's first movie. I did not remember him there. I did not remember much about it, so I rented it and I gave it to the second. It's very funny and pretty graphic. Just like Kentucky Fried Movie, it's not fun. Love the toes, simple lube, and I'm the president's parts. The dealers are wrong. I give it a score of 6.5 or 7
