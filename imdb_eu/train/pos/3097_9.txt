This show was Fabulous. It was very complicated and well written and all the characters were incredibly delicious. Even Jonathan Cake was a boyfriend. Our airplanes are full of noise like American Idol and Dancing with Stars, it was nice to watch drama like theater theater. It was always interesting to see how each person was joining the next situation. It's really annoying to end up thinking a bit and show a mysterious number that most of us do not pay much attention. Some of us are not sheep. This show is not a lot of people but maybe some enthusiasts will lose it.
