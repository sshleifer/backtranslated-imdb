Hey people, what's wrong. I am a man, only Mike "Sonny Sakura KIller" Kelly. You know ........ you can not enter a script version of Sakura, because we have not had one. As I know, we had a great time in the story. The best time of my life I made this film, and I got so much shame I exhausted Jism ... fun time. You were gonna swear the movie. I really did not plan to fight. Whenever I prepared some moves, the battle director changed them. However, I did blast and really found a great crowd. Especially the purple Ninja, which looks like the movie scene has fallen.
