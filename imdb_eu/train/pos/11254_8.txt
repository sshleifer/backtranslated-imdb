It's been a long time since I saw the mini-series and I'm glad that the merits we recall have endured the test of time. <br /> <br /> Most of the ingredients in "A Perfect Spy" adapt to the LeCarré's best novel, I believe, as a top drawer. His remarkable aspects are music score and script masterpiece, that is, the second written by Arthur Hopcraft, I think it's also the Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, a few years before Alec Guinness. <br /> <br /> The actors are very good, some excellent, among others, Alan Howard Jack Brotherhood and Ray McAnally's Ricky Pym. Peter Egan is spectacular because his face changes with all the angle of his camera. The passage of time and the effects of the physical manifestations of the characters are very credible. I asked so many Peter Egan for how many years he was shooting. After being transferred to the actor Magnus Pym by the actor named Benedict Taylor, Peter Egan is a very old man, since he leaves Oxford. But all this is very small and irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Egan must convince the problems only when the text becomes melodramatic and emotionally it must be "shouting", that is to say, to cry. There is no easy act at this moment, as well as the excellent Frenchman Tomelty, everything that Peggy Wentworth plays is wonderful and easily steals all the part. <br /> <br /> Jane Booker is as annoying as Mary Pym. She has a part of her character under her skin, but she often reveals the petulance of the dreamer, that is, it reduces her to Mary Pym's friendly homemade cookie. Rüdiger Weigang is excellent, funny, ironic and excellent. I also enjoyed being a Baroness Sarah Badel camp. <br /> <br /> The Americans' views of Britain are strongly interpreted in some hilarious scenes. With Yanks Bo Brammell (head of the MI6) abroad, United States contingents are depicted as an empty bubble, they seem to have learned a lot of long vocabulary and long American Americans were built with American jargon and psychedelics. , much contempt for English. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness blend in a lot. LeCarré mixes his talents with various stories, and Hopcraft has the melancholy of his originality, but has not captured a fascinating atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect production (what's it?) And it's still best for LeCarré to adapt to today's movie or television. <br /> <br /> Especially recommended for lovers of spy-thriller and LeCarré. Available in DVD Acorn.
