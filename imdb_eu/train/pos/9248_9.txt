Hold your men Jean Harlow, Brooklyn's employee class, comes from Clark Gable's wife and has all kinds of problems. The film begins as a film, but this time it is emphasized that its character is definitely changing. <br /> <br /> The movie Gable street game starts with a partner with Garry Owen and marks it. police Because the ducks that are placed in Harfour's apartment are running behind, it is so attractive that it hides it. <br /> <br /> In a few moments it involves her and unfortunately her rackets. Gable, Harlow and Owen try to draw an essay on a Paul Hurst drunk, but Gable will not happen. Obviously, when Hurst realized it, it still becomes worse and becomes belligerent and Gable must punch. Harlow was out of the apartment and easily identifies platinum red hair. He puts an accomplice of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie itself and its jail life can be adapted. His interaction with his other prisoners is very good. I think some of the material later use MGM classic Caged. <br /> <br /> Harlow also plays the title song and works as a ballerina ballad, which is very popular at that time. Sophie Tucker speaks and sings pretty well. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the man who develops consciousness, who will often play the part, would preferably play the role of Honky Tonk's favorite Gable film. <br /> <br /> Still there is Harlow who is shining in this movie. I think it's the best MGM, its fans should not miss it.
