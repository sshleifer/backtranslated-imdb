It's Mitzy. I loved this one And did not it look great? I love Sunday afternoon popcorn movies. This is one of these nailbiters, which always goes to commercial. Richard was a terrifying character. I dated boys like that. Well, it's not quite like lol. I would not kill Zack. It was nice and very easy. I love Stalker-type stories. It always raises me and my doors are locked. My husband usually does not like these types of movies, but really sat down with me and I really liked it. I can not wait to see what Mitzi does!
