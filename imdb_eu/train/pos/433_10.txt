This is one of those strange films, beautiful and compelling, decent and curious, a real treat. I think it's a condition for traveling to Italy or any holiday, because it reminds you of its extensive experience (magic). I loved Josie Lawrence, like Lottie Wilkins, but the protagonist and the actors are definitely in this movie. If you attract costumes, fashion and clothing, they are very successful. I'd like to release it on the DVD because they carry my tape version. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely worth the time, just make sure you stop watching it, without interruption.
