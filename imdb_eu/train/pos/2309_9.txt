Life was changing, it was really real! The Man in the Moon is a unique experience to see. The play was wonderful, the story line was excellent and it was a great start to Reese Witherspoon's career. See how nobody can love this movie. Surely, it's never been the best movie, although it was close, but it was very fun to watch, and even though I had a laugh in a joke and a lot of little laughs. Of course, your heart was crying in some moments, but this film was enlightening, and it keeps your day vigilant, even though I had to stir a bit of the story again and again. I do not think that this movie has won at least one prize, and I can not believe that they have seen a lot of people in this site. Watch the movie, if you do not, because it's definitely moving.
