Half an hour sitting and watching a story, believing it all, then watch half an hour of the same story completely ... and then pick it up again. Excellent. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting feature films of the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. I do not know if Andrew Jarecky's "Friedman Catch" had anything like Anna Broinowsky's "Lied Lie". Normandy Khouri, Honor Lost, is a famous and astonished champion of homage to Jordania's 2001 homage, Norma Khouri emphasizes, reveals and questions everything. <br /> <br /> What is incredible and what makes this extraordinary film is that Khouri's "exposure" is made with Khouri's participation. <br /> <br /> In the first part of the film, Khouri presents the alleged story of his alleged friend. Amman, the story of the book. It seems incredible and convincing. <br /> <br /> Then his story is different, credible and believable people, such as women's rights activists in Jordan, research journalists and Australia, where Khouri lived. a little bit. <br /> <br /> Khouri returns and denounces allegations, making a successful trial detection process. Another part of the destructive exhibits comes here, not necessarily defined, which had a great impact on the shock value ... and then Khouri returns and faces allegations (not all, but in the field of books). </ B> <br /> <br /> And Houdini continues the game, this heavy fighting game, in the fight against the shoulders, surprised after surprise and there is no "happy ending" resolution. Brilliant
