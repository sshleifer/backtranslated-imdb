This movie was awesome ... he laughed me, he made a bawl, and above all, the animal speaks in it! This movie should be viewed by many people! It's one of my favorite movies and I love to write so many comments !!! rox! So he feels his heart and is a wonderful storyline that makes up a wonderful movie! My favorite character is shadow. I think it's interesting and charming. I had a gold retriever as the same shadow, I lost so much !!! He was my best friend and I knew that he would die in a happier place, but I have my heart! This movie is the best I love and everyone needs! Love your pets, what they do, as long as you!
