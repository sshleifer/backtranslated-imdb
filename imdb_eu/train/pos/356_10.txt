Apparently, it was a stylish production that had to be a small budget. Multiple characters are amazing, 7ft ghoul from dwarves that exploit their ax! I enjoyed the relationship between them, not very sentimental, but romantic, in order to advance their interests. I also enjoyed enjoying mood (it can be very poorly achieved, too much / not enough), which does not have too much darkness or excesses. Eaves's other efforts, with Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, were a great step in the story and production. We're glad to see that we have a great website. It is not possible to wait for Bane, if the improvement level continues, it should be wonderful.
