Classic cartoon, always enjoyable and fun. It has an interesting plot with fairy characters. Road Rovers is a show that is worth a visit, it's 13 short episodes, and if you've ever seen it, you should. Unfortunately, finding it is very difficult. I think Warner Brothers Studios should publish a DVD with all 13 episodes. Certainly, I would buy it, however, and if they do so, you should buy it. If you like children with dogs, they love boys on the road! Road Rovers should pay more attention while in the air; Without a doubt, it was a special show that was very special, much more than it was.
