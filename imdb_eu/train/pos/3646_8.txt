Walt Disney's "The Rookie" is based on the story of Jim Morris, one of the most amazing tale stories in the history of sports, a small picher story of the league, finishing nearly 10 years of retirement and making his debut in 1999. 35. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a brief summary of Morris's infancy, including some locations. He was a military father. And his family was well established in football, but it was Texas's misfortune, but Morris maintained his passion for baseball. <br /> <br /> The Childhood segment jumps up to 23 years with Morris (interpreted by Dennis Quaid). Now baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School (real life in Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas), he has been saying he's been a baseball player, but that's not what he did. <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He has to turn to the table, saying that he must try to get to the Major League team, and when he has played several times, they are surprised at the speed at which he is thrown, but Morris does not convince himself, but he gets an agreement if he gains a lot of players, Major League team It will try. <br /> <br /> Big Lake earns a range and until the deal is over. Morris goes to Tampa Bay to Devil Rays. Phenomenally, he sprung him 98 miles a mile - he threw his spear more rapidly The league's minor career and outstanding speed are even the Major League pitcher. After another attempt at the group, Morris's Devil Ra It offers a contract with ys. <br /> <br /> This decides to make it hard. Commit life comfortably or start dreaming of its league again. The small league makes little money and goes abroad at the same time. And the decision is worsened in its first lowercase leagues, with his wife and three children. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < AAA level, a league that is below the main baseball level. As the season declines, the possibilities of "calling" are becoming increasingly smaller. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I love this movie. There are great shows and nice characters and it is very easy to play with Morris. In addition, the professional film baseball plays a great job in both the main and small leagues. And, above all, it teaches a momentary message that keeps dreams, when they get remote and almost impossible. <br /> <br /> However, it has some errors in the movie. In general, although accurate, he does too many things and produces them even more. Check out http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. Also, except for one of his players who prays, the film completely rejects the Christian faith of Morris. But it's not surprising, considering Disney's left soul. <br /> <br /> Allegedly, many abuses / fabrications were made to make the story dramatic. However, the DVD Morris's 20-minute documentary DVD dramatically dramatically dramatically stays on the DVD but is out of the movie. <br /> <br /> For example, from birth to his family until well established in Texas. At the age of 12, Morris stood 14 times. And at the end of his early league career, he made four surgeries, when he lost half of the muscle on the left (on the lawn) shoulder, so he let it clear 98 mph. <br /> <br /> To fully appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris, it's good to see "The Rookie", but watch the DVD documentary, see the movie's wrong link and read the Morris biography, "The Rookie." I have not read the book, but I hope one of these days. <br /> <br /> But, in general, the miracle story "The Rookie" is a very good portrait and a powerful testimony to the power of dreams. and the victory of man. 8/10
