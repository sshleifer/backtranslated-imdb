Plotwise is a pretty small whodunnit drama as a dramatic / biopic mask. <br /> <br /> However, the only reason I wanted to see it was that I was really curious about what was really great about Henry Fonda. as in his time. I was not disappointed - it really created a warm and charismatic performance. <br /> <br /> In addition, in film I can say I never get bored to get bored at any time at the movie, so it's a powerful 1/2 outside *****
