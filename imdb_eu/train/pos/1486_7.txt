I was very happy to see a film in Milan for a "Milanese" movie. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who has been well understood and fortunately printed in a film by Milanes. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a standard Milan-style career. death Birth marriage is so common that any scheme of origin and all the wedding guests come together and the story falls in love. Life is hard in the "city" in Milan and after sweetness the old days became harder and harder, then finally the product: a child, which weakens the relationship between the couple, weakens the "selfish" "current" effect. metropolitan "identity, under the stress environment, the" advertising "of all" creators "contributes to the well-informed field, we are losing the values ​​of life, which is deeply reflected in this beautiful and sharp film by Senza Pelle. <br /> <br /> The actors are well-chosen, Stefania Rock's nice and well-differentiated, and a positive surprise. Fabio Volo, a well-known incident, known as the "trash" series: Le Iene. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
