This film is not only entertaining, but also interesting in interpreting a comedy. It was done at the end of the Soviet Union, but the Soviet mentality is at stake. The story is in the early days of the Soviet Union and questions the cause of the revolution, both culturally and practically. Of course, at the end of the 80s and the early 1990s, the strange stubbornness of the Soviet society is relaxed, but the ideology and mentality are still alive and well prepared and deserves to be well deserved. Fortunately, all the deep philosophical commentary is included in a fun and entertaining package! <br /> <br /> Jur
