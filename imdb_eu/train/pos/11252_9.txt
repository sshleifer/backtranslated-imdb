This is my second time for A Perfect Spy. I have seen 2 or 3 years ago and I like it. I like it yet. It's natural to compare with beeb's Le Carre 'series, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Tinker Tailor is playing in the "game" spies; Perfect Spy gives us another axis - what spy person does. He has some issues with these genres, along with other genres. <br /> <br /> Ambiguity - moral, sexual, interpersonal - genuine and false, outside, creating a multi-dimensional space. love vs. responsibility In some ways, these characters are more happy when they treat each other with love and respect, and it is a "hue" in its different nuances. Father and father figures are also important. . A Perfect Spy is one of Rick's most interesting characters, perhaps the most important character in Magnus. He betrays the story and betrays it. When he climbs up the ladder forever, he who asks others to think of what he thinks, asks Magnus when they meet each other "Do you love your old man?" and never, "Do you love me?" Maybe he says somewhere else, but A Perfect Spy is a love story. <br /> <br /> Another issue is wickedness. The nature of the company is to turn people around again, against their governments, their friends and their counterparts, against their values ​​and beliefs. Every time I've watched Le Carre, I've seen Spy, Look at War, Soldier Spectrum, Smiley's People and Spy Perfect, turning it on and turning it into the basis of the tragedy. <br /> <br /> In the end, more than one artistic issue is not so much - in each of these films usually there is only one shot of a single gun, or perhaps two shots are given to the story. Violence, torture, cruelty are always under the surface. We do not get results like bloodstream or huge cell imprisonment, but Le Carre's characters stick to objects when they are ineluctably absorbed in the storm. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the films above, and you enjoy A Perfect Spy, you are watching. Also, I would recommend The Sandbagger series (Yorkshire TV), where the second and third seasons reach this level of complexity. The IPCRESS file in Berlin is a pretty burial. Trying to play political intrigue as much as a British race, Card and yes, Minister / Yes, Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If it were just a Brit, it would ask for The Three Kingdoms, it would be a movie with intrigue and complexity.
