I recommend the images that try something else. Many movies just seem like traces of old ideas, so I recommend the passport to Pimlico. <br /> <br /> The film is after the Second World War, and afterwards it seems like a shortage of war and reasoning. Among London's "barmy" drivers. The film focuses on a small neighborhood called Pimlico in London. Likewise, besides not being able to buy what they want, they do not see any solution. That is, until you have found a treasure hidden unexpectedly and almost as much as a sovereign nation, hundreds of years ago! With this document, the reasons for rationalization and coupons can be ignored and they want to live a life, however, the British really ARE NOT 'subject! In it, the movie goes through and eventually the crisis is solved, something that you should see. Leave Ealing Studios a great mind with this gem!
