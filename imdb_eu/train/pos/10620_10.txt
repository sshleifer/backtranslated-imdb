For the first time, this story seemed less annoying than the other Cannon Movie Tales. After much more, I think it's best. Some songs are quite bad, especially the love song, but there are two things that make the movie stand out, as well as singing. It's an art direction. Cannon Movie Tales, like the other, that is, the beautiful decoration of that era; Each piece of cloth and gem (both films have a large part of the plot of this film) is fresh and new and contrasts with the foreigner's clothes. During the love song, I am studying the princess dress and her hair, very well made. The other thing is the comic season. The movie is a cheesy man, but the impatient emperor (and at last laughs at himself), suspicious guards, guarded by Nicholas, and the stupid prince was so funny and pretty ridiculous. . And the sequence of the Weave-O song was not so good.
