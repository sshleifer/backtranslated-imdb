I admit, although I saw Cowgirls Even Get Blues, I did not think it was very memorable at all. But now, after seeing the sixth time, I have confessed that it has grown so much for me. In Sissy, the characters of Jellybean and the Countess have become very pleasing. And Sissy and Jellybean seem to be very sweet love. Although the plot is very weak, I think that satire mood compensates more than that. Then, K.D. has a talented character. Lang (who reminded me a bit of Patsy Cline) was his best. The movie that I can not think of as a "multiple" after a first impression, as much as Cowgirls.
