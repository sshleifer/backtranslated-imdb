The most popular film Depardieu is Bertrand Blier (1974), a bertsolari. She has many sex scenes that match X-rating with Jeanne's Moreau, including Jules French and Jim Menage a trois, with two hippy French hippies (Depardieu and Deware). There is no sacred territory in this film; Everything is a fair game. <br /> <br /> It's very strange that Americans do not like this movie a lot, because I know that many French people think it's a classic. That is the opposite of Americans about what they liked. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gerard and Patrick Deware are two late-bitch riders who become hippy drifters with a lot of sexually insecure women who bother and make small crimes. . They are against oppression and capitalism, Euro-commie, slacker 'freedom'. Blier satirizes these two men and, at the same time, the same bourgeois society is to look more cruel. However, Stephane Grappelli's wonderful score is a way of transmitting an unstoppable soul of different points, which brings together all the insanities that make the deeper consciousness or the "ideal ideal" of the unconscious.
