This movie tells the absurd essence of a patriotic patriotic American - his work (and politics) is that the American people are critical as the President himself says. Alan Bates captures this mentality as well as Michael Baytes, and Bates will remember this character. It is a Canadian and American movie. It is a valuable piece of cinema that is able to reach the viewers through the magic of a movie and it is easy to lose control of the producers and directors, the full will of the actors and a lot of external forces. Fortunately, "Hollywood North" does not face the subject of portraiture: Peter O'Brian directs it with precision and control, and directs the scenes from the background of the movie and the film. The film, "Flight to Bogota", with the best clarity and vision. If you're interested in the meaning and strength of Canadian cinema, it's a great place to start "Hollywood North".
