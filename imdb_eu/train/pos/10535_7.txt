The only word that summarizes this movie is curious. Through the existential concept, the soul is light. Bouncy (in more than one way) and a little nutty. I would not call the big and unforgettable cinema and it does not seem memorable the first "cube" movie of this director, but it is advisable to watch it on Sunday mornings. The actors are sometimes respectable and annoying, but I think this was how to write. As a serious film, it might be great or could be very good in the bet. He fills in a bit with the "head" of the "matrix" with the "human nature". <br /> <br /> From ten to 6.8
