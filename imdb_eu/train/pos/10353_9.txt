This review has spoilers who do not know the details of the story based on this movie. <br /> <br /> "The alleged right to anyone who is" innocent until proved guilty. a civilized society; But according to Fred Schepis, according to the famous story of the famous celebration of Australian murders, Lindy Chamberlain was not allowed to kill her baby. The story that revealed his innocence was not very difficult (they considered a dingo), but they were even more guilty, and there was no stronger proof against him. But the Australians moved according to the choice of their own guilt and the Chamberlain religious seemed to be in the media (and the media themselves were, of course, innocent in this process). So, though they were cleared by an initial poll, they were subsequently prosecuted and convicted. Although Chamberlain was eventually released, this is embarrassing only for the discovery of new evidence by "proving" their innocence, what a defendant should not produce. <br /> <br /> 'Dark A the Cry' works very well, especially when Meryl Streep puts a convinced Australian accent (at least Pomen's ears) and manages Lindy (with us) to be sympathetic to being a national hate . Prisoner scenes are simple but they are bad hearts, because we believe that the characters are genuine. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the accuracy of the portrayal of this story (something I can not comment on), the broader issue of this film will be called out with a knowledge of the British popular press and a clear habit of attracting readers' instincts directly to charities. No legal system will ever be perfect; But the statement against the British asylum seekers today is coming from the same hole of evil, Lindy Chamberlain voices away. I am not a religious man, but the Bible still has killer lines (if you have a pronounced excuse). "Do not judge it so you can not judge it" is one of them.
