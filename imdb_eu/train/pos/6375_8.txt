I have a great respect for Disney animated films, but later I do not call what I'm going to see. Atlantis's first movie and trailer seemed exciting and fortunately I joined my expectations. <br /> <br /> Atlantis Disney is a "mature" movie, when the songs are missing (it's a very unusual feature). Disney movie), and deals with more events and discoveries than other Disney product offers. The world of Atlantis, hidden behind the Earth's core, is beautiful, which is presented as a demolished rock that is found in ruins, then slowly evolving into true ecosystems, usually accompanied by some hard-remedial remedies, and tropical paradise becomes more and more interesting. arrived Simply presenting the landscape and the environment of Atlantis, without a joyful song, it gave the kingdom a more beautiful and interesting look. The inclusion of the Atlantic language, as well as the efforts to connect mythology to ancient real-life civilizations, is also added and works well. <br /> <br /> Besides, with the Mole's scenes. Practical joke, it seems that I combine most of the "childhood" elements of Disney's films. Instead, the battle for Atlantis and the constant discovery of Atlantis were the main elements. The place where Milo was outsiders learned everything he needed to know about that place, Atlante helped them know the parts of his history. They did not know. A part of this involves Atlantean "weapons", which is used in a very action packet climate, if not better, quite exciting. <br /> <br /> When the story is over, the story does not go far enough. meaning, and the movie does not create new visual effects created by computer, but beyond the Toy Story movie, this is the fun Disney movie I've ever seen this year.
