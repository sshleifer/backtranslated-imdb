Jörg Buttgereit is too far behind his films and themes, even for his taste, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They are made artistically, often with a deeper meaning in matters. This is an excellent example of this movie's work. <br /> <br /> It's really difficult to label this movie. It's not really a movie with a story, in the beginning, in the middle and in a sense that ends with it. He is also the main character, but he is based on 7 suicides and murders in 7 days. <br /> <br /> All stories are telling you about many classes, although some of them are known. more "interesting" and more real than others. They are not necessarily connected, but they still tell the story together. The film does not feel any connection. All the different stories feel, and Buttgereit tells the story with almost no wording (as well as its typical style), but that's why the feelings of the senses of the characters and the characters tell them the whole story. Watching this movie helps make it more effective. <br /> <br /> Once again, all the values ​​of production are not very large, and perhaps some people may be something that can be scared. However, this particular movie helps the tone of the whole movie and the atmosphere and dark, disturbing and depressing themes. <br /> <br /> I started a 'Buttekoit' movie. <br /> </ span> 7/10
