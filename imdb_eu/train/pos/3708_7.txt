A lawyer becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse with a woman's lack of adaptation to a novel by Grisham. Altman creates a suspensory gothic environment, but the script is weak. Following the drawing of the South, Branagh is credible as a lawyer, and Davidtz is the object of his will. Downey is a private detective. Duvalle has a small role, which does not do much with her strange character. Hannah and Berenger got rid of it. After an interesting set-up, the movie gets awkward and does not really listen to the initial promise, but Altman always deserves a look.
