Disney is the best dub that I heard, as well as the best adaptation of Kiki Delivery Service's music, topics, characters and conversations. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> This has a different atmosphere, especially the deviations of the usual hero. This has a heroine and heroine (although I do not use the heroine and heroine here, because Miyazaki is stereotyped and out of ordinary subject). As usual, after Spirited's departure, impressed by Mononoke, worried by Fireflies's Grave, and Majo no Takkyuubin has touched on, this has been questioned a bit. Will Gubi's first question be asking? Well, in the end, like Yesterday Only and Whisper of the Heart, I gave them 10 points. I would get a score of 9.8, but encouraging the addition of 0.2 additional people to share a good feeling. <br /> <br /> SPOILER Somehow I see this as a sad film, people die in it, a lonely robot, an abandoned place, and destroying it. Mankind is like power too much. The collapsed scene gave me a patch of Metropolis. It's somewhat sad. The plot is evident in most reviews and even in the soundtrack (as always). Joe Hisaishi is actually Calemary Uematsu, Kanno, Williams. People who can not make a movie, a game, an event for the rest of their lives, even though they have an amazing composition. <br /> <br /> This feels good. The movie was in the classic American film days (It Wonderful Life etc etc). Well, things change ...
