When you wake up the next morning, it's one of those movies you've just thought. It will give you a warm and fuzzy feeling and will let you smile on the face. <br /> <br /> Yes, we feed stereotype characters and typical stories, but it's a trick: entertaining. <Br> /> <br /> Being in Sweden and in the United States, it's pretty good, it's funny how we react. "Your husband and wife will kill you," "She (Gabriella) will die and then he will be rebel at the end of anger." We know how these things work, everything comes to an end. And he did that. The characters were very simple, when you did not think twice about them so elaborate, nothing was left of your imagination. The nearest one would probably be Siv, Daniel is asking if he was in love, but about that. <br /> <br /> But it's a beautiful movie, located in rural Norrland, music is amazing. and the characters are fairies. Michael Nyqvist is really genius, with his crazy appearance and Frida Hallberg is charming and close. Maybe it's a little bit enjoyable. <br /> <br /> But most of this movie feels to you, and that is the most important thing. You cry, you laugh, you hate and identify yourself. I do not know the guys for you, but that's not the case.
