Now I was pleased to see the first time in the 2000 series Contaminated Man in December 2000. <br /> <br /> An expert in infectious disease (William Hurt) loses his family when an unknown disease goes into the house and kills them. . A few years ago, now it's in Russia or elsewhere. I do not know exactly, I know that this area happens somewhere. In any case, due to budgetary restrictions in an infectious disease laboratory, most of the workers are forced to release it. One of them, the shameless security of Joseph Muller (he played Peter Weller, who played Robocop as indestructible), must return his job. She needs divorce because she divorces and needs child support. So he goes there, a battle is awakened, and some things are destroyed, dangerous things. It is soon found that Muller is infected with a deadly pathogen. In fact, it is so deadly that a drop of blood will kill one person in seconds. Soon the word comes out and calls for the study of the disease (Hurt), and then joined the American journalist. Now, Muller decides to return his wife and son to his house and there is nothing left to think about, even though he was very infected by the Russian people. <br /> <br /> Now, as I said, this movie is like Falling Down. . We have a disturbed person (Weller here, Fallen down Michael Douglas) who will not stop achieving anything, even in the process of killing some people. Next, we have a hero-type person (Hurt, Robert Duvall Falling Down) who decides to stop heart and antagonist. The good story of a man is infected with a good story. good lines and good performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
