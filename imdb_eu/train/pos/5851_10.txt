* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is only 10 perfect pay-per-view, the first one is 1991 Royal Rumble. The games that were not memorable were full of excitement. That's why I love it. <br /> <br /> Razor and DiBiase and Ludvig Borga and the only start point with Marty Jannetty. They played well, but DiBias was well worth it according to their final payment match. Today, such a game would be run-in and Razor's first baby would be the climax in the main push. And Jannetty, in the face of an Intercontinental race, could have been a better match with Borgia. But I do not think anyone cares. They only need a backup balance for TVs that pay for what they have to pay. I would like to win the perfect one, but Michaels is not one. After considering it, he left WWF, so he did not have to work Razor. Bret Hart has made two great battles with Doink (see everyone's best match against Hit-man) and Lawler. Their competition was classical; That's why the Feud of the Year was the reason. How many do you see that the two legends of the annual Feudo Career arrive late? <br /> <br /> Steiners-Heavenly Bodies team was the best year. Who knows that the Institutions can have in front of the best teams? <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many say the Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez match was a waste of time. But I love it. Remember that the old WWF (formerly WWE) was a great mix of athleticism and freak show. Akeemik did not like the soul? <br /> <br /> The main event is not bad, but there is no such situation in that year. Lex Luger was well placed, but it was a good chance for Yokozuna to keep the belt. Superstar Graham was the first heel to hold the belt over the first two months. Today we are the champions all over the time. But if you were flashing the WWWF from the beginning to the WWF of the 90s, you lost the title's reign. <br /> <br /> As an old school fan, this and SummerSlam '88 are my favorites.
