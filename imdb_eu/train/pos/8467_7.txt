I liked this movie, especially because it made less. It could be more interesting if they were more restrictive in the studio (some of the plot elements were becoming more and more difficult to develop). <br /> <br /> The man playing DJ played a good job. Someone was scared and watching their memories trembled. I have also found that it's quite fun with his conversation callers. <br /> <br /> While stretching parts of the movie for a mile, other sections you do not expect. <br /> <br /> In most cases, I thought the ghost story was quite small, concentrating on the more vivid aspect of the equation. The last 5-10 minutes were pretty good when everything was revealing. <br /> <br /> Although it was a shorter film, it was about how long it was to tell the story. He began to drag on more and more.
