Another powerful Chick Flick. This time around Diana Gusman is always in the fight for school. Instead of being thrown out, he takes his anger somewhere to the boxing ring. He got into a boxer and found Adrian on his neck and falls in love with him. This movie has a powerful message that you do not even believe in taking your dreams and going with them (in this case your father does not believe). That alone makes the movie worth the price. Enjoy
