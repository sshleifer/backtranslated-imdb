My name is Heather and I'm a girl with a movie-based story. I want to thank all those who watched this film. Some of the things that were depicted in this movie were as raw and harsh as it was, it was not really about describing the bad things that were near. I did not have to mention the influence of the mother and the little sister. thank you again to everyone, thank you <br /> <br /> hello everyone! <br /> <br /> Heather is the mother. It's hard to believe that this film has been going on for many years. It's harder to think that people were still seeing it a year ago. Anyone who is going to go through the situation you are here to find out is that everyone who understands who you feel is in the cyberspace. Our thoughts and prayers are each one of you.
