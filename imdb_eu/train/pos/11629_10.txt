Red Eye is a wonderful movie by Freddy Kreuger, creator of Wes Craven. Wes Craven describes the story of a typical London hotel worker. After the passing of the grandmother's funeral, the red eye decides to take flight. While waiting, Jack Rippner knows this man (how is this?) And they become friends. Ironically, both are sitting next to each other in this plane. Then fears begin. The movie is exciting and is due to people who do not like exciting horror movies, and let's say it's possible to wash them in their own way. This is an excellent example of bone vibration production. Wes Craven has done well with this film. She chose the best actors, such as Rachel McAdams, young and sexy girl, who knows what she is doing and really be careful in a movie. Cillian Murphy, a horrifying and horrifying actress, can crush bones in this movie with a stunning performance in a bad character, and her face can really brighten her eyes. Wes Craven did a great job and I expect more films like this film.
