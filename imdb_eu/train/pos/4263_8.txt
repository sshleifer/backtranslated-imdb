At Kurt Weill's Celebration in Brooklyn, WHERE'S WE ARE HERE? Eventually, there was a performance. It is surprising that weird-Gershwin collaborations have any images of any age movie that are missing on the screen. The score is high, and the material CD, together with Gershwin and Weill, highlights. Yes, the movie has problems, but the score is not one of them. Ratoff is not an element of great musical director, and Fred MacMurray can not understand the material. Then, the "modern" segment is written weakly. BATH fantasy items lead to a high-quality film, Joan Leslie and June Haver, as well as two great masterpieces. Both work has a delight to work desperately. World War II is greeted by the history of our country, and in the "never-ending" world, the film has a place in Hollywood music history, and everyone can find and find great merits.
