A few years ago I continued watching TV soap. So I was curious about this movie and found it so beneficial. It's a wonderful mix of soaps, jealousies, insecure actors and all kinds of exquisite beauty. But more than anything - excellent ice cream and incredible script. How did someone get high acting in the stupid movie? And how did the little movie get writers to write perfect lines? I've never even heard talk or talk about that movie, but it's wonderful and that's highly recommended. Sometimes I'm going to do housework and I'm sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and enjoying wonderful things. Congratulations to all of them.
