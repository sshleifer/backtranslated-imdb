It's a wonderful classic monster of the 50s! Overall, I love the 50s, as a car and musician. However, I like to look blob. I love theater in the horror movie of the season when everyone goes in and blob goes in and the party crashes. Another thing I like is one night, like Halloween II, like that. <br /> <br /> When Steve and Jane are doing it, they see meteors fall from a space. Meteor is an inner dough. When each person consumes a blob, it is growing. People are trying to persuade people about the whirlwind monstrous, but nobody thinks them until later. Can anyone stop this blobby creature? I highly recommend BLOB !!!
