Want to solve mysteries? Do you like complex narratives? This is for you. Francis Leclerc's fabulous and slim film (Frenchman Felix Leclerc's French son). Bright photos and beautiful photographs are Leclerc's words, accompanied by the dythyrambic of Roy Dupuis. <br /> <br /> Alexandre Tourneur is a 40-year veteran of Earthquake. Unknown when someone is disconnected. Tourneure remembers who was knocking on the devil while he was finishing the deer. Throughout the fight, he has a strange behavior and he seems to have taken something. <br /> <br /> It was not terrifying, but very mysterious and well-interpreted. My hypothesis over the end (I think India has caused an accident), but this end was open to any explanation. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend 9.5 / 10
