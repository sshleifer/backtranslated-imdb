There's so much drawing, play, script, melancholy, sour taste, excellent writing skills on the film. What can I add? Check out the most heart-warming, beautifully played, and poignant scenes shot. It's Christmas Day and the nature of Frank Morgan (the owner of the store - Mr. Matuschek) is recovering from his broken marriage and suicide attempt. As long as each employee leaves, he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each of them gently shreds. Everyone on Christmas Eve plans. At this moment, this shocking scene is given a deep sadness. Frank Morgan offers the performance of his career and this scene is tearing me to tears. Fortunately we unveil this unique scene. A new worker, the corrective one, the last one to get out of the store is in a beautiful street scene. Unfortunately, Mr. Matuschek is approaching the boy and asks him that he would like to walk in the afternoon with him. Then he will deal with all the superb food that he has never seen in the secret! Matusche can be as lucky as Mr. and together they can have a wonderful Christmas meal. Every time I see this scene, he moves me. Frank Morgan Mr. With the introduction of Matuschek and the excellent DVD movie director Ernst Lubitsch, you can enjoy a wonderful look. This film is a joy to the end from the beginning.
