Jokes are obvious, gagas are crisp and characters are walking on characters - but I could not stop laughing at their fun movie. It does not matter how many times I see, I still kick a shot, and I highly recommend it for fans of innocent entertainment.

If you had a bad week and you need a laugh, rent it on Friday night to make your weekend a great start to your home.
