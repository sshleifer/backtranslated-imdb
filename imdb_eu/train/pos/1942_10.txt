I think it's a movie fan. I was sick at the sofa and I started this movie. From the beginning to the end I saw these great voices, I never saw, talk a lot. Shooting was beautiful. It was just what I needed. I hear this post on the wrong comments written by others. The director plays his heart and plays with his actors. Thank you for making such a movie. Fabulous and elegant, wonderful and elegant at the same time. Excellent. I can not submit it without a total of 10 lines, so I just want more for this director, I want all the actors and writers of this movie more. I did not want to finish. End
