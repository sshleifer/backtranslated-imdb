As others have commented, I did confirm that Siskel and Ebert mentioned one of the 10 best films of the year. What a gift Then I bought it to make a loan. <br /> <br /> The best budget? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is on top of his cab. Cage at least asked for forgiveness. "I'm afraid I'm sorry". Yoakum pushes his gun on Cage's face "Does this make me terrify?" A little bit of humor after an exciting (and temporary) flight. <br /> <br /> It was really fun for that. Continuing to look at the "Welcome to Red Rock" signal, it shook my head and head shining. He created a game of "double hunts" with music and a close quality. Unlike Twin Peaks, however, it does not break things away when it comes to being "top". <br /> <br /> I see credit for 15-20 times. You will see, Yoakumen, "Thousands of Miles" (firstly selected) as a freight train on the desert floor. . away the snow-covered mountains. This was incredible, fluid frames. Also, I have never seen a better visibility and sound compatibility in the film. In addition, the story is perfectly adapted.
