Two years ago I made the trip on the Internet - I've watched the movie! What a walk! And what a journey Darius Weems eventually met! A brave, kind, funny and talented spirit! And what a friend! Darius to listen to the city of Panama outside of the water, to watch for a close warrior in the city of Louisiana, in the eyes of his eyes, with the excitement of some rafting to eat a sponge cake, and call his phone at home, and as always - boys will be boys. All this, young and old, must see this movie. Dario and his mother are strength and courage. And crew members are testament to the hearts of young generations. Darius got a new wheelchair; accessibility problems were documented; Darius took on the journey of his life; and they touched a lot of life. Awareness of DMD and the promotion of money for research will help the Darius Goes West's ultimate goal - DMD cure.
