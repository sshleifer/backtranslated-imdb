One of the best films I have ever seen in the last five years! The New York Lower East Side is a spectacularly young story of young love and boldness. Funny, charming, dull and inspiring, this is a totally refreshing young city, Larry Clark often nauseates and places it in the right place ... although I must admit that Bully was cut over his ordinary rate. Raising Victor Vargas is missing a movie when it's missing ... so do not miss it!
