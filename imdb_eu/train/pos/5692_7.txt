John Curtis Estes, an ultra-hung star, is the second movie in the era of life and John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also based on her entire life. Maybe someday a movie about Tommy Byron's life. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story is not saying very well. With more than Wonderland, he transforms many episodes of Law and Order, and the director has never liked criminal cases. Val Kilmer has two problems: Holmes (and this time does not have a prosthesis like Boogie Nights) is not nearly completely hung up, and mops look much better than Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director does not present a single favorite of castan. With a short term, your wife, or the police do not feature many characters. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is to say "lost" to Paris Hilton in Eric Bogos. <br /> <br /> Considering all this, anyone who is interested in the pornography business or the real crime of the 1980s should not miss it.
