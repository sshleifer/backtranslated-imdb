I saw this when I first made it and I saw it again at the IFC. This is the story about the population of peasant farmers planted in Hawai'i in the decade of the early 1900s. My grandparents were part of this migration; My parents were born in Kohala plantation (Big Island) at that time. I went to Big Island a year ago after living in California for more than 30 years. I was surprised to see that many of the growing cane fields were still undeveloped, even when the wild canoe was growing, several years after planting. I've heard stories of children with girls and plants. This movie helps them think of such stories and memories. This story is a historical document, rather than a romantic plot movie. My mind is left letting go of the review as I read. Some people just get it. <br /> <br /> I do not remember Youki Kudoh's main character. In Jim Jarmusch's "Mystery Train" and in an Australian movie, along with Russell Crowe's "Heaven's Burning", I remember some great plays. Tamlyn Tomita did a great job in her pidgin English, especially someone who was not growing in the islands. I was forgotten that Toshiro Mifune was a role as a floating storyteller. And I lost that Jason Scott Lee did not participate in an unpublished language in the field workers. <br /> <br /> I was just looking forward to the death of Kayo Hatta and his writers in 2005 when he was accidentally killed <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The other two excellent films There are mirrors. This cane plantation experience: "Gaijin" in Brazilian immigrant cane workers (many of them Japanese) at the same time; and "Sugar Cane Alley" cane on African planting experience. The latter is still available, but "Gaijin" unfortunately seems to have not been shown for some time. Another big movie about the first American children, when they were "slave-like immigrants," is "Thousands of pieces of gold". Chinese personnel participated in the railway company, with Rosalind Chao, Chris Cooper, Michael Paul Chan and Dennis Dun, the protagonist.
