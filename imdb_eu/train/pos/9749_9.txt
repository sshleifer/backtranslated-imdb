I watched this movie with my mother for many years when I was in school. I did not like opera at that time, but it changed my opinions. I enjoyed the movie and opera I liked a lot. I bought some of his CDs. Who cares for his own abilities of behavior, he basically played himself, that is, adorable. So charming, it was so charismatic; I wanted to hug it honestly. I feel very sad that they criticize so much critically. In fact, he did not accept people to judge him or to prosecute him or her. He deserves to respect and admire his talent. It will definitely lose !!!
