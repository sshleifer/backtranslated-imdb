Whetmemire. <br /> <br /> Another great Muppet movie. This time, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Gonzo and Camilla chicken are out of the university and are the main characters in Broadway. After pure production, all are divided and divided. I love poems and characters. The songs of the film "Together Again", "Look Me Me, Here I am", "Say Goodbye," "And I always love you," "Rat Jazz" and "Happy will be me." "Frank Oz directs this film with fairness and all the actors make a great job like Muppets' own behavior. View! 91 minutes. Assessed G. My rating: A.
