When they showed me later on television on television, I remember for the first time what they saw in the 70s. Scared me At that time I was a teenager about the films I do not have. <br /> <br /> SANGUA (DANSE MACABRE) is a great example of the horror genre in the 60s. Mario Bava BLACK SUNDAY (1960), LIVING DEAD WITH THE MURSE (KILL BABY KILL) (1966) and Mario Caiano's NIGHTMARE CASTLE (1965). If you want to write it to a great atmosphere with good writing, check it out. I also value these first films with Roger Corman. <br /> <br /> I saw a new Synapse DVD extracted from a French print and a great improvement on this old ship. -and scan printing over the years has hit television. It adds a couple of minutes of conversation (French), but it does not add much more to the movie, but it's really nice to complete it without cuts. Unfortunately, the DVD does not add some photos of the movie. <br /> <br /> I saw a suggestion opening when you were watching the smoke-free effects on the camera. the inn's door. I think the editor was not caught up in that moment, or maybe it did not matter to them, but it was something I did not notice for the first time. That's the wonders of the DVD. Flubs, errors and details for the first time you will not see apparent. But it does not matter. <br /> <br /> But it does not matter, it still gets 7 at the imdb meter <br /> <br />
