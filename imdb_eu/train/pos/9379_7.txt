The more I saw Nicholas Cage, the more I value it as an actor. Watching this movie today (2005), I know it's not in line with the genre of movies that were created at the beginning of the 90s. I do not think the film may be in black, but sometimes it is quite dark, especially for the characters' lighting and curious characters. <br /> <br /> Typical performances by each of the three major. All the actors made a good job with their role. However, I thought Hopper and Boyle's characters were undeveloped, sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they did. Hopper is love, or hates a guy. The land is very good and, although I found some very realistic parts, the parts that I had to deliver to the director (that is, sheriff's first sight). In short, this movie is definitely worth seeing. *** 1/2
