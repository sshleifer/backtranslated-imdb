Woah! I can say about this movie is one thing. Personally, I love one of these cats, so it would be a great part of the movie, but I really liked the fact that the cats eventually took vengeance. <br /> <br /> I liked it. but I must admit that Brian Krause was interpreting that Charles Brady was very irresistible. I think the book looks best to me when I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed. I've seen Charmed and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, her little O.K. In the Sleepwalkers, but very unlikely to compare it with Holly Marie Combs with her scenes, I do not know if Krause and Combs have a great chemistry or perhaps a bit more, that's the only despair in the movie, but I believe that Brian Krause was stuck in those jeans. <br /> <br /> Brian Krause If you are watching the father of the heavenly husband, Holly Marie Combs, and the father of his son, it's not like a boy angel to make a big surprise. Although I think now, it would be wonderful to see Krause's character misunderstood with Charmed, just like Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> I also have to say it was a great movie!
