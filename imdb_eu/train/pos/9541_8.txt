Wow baby, which is indeed the Asian fine horror / gore, and crazy film horrible. He reminded me a little bit of a tattoo, but in this case, it was a Japanese splatterfest that reminded me of blood and courage, a strange love story. It's hard to imagine how they shot this visually stunning, even though they were infected with human beings as parasites, they made me a partial machine or invented cyborgs. It is wrong with these beings after taking the human being, they die one by one and have to eat the other. hmmm, yum yum This would probably be called an industrial dissolution or something like that, with an excellent soundtrack. The movie Carpenter "The Thing" also draws a bit on creatures, design and effects. I would include it in the necessary category for gorehounds, because they do not stop and it is very spilling. And it's essential for recipients, because you do not have to read sub-headings, only visual imaging is a smart journey. The creatures that live as a fetus in the human body think that Frank Henenlotter's films reminded me a bit, that is, with the humor, it is a homage to these brilliant gore films. "Meatball Machine" is definitely a must for gorehounds, and I just love it.
