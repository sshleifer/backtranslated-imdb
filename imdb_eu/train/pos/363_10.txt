This film is about development. People grow up and people are disappearing, people are surprised and people are disappointed. It has everything and more. Expectation, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hatred. It's really a classic play for the entire cast, but especially in Whoopi Goldberg's role. It is mandatory every Saturday in all prisons in the world - it puts your compassion on you. Rating: 10th to 10th. <br /> <br /> PS: I admit: I was delighted to say it in the last scene.
