I just finished watching this movie and I was told I was so impressed. Everything was excellent. Acting characters, story. The child became credible and courageous, always willing to help others. His mother must be proud. I could not get my eyes removed from this film, I'm afraid of losing something. Moral, pretty and scary spirits and "monsters", but still a passionate people. The child becomes poked and bullied at the school. He was chosen as the pilot of the popular festival festival and decided to travel to the Goblin Mountain, where he discovered Yokai, the amazing creations that Brian Froud had. And they needed an evil Cat and a hug. These evil people are caught by Yokai and thrown into the red hole with unwanted objects, like motorcycles and other mechanical things. These become one-of-a-kind robotic monster monsters. Takashi is a young boy to become his savior, along with the redhead / dragon boy and the princess of the river, and even a pretty little creature, if they were in America, they would be sold in a toy and sold it. in all the best toy stores. The lines are good above all. Do not try this at home for kids and in other gems that smile on your lips. Attach your belief and watch this with a child or enjoy yourself! It has to be acknowledged, even though the end was not so great. And not necessarily like this. Cheer Furdion
