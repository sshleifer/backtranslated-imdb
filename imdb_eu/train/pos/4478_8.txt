In general, comedy is beautiful, lightweight, romantic and musical. I think it would be a long case to make the movie. But I do not know what you would cut. Singers Kelly and Sinatra? No A wonderful dance by Kelly? No Does the film take the time to develop the story and develop the relationship between characters? No (it seems that the latest movies have not been used by the characters as a common complaint). <br /> <br /> Some comments that Iturbi did not bring much to the movie, but that allows us. See and listen to great talents in the 1040s. What would happen if the actor was not? It was an important part of the movie, at the base plot, Grayson was doing the same with him. <br /> <br /> Originally, Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer brought him to MGM, including the air. In the film's audition MGM is making a bronze shot, gesturing and smiling. You can think of it like that did the actual screen test a few years before. <br /> <br /> This movie is very intense, it's hard to get everyone's attention. The entire film was full of color and lighting. Frank Sinatra has become a star of why you will see it. A nice counterattack of the movie was how to find a date in Sinatra (male men) on July. You will feel after watching this movie. 7/10
