Will Smith once again presents a movie about a man around the world on his shoulders and on his cross, to direct a way that touches the toughest hearts. The writer Grant Nieporte and the Italian director Gabriele Muccino meet together and create a masterpiece that recommends buying and storing your entire collection of films, you will never get tired of this film !!! I'm the best party with Will Smith, who is not a great actor, but has a real love for people and life, and it's definitely a perfect character for him (IRT Ag Ben Ben Thomas). Rosario Dawson, as usual, was fantastic, you will find Emily feeling her love and her anger. They fell in love with their characters. Woody Harrelson also stars in Top Notch. It's very difficult to write this comment without writing a plot of land, it's very difficult ... I can say everything, see and when you do not interrupt, remove the phone by hook, sit down and get it. To start trying to clarify the mysterious and past life of Ben Thomas IRS agent ... Will Smith wishes to thank you for the great movie!
