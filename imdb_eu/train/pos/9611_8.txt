It was surprisingly intelligent for a television movie and in accordance with my bulimia. He was really investigated, and I can not imagine that someone who has experienced similar experiences has written all the details. The character was very well drawn and Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were great performances. I think they are more like-minded and intelligent, and there was no mute for Beth's bulimia (there was no "no control" of the diet, because of the pressure given by the girls in the media, we're not going to face pressure ... " ) His mother did not write completely wrong, often on TV, ALL EVERYONE will receive a bit of awareness and tell us who they are not the last person ("Diabetes, what's that?"). Oh, my world is lucky, doctor, please explain to me all as a small child, "etc.). His mother was excellent as a psychologist, although he did not see signs. And Beth-e's scenes were not melodramatic and sensationalists More and more concentrated on the need for unnecessary and uncontrollable bulimics. Beth told Mum that the bulimic scene could creep in the room that would not stop other people. <br /> <br /> Okay, so I liked those bits It was not so good for me that we came back to the land of television filtration, but we do not particularly love it, but I think they should have gathered. "You also will heal your child's eating disorder, if you live a lot of money In America ... "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And again, I really like Mare Winningham, it's great.
