My expectations were very high for this film. All the people who watched the movie in this movie told me that they were so touched by the credits that were left there. My hopes could not be bigger, it would be wonderful to me. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this movie. I loved how difficult things were going on without going through a traditional Hollywood movie. In this film, the characters worked in decades, worked through prejudice, learned to open. But he did not come easily, and not just singing one or two songs. He was painful, he took arguments, took up conflicts. Life was like real life. <br /> <br /> The scenes I took out of scene sang Gabriella's song. Helen Sj√∂holm is one of my favorite singers, her voice is beautiful, and you can say that there was no synchronization of lip shooting with previous recordings (often found in other films), she really sang with the whole body and soul. In this scene, you might feel the way Gabriela felt. That Hollywood movie would probably sing his song at the end, and the husband could open his eyes and see his paths, as well as other people from the town. or two. Instead of half-way, he did not bring any solution. His husband was not terrified and realizes what he is doing and it seems that no one else is feeling open in the town. He was beautiful, clean and moving, but he did not solve all his magic problems. This seems to me a real one, which is surely what happened in real life. The whole movie seemed real life for me, something that was well-connected, but a sense of joy and happiness. You rarely find a movie that feels realistic. <br /> <br /> Some things were worrying me, but the movie is not perfect. If you do not yet, you would see "as it is in the sky" and fulfill your feeling of joy, sense of hope and low-life films. Sad, pain, joy and a dozen other emotions. <br /> <br /> Someone said that everybody in the world sings in a choir that there would be no more wars. After watching this movie, I may agree.
