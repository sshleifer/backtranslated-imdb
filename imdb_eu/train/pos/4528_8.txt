Although the film is clearly dated, the public will still be able to easily identify the harsh situation of the evil Buster and this very entertaining story. Buster is fighting in three different ages: Stone Age, The Roman Age and Moden Age, almost identifying the same character as a unique landscape change to help identify "age". In this movie, we will see one of the most spectacular figures of the comic stereotype "man cavernas", romanticism but not by force, as well as a romantic anti-Roman fight. Mel Brooks's "World History: Section I". The subject under the film is simple, but convinced: even though some times have changed, we still have to fight in modern times, we were struggling to "win the girls" in prehistoric times (remember this). 1923 is a topic of America, the time of Chauvinism still fashionable. It is interesting to watch this movie eighty years later, and consider how things have changed from today's "modern era".
