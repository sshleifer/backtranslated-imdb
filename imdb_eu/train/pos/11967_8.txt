I do not know whether it's a sitcom, but I'm never allowed to be one of the biggest television shows. It is very good that this show is still open. And I love Michelle. He was one of the smallest baby when he talked and sometimes said funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This show is intended for children and teens and ... well, families are struggling with times and struggling as a family. I do not know if someone could see this show. <br /> <br /> I think this episode, I love it, is DD ... the older girl accidentally stole the sweat and learned a robbery lesson. It was a great episode. This television show shows an example of family work as a family. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to everyone.
