A few years ago I watched the movie on night tv. He then went to "Stairway to Heaven". As a young boy, I remember the story was deeply excited and I was amazed at the visual effects of the trial process (I know what I know I'm talking about). This imagination! Romanticism, drama, humor and fantasy is a perfect blend. This film is made with the greatest classic ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Wind. The voters of IMDB voters appreciate this film, which is why voters rated between 51% and 10%. More than 84% had 8 or more validations. I was surprised to find that there was not a list of the 250 best films, since I noticed so little, compared to those of the lists. Pity I hope that this movie will be released in DVD 1 (North America), 1), I can buy and 2), others know this hidden treasure.
