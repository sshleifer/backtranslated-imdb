This is a real movie! I remember when I first saw that I was very young and I had seen it all the time once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Homeward Bound is very fun and it's really nice to do all these things how to train animals. The episode of the movie is dull (such as Sassy, ​​the cat, falls down and the Shadow drops at the end of the hole). I saw Homeward Bound second, but it's not as good. first Shadow is intelligent, Sassy is both Sassy, ​​and Chance is stupid idiot. I recommend this film to anyone who likes comedy or music lovers. This is one of my ten favorite films!
