Hmmm, well, this passage is very little. <br /> <br /> Even though bad writing and acting portraits. I think that those who passed those who won bad. <br /> <br /> At the end I love the origami fragments and the great 'twists'. I absolutely love that scene when Tony plays Tony. Actually, it's one of my favorite season's scenes. <br /> <br /> For some reason, people have always hated the episodes of reincarnation, but I always liked it. They are not the best in writing. but I'm really interested in the subject, <br /> <br /> I'll give it a THREE star, but if I had a little more writing, I'd give it four.
