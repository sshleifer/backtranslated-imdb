Moonwalker is not a movie that is a fan of Michael Jackson. I'm a big fan and I've enjoyed most of the movies, the end is not great, but the first 50 minutes or so have been a fan. <br /> <br /> Personally I think the first 50s are seen again a couple of minutes. The dances of every video are amazing, music is fun to hear and a fun conversation. <br /> <br /> Bad is his best videos including Bad and his first videos. It also includes footage of direct concerts. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Michael Jackson, it's essential if you're not a fan / if you do not like Michael Jackson, drive well. <br /> <br /> 9/10
