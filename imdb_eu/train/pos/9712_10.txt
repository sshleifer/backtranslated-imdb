Another review team is similar to a cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks. We also have to point out a new revision about the differences between comedy about black comedy and black comedy. It also deserves attention. <br /> <br /> See the whole thing, all three series. In the end, all the characters are tied up and the puzzle pieces enter as Douglas Adams. Crushed and details are amazing. Well postmodern Improperly funny and surprisingly tragic. Not for children. It is not for thin skirts or for those who do not have objectivity. Think about it. At the same time, literal, figurative and surrealistic in disturbing ways. The most beloved comedy I remember. <br /> <br /> And, probably, the most fascinating thing I will ever see.
