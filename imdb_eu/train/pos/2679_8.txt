Delir, with a roughly moody atmosphere and LSD more inspired by the devil, we must remember when it was done! After a surprisingly open SM (even though it does not seem to be) focus, dream or imagination or do we remember? Many literary and cinematographic references, praised by Lang himself. The beautiful and hypnotizing movie is nice, but it has a wealth of folds. A strange movie. When old Jess could try it. Beautiful central performances including Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I did not even mention Lisbon's places: ah!
