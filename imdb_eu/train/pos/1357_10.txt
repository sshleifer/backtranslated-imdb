Wow what a passage! Last week, I saw Mellisa, Annie and Brandi's friendship about cameo, I almost felt it. But nothing happened after seeing Mellisa pulled out of the drawer. Watching his slot around his wife with no darkness and seeing the shouting of someone out of pocket, was a very entertaining reality of reality television. People laid their eyes on shouting, "dressed" in their clothes, as another would wear one of his most beautiful outfits. Do you have a Mellisa for 40 years and are you still a violent blow? Then John calls the name Annie and Brandie in the book, and he has got up and left the show! Both rivers left the champion to continue being the champion. Because of the decline in Mellisa's tears and forgoing a conversation, all Americans prove what he thought, the baby is damaged. WAH WAH I can not get my way! I love Annie's way of manipulating her cameras, as she said, and then did that. Mellisa is the best competitor and deserves to win the whole game.
