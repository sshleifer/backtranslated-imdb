The influence of Adrienne Shelly on "I'll Take You There" is not clear, but he is clear about his work (Shelly has played in Hartley's two films). His film shows a narrow narrative, but hyper-stylized and extreme characters stir up human emotion. This film, in general, is not ironic (thanks to God), the small and subtle ironies that spoil the pieces refer to bitter truths of love and loss. Beautiful cinematography and a direct soundtrack of the seventies, the "I See You There" is an excellent indie movie, when postmodern love does not face the challenges of love and human emotion. > <br /> Films begins with Bill's life. In addition to selling Ray's best friend in a beautiful country, his wife Rose has left Ray to retire. They are all cleared, until Bill returns to his darkness and sentence, his sister Lucy (director Adrienne Shelly) brings all sorts of surprises: a self-help book and a "date" for his traumatized brother. <br /> <br /> He tries to refuse to give up his bill, but Bernice leaves his appearance on his doorstep. He undoubtedly questioned Bernic's overwhelming attitude and ridiculous hairstyle to "bounce him". However, his pseudo-Hippie features so much annoy him as he shakes his first date. And Bernice is so traumatized that when his adherent notes adhere to him, he raises himself. For what we do not know ... except maybe a psychic. (And who plays psyche as Ally Sheedy?) <br /> <br /> When Bill Rose tells Rose that she wants to see her desperately, Bernice offers her car, but she'll be taken as soon as possible. Along the way, Bill stabbed his gun (Pinkerton Detective, less). As a result of anger, resentment, salvation, passion and violence, Bill and Bernice Ray and Rose are in the country's home, of course, with a few stops on the way.
