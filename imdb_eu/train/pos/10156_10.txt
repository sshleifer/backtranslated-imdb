This great movie has not gotten any more than 5 points! Why not! The great portrayal of Christ's life is a passionless sensation of the Passion of Christ. Like most films, like our churches. The movie lasted for less than a month, while Johnny felt the strong presence of God. In this always-loved movie, it will always be for those who are involved in this great film. fans At least, the crusaders of Billy Graham used to use them as the primary source of education for new Christians. Thanks for producing with Fox. Underlined masterpiece. Films can not be channeled through popular voting as this production proves! In conclusion, this movie is considered one of the great documentaries all over the world, honestly portrayed and a great testimony of Christian faith!
