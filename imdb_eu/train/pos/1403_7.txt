Paul Verhoeven (engineer and CEO) "perfect" and still plays a "funny" dirty type. The first two actions are so good, the last slasher action is undoed. However, I give my recommendations for this film with special effects such as MIND BLOWING (perhaps best) and dandy shows. Verhoeven's moral questions, of course, are unthinkable, and although many movies have been deactivated, this movie is quite soft for older Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Two great mistakes: Josh Brolin (that is, api-man). full lift business If there was an access stairway, why caught them in the laboratory? <br /> <br /> A cool horror movie on Saturday night.
