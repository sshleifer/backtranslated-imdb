One of the best films ever! Why he only scored 7.6 score is a mystery. This movie is a window of the American world of black experience. Congratulations to all people and to children over 10 years old must be compulsory. We recommend you visit the "The Long Walk Home". If you think about Whoopi Goldberg's work "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Squares, think about it again. Do not miss the movie, he must win the Oscar. (And read the book!)
