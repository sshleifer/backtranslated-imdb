Unfortunately, this movie has long been unavailable (as the other posters indicate), but this is a fundamental drama of the Great Depression, in a popular lyrical and moving drama. Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young are one of the best of their career, and Frank Borzage, director, is able to create the aura of almost fairy tales about poverty, crime and elements. The awful social difference, proves that his talent is truly romantic and spiritual. This movie shows how love lives between love and despair. It's a true masterpiece of that time, and is a very popular movie.
