An excellent screenplay and some of the best actors ever produced in the world. Montand provides a new dimension of the detective intensity of the "single wolf", and, above all, credibility. <br /> <br /> If a policeman with a typical Hollywood heroine loses family, friends and pets, the murder is usually given for his pain. But after sixty seconds, he picks himself up, picks up his gun and fights his enemies one by one. <br /> <br /> Montand's Marc Ferrot, however, is really destroyed - by the assassination of his girlfriends. Of course, but knowing that he had another lover. He does not seek revenge in his confusion and fury, but he must find the true author of a crime fingerprint throughout the scene. Therefore, all his actions become unusually logical. This is what this movie is playing at our seats, but it's not the only one.
