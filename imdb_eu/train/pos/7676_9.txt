Brilliant! My wife and I went broadly into the Holly Edinburgh Film Festival. After watching the movie, I understand why it was a long line. Holly is a moving story about an impossible connection between two people. The girl is young and she is from the west. The film brings together all the bones of our body. There is no graphical or visible scene that is difficult, surrealistic of the normality that hurts you. The movie is beautifully shot. We love the scene that Patrick Holly has spent on a small motorcycle, among others. Thuy Ngoyen's cruelty (it can not be believed that this is his first theater job) and Ron Livingston's performance stayed with me for a couple of days. Highly recommended
