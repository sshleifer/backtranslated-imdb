I saw McCoys' meeting and I was glad I saw Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez. Congratulations to see it was wonderful, the show I always saw growing when there was a television show. was so excited !!!! The only thing I could not understand was why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (Luke Little) were not there. I know Walter Brennan was dead. So I got on my computer and I wanted to know about them and I found this site so that someone who came with Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (Luke little thank you would thank !!). ! I'm looking for and I'm not a bad luck. I think the only thing to know about Michael Winkelman was born in 1946. This exhibition had values ​​and morals that gave each lesson a lesson. . Which cast casts everyone was believing that they were better than knowing them. That's why it's impossible for someone you can help please! Thank you Glenda
