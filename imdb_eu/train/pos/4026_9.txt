Pinjar is a masterpiece ... It's an effective movie that puts you into thinking and thinking about our culture. This is the best Hindi movie I've seen so far. This movie has been shown at festivals around the world, and I think that it would be a serious competition in Cannes. All the characters were perfectly well cast and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai frightened their roles. <br /> <br /> The movie story about partitioning is very important and it is a story that is never forgotten. > <br /> It has no difficulty or prejudice, and has given the partition a human story. Here, a country is not depicted as good or bad. There are evil Indians, Pakistani wicked and good Indian and Pakistani. Cinematography is excellent and music is a melody, meaning and constant. Everything about the movie was amazing ... and the theater just breathed. Everyone was well thrown.
