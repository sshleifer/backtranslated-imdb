I saw T.R's voice in the first seconds of this movie. It took me to the trip - I liked the thumbs that were first attached, but my sense of humor and the gross look of the two sissy actors - I do not know who played the young man - but it was great and so it was! - <br /> <br /> I am a friend with two other friends who took the film in the middle of the second half ... and I always have a test with my friend to watch my movie. - And we both enjoyed the same - hilarious ridiculous - "normal realistic police" sadly. Both of you, T.Bobins, I found it well ... I thought Robbins would also accept it, although I do not have an idea about whether he likes the movie or not. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see things covered - i heard gus v. Sand had to take a lot of scenes for the first time because the viewer (or producer?) is well-known but still an artistic film. It's too short, but ... it's one of my favorites - and I know most people can not keep that kind of movie and assume that they think what they think is ... ... what a pity! I hope that there will be a DVD containing additional material on the day of the day - so you can see more crisp keanu - expecting baby and all of you to watch it <br /> <br />, think twice and enjoy watching this option. ... m
