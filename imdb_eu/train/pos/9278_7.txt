The White Balloon and Crimson Golden, which I have seen in Jafar Panahi in the other two films, leaves the director an amazing depth on matters that seem small in the face. In Offside, Panahi's serious homage to Iranian women who favored his rights did not seem to have been successful. What is said is not important, of course (and it is very bad for Panahi to be like any other movie, which Iranians can not see). But, after a while, the film feels flat and feels 90 minutes long. I did not like to say. All the actors are wonderful, and at the end of the film the celebration is infective. But it's not an important job, I think.
