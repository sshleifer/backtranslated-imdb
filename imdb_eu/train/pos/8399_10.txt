Love Trap is not short, a 105-minute long feature is pretty clear. <br /> <br /> While I'm writing this, I'd like to say more about Love Trap. I often wonder what makes Love Trap different ... I'm going to answer this question: 1) Never-before-seen characters, especially in movies. None. <br /> <br /> 2) It shows more truth about love and explores the concept of love more than any other movie that has never been done, my modest opinion. <br /> <br /> 3) Instructively, the story goes by, it's similar to the love story you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 4) Provides very good opinions about different cultural problems, both from the black community and from the inside. <br /> <Br /> Over time, people will come to see an original, original work like Love Trap, an innovative, genuine and honest era. It is a strange food full of thought. <br /> <br /> Visit www.lovetrapmovie.com to make specific and detailed information about this film.
