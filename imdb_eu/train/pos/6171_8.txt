Among the readers of the highly-respected Rohinton Mistry novel, this film will surprise you, due to their exceptional adaptations. Except for a small sub-hole, Sturla Gunnarson's feature-length debut is almost recreational recreation (up to the last line). <br /> <br /> You are not reading the novel, this movie is difficult. Certainly not a great cinematic drama. Instead it has a strong element of realism, but I would not have it any other way. The best way to describe the long journey for movie enthusiasts is that it's a small scale and it's a Hindu version called 'Fiddler On The Roof'. Instead of a Jewish / Russian soldier, Gustad Noble is a Bombay banker in the 1970s during the Muslim and Hindi War of Pakistan. He has had to face many unforeseen problems in his life, including his ill daughter, with his main individual son, dirty money and a healthy neighborhood. The endless one is neither happy nor sad, but that is essentially realism. <br /> <br /> A long journey is a beautiful short film, but you want to see it to find good luck. Unlike the Nobel Prize, it has been recently published.
