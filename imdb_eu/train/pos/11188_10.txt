I'm a fan of Stephen King's work, and this movie has made me a big King's hobby. About the Pet Sematary Creed family. They joined a new house and it seems happy. But there is a pet behind the house. A new neighborhood in Creed explains Jud (Fred Gwyne) burying himself behind the mascot's rooftop. This tomb is a nasty thing. The Jew says that when a man (or any pet) is buried under Louis Creed, life would come out again. The only problem, when they return, is NOT the same person, they are evil. Shortly afterwards, when everything is revealed about the Jud Seminary, everything goes to hell. I do not want to explain more because I do not want to give the main part of the movie. Pet Sematary's performance was pretty good, but it needed a bit of work. The story was one of the main parts of this movie, especially as it was original and tough. This movie has a lot of effects that make the movie more mysterious and scary. This movie was thrown back at the base of the movie, which was one of the main reasons, namely the make-up effects. In this movie, the character is really curious. The character is "Zelda". This specific character appears in the film three times more precisely. Zelda is Rachel Creed's sister, a few years before she died, but Rachel is still afraid. The first time that appears in the film Zelda is not terrifying, it does not speak, but the second time it is the worst, and it takes away the life for a second time to be honest. Nothing wrong with this movie, it's almost perfect. The Pet Seminary offers tremendous hopes, a pretty good performance, first-class drawing and brilliant make-up. This is one of the favorite horror movies of all time. 10 to 10
