Some of the collections, mostly of the 1970s, but also some research in governments and American corporations. One of the longest segments of "dealerships" is not fun for me and I do not know what a parody is. Others, however, totally ignore it. I especially enjoy the segment of cooking shows. Most of the wrong words I'm familiar with are in the movie, and if you deny the full nudity in front, stop.
