Amicus is a horror anthology horrible, has 3 great stories and wonderful performances! It only worsens the last story. All the characters are wonderful and the film is quite cold and suspicious, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are amazing! There is very little and my story is "Sweet to the Sweet", and all the characters are very nice. It's been predicted, and the last story was very disappointing and it was pretty cool! Amicus is a great anthology of horror, has 3 great stories and wonderful performances, it only diverts the last story! It is necessary to see it! <br /> <br /> <br /> The first story ("Murder method"). It's a wonderful story with lots of suspense, and Dominic's killer feels terribly and very good. It was a great way to start a story, and most of all, it's a surprise, it's a touching and quite ending end to the twin! A Grade A <br /> <br /> The second story. ("Waxworks"). It's a solid story around, with wonderful performances. However, the end is quite predictable, but it is still horrible and quite nonsense. Peter Cushing has done a great job and I can not believe that Joss Ackland was a young man, I really liked this story! B grade <br /> <br /> The third story ("Sweet candy"). This is the best story here, very creepy, and unpredictable, even a nice little one! Christopher Lee did a wonderful job, and Chloe Franks did a wonderful job as a young daughter, and it's finally moving. I do not want to ruin it, but it's one of the best horror stories I've ever seen. Grade A + <br /> <br /> Fourth story ("The Cloak"). The terrible story is really weak and unknown because Jon Pertwee was angry, but at the end I was surprised, and Ingrid Pitt was as great as ever, but it is sad, and creativity has often been made. ?? Grade D <br /> <br /> Management is excellent! Peter Duffel works brilliantly here, with great camera work, at great angles, adding a terrific atmosphere and keeping the movie fast paced! <br /> <br /> The play is awesome! John Bryans is great here, as a narrator, with excellent lines, I wanted to have more time on the screen. John Bennett was very good at Det, and it was very intense, it was a good end! I liked it a lot. Denholm Elliott is superb as Charles, he was vulnerable, he showed fright, he was very nice and I love facial expressions! Joanna Dunham is amazingly beautiful! And when he did it as well as his wife, Denholm had a great chemistry with Elliott. Tom Adams is as terrifying as Dominic, it was a terrific look, and he did a great job! Peter Cushing is as amazing as ever, and it's amazing here, nice, focused, charming, and as always, he had a lot of classes! (Cushing Rules !!). Joss Ackland is always so beautiful and here it seemed very young, I almost recognized it, his accent was not so bold and I loved another role! (Ackland rules). Wolfe Morris is terrifying here and he had to do well. Hristopher Lee is always amazing and amazing, very intense, very focused and, as always, his face looked great, especially when it was amazing. end! (Lee Rules !!). Chloe Franks is a daunting daughter, she's a little creepy, and I loved her for the best performances I've ever watched, I love her. I love Dawn Porter's beautiful and superb babysitter, I really like it! Jon Pertwee annoyed me and was very stupid and totally unknown, even with Ingrid Pitt. Ingrid Pitt is beautiful, and she's doing the usual Vampire and she's doing well! <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast does well. You have to watch it! 5 to 5
