The story has been very emotional and because I go through a similar story with my parents, I really connected. It is very easy to forget about someone who does not forget to be passionate and passionate. And then they make mistakes and have to live. I loved Ellen Burstyn's screening and who is Christine Horne? It's wonderful! Real discovery Probably, the scene I have ever seen is the most erotic, but nothing has been shown - it's so beautiful. The overall look of the movie was amazing, a true emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good at this image, humanizing a man who descends a man. As a filmmaker woman's life seemed to me that he liked, never sentimental, never too much, simply enough to link us, but it's not enough.
