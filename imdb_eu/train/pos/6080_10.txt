Othello, the classic story of Shakespeare's love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I recall the story at the secondary school, which really seemed to be a favorite of Othello Shakespeare's story, which was very fascinated, because Shakespeare caught the sensation of friendship, love, and racism. I mean, when you're really studying this story, Othello could go to Othello's nonsense about him and why he was crazy. But later I also saw my report Othello's version and I must say that it was absolutely wonderful. Lawerance and Kenneth story are so successful and they understand the darkness. <br /> <br /> Othello is a great soldier of his time in the city, they love everyone, even the king. But the king said that Othellus would reveal his daughter, Desdemona, that the king is furious, but he does not. Othello is welcomed in the city and his best friend, Cassio, instead of Iago, who made his representative, Othello. The jealousy of stupidity has taken revenge. While othello's best friend remains, Othello underlines that Desdemon is cheating on Cassio, he has never said, Othello thinks he is going on. Othello is insane and does not have Desdemona or Cassio's plans and Iago makes him happier. <br /> <br /> Othello's story is incredible, I suggest you read. It's a story following the thought of reading. Othello is a great movie and I recommend it once again, it has captured the story perfectly and it has a great sensation, or what Othello and Desdemona know about what happens. love will betray him. This is a wonderful movie, great theater, good ensembles and good directorates. This is what Shakespeare writes about when he writes the story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
