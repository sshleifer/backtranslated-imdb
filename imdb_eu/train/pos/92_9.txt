This is not an art home cinema, the main entertainment. <br /> <br /> A lot of beautiful people, t & a, and action. It seemed very funny to me. It does not have to be an intellectual stimulant to watch the fun movie! Jesse and Chace are fun, that is, it's just sauce. Certainly it is worth renting. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, I would recommend for Friday night entertainment for boys or girls (if they want to see other girls). <br /> <br /> The evil ones are good too. Vinnie, Corey Large, Heroes. Very evil wicked
