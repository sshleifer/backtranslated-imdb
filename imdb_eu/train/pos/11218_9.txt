This anime is essential for Evangelion lovers. Anno Hideaki's previous work, but her dramatic and dramatic style is quite well. Also, those who did not like Evangelion will know a bit more about this note. Gunbuster is a science-fiction animation based on true science. Indeed, the show called "Science Lesson" explains a description of some of the movie's events. One of the greatest dramatic points in the film, the passage of time is at a speed near the light. The series makes a wonderful job to get a traumatic experience that leaves the earth's emission mission for six months, near the speed of light over the course of ten years and returning to Earth. The main character is kept in ages 17 or 18 in the whole series, almost all of the other people are very different. Be careful, this show is sweat sometimes too heavy. I have a pair of breasts that I've also seen with my breast. I find it pretty easy to discard shocking uniforms and boo-hoo scenes, because the series is very good, but the viewers with low flavor tolerance want to stay away from it. In an interesting note, Gainax, as usual, has exhausted the money in the last episodes. However, black and white films and still drafts of action were achieved, but they did create a good resolution. Finishing is a bit stupid, but he has given me a very good feeling, I could not love him. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the best pieces of anime.
