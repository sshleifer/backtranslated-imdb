I saw the "Fever Pitch" like this accidentally; He was playing the plane flying to Europe. Actually, there was not a bad half. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a fan of the world 1. Red Sox, but it could be related to Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore). The film is an interesting look at how global events can affect people's relationships. In particular, the eye opener is Red Sox loses 80 years of age. I think that these types of things happen all the time and we do not notice them. It's not very bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie that depicts a relationship that is related to baseball is the 2000 "frequency". Check both.
