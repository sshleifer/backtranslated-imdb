I agree with many negative opinions published here, because I'm going later. This ministry is powerful and convincing, because talented breed catches the dark truth of Hitler's world. <br /> <br /> Peter Stormare is the perfect brutal leader of Ernst Rohm, Brownshirt. The scene with Hitler is an explosive one! Hitler is so evil that everybody dominates Rohm Thuggish, primitive, but clearly puts Rohm just for that reason. The relationship between Stormar and Carlisle makes it clear that Hitler has pleased Rohm's brutality, but later sacrificed for political reasons. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone reflects Geli Raubal, Hitler's nephew and his undeniable victims. perversions Without revealing the dirty sex, Jena Malone shows all the fear of a slowing down of the spirit of a young girl. He uses his eyes and voices to suggest all the horrors that he will visit millions of times in the coming years. And it's great! Zoe Telford plays Jena Malon very well with the portrait of Eva Braun. Eva is clearly ill, cruel and unwavering, but at the same time, Adolph, almost subdued by the tender tenderness. An abortionist love affair (the backbone of Hitler's immune self-inflicted disease) is moving and erotic. <br /> <br /> Liev Schrieber, Putzi Hanfstaengel, is as terrifying as a man without a man. -In the city that fascinates Hitler's riches and power. While wild animal like Rohm loves the idea of ​​crushing skulls under the boots, Schrieber's character is among many Germans, who worsens the Nazi violence, but can not afford and quicker and quicker the power. Hitler, on his weak will, has lost momentum with respect to his wife, and Julianna Margulies, stunning and real, strikes her with style and sensuality. Marriage and betrayal provide a real portrait. <br /> <br /> These performances lead to a small series, exceeding the occasional weaknesses in the script. There is only one exception. Unfortunately, Matthew Modine's chops are not actors with tobacco. His lunk-haid Noble journalist spoils his scene - the viewer can not wait for the terrifying Rohm T-shirts to be honest, according to the ignorant gold-faced boy in Hollywood. But the story still works. <br /> <br /> Now, taking into account the exacting details of the script, Hitler's perversions and cruelty become an intense and credible drama. Hitler's body battle record is very wrong. As the public is not afraid of managing the idea of ​​an evil and a daring of a person, the writer looks like a cowardly "asking for an iron cross". Anyone from the Kaiser Navy can get a medal as if they were whisking around it! The movie Hitler thought he was cowardly when he was a terrifying soldier. Likewise, the comrades scorned those who suggested that they were really admired by officers and those who enlisted it. The small thing is that small series represent Hitler as a monster in an honest way - but they just did not have a cheap attack. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Hitler: RISE OF EVIL is a great success highlighted by powerful shows.
