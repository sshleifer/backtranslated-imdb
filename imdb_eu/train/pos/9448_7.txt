This is definitely the worst movie I have ever seen. The first part of the film, although strange, has a lightweight and fun quality. The journey begins very unnoticed, detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the Appalachian mountains. But this is not credible. The obvious social problems (interior) and deformations of rural inhabitants are the worst part of the film. I still hear Bobby crying, and I'm afraid of thinking. Lewis's wrinkled leg. However, while the movie was, in general, very disturbing and disturbing, he raised some interesting questions. When is a morality or right to take another person's life? What can we cause morality, or not, in some cases? And dignity and moral integrity is more important than life itself? Despite any consequences derived from the film, it is an achievement on its own (though it is true and it is a number of aspects that are astonishing).
