This James bond game is the best bail game I've ever played in my life, so far, James Bond's favorite game is so far: <br /> <br /> The quests in this game are really fun because it can be really hard and that's what it does. You are a lot more fun to play missions when you use a lot of actions are very good weapons. The cars in this game are very wonderful because the car missions have a lot of action and it's really fun to play. The voice of the actors is very good and it's great that Sean Connery's voice as James Bond's voice is very good, because Sean Connery's resemblance is to James's and other characters. It's the same as the movie. A pretty good graph in this James James game. Also, the game keeps the movie pretty much, but not all, but it takes most time to do it. <br /> <br /> overall score ********** outside ***** *****
