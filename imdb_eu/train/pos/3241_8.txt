Action Comedy Suspense. This movie is all about. <br /> <br /> They are invited to take part in an attack on a small town in Montanya, professional thieves. It's here in every kind of character of the crime film archetype. Frank, the chief of staff. Carlos, an expert in weapons. Max, the explosive expert. Nick, cracker safe and Ray, the car. Unfortunately for Frank, two improper detectives (Ed O'Niel and Daniel Roebuck very well depicted) arrested those who continue to write from New Jersey. They have sent 4 other letters. <br /> <br /> Our 4 characters meet at the train station and from the beginning they have no liking or confidence. In the mix he added that Frank is missing and they do not know why they called him. <br /> <br /> Now it takes 2 detectives to Frank to New Jersey but soon it will run away and try to go back to the boys who use all sorts of problems. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie full of hilarious and funky films. Simply a good laugh or something different for everyone
