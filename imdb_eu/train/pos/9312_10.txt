I'd like to see this movie. I like babies because they are terrifying. My favorite parts are those who see the raptors behind the column, because there is a scene that reminds me of a movie that is on Friday afternoon. <br /> <br /> I like to see a lot This movie is considered to be a fake computer graphics, but I think it's OK to find out what is going on in the movie, and I think it's a good end, although I do not know what happened to me. The first couples I figured the concept over time and that's important. The most important part is how much they may be afraid for the first time dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> THE BEST FILM WILL BE THAT.
