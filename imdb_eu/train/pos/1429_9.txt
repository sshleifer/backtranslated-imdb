I love EARTH. His photography is incredible, the editing challenge must be interesting, and Patrick Stewart's voice is PERFECT. In addition, if you do not want to miss out on his music and sound edition EARTH experience. You are really on a trip that would end up really alone. <br /> <br /> And, at the beginning, I was surprised to see the laughter of the audience as we see animals in the fight for everyday survival, sometimes I could not laugh at myself. Nature simply seems to understand it as understandable. <br /> <br /> But, in the midst of the need to laugh, I left the cinema with a profound question: "How have the 200-year-old industrial revolution reached here to destroy thousands of natural systems here?" <br /> < > Given this question, I felt the bitterness and the unrest in my way as I saw it. I felt the immediate need for change of the world, to help them fight all of them, to dissuade the changes that we have spent in the last centuries and stop global warming at the same time (this is not an NGO activist!) ... So, At the end of the movie I mentioned the website I immediately visited to see what I could do to see, still depressing its deprecating fate to keep our fantasy (and polar bears) ... (www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed without finding the right answers in my questions. However, it was very interesting to know what the film and the crew were fighting. <br /> <br /> I hope to reduce my energy use. I do not know how to reduce distances when white bears arrive to the ground to get the territory they had to swim before they attack animals ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Film inspiring It's, but I did not leave cinema very happy.
