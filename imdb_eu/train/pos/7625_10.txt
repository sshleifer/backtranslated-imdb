Kurt Russell was the closest person to look at Elvis's shows and was probably the closest person, so many were fake things in this movie. First of all, the makers said Elvis opened their live shows, '69, has been wearing the white jumping for the last 9 years since its release in 1972. He also sang in 'Smoke Burning' in 1972. According to his first pride in 1970, he got his first guitar, all fans of Elvis know how to get his birthday. I know all the past-based movies are something fake, but these are just a matter for those who like Elvis.
