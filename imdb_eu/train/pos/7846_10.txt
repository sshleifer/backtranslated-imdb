I'm not usually joining a specific show (save The OC and Desperate Housewives ... that's it, I'm 20!), But it's not a joke, I was hooked up after a section of the Reunion. <br /> <br /> I can not tell how much I felt that this period of time was in conflict with Bush's speech last night, the eagerness of the 1987 episode that he was really looking forward to, that next Thursday will appear. Once again, this conflict is disadvantageous, the fact that a new show has to be created has to create a second week and a week a week. <br /> <br /> That said, television has not always been. To be pleased to be Emmy worthy of it. I do not expect Reunion to bring home some awards, but I hope that my attention will be able to get out of the season. Did you see the first parts of the beloved show a few years later? Sometimes you ask yourself. Characters construct takes some time. <br /> <br /> Every year it is a wonderful section of every idea, in my opinion. The only other show that I remember when doing something similar is 24, each one of each episode of each hour, and having an additional year is more than one realistic day! You will give this show. Relax art until ... it's just TV!
