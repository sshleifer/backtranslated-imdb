In the Austen films of the 90s, this is my favorite, more than "Persuasion", that is, it has become Austenian. Before seeing this "Emma", I saw the previous two versions, but Emma was wrong, like Lady Teazle, and the other was wrong, as a possible scammer, seems to be right here, young and bad. and hard In general, I thought the attitude and atmosphere of production were very good charms of the novel; Indeed, it is one of the sweetest and most happy things I have ever seen, but rather to the nature of Christmas treatment. The script is uniquely well-formed and the image of the adapter is like the light axis that shows Harriet at Emma Church. Mark Strong did not expect it, but I liked it a lot: he emphasized the practical and ordinary side of the character, unlike Emma's affections, and the evident cholera against Frank Churchill are very entertaining. . Bernard Hepton makes a nonsense image of Mr. Woodhouse's almost Carrollian; Samantha Morton had to be as solid and as strong as Emma's protector. And like the same producers, "Pride and Prejudice," it is assumed that the last couplings of the characters can be believed, only in some cases. For me, production is delight and still remains.
