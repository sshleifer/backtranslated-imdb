I saw the movie on Friday, April 7th. I did not see the last scene (at the same time I spoke with my mother mother). Anyone told me what happened to him? I saw somewhat that her husband heard that someone was listening to his wife in the room and opening the door, he has already died. <br /> <br /> What happened to you? Was he dying? How did you arrange everything like phone calls? Meanwhile, when her husband was home at home, this strange admirer spoke to her? Anyone can explain to me, please. I'm so curious! (Finally, I read that he suffered from Multiply Disorder Personality). <br /> <br /> Previously.
