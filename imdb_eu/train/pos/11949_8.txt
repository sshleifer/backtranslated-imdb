Second film by Woody Allen in London. Tha Tarot Card murdered prostitute in London. The journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a tip that may be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). With her, she begins to love, but she is soon falling in love. Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) has helped the magician not like what he does not see. I like the one from the previous year's "Match Point". He was shorter and faster. The plot is old, but I was entertained and invented until the end. It's not a comedy, but a mysterious comedy with good lines (of course, Allen). It's not much better than Allen, but it's a lot better than its worst. <br /> <br /> Efficiency is generally very good. Allen is bad, but this character has played a thousand times before and is tiring. But Johansson and Jackman are superb: they are fantastic and they show two incredible credible exhibitions. Also, Allen (surprisingly) deals with their sexual appeals; So, one of the costumes is to show a sequence of beautiful bodies. There really is only one debit in Allen yet how sure he was sure in London. Even though "Match Point" is not on top of it, it may make a better progress. <br /> <br /> You need to see it. I give 8
