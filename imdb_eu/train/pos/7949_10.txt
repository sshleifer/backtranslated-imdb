SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is an important movie of my life, because my home cinema is a movie that I remember as a 4-year-old boy. The story is a novel by Sheila Burnford and why this is not possible to write a kind of Lassie brain clone. <br /> <br /> Basic story: Two dogs and a cat are happy to Seaver's family, when the new husband is about three mothers, he gets a job in the city and, temporarily, they must go to the San Francisco interior to spend the animals in the ranch to live for a couple of months. The links between animals are particularly strong and Shadow the Golden Retriever and the Sassy Himalayan cat break out as children, despite being a young American Bulldog who is known as the Chance American, and a little happy. less worried and cynical (partly saying what was abandoned by his voice, when he bought an animal shelter and bought a family), although he has a large part of the story as a character. important story <br /> <br /> Three pets flee from the ranch and enter into a wide and dangerous beast (wonderful desert scenery), driven by Shadow's direction instinct. Along the way, there are several dangers to take home, and family and ranch hospitalists are suddenly concerned about the disappearance of animals. There are amusing moments, a great dialogue between three animals and hilarious lines (memorable quotes), and a moving friendship that grows among the main characters of the story's history (from the moment of sadness). When it avoids submerging the Sassy River, when it drops into the river and drops a waterfall, the viewer loses a moment of loss. <br /> <br /> In some ways, I fail to bring the story of a lost little girl in the desert and transport her. Somehow, it seems that part of the story is not a bit necessary. <br /> <br /> The final bet is that when a shadow enters a basket in a hole and when the leg is dropped, it is difficult to get out and give it away. Up, exhausted, and afterwards, Chance wanted to convince him to go out with him, to tell him how important it was for him and how he pushed him away, so it was not so easy to throw. <br /> <br /> Like this scene (brilliantly done), Chance and Sassy leave home the ambiguity that follows the last scene, but Shadow has never been seen. Then, as they all seem, it appears slowly and joins the family. Chance talks about the friendship he has developed throughout his journey and his classmates, and to understand what a long journey to get home, he leaves a fine epilogue to prove how much his character has grown. but also the other two. The second, I will cry ... <br /> <br /> However, I have not read Sheila Burnford's book, so I do not know the differences between the book and the movie. lie However, it is a movie that can be seen by all the family, and although lovers love to talk to lovers, older audiences understand the plot line (after I saw the movie I saw it after a few years). The film is a movie masterpiece and I do not see you see it coming out and I suggest it! <br /> <br /> And do not get the secrets (see my review Homeward Bound II!)
