I do not know why he did not play in Peor, but the British comedy is very funny and clear. It is set to the end of the "Swinging Sixties". Peter Sellars is a terrific fantasy girl of forty-one and forty-one fantasy. Goldie Here's a great 19-year-old girl in London, and it's "Day Catching" by Sellars. However, the television food critic can not stop blond Americans who will be dizzy. <br /> <br /> Humor, ducks, great screenplay, performances and caste. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent movie, and the best gag is the final line. <br /> <br /> Try it, you'll like it.
