Of course, it was cheesy and meaningless and sometimes crispy, but at least filmmakers did not try. Although most of the television films are limited by mediocrity, this film has some features to really recover. Cinematography has been quite good for television, and Viggo Mortensen shows the tone of Aragorn in a movie about a man who has played with his rules. Most of the flashback sequences were cheesy, but the mountain lion was a lively scene. I was annoyed as a rebellious task in Jason Priestly's movie, but once again the TV is a FILM! Although it was a good thing, the soundtrack was horrible. However, it was a great highlight in Tucson, Arizona.
