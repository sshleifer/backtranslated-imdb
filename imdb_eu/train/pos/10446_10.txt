I saw the movie 10 years ago. Since then, I have seen the video once a year. It's a kind of timeless film, because issues are universal, but stories and interviews are so personal. Although it is also one of the few films that make you from a creditback frame, really, even though there are two characters (very involved). This owes much debt to the wonderful, who really believe in us and celine. The first movie I saw in the first movie, and now the phenomenon is impossible! I love the way the film surrounds the viewer's space, and you think that, even though you're as dirty as you're, you're one of those characters. I wanted to go on a European train! I have not found anyone who has not linked any movie. maybe I, my friend, or only speak to the genre of this movie.
