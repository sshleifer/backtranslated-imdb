More television films should be done as follows. I watched 93 on TV for the first time. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were great, giving realistic and realistic performances. Weber was particularly good, as stupid and awful as the child molester / killer. This film really respected Hunt as an actor. The director also directed "Hoosiers", so to speak and exciting. But the direction of these two works is so hard and simple realism. If you want to watch movies that are not broadcast on preview, see if you can. The story about Hunt and Fahey is also attractive in the face of the main story.
