Many comments on the users I've watched on IMDB for this movie are not really straightforward. First of all, let me say that this movie was not taken seriously. It is a fun and stupid movie, which is not to be thought of, just to enjoy. If you watch this movie with the intention of seeing a masterpiece in cinemas or in the mood, then you will be disappointed. However, if you want to watch a stupid movie with some talented actresses / actors, and enjoy some nice phrases.
