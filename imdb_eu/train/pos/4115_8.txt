This is the shorts I've seen recently. That's why it looks like a movie like an experimental film. The Kurasa experiment took on many individuals living in a landfill and experiences plunged into a texture that shows their existence in general. It's not hard and hard in every episode, but overall, this is definitely the tone. Let's see ... incest / rape, murder attempt, wife's exchange, alcoholism, infidelity, eating a fish that is infected with the death of a boy, a man with severe depression (never speaks of the movie and looks very scary), who would diagnose schizophrenia Significantly, a young man who thinks that the young train is a director with a backward direction, and all the moments of his waking is driven by a "garbage tank" of garbage piles. The whole exclamation (I think that his favorite character is less than a violator!), And so on, and so on. Indeed, it is pretty depressing that when Ingmar Bergman almost seemed to be a Japanese movie, Bergman made a lot of movies. mental illness and the tendency to face the imbalance of life. Is it not surprising that after this movie, Kurasawa has tried to kill himself! So, did you like me? It's not a fun experience. But it was a very well-made movie that definitely kept my attention and, consequently, I wanted to see what happened to people. As it seemed like seeing the disaster of the train, you do not want to see all the extermination, but you can not see it! Of all the collections, I think that the man who was in custody (who was really fit and willing enough to be at home in the dump) was supposed to imagine that he was in custody. Kurasawa himself. Maybe I do not know. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a lot of Kurasawa movies and if you've had a great deal of tolerance for art curling films, take care of this. However, DO NOT do this to watch your first movies for the first time, surely scare the audience!
