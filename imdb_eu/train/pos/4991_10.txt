It's a pity that this movie is so hard to put your hands in the US. I found it through a strange video seller, and definitely worth it. Without a doubt, this is the best film in pre-code and the best movie in the 1930s. Director Frank Borzage made wonderful films about Depression, and together with MAN-CASTLE, he created a fascinating story between the difficulties of that time. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have a wonderful chemistry and help them. Make this movie a wonderful romance. Young's Trina is sweet and promising, Tracy's Bill hopes. It creates one of the most difficult dynamics of character, but finally, good relationships in the film. <br /> <br /> I have seen the pre-code I have seen in the MAN's castle with the second view. Borzage uses a foggy and dreamy technique to return to the town square that lives in Bill and Trina's mansion. Depression difficulties are never ignored; Because they are essential for cinema. But when Borzag fits the movie as a fairy tale, the love between characters seems to be more difficult. It turns the movie hot and loving. <br /> <br /> The man's castle is a corresive achievement of the pre-code era. If only more people would see it.
