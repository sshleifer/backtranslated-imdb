Have a team of archeologists find a real treasure? Sheeba Queen's Crown. The Egyptian crown runs through a steam boat in San Francisco. But it will not be an easy trip. There are plenty of thieves who would like to be loved by precious jewels in the crown. Fortunately, everyone involved, Mr. Moto has the right hand to keep the crown on his trip. However, this does not mean that someone does not try to get out of the treasure. <br /> <br /> After the disappointment of Moto's Gamble, I went to Moto. , but, of course, worst of the worst. But in the first 10 seconds of the movie, I knew it was nice to me. In the 1930s I am a mysterious style, related to archaeological excavations in Egypt. And seeing the motorcycle as a German archaeologist (Imagine, it plays German Peter Lorre), the initial scene really drove me. Even though the movie is less likely to be exotic in San Francisco, it's been nice to keep up. Dark and cunning people rainy on rainy night; open open open fires, those who have lost the head of the hero; For sophisticated and supposed alarm systems, for someone to try it out; The criminals who think themselves dead are? That is, the kind of element we find many of the mysteries of the 1930s that I love. And Mr. Moto takes all the vacations. One of the best ones for me was Lionel Atwill, who was always pleasantly pleasing to the role, a comic relief from G.P. Huntley is really fun, and Mr. A motorcycle return form. I have already mentioned the camouflage's initial scenes. To be heard, it will end at Moto sports. A motorcycle is like a rotary Dervish that goes after its prey. All this and I did not mention Lorre's excellent work. Looking at the motorbike, he is able to win the holiday. <br /> <br /> Mr. I like the Moto series as much as I had to finish this installment. . He was in the corner of the Second World War. And after Pearl Harbor, a movie made with a Japanese hero would not go well. Mr. The motorcycle series was at least a very positive note.
