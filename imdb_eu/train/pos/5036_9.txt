Bill Paxton, Aliens, Near Dark and Terminator, amazed me as Frailty's director. It strikes every cylinder, but there is no falsehood through the agent of the FBI agent (Powers Booth), that is to say, a disturbed thriller that takes away from that thoughtful one. In addition, this movie is fine. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays father. It never gave a name, but that is not the weakness of the film. In fact, it strengthens the film to see the viewer as a kind of symbol. He has a point of view that one day, saying that he was sent from the goddess, he says that the world is over and that Fenton Meiks (Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter) have two children and demons to kill and kill demons. . Demons seem like ordinary people to die, which asks the viewer to only miss out on the father or really do God's work. There are scenes that reflect the confusion of two points and gives a more suspicious movie. <br /> <br /> This story is told by a son (Matthew McConaughey) who has grown up today and speaks. Wiesley Doyle (Powers Booth) FBI agent is very skeptical and straightforward. After all, it is not a day for someone to enter your office to say who knows everything that the killer has. <br /> <br /> The film is full of reflections and is directed by Bill Paxton, guessing without losing interest. The operation is incredible. Both young leads and Paxton work together as a normal family, even though they are all involved in murder. As I said, Powers Booten is not the only person that is not involved, but it's not really great. This was a very well-done film with faith and family.
