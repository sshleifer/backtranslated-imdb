Alexander Korda (1940) Fantasia, THE BAGDAD of BAGDAD I discovered for the first time in the 1950's "Century of the Wonder Show!" Bill checked. Korda Technicolor, THE BAGDAD OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK, were never to be forgotten. Miklos Rozsa's music has improved two films. Whenever Technicolor was terribly beautiful! BAGDADEN THIEF continued on my list of the best fantasy movie ever made. Over the years, it was more difficult to get the color of the film as it originally appeared. True Technicolor began the Eastman Color process in the mid-1950s. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn filmed again. But Eastman Color's engravings were more pastel in nature and revealed in the original Technicolor. The release of this Title in Laser Disc also looks like a pastel - nice, but not so. Now comes the M-G-M DVD (December 3, 2002). BAGDADEN THIEF again looks at the wonderful Technicolor on the DVD with nothing STUNNING !!! It was so exciting to watch this once again once I saw the DVD, I saw it the second time. The only "add-on" is Spanish dubbed version, subtitles in English and Spanish, and a beautiful original trailer. We would like to thank M-G-M for the DVD. Now, Korda's FOUR WASTE and the recaptured version of Korda's JUNGLE BOOK (to replace the poor excitement of public domain in circulation) is expected soon on the DVD.
