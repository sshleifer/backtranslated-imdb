<br /> <br /> I'm questioning other reviewers' comments, that is MYSTERY FILM, not a supernatural reason. It's not just a seemingly "supernatural" explanation of the movie ("vampires"), but it's a very original one. <br /> <br /> Other rememarks of Edgar Wallace's "Pre-before" and "most famous" "vampire brand". <br /> <br /> The film makes a wonderful work to create a "great atmosphere", similar to DRACULA, when Renfield finds himself in the stairs of his castle or in the stairs of MARK OF THE VAMPIRE when he looks two-person. From the castle window of waste and watch while watching a "corpse" body, while the moon goes down using wings! Very surreal <br /> <br /> If you like touching the atmosphere (often silent), this movie MUST be! <br /> <br /> Norm Vogel
