As a Paris Je'Taime fan, I went to New York, I love you hopefully. I was very pleased to meet all my expectations. It was fun, sweet, quick and fun. The films begin with two cabs (Bradley Cooper and Justin Bartha), who are trying to reach the same area, but argue how they should go. It was fun, and then what I've seen the best movie ever seen. There were eight stunning from all of the best. I will talk three about them. Shia LaBeouf is in a star of an hotel that finds love in an old lady. Next, Orlando Bloom appears as a composer, who is negotiating with a woman with Christina Ricci. Another one is Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly, two people who go to the promenade, the thirble nature. The best Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman are the couple. Nataile Portman makes a spectacular debut for the director, and I'm going to pay attention to what you write about a goalkeeper, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are flirting men and prostitutes. New York, I Love You is definitely a good thing, it's Paris 2006 better than Je'Taime. Skits are a bit of a rhythm, and shows how the movie should be like indie films. The film, however, has no famous directors like Paris Je'Taime, so it was wonderful to live up to its excellence. If you want to laugh, you will see great dramatic effects, see many great performances and just entertain yourself to see New York, I Love You.
