Stunning. Absolutely amazing This is a movie for two children, the father suddenly is a vision. An angel visits him and says he needs to kill "demons." Later he picks up instructions, and the demons begin to round themselves to ordinary people with their own eyes. The so-called demons kill an ax with a head and cut them, buried in the garden with pink. The father says that he touches his sins. The movie ends. Finally, with a tour. <br /> <br /> This is something I like about this movie, it totally captures the weakness of human perception. Father is completely crazy? Or does he say the truth? The audience decide. Go to trial yourself and watch the movie. Now
