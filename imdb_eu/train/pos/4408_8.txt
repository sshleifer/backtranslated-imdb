Ang Lee, Taiwanese director, plays previous films 'Sense and Sensibility' and 'The Ice Storm', which gave her latest film to a civil war in the American Civil War. According to Daniel Woodrell's novel, a guerrilla group in the south continues to suspect convictions, known as bushwhackers, fighting for North American equivalent, Missayan water jayhawkers. <br /> <br /> As expected, however, there is a mix of action for rehearsals, but we are focusing on the tension that has taken place in the fight against war, many of whom are still struggling with their neighbors and their families. Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) is a man, or rather a boy, who is only seventeen when the war arrives in Missouri. He is a son of a German immigrant, but instead of being a member of the country and becoming a unionist, Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) joins his longtime friend and bushwhacker. Although it was not accepted by his ancestors and he was not keen to participate in the murder of unions, the cause remains loyal. So, his friend Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright), a black slave who has been released by another bushwhacker and is therefore struggling in the South. <br /> <br /> Lee manages this matter, deep introspection that the plot requires before ever. It is a part of the action, which gives the film a sense of warlike reality - boredom and long hopes, along with some terrifying fights. The action is unglamorised and admirably honest, both sides acknowledge many atrocities. <br /> <br /> The performances are excellent, Maguire and Wright both courageous and decent. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a cool Irish actress, Skeet Ulrich is kind and friendly. Lee has never gone through the war's reality, but his actors have a wonderful job of showing their welfare: the growth of friendship, the show of courage and the emancipation of the oppressed people. Ride with the Devil is a beautiful and compassionate movie that periodically strikes, but always moves the audience.
