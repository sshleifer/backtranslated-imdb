Johnny Yuma, one of the most encouraging Western style, has the freshness of many WAIs in the genre's average, and is highly recommended for fans of genre or smart cinema fans. <br /> <br /> In most of Johnny Yuma, it's not very original, but it's not true. The success of a genre movie, in addition to the expectations and audacity of the audience, the expected elements offer surprising variations. Previously, enjoyable experiences regenerate, but the constant (or main) constant interest they are interested in. Execution quality, of course, is important. Pleasant aesthetics will be less successful than the honest attempt to entertain or move the audience. <br /> <br /> Based on these criteria, Johnny Yuma succeeded. There are many repetitions of previous movie items. The environment is a world of twisted feudal, semi-feudal fog, shared by some of the best "Gothic families" created in 1964-1968, such as Tempo di massacre (1966). The plot is a combination of the Fistful of Dollars (1964) and the Ringo movies, but it's not surprising that both the Fendiando di Leo scriptwriter came out in both. Di Leo was one of the best screenwriters who swore in the popular film Cinectent in the 1960s and 70s. His work offered many of the greatest genres of continuity and coherence (along with other circles, actors, directors and screenwriters). In the plot of the FOD, the protagonist enters the town, creates a difficult situation, and then the resurrection will occur as a result of the resurrection (in some films, Quella sporca storia nel west (1968), the crucifixion is quite literal). Catholic narratives and symbolism are fascinated, especially given the implicit expressions of filmmakers and their populist socialist films. In the Ringo plot, Ringo plot developed by Guliano Gemma in a series of film screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi, he selects a community interest in a member of the community (with a healthy dash). uncertainty). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clear from Manco / Mortimer (Dollar of Fistful of 1965). The two scenes of the Hanging Exchange allow dialogue and mutual understanding. Many films, such as Da uomo a umomo (1968) or even El Chuncho, who knows? (1967), use this old and younger relationship (father / son, younger brother / younger, Anglo consultant / opponents and revolutionary peasant) as the basic dynamics of the plot. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are scams and misdirection, mazes and mirrors, which are repeated in the premier WAI. Almeria canons and babies become literal labyrinths between this protagonist and antagonist, as they play cats and mouse-changing games. line-up with intelligent scripting mechanisms. The conversation was never very important to WAI and often absurdly incomprehensible (it is believed that there are some exceptions, such as Django (1966) or Faccia a faccia (1967), cynical comments. <br /> <br /> Psychological depth of character is created almost entirely through iconic imagery, a description of the general faces and narration situation, see how deadly Samantha's presence, beating, or the feelings behind the backdrop of the initiative. Samantha and Pedro have their confidence and confidence in their power to silence their ranch silences, as well as the hotel, as well as bedroom, which is once again a FOD theme. Finally, keep in mind how much information is looking for, including many elements, that is, the FOD, based on the mysterious novels of Red Harvest Novel. , listening to conversations, looking at windows, diluting watches, or identities and wrong moves to Pedro and This narrative that narrates the narration within this surrealistic and absurd reality created by Samantha's actions. <br /> <br /> What is most important is the movie. they were perceived as an abuse of violence. These philosophies were hardly much more violent than American forces. The psychological intensity of the violence was different and its reasons were different, that is, the violence was not changed, the meaning changed. Johnny Yuma is different and interesting in the use and reproduction of violence, which is an interesting part of the film. <br /> <br /> I think the most interesting part of this genre, the link to anonymous. The recurring narratives that the unnamed viewers of Italy and Spain were of great importance and importance. Is the artifact not inherent in itself? From a prehistoric site to some delectable deceptions, a piece of ribbed pottery, or a leather moldering piece and a rusty metal? But it is a reference to some unnamed presence, life, but rather significant ones. Although Johnny Yuma is an intrinsic value, it's a great deal of interest for me and for that mystery. <br /> <br /> <br /> Spaghetti Western Mountains list http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br/> <br /> Average SWs http: // imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849889 <br /> <br /> Fanatic (at the bottom of the cannon) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list? l = 21849890
