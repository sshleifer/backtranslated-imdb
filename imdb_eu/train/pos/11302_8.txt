Oh, these malicious Italians. It is not the first time the film is based on a material source, without the author's being able to get acquainted with or without this author of the novel. Of course, this is not something of Italian, but in the first days of the film, a lot has been done, especially because they thought they could escape. The publishing house of James M. Cain kept American American screen shots until 1976, but the movie itself has become a bit of a classic. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as magnificent as the American in 1946. The version is a beautiful movie. This, of course, is not a minimal movie story that is strong, that is, it is intriguing and provides a great character and realism. The novel is still very close and, therefore, it is mostly the same as with other movie versions of its story, of course, as a difference in the Italian environment. <br /> <br /> Leave the Italian life of a movie about life and the real people there. At the beginning of these plays, they always have a more realistic feeling and, therefore, seeing it is also quite implicit. Sadly, the movie lost its power at the end when the movie began to feel a bit long and it started to drag on sections. The movie was easy to finish 15 minutes before. <br /> <br /> However, I do not have much negative about this movie. Simply, it is done a lot, based on the same basic and solid base. The first premiere of Luchino Visconti has been directed by some of Italy's leading and most memorable dramatic films. <br /> <br /> 8/10
