Green Eyes is an excellent movie. In the context of the current protection of our troop, it is interesting that this film reveals the lack of respect for the soldiers received from fulfilling their mission. From the historical point of view, the end of the Vietnam war ended up with something to remember and learn. Gene is very proud of this film, and he deserved the credit he received from "Green Eyes". I agree, I do not understand why this film is not often or not. This movie is a movie to be shown on TV every year, such as the movie Magoa Oz. A man's dedication to his lost son is moving completely. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to know him. Rocky
