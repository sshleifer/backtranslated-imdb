This short film of the Oscars is among the genres. Taking a lot of the conversation, he looks at a young boy who buys a gold fish, loves him in the bucket, then goes to school, leaves the gold fish and a window is open. After a while, a nearby orange will appear and it will come in through the window and slowly start on the boat. Fish seems to be very excited and that something is happening. As the cat approaches the boat, the fish jump. He catches the cat to the fish, falls into the bowl and leaves the window, the boy, knowing what has happened, has returned. This was really shot with real animals; On the other hand, Cousteau managed to get these animals in the way. I only want this movie to be available to watch people; I only saw it once, when it was originally published in 1959, it can not be forgotten.
