Will it premiere? Wow - Cross-Eyed is one of the most enjoyable independent films I've seen in the past year, and it's hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the first movie writer. I mean: I signed up with the writer to find out more about this writer's writings ... Cross Eyed has a unique signature - what you want to see is what the writer can say. This day is strange to see a movie that has been written, directed, well-posted and well-executed. I think Cross Eyed tells what to look like about filmmaking. Combines the best elements of the film to create a clear, artistic and emotional tale. More, please.
