Probably one of Nancy Drew's greatest fans. I've read three times in every book and have played a lot of Nancy's drawings. I love this movie. You've been entertained all the time you saw. My friends went about 10 and everyone loved. We were three women sitting behind us, when they appeared in the late 40s and they liked it, they said they loved them. So you will see that it will be entertainment for all ages. You have to make a choice. And it also teaches a lesson, just as you all are alike. So, in general, it was a great movement. I saw the second time! So, please leave bashing. It's a real movie!
