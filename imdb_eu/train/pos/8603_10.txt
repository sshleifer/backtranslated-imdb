The movie is fantasy. The storyline is thin, but the wonderful song serves as a sung and sung song. (I still can not believe that people can be so attractive and attractive.) Some interviews are very thin. The costume since 1942 I felt I was seeing the show of high-quality dressing. <br /> <br /> Movies are for various purposes. This is designed for fun and it certainly does. If I have a negative comment, Nelson Eddy was too old to be a beautiful Countess. Some covers made me feel uncomfortable. But he still sang and sang inevitably. However, Jeanette MacDonald was as brilliant as ever. It makes the angel a spectacular one. <br /> <br /> This genre is very well before my time, and I am a new story about Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy and a related interview. This is a beautiful music from this movie. As I love classic rock music that meets most modern movies, there is no doubt that this music is only and clearly more memorable, more enjoyable and better. The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars of the movies they see today. And Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefit of the plastic surgeons Beverly Hills, was more beautiful than the one I see today. I do not know why other posters are falling apart because of this film and, in general, the likes of this film group. He tells them that they are dated and why they try to explain it. Those who do not like it say that it is not very good, but what? I think this movie will surely be fun as people are forgotten by many other movies. In this movie, in every way, it's just a great quality to remember and enjoy. I respect this movie for anyone who enjoys great talent, great beauty and great music.
