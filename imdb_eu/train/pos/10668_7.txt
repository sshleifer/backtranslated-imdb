As many reviewers have pointed out, the movie version is a bit unfocused for the scenic version of the story. I have never seen the scenic version of the story, and that's why I have a better review of the film than other reviewers. Richard Attenborough may not have been the best director of the film, but the movie is still a fun concert, trying to make a great deal of Michael Douglas's choreographer show. The film goes well with the most prestigious actors or finalists to finish the final selection team. Thus, our attention focuses on dancers movements and individual stories and battles during outs that are being developed during the marathon day. Douglas is probably not the best choice. Apparently, some songs were cut short, and the story of the romantic relationship between the romantic relationship between the dancer and choreographer was added. I must say quite frankly the weakest part of the movie. As Cassie attempts to repeat repeatedly, talent and / or unlucky talent in art talent often reflects almost fake looks. However, this part of the film has been dead in the past, and it is curious to see this old shoe again. The revelations of the same dancers were enough to start with "I can do that" with a number, but then drew a little while while dancers were telling their stories. To be honest, their stories are not real life that they never get so similar. *** 4 stars.
