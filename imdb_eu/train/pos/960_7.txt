This film has many things that Japanese people only understand. Well translated, there are some things, of course, private jokes or regional symbolism. In my opinion, I have tried to send a certain message, but I'm wasting it. <br /> <br /> It's basically a minimal movie with special effects. Some children become "unique" and, in the end, they have no sense of any yokai war that does not make sense. It would be nice to understand what they were talking about, but like Azumi bean yokai bean and a living beast (what Rihanna eats your heart) I can not distinguish it from the plot. <br /> Bottom line: pleasing vision, children shout a lot The river princess is very nice and the rest is wonderful.
