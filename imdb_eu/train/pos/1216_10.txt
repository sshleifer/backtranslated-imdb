When I was a baby, I preferred the first film of Care Care, which seemed so dark. I sat down and saw it first. When I was old I preferred this. I think this movie is very dark for kids, but you understand that you are growing more because you understand it, it does not seem dark when the child was back. > <br /> This movie, in my opinion, is better than the first, everything is so much deeper. The first movie may be a contradiction but you have to discard the first movie to watch it. The buckets are very welcoming, I delay the scene of "My Colors". I sing all the tendencies to mix up. <br /> <br /> The sound track is great! Carol and Dean Park. I love every song in this movie, I've downloaded everything and everything I hear is "I'm listening," as well as my "Remember". I've always preferred this soundtrack as soon as possible, although I love the Carol Kings song in the first film called "Care-A-Lot". <br /> <br /> I think it's a great animation, that is, animation Both movies are fantastic. I was surprised when I sat and I saw ten years later and I saw that the animation of that moment was excellent. It was very amazing. <br /> <br /> There is no backing for other people, this movie is great, but that's it. I do not think it's strange / strange. I think the movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie was taken over by Care Bears and Demon, Dark Heart. The endless one is astonishing and once again "Pokemon Movie" confronts any moral "Brain Bear". It gives you an impact. Again, the film can teach all ages about morality.
