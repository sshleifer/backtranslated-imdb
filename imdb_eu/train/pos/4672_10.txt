I saw Brother's Shadow at Tribeca Film Festival and I loved it! The exquisite Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are father and son. The film has given Scott Cohen free guidance as Alaska returned to his family in Brooklyn. He appears there because his brother died and starts a journey with his brother's wife and wife, and his father never forgives a black sheep with the family leaders. The story leads to the heart and mind of this family, and allows us to better understand the complexity of their lives. In addition, the woodworking business and the Brooklyn backdrop adds the tone of this rich and attractive portrait of the family.
