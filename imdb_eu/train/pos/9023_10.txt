A very noisy and swirling portrayal of a part of World War history, most of the United States never happened. I'd like this in the video. Only showed t.v. Once I know it, in the 90s and 90s. I have asked about this question, and most video shops are unaware. The great actors of all the surroundings, I want to see it again. Top series
