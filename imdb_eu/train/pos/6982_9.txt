Good show <br /> <br /> The basic basis is that humanity is at the crossroads. There is a series of moral dilemmas to face. Human beings have made technological advances, but humanity is sufficient enough to face new toys? There is moral decadence in the virtual world. There are religious fanatics who are willing to pay attention. I foretell (based on BSG's back) will be a problem with Cylons and the slave. In addition, there are other issues that affect us human beings. <br /> <br /> This show is not a BSG, at least with human-faced issues. after all, to carry them out. There are no special shoot-em-up or space-based effects, at least in the first few episodes that I have seen so far. characters and themes. The actor also has good performances. They can make a culture similar to today's society, but at the same time a stranger can be absolutely compelling. Like BSG, this show is about humanity: our strengths, weaknesses, potentials and mistakes. It seems unbelievable that society in a society of different worlds has necklaces, antique cars and chickens. These things, however, are more likely to create semi-familiar links. Anyone who sticks in these details really lacks. If you are a Mafia-style culture or a rich and high-tech culture, human beings and human nature are not 150,000 years ago, in the past of great technology, than we see today. Ask if writers are trying to say something.
