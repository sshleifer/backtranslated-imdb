I think a lot of people dropped the movie, quality is missing. But the Hollywood formula was not followed. Some conflicts are not resolved. The ending is very real for others, but the characters and supporters of the rich trips are thoughtful and entertaining. Cinematography is also excellent due to the urban atmosphere. Management is also excellent and innovative. They took some risks and did several things. I think it has worked well, intentionally, I try to avoid the correct references to the movie, what you see is the best answer, not accepting someone else's interpretation.
