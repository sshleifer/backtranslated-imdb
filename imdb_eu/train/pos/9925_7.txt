When I was renting the Dome, I expected that it was very mute. I hate movies that are really hateful and have cinema and Domino has also received bad reviews. I saw the only reason Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott liked others. On the other hand, I also enjoy the adventure stories. Yes, editing and filmography were sharp, the story was weak, and the performance was mediocre, but I still love this movie for some strange reasons. Domino was very fun and very fun. It was released when it was released. Everyone thinks that Scotts wanted an emotional trip like Man on Fire in the final movie and had a wonderful entertainment. I really understand why everyone hated so many Dominoes, even if they loved and recommended.
