Ealing is a cinematic studio format in the studio "The White in Suit", a kind of male, subtle and lean movie. Although I think some modern viewers may think it's dark in the beginning, it's definitely that many of them would not be seduced by the plot, the topics and characters are going through the film. <br /> <br /> The great Alec Guinness is a good character in a movie called "Kinds Hearts and Coronets" inspired by the Kinders Hearts and Coronets inspired in 1949 by Ealing. This time, he plays less than eight characters, but while Sidney Stratton is inventor and scientist inanimate. She finds a direct tone and expression. In addition to the expressive and subtle behavior of Guinness, the rest of the pieces are effective. Among the main players are Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger. Thesiger is credible as absurd as the absurd business, while Parker is as trustworthy as origin and parenthood. Father, that is, by Joan Greenwood, by the handsome comic actor, who exceeds his peak in this film. An attractive and attractive party and dictionary, it is very sublime in this movie, very similar to the contrast, but it's more bad guinness. The scene that tries to tempt him is that the couple plays the scene so well that it is very funny and fun ... <br /> <br /> The issues are handled very efficiently, it is not an easy habit. The complexity of the relationships between science, business and the workers are well analyzed. This film, expert in Alexander Mackendrick, is technically expert in every field; Imaginative photography, sound effects, and good music and a clever handwriting, are surprisingly surprised. A very enjoyable film, with Guinness and Greenwood brilliant. <br /> <br /> Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
