This is a great documentary, with beautiful running events and a wonderful story. The IMAX camera offers you a wide view, ideal for DVD movies. You listen to all your speakers who work most of the time. The film does not accelerate and it gives you a natural feeling of 230 mm. Of course, some sound effects have been added, but I think they are good, they give the drivers a great deal of the scene ...
