The exhibition was from the beginning of Carmen. It was one of the best characters. Why were they removed? The show is not like it before. Its way worse. <br /> <br /> Carmen with the best episodes. You can not replace someone from the beginning! So it's South Park without Kyle or Child's Play without Chucky! It's not correct! He is the only nephew he represents, yes! Scary. It does not fit into any story. He was one of the main characters, and his nephew can not replace her. He was a great actress. The road is better than a niece. Take it back, or you will lose the tone of the audience.
