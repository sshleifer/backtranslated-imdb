Or the best at least. I think it's a fun and fun game for the N64. Bowser meets his usual dizziness (both the silent and the only thing I think) and Mario must stop again. This game is very fun to play and nostalgia is great for me. The only thing that is the graphics for today's standards, but the rest is pretty good (especially mini-unlock mini games) is the best N64 game (the first best Conker Bad Fur Day). I recommend Mario to any fan or platform game fan. Super Mario Sunshine plays a crazy day at any time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
