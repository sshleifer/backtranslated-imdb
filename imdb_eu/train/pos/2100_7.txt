Before entering politics or public service, Glenda Jackson was one of the best British film actors. This movie shows his talent, although he has lost a memory of Julie Christie Kitty, a British royal captain, who has lost a memory of the past 20 years despite losing his past 20 years. The role of an elegant sister is unknown. Alan Bates plays captain at the beginning of World War shocking shock shocks. Sir Ian Holm has a smaller role as the doctor treats. You can see popular faces like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finlay. You can not go to a madman Glenda and see the captain's true love, but they came from different classes. It's not the biggest movie but it's good to see Glenda's amazing talents. He is still an actress, comedy or fantasy theater. Margaret Gray turns into a nice character and you see why the captain king fell in love with her.
