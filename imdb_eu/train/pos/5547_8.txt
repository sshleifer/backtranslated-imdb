The seamstress was made by a low-budget PRC studio and, definitely, one of the best films I've seen. <br /> <br /> A man hanging out as a murder did not return as a ghost. They vindicated the people who accused them. The victim uses a rogue to disturb and, after several deaths, including the ferry that crosses the shoreline, he disappeared. Grandpa's granddaughter takes the same ferry and falls in love with a local man and they decide to marry. <br /> <br /> This film has many frightening atmospheres, which are also incredible. <br /> <br /> Throw Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as Strangler. <br /> <br /> Palate's attorney is a must-have like horror fans like me. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 to 5 stars.
