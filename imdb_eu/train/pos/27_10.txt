Emilio Miraglio's "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is one of the most beautiful examples I have ever seen, mixing all the necessary elements in a single malicious mix. First of all, it has a crucial importance for me, it has a complicated and complex plot that ultimately makes sense, and the killer here is not completely out. The story, a story about murder pains (you already know about the titles of the movie, right?) What happens when an old prophecy about two sisters is involved, implicated and killer, red. A frightening and memorable image of a damn woman. Each great giant demands some beautiful lead actors, and here we have a pretty bouquet, one of the two beautiful sisters Barbara Bouchet, and one of his first roles, Sybil Danning, Barbara's fashionable attire. . Another great component of Giallo is a tough and honest score, and Bruno Nicolau needs a stay with you for a few days. Beautiful scenery Check again In Wurzburg, Germany, largely shot, the image is in favor of the eye. OK, well, but what about those murders? After all, is not it all about the gialli? Well, I'm glad that most audiences should be delighted to have various dishes such as knifings, shootings, impalements and other carnage ... no cripta, freaky dream sequence, rats and bats (and I have to mention) LOT lots, too!) Drug references, rape scene, compulsory red herb, and Ugo Pagliai, people viewers hunky men leading people. As I said, the perfect giallo. Even better, No Shame's good people are DVDs, and you know what it means: a great start and a lot of extras, to launch! Thanks, guys!
