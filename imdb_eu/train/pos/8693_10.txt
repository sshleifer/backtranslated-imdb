I was very young when it appeared in the United States, but I recorded it from the TV and I saw it all the time until I got the memory. I still still mention it today. The show itself was ridiculous and Frank Sinatra, many famous characters, for Sylvester Stallone, for Mr. T. The voices were excellent and similar to the characters they portrayed. The puppets are also well-done, although they are a bit daunting. I was surprised to learn that recently by Rob Grant and Red Dwarf Doug Naylor, I also enjoy the show. As someone else wrote in a comment earlier, I also stole a "friend" from me and never returned. I'm sure it would be enough for this show to secure the release of the DVD, but I do not think how many people have heard. Well maybe e-bay ...
