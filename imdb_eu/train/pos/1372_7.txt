"Party Girl" takes advantage of the horrible charm of Parker Posey. Indeed, sometimes the movie seems like a vehicle that seems to stop Mrs. Posey, as usual in real life. <br /> <br /> Film directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer. It's nice for Posey's lovers. Mrs. Von Scherler Mayer has taken us down to Manhattan down to show off this unabashed soul to greet each other in an unforgettable spirit of greetings. It is time that it was much naive than that of the Area and the neighboring Market Markets. At least, there is no intention in the movies, and, if we say so, we will see the earth that people usually carve their lives. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes an amazing Mary. We're enjoying more than just another actor with Mary Mary, with Parker Posey. It's a complete picture. The rest is good cast.
