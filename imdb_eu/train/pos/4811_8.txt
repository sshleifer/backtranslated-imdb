Who knew? Victoria Queen is Dowdy, after her ten years of age, her husband, Albert Albert, has been a virtual king and, therefore, a drama and intrigue of young life. "The Young Victoria" is not only the story of a young queen's husband-wife, but also works well enough to determine the details of political environments that rise to his throne. <br /> <br /> Act I 'setup' immediately draws you up. Victor's father, after the death of Duke of Kent in 1820, after less than a year of being born in Victoria, the Duke of Kent was eventually bound by the former army officer of John Conroy, the services offered by the widow and his king's child. be it Conroy emphasized that Victoria would put the "Kensington system" under terror to prevent future daughters from interacting with other children. Even more, Victoria had to stay in her mother's room until she became a queen daily. <br /> <br /> The film was approved by the Parliament in 1830 by the Regency Act, which had become the regent for Victoria's mother (and therefore the Guardian). ) Victoria, when entering the throne, in minor cases. At that time, the dukess and the fearless stranger Princess Conroy tried to convince Conroy to determine his private secretary and treasurer. Victory in high power would not have any problems and refused to go to Conroy and her mother's inadequate plans. The Duke did not like William the king, who had brought him a respectful monarchy; The king felt that the Duchess had not respected his wife. As a result, the Duchess wanted to contact King Victoria. In a conspicuous scene that seemed to have happened in history, the duke held the birthday of the king, when he had intended to survive, until his mother was 18 years old Victoria was not allowed to become a king. <br /> <br /> William King kept his word and died shortly after gaining access to the throne of Victoria. Victoria's mother took revenge on Conroy's help, due to the culpability of childhood misunderstanding. They were exiled to an apartment apartment in Buckingham Palace and, for several years, Victory had little relationship with her mother. . A large part of the film is Victoria's Lord Melbourne relationship, the Whig Party's Prime Minister, unfortunately, depicted in the film as younger than ever. In the beginning she gains trust in the queen of Melbourne and becomes good friends. In the early years of his reign, he sees Melbourne as the advancement, but later loses self-esteem as he reveals a typical politician because he conceals his contempt for his supporter. Actually, it was a picture of Melbourne Victoria's father, but the film touches some sexual tensions between Prime Minister and Prince Albert. As rivals are romantic <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The film reported the 'The Bedchamber Crisis', where Peel presented his resignation as Victory, who did not refuge with her bedroom bedrooms amongst the brides of historic politicians. The film reveals another scandal that Lady Hastings, mistress of the Duchess, accused of John Conroy and her becoming pregnant. According to Conroyek's hate, Victoria's rumors are spreading on Hastings's pregnancy. As it happened, Hastings was pregnant, what really was a stomach tumor. Victoria's inexperience is revealed through Bedchamber Crisis, but the film's scenographers reject some of the characters that characterize Hastings Affair. <br /> <br /> The rest of 'The Young Victoria' is as follows: course - The love of the Queen and the Prince Albert. Victory Albert kept waiting, as the film shows clearly, as he wanted to live as a new sovereign. They spent a lot of time together to return to Alberta to England and to help Victoria's camera during the crisis. <br /> <br /> I found the parallelism between Prince Albert and Prince Philip. the queen of the present queen. While Philip was primarily Danish, he went to school in Germany and studied German. Albert and Philip decided to change their protocols to their business (the scene is great because Albert King King George III officials are setting up a table). As Albert King's husband struggled, he needed to find something. Both Albert and Philip participated in various civilization projects and proved that they were not always constantly living under their wives. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the scene is superb at the end of the movie where Albert understands Victoria as an "interference" as his "illness". Albert does not want a second "Bedchamber Crisis", so he overcomes his wife's head and organizes a compromise with Victoria's bedroom. Victoria is hardly speaking to Albert, when almost all the killing bullets are shot (they shot Albert on the arm, but that has never happened!). <br /> <br /> The movies are evenly excellent, above all. Principles, Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. The young Victoria is abruptly ending and the abuses of credits that have been closed are directed towards hagiography (after Albert's death, without mentioning Victoria depression). But 'Victoria' is a fun lesson and history that is a wonderful lesson.
