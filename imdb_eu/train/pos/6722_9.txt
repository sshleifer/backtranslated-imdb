Everyone has already commented on cinematography (good and good), characters (greater than life), structure (chronological, surfing culture over time over time). The lost is a question of greater sociological importance: the American main culture is something more fulfilling and enriching. <br /> <br /> I was a surfer in the 70s. We watched 16mm movies at the major SoCal local schools. I remember feeling like a surfing all day until I got my skin warm, with a Hawaiian T-shirt and sock and a new surfing movie tonight. Often, the narrator himself was a filmmaker, writing a paper page. Sometimes it would add surf band or proto-punk band music. I was never happier. Unless except hooting and hollering, 'Riding Giants' took time to see me back. <br /> <br /> IT also strengthens the feeling that life is on the edge, not money and social disturbance and disturbing corporation. If you move physically and mentally in line with the Joneses, in moments of joy and joy - the answer to this question can be: "What is the purpose of life?" At least for Greg Noll, like Laird Hamilton and the like, we have found some of us to be brave or sincere: we only live in our lives. Perhaps they would be supervised by society when we wanted to do it all the time, but it is wonderful to see people who dreams come true. <br /> <br /> This message was really impressed.
