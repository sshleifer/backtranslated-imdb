I do not add too much to my summary. This movie places Top Gun as one of the most entertaining films ever made. I do not think it's necessary to take it seriously while it's so nice. <br /> <br /> I do not think Christopher Walken's reputation goes down, however, but his popularity diminished. . Pulp Fiction had to wake up from sleep. In regards to Michael Ironside, he has been in some fun while he does not want to be serious movies. Recover Total, Top Gun. I think it's amazing that this movie has its own budget. Scenes, actors and explosions, etc., are quite amazing, so someone liked it so much and was prepared to risk a lot of money. Anyone who liked this movie I love! <br /> <br /> If anyone reads this in search of McBain's information (and if I question it, I'll be there too), let's find out that it's a fun movie and smile on your face!
