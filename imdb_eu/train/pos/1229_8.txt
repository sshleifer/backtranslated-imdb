I waited for age before seeing this, I was told that all the opinions I read were a great sign. I rented the worst and this sandler movie is not nearly the best, but they are much worse! Sandler often talks to the camera and the movie is not taken seriously, but all this is crucial! It's a great way to start wasting an afternoon, and you also laugh twice! Good movie, it's worth renting!
