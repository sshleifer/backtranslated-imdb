I think that many people have written one of the curious films of Tom Cruise (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut), but Vanilla Sky is definitely his movie. Many people said it was strange; it was not. It was different and confusing, but it's not strange. It's strange to Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. The Truman Show is different. It's confusing Matrix or The Game. Unlike Kubrick, this film has an effect. Everything is sensible - maybe not immediately, maybe even today, but it will be meaningful. Vanilla Sky is confusing because it is mixed with David Aames (Tom Cruise). That's the point. This included the so-called "curiosities" that influenced critics. As a Spanish "movie" of 1997, they were "worried" to see it. And if there is not enough reason to see it, see music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; the film uses "feeling". The songs that play "The Good Vibrations" by The Beach Boys with the emotional and dramatic emotion of the movie create a "right" feeling. Fantastic movie, its script, music, theater and images, Vanilla Sky unfortunately is a movie bandwap movie that gives critics intelligent intelligentsia. Excellent: A +
