Henry Fonda continuously performed three films with Ford and three times and focusing on the surrounding environment and the cultural environment. In Mohawk, American pioneer flourishes the Americans to fight against the Indians and other forces. Here, Ford XIX. It shows us America of the century; At one time inventions and creativity began to flourish and this nation became really great. He was a tall and gentle lawyer in Illinois among the likes of Abe Lincoln, and this film fiction as a lawyer for his life, which he anticipates for the future. <br /> <br /> This is a great fun in this movie, capturing it. Lincoln's essence is what one considers, then no one knows exactly what it was then. The bundles and support pieces work together and Ford finds a unique balance between the American dream and its many forms. This is not a literally moving film, but symbolically, that Lincoln is showing that he was getting warmer for his life to create his legacy. Even though some scenarios get him and a young Mary Todd; And it's hard to see how they ended up together, but that's not the point. In my opinion, this is just a tribute to Lincoln's grandeur, which has become the highest president of the United States. Then, his calm and direct attitude was strange and now he would be. In fact, our government needs more men like himself.
