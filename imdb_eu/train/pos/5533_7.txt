From the filmmakers who brought us the penguins, I think that there was a lot of hope for Fox and the Child. From the rugged winters of the South Pole, from rugged wilts in France, from contemporary narrative documentaries and fairy tales, which tells of the reconciliation of two characters, Renard fights and his friendship with his child. Performed by Bertille Noel-Beuneau. <br /> <br /> This story is quite simple, and sometimes this movie would look like Japanese films that have a lot of friendships with children and a lot of trusted friendship. They hang around each other, their respective opponents and their likes. Here, the child finds an elegant fox close to her home, a filmmaker who offers many wonderful photo postcards to capture a photographer-photographer. <br /> <br /> But while we are with the wonderful landscapes we have been enjoying, the characters do not set a level of confidence from the beginning, and we need to spend some seasons past, and in 45 minutes in the film before finding a food. The child strives to constantly strive to adapt to the being, but foxes, well, of course, like other ideas. While I was thinking of a rather weak narrative, unlike the Penguins' March similar to what happens on the screen, the main documentary of the film that followed the life and time of the movie appeared here. and prey. <br /> <br /> Between the two, more tension and drama was given to the latter, especially as opposed to traditional enemies such as wolves, and when given, the sequences were quite vivid especially when the child entered. was it Otherwise, the sailing was plain and boring, both of them began to play together, knowing that some magical short films have been made. At that moment, there were surprisingly dark moments in the movies that were not adapted for children, because they were confirmed in the same room, because their eyes were silent outside, so parents might not even give their baby the rest of the movies. <br /> <br /> As a movie, I'd rather like to have a full-length documentary on Penguins March, but I thought it was a wrong way, it was probably the goal. I want to warn you not to make it messy with nature and not to say something, and to stay that way. The film decision, attached to Bertille Noel-Bruneau's chemistry and Renard's force against the fox.
