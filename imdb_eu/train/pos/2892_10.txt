Crayfish .... <br /> <br /> I did not watch the movie I saw it last five years. Magic is left It has something to do with the storybook, entertain the songs and please the second character. The criminals with step sisters are completely evil and evil. Then, it's the most magical Disney, you know mice and you know mice. In conclusion, the four Disney princess films are very good, but it's a wonderful magical experience to see and enjoy. Oh, and, of course, Cinderella is a wonderful movie star. <br /> <br /> If Disney thinks you can lose your charm. Elene Wood and others feel the movie, you just can not smile <br /> <br /> The morals of this story say that dreams are true. Of course, in the real world, some make some believers some more. This movie is even more magical when the smile of the rainbow comes out. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the rest ... Cinderella
