I watched a friend with a homofobo friend, with my wife and his friend. So I've seen all sorts of instructions. Above all, the movie made me laugh, the sexual tension was not there and Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu were outstanding actors. Yes, I think his role worked well, even though the script was not right. There were good actors from Romania, they only had complex roles. I am praised when I joined the Puya movie business. I do not know why, but I think he is a good man, I hope he will be the actor. <br /> <br /> His wife loved the movie, and I think maybe the chords might be. He was playing me and I did not have any ears. If the movie wants to present the current sexual behavior in Romania and its consequences, then it failed to fail. It was not a consequence. Think that the girls are really a boy and a girl, and the same story will become a boring and interesting plot. <br /> <br /> I do not know why these BAFTA awards got it. In my book, "Better luck better next" should get the prize. (Bafta = good luck in Romanian).
