(Due to the fact that it has not been necessary to retrieve soil, it has already been done by others.) <br /> <br /> It is understandable that many viewers find a mistake in the movie, which has been developed by slam-bang experience of today's movie-makers. In the face of this, it seems like a movie like a movie has gone on a different planet. In my opinion, it is worth it for some reasons. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, the film is poetically developed, which surrounds the camera slowly, surpasses the surrounding hills, trees, clouds, etc. The world that integrates man and woman into its fold. Together, they reveal the style and dimension that is almost completely lacking in the current cycle of contemporary technology cinema. There, the rapid fire edition diverts attention from the audience and does not concentrate. In addition, the story is transmitted through the eye and not in your ear, there is hardly any talk about what's happening. This is another departure from today's current rates, it seems that the visuals only create an enthusiasm for the audience. But maybe it's more relaxed - it's silent on some movies, as silent films will not be quiet. But when people rarely speak, we speak in that sense. So the burden of the story is divided between the filmmaker and the audience. The former must choose their own artistic images to transmit to the narrative, the latter must think again about those exhibits, because they do not have to explain. <br /> <br /> This does not want to diminish today's movies. -making. Simply, the movie like Machaty is very different from what we currently have. I do not say better or worse. However, he says, we can say that it is a vision that is currently lacking in the movie's experience, such as the cautious value is slow and boring. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a masterpiece, although sometimes it reaches artistic heights, such as a beautifully-formed beer scene, its latest towing crank up, showing a good table below. Slow pies in the rural area, pantheistic celebration of life, nature and regeneration, are admired. They are a type of scene overloading them, but instead - giving them a half chance - it's a memorable experience as a backbone of "his Jaws". <br /> <br /> On the other hand, movies are sometimes heavy, when Machaty stacks on images, especially in the final ode-work sequence. It's hard to know what kind of presence this damaged. Perhaps, symbolism is a tough task, a heroic dimension to the hero of love and to the general public; then the subject that promotes a major influence on Soviet cinema. However, his presence is bored here. <br /> <br /> In any case, I must admit that the initial tuning was to see the gorge of Hedy LaMarr. But now I have to admit that in the process they only managed to dive into the woods.
