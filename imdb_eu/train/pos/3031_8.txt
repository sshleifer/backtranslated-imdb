It would be better if someone with more experience should direct it. Shumlin did not do a bad job, but it's not an excellent movie of art. I love to show it because they used local channels. Graham Greene is one of the favorite writers of the last century. They did some bad books from novels and stories. (I love many of them "The Fallen Idol", but I'm not among them. I've seen Brighton Rock for many years now and I liked it, but perhaps I'm thinking of the novel passionately, but Charles Boyer will not find the Spanish truth. It's better - Tired, cared for, and cared for. Lauren Bacalle is attractive to her, but the best contributors are the best: Katina Paxinou is excellent, and her performance is a small Grand Guignol, but I give it to the director Peter Lorre, the Boyer who first met Esperanto - As always, it's always great - as always. <br /> <br /> And Wanda Hendrix can break the hardest heart, she finds herself as a premature early child, she wants to be a helpful person. It does. <br /> <br /> I recommend this very movie without reservation. The reservation is particularly stolid, but the story and the performance are hardly improving.
