Rabbit I would like to have a full animation, but the movie starts with a reverend and two men who race in jail with another man. While waiting for the prisoner, he tells a story about the three men he knew most. The movie goes into animation format and we see three. These black men sold the house to black men. They decide to name them with Harlem names. So, a black rabbit is killed by a great player from Harlem and is essentially a feature film. The film continues as an Italian mafia. The divine mafia, homosexuals and three Italian clowns. With Italian clown Koonskin is an entertaining animated film that is worthy of knowing, that is, if you find it.
