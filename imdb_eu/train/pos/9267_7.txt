It's not a bad movie. In any case, the Iranians reacted to the match they had in the film, although I do not know anything about football and I'm not a fan. Finishing off at the bus was wonderful. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the problem of women in Iran, and does not allow men to enter sports seats, because it is considered inappropriate for women to listen. . In spite of this law, they try to enter some women, but many of them are caught and detained. It is really amazing that society has old notions of gender. In an interview, Panahi has said that he is a documentary about his films and his injustice, and one day we will see the future of these films and see how Iran has lived. We hope you will come later in the future.
