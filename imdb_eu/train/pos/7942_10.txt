Giallo fans are looking for this strange movie. It is well written, full of life-long usual movies. I do not want to give anything, so I will not even tell you about the plot. The whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere, and you do not know what to expect or who suspects. Recommended! One of the only places I've ever seen in this movie comes from European Trash Cinema, $ 15.
