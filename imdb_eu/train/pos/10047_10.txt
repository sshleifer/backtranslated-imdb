People who have done everything, interview, quote, complain about this ... who wants to hear? If you missed that stunning movie, that's your loss. All of us who love this movie will not mind what you think. I have seen thousands of my life movies and this is what I am talking about in my book. There was no documentary or news about that happening that night. It's the most amazing story of love ever tried. I know that the 90's is cynical and the millennium is great, but it's going to continue. A comment person has complained that he has done too much money! How is that not He has made numerous bundles in all the civilized countries of the planet and is the world's biggest film on the planet. I will be glad this time with the majority. Ok, cynical, I finished the time to explore under your rock.
