Deliverance James Dickey's fascinating, awesome and sometimes disturbing stories, have become a great movie by John Boorman. There are four businesses, guided by men and men, who spend a canoeing weekend in the mountains. There, there is the worst form of human misery and human misery ... poverty, mistakes and physical persecution! These four men sought to travel down the river with adventure and enthusiasm, but their journey soon becomes an odyssey over the rugged and hidden mountainous terrain, excluding all kinds of civilizations. All of these elements make it one of the most important nightmares that I've actually seen. Regarding all those things that happened to these men, you pray that you never have a similar situation. Films in clear speech, Deliverance film is very important. The best of John Boorman (which continues with Zardoz and Excalibur) is still a very influential movie and has already been featured in other films. Think of the excellent music score "Dueling Banjos" and, of course, an unforgettable rape "like pigs". All actors give the play (haha). Especially Jon Voight. A picture to see!
