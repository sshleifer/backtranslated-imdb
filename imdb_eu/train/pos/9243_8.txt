Do not listen to such stupid and terrifying comments on this movie ... just put it on the ninja movies, it's just as good as my friend gets! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a fool, it's a drama and a drama too, but the gum ... so much fun! Actually, as in B-Movies, the awful "actors" (that is, it's the worst thing I could really see in the movie!) And the ridiculous "plot" really only works to increase ten times. <br /> <br /> Of course, the fighting scenes are the main attraction and, above all, I'm glad to say, they are very well-choreographed, especially the Last Show (in which we can see that the ninja is not limited by the norms of gravity). <br /> <br /> Get ahead of me with confidence, you're a fan of ninja movies and you still have not seen Sakura Killers, and I really do not think you're a genius crown.
