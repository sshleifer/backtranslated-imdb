It becomes the church of Jesus Christ of saints in the last days, I can so much absorb as much as possible in the history of my religion. They invited me to an International Film Festival with my children and other young men, as well as our families. <br /> <br /> On a beautiful spring afternoon, Kirtland, we arrived to Ohio there in the historic town of the church. At Vistor's Center we had reservations for the movie. Since the conception of my films was only part of the church's documentaries, I was very curious. I saw that the long "feature films" of the church were just "Legacy" and "My Best Two Years", I thought they were very well written and I thought they were preformed. <br /> <br /> At first, the missionary's interpreter explained the fabrics as they tossed the film deeply into tears. I thought "Okay ... but it is necessary to take tears a lot". Imagine my exclamation, when I became weeping! Actually, the prophet Joseph Smith is very moving and inspiring. <br /> <br /> See and believe the powerful message!
