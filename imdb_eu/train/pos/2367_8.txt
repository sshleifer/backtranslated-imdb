I could not get my eyes removed from this film. Interviews and costumes are the quality associated with softcore core porn. In this case, the appropriate space is used as a vehicle, not for sex, but for seriousness in the series. (Perhaps also for sex, but not in Indian television anyway.) <br /> <br /> I would not have been a fan of the genre Jeff Wincott, and I did not need to search. Only once Brigitte Nielsen negotiated her futuristic nurse (so main!) I made a positive personality for the disappearance of Beverly Hills Cop II. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely not for the 90's at the beginning of Couture's or Paul Verhoeven's high-class dress. Add the tag of the genre to "so-bad-it-good"?
