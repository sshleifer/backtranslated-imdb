Two adventurous teenage girls, the best friends, travel to Thailand with their latest experience before going to college and going to college. It seems to be a fun time to visit an exotic land until traveling to Hong Kong and getting caught up in a bag of drug luggage. They get local police and justice in Asia is very different from US justice. <br /> <br /> This is the main story of "Brokedown Palace" and it was good. The work of the film makes a portrait of arbitrary justice and corruption of the third world nations. Actually, it was a light portrait, much worse than depicted in the prison conditions. Reminding us of the fact that our system of justice is misunderstood, compared to many other countries in the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The whole escape attempt was a fake fantasy. When the money is turned around by the money they give back to the prisoners, it is assumed that the guardians who were controlling all of the visitors were not aware of what they found, both guardians and viewers, as blockers. <br /> <br /> The story does not even give hope to how drugs have gotten Alice in her backpack (Claire Danes). Did you really accept to transport drugs? We are guessed Keeping the girlfriend's innocence throughout the film is very interesting, but the movie that we have never finished ends up ending with a mistress or both of us. Except for great mistakes, the end was excellent and the results were unexpected. Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale's theater were very good and well made. Danes, overold and over hyped, really came as an actor in this film. Although his portrayal was often immature (as his character), the film improved and the circumstances were more dramatic. Beckinsale, however, makes a short route under the radar and suddenly finds himself in prison. He was the best performer of his film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman was not a lawyer. His unrelenting and different style is an actor in films like "Sleeping You Were", but as a lawyer in a third world, he was sentenced to two innocent children for wrongdoing. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see the tourist in Thailand, but I did not want to go. <br /> <br /> In general, a fun movie made by inserting some hilarious filmmakers. I gave it to 7/10.
