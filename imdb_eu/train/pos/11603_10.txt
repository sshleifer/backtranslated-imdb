For the first time I saw the half I got, but I saw it and later I learned about Salem witch trials. They took care of Sara's family. He is truly famous for having cursed a priest. In her film describes her daughter Dorcas and her husband Ann Putnam, Sara's daughter comes to the future to free her soul from hunting this girl. which happens at the end of the film. Dorcas has been a witch that has been in the game for 5 years. What has never happened, Ann Putnam does not denounce it. The little girl is safe to see Ann Putnam's grave to be empty, but at the beginning he denounces sorcery and leaves death. Ann putnam rescues her character and does not exclude society from salem witch trials.
