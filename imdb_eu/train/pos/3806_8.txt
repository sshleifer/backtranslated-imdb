This movie I breathed in some points, I just loved it! <br /> <br /> I accept the character dialogues and drawing better, but this is a short history of two couples who want to kill a dragon, nothing more. to the! <br /> <br /> General design, atmosphere, beautiful scenery ... it's just magical! <br /> <br /> They have made a great love for this movie. They were great and fun designs for the characters. If you want a bit of Tim Burton-ish. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in great design, in a small but beautiful story.
