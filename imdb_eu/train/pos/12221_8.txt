This is a nice job. Very sexy and passionate plot to keep my interest all. His main disadvantage is that he looks like television on the screen, and there are plenty of sex scenes, but there was no nudity (but the boy was approaching!). Strange also, because Netflix has stated by R. <br /> <br /> Either way, I'm very detachable and I would like Alicia Silverstone to create more films. <br /> <br /> A Netflix reviewer said it was part of a series, but I could not know what series it was. But I'd like to know it because this movie is so good. <br /> <br /> Walt D LVn. 8/23/2005
