This, "Witchcraft" and "Eastern Conditers", are my favorite Sammo Hung films. Fat Dragon has much more than this "Condors" on this exit, but I am sure as a director or an actor. Indeed, he is in his highest form and gives an enormously devastating activist, and has half-full dozen amazing sequences and also tells the love-affair story. Love and romance are not the priorities of the director here, but they are extravagant elements for an action and the viewer does not press the push forward button. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, with a frightening light, shapes a solid but deceptive tone. Sammo's role-play is a beautifully executed sequence with a car and enjoys a stunning comic tone. Sammo and Lau Kar Leung, a fast and rage, is a brilliant and superb choreographed and superb way, and is a type that is much easier than ever. The violence of the film gradually increases, and eventually, when climatic events have arrived, we suffer from the brutal changes that have been observed in the Sammo productions that have taken place. Billy Chow's director's attack and hostile and threatening opponent is a house crackdown, physically punishing for delight. <br /> <br /> Terrible at all levels and one of the best martial arts ever made. <br /> <br /> High score too.
