For me, the last scene that answers Harris press is worthy of seeing the intelligent and contemporary slice of politics (especially the campaign phase). If they respond solely to "real life" poles, as Mr. Harris, then the suppositories and autoservices of the press would think twice about being "irreparable" without anything unrelated. to effectively manage the challenges of the office that can make the candidates' competencies.
