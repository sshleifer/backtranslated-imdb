I was really impressed with this movie. When I entered the preview preview, I saw nothing except the trailer, but I thought Dude Where's My Car was. I was looking for joke and furtive moods, and eventually it would be a wonderful character, as it finally plays. Then I got a pretty and amazingly original movie, especially if they just had sex. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film has sex jokes and full vulgarity and is occasionally a wonderful look. -nick, but it's much more in the mind of Santa's Badge than Sorority Boys. All the characters are the people you know in real life, they are interchangeable friends who try to dream your brother and live. <br /> <br /> I thought that this movie would be empty, and I was very impressed. Yes, it's pretty far (that's a movie about a 40-year-old virgin!), But it's very well done. <br /> <br /> In the end, you're really smart to get it set for that, because it says a lot of movies, honestly, do you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his or her car?
