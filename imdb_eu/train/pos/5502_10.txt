The movie is propaganda or not (I do not think so), it shows the power of the Median. The importance of this documentary is not to show what Chavez's personality is. It's really about seeing how Bolivarians have come about, how to watch it in Chavez. Although it seems bad, and even though there is a tendency to protect a movie, I think the view on the film is absolutely legitimate. The private Venezuelan private-sector corporation saw the Venezuelans hit only a fierce blow, a neoliberal party. This film shows the way Bolivarian has seen it. Calling the Propaganda, I say your side is a trial call.
