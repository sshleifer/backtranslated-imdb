All people, my name seems strange, but there was nothing! <br /> <br /> I never saw anything like that, it was totally crazy! Of course, it's a good thing. The movie is interesting and humorous, and my absolute thing is that they all match their favorite with other things! Like little chicken, the fish that looks like being King Kong and Runt beef: "Great beauty, the beast was killed", the world war scene and more. Walt Disney does NOT lose that touch. They also saw how they saw a movie and it was like home cinema. <br /> <br /> However, some parts are not included. The lion, like the original king, did not you swear Timon and Pumbaa with Simba Scarra? In this movie, they are not! they were left behind. What's more, Pumba's reason is why he is not so sure of being encouraged by other animals and Timon, Timon, Timon. Anyone realizes that only the story of Timon was told, but the Pumbaa only had the flashbacks? <br /> <br /> But besides, HORIA "NEW!"
