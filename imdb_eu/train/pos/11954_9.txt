An excellent movie, enough laugh and an action for the audience. <br /> <br /> The last person in this movie, Woody Allen, is terribly called and I'm not here to comment on the film. </ B> <br /> This is a difficult-to-find pair, Johansson and Allen, who continues to be the ghost of an English-speaking reporter recently. He leads the quests to the assassin's house and, finally, a tragic ending. But do not let the plot fool you, the movie is really horny and the performance is excellent. <br /> <br /> It seems that at some age age, things really work. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack perform some of their imaginative careers. Also, watching film in a movie theater, you can tell that people really love Woody Allen and they'll be ready again soon. On the second screen, the viewer was switched on. There is something about the man and he really shakes Scoop. <br /> <br /> Check it out, it's worth the trip.
