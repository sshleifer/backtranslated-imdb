De Sica is becoming one of my favorite directors, but it was a hit-and-miss for me. A stupid young boy, shocked, becomes the head of a community of illegal settlers located in an empty area outside of Milan. It is a detailed and sparkling story of innocent masses, with evil capitalists and evil police officers, but slowly transforms into a fantasy tale, which develops the head of the boy to the unlimited power of Superhero Toto. 10 minutes later, I took it with Toto, smiling, and when I took the magic, I left the dust. They arranged so many wonderful shots that, among the settlers, there were so many good characters, I thought it was catastrophic that the movie was not more serious with its material. The coupling of neorealism and fantasy can be seen as an "appearance-what-we-can-do-as-work" experiment rather than a work / art that is fully developed.
