When he fled at the beginning of the 80s, Steven Spielberg directed Whoopi Goldberg in the adaptation of "The Color Purple" by Alice Walker to the desperation of an African American woman in the 1930s. With Goldberg watching Celie playing, I believe that it is the same woman as the protagonist of "Sister Act". This is a movie that could easily be - no, what you have to do - a part of the curriculum in black studies and women's research. It's a scene that can be one of the most beautiful works of editing on the screen (when you see it). I can not believe that this Oscar has not won; Behind the "Schindler's List", Spielbergen's second movie may be the best (maybe even linked to it). Also, Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne.
