This is a great horror ghost story. In the cinema room I showed some of my friends, and they were amazed until the end! Not good for blood or blood, good old suspicions. It starts from the beginning and builds and builds it. The endless one is a real conversion and it caught me unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> Correctly correct and well done. The "period piece" set in the 1920s is also added to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> So, I was surprised, Susan Hill received an Amazon book. The movie keeps track of the book. <br /> <br /> Sorry, it's not available on DVD. My copy is VHS. This is with the "Haunted", the two best Ghost Stories ever. This shows that only a little creativity surpasses "face" every day!
