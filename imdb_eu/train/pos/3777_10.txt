Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey do not think anyone is one of the biggest films of all seasons to be aware of. It somehow manages, totally inane and no-brainer, but also frightening knowledge and at the same time fast. One of the curious films that prevailed at the time, Bogus Journey can be enjoyed again and again. Notable are Death and Death "mistakes", very "emotional". Keanu wants Matrix to forget all this rubbish and wants to do everything he wants best, Ted Theodore Logan Bill and Ted: The Return.
