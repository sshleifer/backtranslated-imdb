The only and only season here aired here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I love! all lines are so good! and nowadays it is a more realistic view of adolescents and family life. However, it still maintains strong family values ​​to stick together and stay there. Their problems were real, and they really brought you to the exhibition. The show is essentially about the family called 'The Days' and his life. Abby Day (mother), Jack Day (father), Natalie Day (daughter sports), Cooper Day (outside son) and Nathan Day (young boy). Each episode has one day of his life, all over the coopers view. The view of the show that I loved the co-operative was very good. My favorite character was far away. The many things that he followed were over, I'm very sad that another season has not been done. I lost a wonderful show.
