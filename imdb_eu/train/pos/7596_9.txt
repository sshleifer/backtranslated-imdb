The first episode immediately gave a good impression on what series to expect! Mystery and good drama! I like gradually revealing stories about characters! Be excited enough to be there! This show has some mistakes! In the first two series, there are no characters in the third season! Many characters are sent, but some of them are not there! Like Rose and her husband! Where are the fish What happened to them Maybe they'll be back later! But it's a bit inconsistent! Say "Lost" in all episodes (especially during the first two seasons)! This is very difficult! I realize that the third season gives more importance to the mystery of the spectacle than to the mysterious nature! This is not a bad thing! What's more, it saves some episodes boring! One of the elements that are considered to be the force of this show is wonderful characters! You will love to love these characters! Good or bad! But eventually I want to see some mysteries and close them! The risk of "loss" is due to a reduction in the evaluation. And that would be destructive!
