The best thing in this film, like Hitchcock's films, is a thriller that does not take seriously. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hitchcock has understood that people are having fun at the movies. Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years. This is a thriller, but it has many laughs and always looks at the camera. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams is always so wonderful. Cillian Murphy is more passionate than Batman's Begins. In the old days, there were always boys who played bad boys. We do not see much of it these days, because Hollywood agents think it's a bad career, but Cillian Murphy is very good to be bad. <br /> <br /> Management is elegant. The story is good, but the same conversation can be used. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If you are looking forward to a delightful thriller for enjoyable getaway, "Red Eye" may be your card.
