This could be the best WWE second PPV after Wrestlemania, because it was a good surprise! John Cena had a great match and Chris Jericho was angry. Jeff Hardy kept his title in a short game with Willam Regal. Bubba and Spike Dudley Benoit and Guerrero's tables were quite violent. Jamie Noble had a great match with Kidman. Booker T defeated The Big Show in a second match. Biger, in the second place, Booker T with the Big Show threw scissors and sent him across the table. WWE Christians and Lance Storm decided stupid anti-Americans who were jealous of Hogan and Edge with the help of Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock got a nightmare, full of great points and the RVD kept its title through a DQ, so I was happy to keep the title. Triple H signed with Eric Bischoff and Raw, which means nothing less. And at the main event, Rock won WWE 7 times with a triple threat that defeated the WWE World Cup, Kurt Angle and Undertaker. In general, this is probably the best WWE 2002 PPV! 7/10
