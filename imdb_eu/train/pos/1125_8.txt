Michael Cacoyannis has had quite a long career, but his name is very surprisingly, including Cold War and Satin The Day the Fish Came Out. Ifigenia, however, is remarkable. Cacoyannis adapted for the play of Euripides, is a better performance for classical tragedy and has recently made his first television appearance thanks to the Flix Channel in the United States. The film is filmed on an epic scale, but it is not a big movie, paying attention to the simple story: to pray for gods, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) must sacrifice his daughter Ifigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou). , much like the queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Popes are remarkable, but Papamoschou is an impressive feature on the screen that brings interesting elements, confusing childhood innocence and thinking it is a pawn in a political game. Ideal for international film lovers.
