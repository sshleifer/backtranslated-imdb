This movie is incredible. If you have the option, see. Even if you give a warning, your eyes will shout. I have, every time I see it, and I own it and I have often seen it. The performances are remarkable. It deals with darkness, pain and loss, but it's hope. This movie led me to look at the world differently: experience vice versa, according to my English teacher. Also, if you have seen it, consider using shadows and lights. The home room is a horrible movie, which is approximately 10/10 - it's a great act, great plot and a wonderful conversation. Very tense, very moving. He does not give all the answers, but he makes a lot of points around humanity
