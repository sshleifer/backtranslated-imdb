Author / Director / Ko-Star Adam Jones is directing a lot. This is what I saw after seeing the feature film "Cross Eyed". Rarely, an independent film feels so good to me. Hand-written and masterfully directed, "Cross Eyed" takes you from the beginning to the end. Adam Jones may not be a popular name yet, but it will be. If this film were one or two "nominated actors", it would be a box office sensation. I still think that the mainstream public is in a position to go watch if a movie distributor needs time to make this movie. Anyway, if you can see it, you're not disappointed.
