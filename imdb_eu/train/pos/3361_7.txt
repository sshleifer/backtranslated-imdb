I planned to celebrate the eleventh anniversary of Marcello Mastroianni as the owner of the VHS movie; However, giving me a light and incessant Christmas marathon, I had to do this! As it happens, one of his best performances is nominated for an Oscar for the film (also with an honorary film). Sophia Loren was also one of the 14 collaborations between many other stars from Italy. Both are, by the way, playing against this type - they are a non-glamorous and homosexual housewife! <br /> <br /> Incidentally, the title has a double meaning: Hitler met with the main characters gathered in Mussolini's day in Italy (the long event is shown in a long archive). But it is more precisely called the stars 'short encounters', where they share moments of friendship, revelation and, above all, passion, although each one knows that it is essential to return to their usual existence, which makes the film a sour bitterness. . This is the character of two characters (all the other characters, that is, the story is kept in the confusing repository of the apartment block, including the rich and patriotic husband of Loren, only appearing in John Vernon's rocky beginning and closing sequences); However, the narrow seat is not the director of Scola (for the record, I saw the seventh movie and I will have 3 more in the VHS movie), and Pasqualino De Santis, which is still fundamentally low. The key - it is far away: it allows the camera to be rounded into different sections of the great building, because it requires status as aesthetics or unpleasant, but always enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> The narration, of course, depends on the two-star performances to be convincing and both provide (the display chemistry is quite unique); It's interesting, though, that Loren's homemade prizes have been separated, Mastroianni's outsiders are not extra-movable films (since, as a matter of doubt, the movie looks like his sexual deviation with Antifaxism!), international audiences are surprised!
