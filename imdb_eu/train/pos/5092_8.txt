Salomon King's Mines thought it was beautiful. My only reservation was Alison Doody. His performance was superb, but his make-up and hair were not at that time, and he always looked like it looked like other places. Patrick Swayze was a great opportunity for Alan Quatermain. It was nice to see this role as a performer looking after the movie after a long movie after seeing smooth and smooth actors like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. It was a great opportunity and I enjoyed every minute of this film. This version is not compared with Stewart Grainger in the 1950s. It was a big-screen movie and it's not for TV. I thought both quatermanns were incredible, but two semi-distributions should be kept separate. I want to see this again and I hope that Patrick Swayze will study these roles again.
