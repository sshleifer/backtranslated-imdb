It is not easy to make a movie in 18 different stories. 18 international directors have been challenged, but no one is good, some of them even more boring. But in his organization, "Paris, je t'aime" is amazing, as "Love Actually", "love goes around", especially in the city of love. Here's a summary (I'll try uninhabited) from 18 different stories. <br /> <br /> MONTMARTRE - what kind of home is secondary and nothing special. A man finds a car park and sees a lot of strange couples walking, why a girl can not find it. Suddenly, the woman goes next to her car ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> SEANA - Another one with a dull sequence, one of three teens, who is looking for a donkey, suddenly travels to a Muslim with the help of a boy. It is very basic, but with a sweet heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The love story of both Saints could be interesting by Van Sant. In the end, everything that comes after Ulliel's monologue is good, before everything gets annoyed. <br /> <br /> TUILERIES - Fun sequence by Coen brothers. Buscemi - without even saying a single word - is brilliant and it's just the horny sequence. This binds me to the end, and this has really linked you to the movie. <br /> <br /> LOIN DU 16IEME - it's also a beautiful story, even if the execution is inadequate, the heart is there. . He is the story of a Hispanic woman who has come up with her son in the early morning morning to take care of another suburban baby. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> PORTE DE CHOISY - this segment must be the most curious and curious film. A shoppers dealer arrives at a Chinatown-lookalike place in Paris. If I understood correctly, the story is about inner beauty, but I think it's wrong. <br /> <br /> BASTILLE - it's really a wonderful sequence. A man has met his wife at a restaurant to break it, so he can run away with his wife. But the wife has destructive news. Pretty basic, but really dull and beautiful! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - a sad sequence. Juliette Binoche is in love. One night the child's son wakes up. When he gets to the place, a cowboy says he can give him a greeting. One of the best segments! TOUR EIFFEL - could be two great mimicking lovers, but despite the good movie tricks, the story is not interesting and it's not fun. <br /> <br /> PARC MONCEAU - truly an excellent and original sequence, one of the best films! A young girl and an old man discuss their future and their fears about a certain man ... Cuaron does a great job, and the actors are amazing! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES - American actor (Gyllenhaal) is in love with lovers. a beautiful segment again, at the end it is very sad PLACE DES FETES - a woman arrives at an homeless man, romanticism begins with him ... because he is the love of his life. Beautiful, dull, moving, romantic, ... Place des Fêtes everyone will cry. <br /> <br /> PIGALLE - The sequence between Ardant and Hoskins is boring, in search of new emotions in their relationship ... very unfunny and unromantic, Pigalle is left behind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <Back A young man (Wood) finds a victim who has killed a vampire ... Tourism and vampires .. They will fall in love! Madeleine is superb, terrifying and curiously romantic. <br /> <br /> PERE-LACHAISE: another segment. Directed by Wes Craven, it could be a great deal like Mortimer and Sewell, but Père-Lachaise is just the usual, not original. <br /> <br /> FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS - TRUE rumors, Twyker's short, amazing and well-made short film. A blind man picks up the phone and hears his girlfriend (Portman - really amazing) that breaks him. It reflects their relationship. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER Latin - Although Depardieu runs this segment, and Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu are also stars, this segment is also diarrhea. Nothing happens, actors lack chemistry. <br /> <br /> 14 ARRONDISSEMENT - the last sequence is at once ridiculous and dull. An American tells in his French class about his trip to Paris. His French is really daunting, but at the end of the segment, he realized that Paris is much more eye-catching. <br /> <br /> At the back of the feist, "Paris, je t'aime" ends. In a sweet tone I do not want to leave, even though some segments have bored hell, the movie organization is great! A truly cinematic experience aimed at young and old people. Paris, I love you!
