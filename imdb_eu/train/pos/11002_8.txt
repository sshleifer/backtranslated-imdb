The director of Vincenzo Natali's Cypher is an inventive and complex thriller, but despite many interruptions and concentrations, it can be a fun experience. <br /> <br /> A stay in Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) -By husband, wife, has decided to add a little bit of their everyday existence to work as a spy company of high-tech company Digi Corp. His work is to travel to conferences around the country (with his personality asserted by Jack Thursby) and secretly gave lectures to his masters through a small electronic social media. <br /> <br /> Actually, discourses cover much less activity. Together with Morgan, with her conference, she cleans herself. Drinking water drugs temporarily includes commas, forgot to pass through them and continually take on their new identities. After being completely convinced of other people, they are called to apply for job placement companies with competitive advantage so they can use corporate spying. Rita Foster (Lucy Liu) is the operator-contracted shadow intervention, which is opening the eyes of Morgan, which is really happening. Morgan gives the antidote to the mind to change medication to deal with brain cleansing techniques. Likewise, if Digi Corp thinks Jack Thursby thinks he does not think it, he warns that it will be "expelled". Morgan plays and has asked for a job against Sunways. <br /> <br /> However, arriving at his workplace, he is given a polygraph test and immediately he's rumbled as a spying. Luckily, Sunways boss Digi Corp sees fake data as a great opportunity to feed, and Morgan turns into a double agent. <br /> <br /> From now on, things get harder and harder; It becomes the plot and becomes the old Morgan, who does not believe in anyone. Eventually it's exciting, they eventually turn out to be clear (but if you've followed the events very carefully). Natali manages the trustworthy director and has no doubt that he has a great ability to produce elegant films. a pretty little budget. He has achieved great performances with his talented work; Jeremy Northam, in particular, is wonderful at the beginning that Morgan's naked babe portrait is perfected. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a wonderful movie of a director he wants to choose. I hope I am eagerly waiting. For its next projects, High Rise and Necropolis.
