In this way, together with Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes meet in the west. The last couple are examining the murders of one of the following books; Pitt is a killer of the series, Davek (not known by Davis) and Juliette, his friend, not everyone, a friend. This is a good cast and the story moves, but Pitt is not terrifying as a horrific killer, even though he has one of his best roles. It's best for Michelle Forbes, who always shines brightly, in the role of "Homicide: Life on the Street" or in a short series of Wonderland.
