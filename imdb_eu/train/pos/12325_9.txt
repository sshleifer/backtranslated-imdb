I watched this movie for the first time when I was sent by the BBC in 1988, when 2000AD worked in the UK in 2000. Steve Parkhouse recorded my friends on VHS and sent me for me. Until now, I saw only Shaw Bros Kung Fu movies, with their bright lighting (so that the viewers could clearly see the movements), was a revelation, Ridley Scott was left to see Hong Kong. This is the first exhibition by Tsui Hark (dramatically, "Choy Huk"). <br /> <br /> However, for all the exterior lighting of smoke and the ambitious special effects (Stop-motion?) in a Hong Kong movie?), in the heart of the Chinese GHOST STORY, there is a simple and moving love story in Leslie Cheung's performance for outstanding talent (what a tragic waste of a tragic life!) and beauty. and elegance in Joey Wong. Given that Joey is gorgeous, but his right balletic gestures give his character an impossible eroticism that is difficult to examine. And if Joey is just over 20 years old (gawd, among which is not there?) It will always be a permanent image of this actor. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers have said that due to the simplistic movie, there is no surprises, but this movie is missing out on the famous Chinese tale written by Pu Songling around 1700! That's how it's predictable at the end of Romeo and Juliet, copying WEST SIDE STORY. (Just to get that chest!) <br /> <br /> For me, GHOST STORY is an essential Chinese romantic story. It has a great tragedy, since Chio Sin and Sin Sein can never be together. It's about to be mature, since no one of us can reach a great loss. About sacrifice, sacrifice is a fundamental component of True Love. And Wu Ma's comedy styles do not hurt. <br /> <br /> Enjoy if you do not see Chinese Phantom through a Western culture filter and you will do well.
