When I saw the dentist, I thought it was very nice. But this movie is not for everyone, especially people who do not like the scene, because the dentist has a lot of scenes. That's why R18 grade. Dr. Alan Feinstone is about dentists, whose wife Brooke swears a swimmer. It is better to see the dentist "before" go. But if you do not like going to a dentist, then it's better not to see it, as you go back to life. The dentist has the best blood blood I have ever seen. Who has ever seen a movie with a dentist (Spoiler) without spotting his spouse's wife's teeth without covering anesthesia? Overall movement, but not everyone.
