Obviously, few people have seen the movie, since no one sent comments. This will not miss a movie. In the end, he won the George Peabody Prize and the Humanitas Prize. Paul Winfield had to win the award for the excellent performance of this film. Eugene Logan was a writer for television, and he also participated in another film about humanity or his loss through the technical consultant of Truman Capote's Glass House film. This movie is available on DVD. If someone is interested, I'll write another letter, how Eugene Logan had become a technical adviser to a movie by Truman Capote. Thanks for reading and I hope you can find a way to see these two movies.
