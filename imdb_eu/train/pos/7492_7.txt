Even if it's not a horror movie, in this traditional sense, this strange little movie looks like merchandise. A vampire seems to be free in a small German town that sucks his blood. Karl Brettschneider, a police inspector, in his first role in Melvyn Douglas, skeptic believes that a murderer is not thinking of a vampire. In his opinion, Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray), an observer for the girlfriend and laboratory assistant, is a friend of Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill). The famous scientist apparently goes along with vampire theory. Citizens believe Herman Gleib has allegedly played the usual innocence of Dwight Frye, which seems to be doing his job well. The film has humor to alleviate the intensity associated with all the murders committed. A fun part is Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), Ruth Bertin's aunt, weird but Herman has not become a bat but a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye are a good comedy team. <br /> <br /> This budget film brings together the names of the "Dr. Caligari's cabinet" with Dr. Niemann, with the power of suggestion to make a somnambulist, by "Frankenstein", to help create human blood in the laboratory and "Dracula ", because the murderer believes that the inspector and his girlfriend are the work of a bloodhound. The director Frank R. Strayer mixes well with a bit of good comedy. Mixing works I saw the old versions used to increase the ambience they used to paint colors. So try to see this version if possible.
