I have had a lot of problems with this movie, and I have heard a lot of criticism, saying they are excessive and incorrect. It's true, it has been running for over three hours, but I was surprised that it was so fast. I do not believe in any way that it is wrong, I think the rating of the IMDb is very decent. The movie is wonderful, with beautiful outfits and excellent effects, and James Cameron's management rarely focuses. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best plays, Jack and Kate Winslet are beautiful. David Warner, an excellent actor, stole all the scenes. The story is very rich in detail, and the development of the character is hot, it is obvious that this love story is moving, but the first time the movie is a bit slow. The last hour is very awful, and I will admit that I was at the edge of my seat when the Titan sank. I will also say very mobile five minutes later. James Horner's music was beautiful, although I was never a fan of My Heart Will Go On. The miniseries of 1996 were good, but they underwent undeveloped scenes and bad history. In general, I give Titanic 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox.
