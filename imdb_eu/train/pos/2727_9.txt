One of the best films of ever-doing crime and the true crime of Truman Capote, who invented the novel, was very faithful to the book. Quincy Jones music scores and excellent performance by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake, Dick and Perry, the murderers. Why not follow a great star to make this movie a mysterious one. <br /> <br /> Black and white cinematography must be edited in this film. Re-generating the killings is terrifying and because murder is a real imagination, it's even more terrifying than those who showed off the rifle. The movie was shot in a real house that was sold to another person after a murder. The film feels very documentary. In addition to the current scene of the Clutter's house, other scenes were filmed at petrol stations and the killers actually went to stores. Babe, Nancy Clutter's beloved horse is also in the movie. Will Geer has a great turn as a prosecutor in a short trial, which is not only shot in a real court, but a jury from Clutter's real killings portrays the jury. <br /> <br /> This is a solid movie, every time you see it is terrifying.
