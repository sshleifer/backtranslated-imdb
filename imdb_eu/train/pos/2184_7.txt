While he was a pretty musician, he joined me with this movie, as Basil Rathbone, a composer and Oscar Levant as his assistant, was an unexpected chemical comedy. It is a great and ordinary artificial age (far away from its well-known roles, threatening criminals, or logical cold Sherlock Holmes), Rathbone's character is not a way to get out of bed. And this support is Starbuck, with Oscar Levant playing with the usual droll humor. When Rackbone Starbuck nominated Crosby's fantastic character, Rathbone Starbuck says: "It's my mind," Levante replied: "It's just a part-time job." This is, of course, that overcomes Rathbone (or more), who is busy with his next successful song. Another reviewer said that Rathbone could be so fun! Bad did not have more opportunities to show his comedy talent.
