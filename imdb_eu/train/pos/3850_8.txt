This is Paul Verhoeven's latest Dutch film "Basic Instinct", "Robocop" and "Total Recall" for the production of Dutch films. Gerard Reve opens the story with a compassionate writer who captures prey to predatory tales with evil imagination. Gerard has been invited to speak at a literary meeting point in the seafront for an hour or so, is invited to Amsterdam. Verhoeven shows how Gerard's imagination turns the reality. If the question writes about whether or not some insanity is readily accepted by the newspaper, "and the boom" says "I read the doom," "flood", I see "I read the blood. I'm dead. '" When it tells a story once more more begins to believe; "Truth is a lie." An offer is made available to the club by the guest's money nightmare, to be a wealthy beauty salon. As she knows her and her husband is aware that she is dead, she starts thinking about a black widow. Is this a turn for reality or is it a killer? It's a psychological drama and I remember the old movies, my favorite genre. Looking at the body of the work, it also seems to be Paul Verhoeven, and he is a masterpiece by questioning reality comprehension. The typical Hollywood rate is a pleasant pace change. I saw it in 1983 and it's a movie "stuck".
