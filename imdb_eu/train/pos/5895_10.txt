I read an article about the Olympic and personal travel of Dan Jansen before I saw the movie. I'm always fascinated by the story of a story I'm hoping for and changing the events of life. This is no exception. <br /> <br /> The background of the characters given gives a sense of family proximity and how positively they put them. others caused life. I can not talk about the exact details of this particular movie, it's a habit that some creative licenses are made while planning a script. However, Dan and his family's spirits are important here. <br /> <br /> The story to be told is a movie worth a story. I felt empathy for the characters and I was encouraged at the end.
