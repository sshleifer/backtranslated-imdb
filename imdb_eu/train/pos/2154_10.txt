I have often seen this movie and I will never tire of it. It's a classic in every sense of the word. The movie is a hysterical and fun at the same time. For all those who are not "subtitles" or foreigners, open the mind. The movie "Beginners" is great because the story is so funny. I'm not wrong to write, 100% is Japanese (and that's what works), but everyone gets it out (even if it's a laugh for a great person named Mr. Aoki). I have seen one of the funniest characters!) <br /> <br /> I can not think of this movie without a smile! I love ... and I think most people.
