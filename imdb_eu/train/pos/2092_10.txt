I saw this movie with some curiosity. Paul Muni played in China and 2), Luise Rainer deserved his Oscar. I was away from film outside! After seeing only one Muni movie, I expected the same kind of performance here. I was really wrong. As Hollywood Hollywood could have criticized as a simple stereotype in the Hollywood idea, I thought it was appropriate for the task. If Keye Luke had wanted to play the main role, he could play it in the same way. <br /> <br /> I was impressed with the use of camera work and the scene of the crowd. especially when O-Lan was a slave in the lurch of the palace. The graphic and harsh environments of displacement and drought were not similar to those of the time, which were glitter and glitter. I saw this film come to an end. I can not say the same today to "equal".
