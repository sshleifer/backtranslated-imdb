It was very well written, directed and performed ... except for the best 2000s of the 2000s, except for the best 80s! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his game. Scarlett Johansson's horny Woody has proven how she has become a curious actor. <br /> <br /> It's no longer refreshing on the love screen with the head mum. He plays a bunch of magicians. <br /> <br /> Some of the comments that were rejected by this film were made. Do not let it see a wonderful movie for you. I saw people in the crowd as I lost the next line I laughed at. If you like films from the 70's of Woody Allen, you'll regret it. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie openly, so you can do it with a smile.
