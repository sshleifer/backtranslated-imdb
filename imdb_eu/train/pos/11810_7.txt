Although I still liked it. Warren Beatty is like a comic hero. This set, which saves this movie, is an incredible sketch and casts a dreaded script. I expected something less noticeable in terms of action or plot but very little. The main reason to watch this movie is to see some of the biggest Hollywood stars in this extraordinary movie. <br /> <br /> A horror movie and a person's movie was not the person that Madonna was. He was not a member of this movie and his plays were pretty bad. At some points the movie stopped. Something else was expected and you did not get anything. Al Pacino dude plays very badly and does well. He and Beatty make a great and excellent guy. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty as well as a movie from Istars. I did not see Ishtar, but I heard bad things. This movie is a good thing, but it can be a lot better. I liked a child, it seemed good to me, and the sight is amazing, the sets are incredible, the writing is unreasonable, and yet I expected so much the better in the movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> <br /> Especially I think the end was not enough. It was interesting, but I thought it would be a bit more complete for this big-scale movie. The reason to see this movie is an atmosphere. The film uses only 7 colors of the comic super vision. <br /> <br /> They also featured costumes and makeup. The wicked facial makeup was great. Beatty is no bigger than life. However, the movie could be much more. Batman is better than me for any other comic adaptation that happened to me at the same time. Of course, this movie is much bigger in terms of gross.
