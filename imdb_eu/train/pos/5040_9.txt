I first saw the Frailty trailer from Yahoo Movies after listening to Stephen King's glorious sky. Not a fan of two stars, I want to see yet because I am a thriller. <br /> <br /> I did not disappoint. The play was excellent, especially for young boys. I usually cause children, but Young Adam and Young Fenton have been great. It was also directed by Bill Paxton's work. It was shot beautifully. <br /> <br /> Soil lies too. In the end, they knocked out three hard and fast lies, and I did not see them. The last tour of the film, along with the seriousness of what was revealed, gives me today's smile, although I've seen the movie so many times. <br /> <br /> A real treasure. .
