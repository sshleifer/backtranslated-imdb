Do you know Our spirit is based on this revolution, it's sleepy ... I can see it, I think it !! Well ... Until the 25th of April 1974, our freedom was limited, we did not have freedom of speech, but when we arrived at the revolution, it seems that the Portuguese lost their opinion, we did not use freedom of speech! That's the result of the revolution! It seems this is clear ... ... About the movie ... I think there are some mistakes in the performance of some characters, but the way I see in Portuguese movies is pretty good! I like it a lot!
