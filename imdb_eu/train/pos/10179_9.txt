De Grot is a very good movie. The great plot is created in the novel by Tim Krabb√©, which has also adapted to this story on the screen. Some of the plays of the upper theater, not only Van Huet, but most of all, Marcel Hensema, especially did the TV work before making Axel van de Graaf. The movie plays as a thriller and creates a great mood. Next, we begin to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story is revealed in a very credible flashback structure, which adds a more romantic aspect and film character drama. In the end, all this will end with the emotional ending, as the audience will be caught by their throats. Make sure you know the least you can see to watch this movie. It is essential, especially if you like the 'Spoorloos' adaptation (The Vanishing original screen).
