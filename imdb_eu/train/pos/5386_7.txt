This film played well in 1932 and probably would not work well because today's style is old and similar. However, as with me, if you are the kind of oldest Hollywood movie you like, you will cut a bit of film and enjoy what it is - an interesting soap. <br /> <br /> The movie is a problem during pregnancy. There are about a dozen beds in this large room where women are waiting for birth, but doctors are worried about complications (gypsies - a room would actually traumatize their mother!). And like "Love Boat" or "Fantasy Island", each mother has her own unique story. With so many crazy and crazy stories, you have to interrupt credibility. I liked it a bit and I liked the movie. <br /> <br /> Here are some stories: it involves a father. You do not see a mother, but she is a very nervous father and enters comic relief. However, it was wonderful here - very moving. <br /> <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden are sad cases. Loretta's prison will be sent to the hospital - she apparently killed a terrible guy. You do not know exactly what happened, but you think he was trying! However, he was given a 20-year sentence - and his husband is dedicated to him and, as he can, is on his side. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell is a horrible person. She has mother of hamster's moods: a really bad and alcoholic hamster! It's pretty fun and it can be seen in most of the movies. I drank from hot bottles of gin full of water and I drank that I could not afford to sell it when I learned to sell its twin! At the end of the film, the heart of Hollywood-style heart change was supposed to be moving - I found out I've found it. <br /> <br /> There is a woman born to a baby born. . It's amazing, false, lady returned in the same room, thanks to women waiting for birth! A mad woman, since you have recently lost a baby, it is far away from a psychiatric unit. She stresses the baby. Later he fled again and really takes a child! <br /> <br /> They are stories more than this, but what I'm talking about is the main one. As I said, it's a television series that is very entertaining - and it's very sad for some stories. The end, in particular, is a heartbreak and is exceptionally well done. There were several good performances, mostly as the main nurse Farrell and Aline MacMahon. In the end, a very good movie - and I do not know why the film had to be renewed a few years later (that is Warner Brothers).
