<br /> <br /> An old man works as a mental hospital in a mental hospital to try to get him close to his own wife and his wife. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the silent neglected masterpieces and the extravagance of Japanese cinema history. Lost long thought, a printout of the 70s was discovered and a music bandwidth has been added, which perfectly adapts to the images. Dr. Caligary's cabinet could have caused (Kinugasa director said he had never seen German films). However, she goes beyond her style and she portrays more rebellious (and colder) mentality within the prisoners of asylum. To achieve this, the film uses every one of the techniques of the time: from a variety of exhibits to a subjective point of view, angle bending of cameras, fast and slow movement, expressionist and superimposed lighting. The following film is very complex, because it has no intertitles. The movie rains in the windows of the hospital, shoving the winds and thunderous trees. Disturbing weather metaphors the mental state of patients and includes one of them: the former dancer. The combination of sounds generated by rain, wind and thunder is a music that encourages the dancer to enter an almost hypnotic dance. Another sequence of the same illness that is engaged in another dance is awaiting other prisoners. Various exhibitions of the dancer are a confused view of the patient and the "vision" of the world. <br /> <br /> These are amazing examples with an amazing film that is trying to represent the unconscious and visionary of patients. "Sane" world <br /> <br /> <br /> Three way to move.
