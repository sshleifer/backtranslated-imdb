The performances were excellent, the costume gave them a unique feeling of that era and was a Victorian Living History, I was impressed by the exactness and details of the army. <br /> <br /> I would not have to say that you have to keep Kelly saga aware of the flow of this movie but understand the events and attitudes that you will need a bit of historical knowledge of that era. Do not expect, like most people, that we all know the accented Auzzie, at that time, was a country in childhood. <br /> <br /> The story is a fictional item, but it is necessary for the film to be monitored. Gregor Jordan told the film that he wanted to "want to interest", and that's what happened with me. The movie will appear here. <br /> <br /> See and NOT FEEL
