When I was 15, the movie was premiered on television. As I was growing in Texas, I understood the boredom and monotony of teenagers. This movie touched my impatient heart of my teenagers and I remembered it in the last twelve years. I've recently watched the 2nd, 3rd, and fourth times thanks to the LOVE channel. I still cry because the movie touches the confused teens inside.
