Film and nutrition disorders are one of the many issues that are avoided. This movie shows. It's not glamorous to be enjoyed by the audience, it shows the true truth, which makes it all the more powerful. I only saw it once and it was a few years ago, but I remember everything and how I feel. The movie is very powerful and it is a good help for anyone with nutritional imbalance to stop the will. We need to be around the movies - to help people and avoid glamorous things.
