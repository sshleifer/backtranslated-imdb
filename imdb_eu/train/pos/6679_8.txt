I'm going to apologize for this movie: far, far away, there are many broad-angle approaches that are more irrational than resistance, quite reasonable. I pushed those first ten minutes. Then I made a ceasefire with a horrible movie; and before I finished the movie, I stopped watching over. This is a very rich comedy that's too rich. It's horny, it's emotional, it's an excellent presentation of the cast's comics, and yet, Usher looks at his characters by means of a cold-looking fish - he does not mind answering them. "Mystery Men" is no more fun, not only clearer, but also deeper, than anyone else's credit. The jokes in the Austin Powers movie, for instance, are fun to be more fun than joking here. "Satan's Mystery" frightens the boy when he deserves something and gently bites him. He does not insult any old thing. That is why, according to what some critics have (they do not know what they are), it runs out of ideas. <br /> <br /> 'Super' is an attractive series of heroes. Surely they are secondary, but they are not only a secondary rate. Blue Rajah, for example, tosses out to the people, and that's not good. On the other hand, it is not a bad comic. It is better than most people in their field, and has worked diligently. It's not a jester, that's a much more fun character than him. If Superman Kapa is a boy, Men's Mysteries are the smallest half-gods that come from the slopes of the Mount Olympus. Much more fun; much more lovable.
