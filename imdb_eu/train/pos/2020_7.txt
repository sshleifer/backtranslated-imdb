SPOILERS BOARD! <br /> <br /> I saw a video of this advertisement. Then my sister found her book. I rented it on the day I finished the book. I thought the book was very memorable. The group was a great Fitzgerald. Helen and Rupert Graves hated Arthur. Costumes, music and adjustments are very beautiful. <br /> <br /> NOTE! ON THESE CASES <br /> <br /> Some sex scenes have been added to the downside and there are some violence. That's why the video is 15. There are other things too. I felt that the accuracy was down. Even though this book is better than this, I am glad I saw it and I would recommend it to people who read the book, who are fans of Bronte or costume theater (I'm all 3!), If you accelerate through Sex. scenes This book is underneath below. Ana Brontes's books are not very popular or well-known, such as Jane Erye or Wuthering Heights, which is included in the television and film. Another thing. When I read the book, I was amazed how religious it was, but here they all came out! <br /> <br /> 7
