This movie is "WOW!" It's one of them. movies It's not the best movie of all time, but I'm shocked. T.V. It was a movie but it was in Elvis. I'm sure the Imitator could say, since there was only one Elvis, but I can safely say that Kurt Russel was very close to being a real thing. It was one of the greatest antiquities I've ever seen. He really believed that it was. I learned a lot from the life of Elvis to watch the movie. And you're not leaving a piece of TV: it's really a wonderful movie! And Kurt Russel Elvis could be twin :)
