*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** After two outputs ("Magnum Force" and "The Enforcer"), Harry Dirty seems to have recovered the "Sudden Impact" breakthrough. He has a strong sense of solidity: the charisma of Clint Eastwood, who also directed and exhibits a story that goes through enough time and great energy scenes. <br /> <br /> Once the case takes Harry. Outside of San Francisco's party (again, after a few questions, he has problems with his bosses), the San Paulo farmhouse. There, (NOTE: a potential spoiler), a bass team is dying in a group, suddenly, a woman who was raped a few years ago in the gang, and her sister has been in a state of catatony from the attack. /> <br /> The murderer Sondra Lock has imagined and Jennifer Spencer makes an interesting mix of compassion and cold blood. When Locke's eyes are cold and frozen, trying to avenge his sister's hospital or oppress it, they are very effective in painting a portrait of suffering and anger in women. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Although the flashback scene, though not explicitly graphic, is a nightmare, and it is enough for the audience to go to Jennifer when their attackers die. <br /> <br /> Some will discard the "sudden effect" to the trash. manipulative vengeance It's true at a certain level, but it's a well-made trash. What works for the film's advantage is Sondra Lock's performance, since his wounds are more visible in his paintings than in gestures, gestures or speech. From the point of view of what we have here is an action movie. <br /> <br /> Do you think fraud or idea can be taken to punish you with some necessary means, but the mystery behind the death becomes clear. Harry (aware that there is no conversation with wisdom) will present the chosen one: what should be done about the murderer, whose motivation he can sympathize with, but their conduct is not allowed by law. This makes the story more interesting than the usual Harry Dirty. <br /> <br /> The other releasing quality of the movie is Eastwood's direction. After all, Harry Dirty is a movie, and Eastwood knows the characters better than others. The film is directed by style and intelligence, and the action scene will be very lucrative. Here are some of the "Harry's best moments" series, the most popular of Harry, such as "Ahead: make my day." <br /> <br /> "Sudden Impact" is a movie. The courage of the crime to present a story about an insolvent crime and presenting the consequences of these brutal consequences. Also, a well-detected story is a wonderful detective. And definitely never sad. According to these criteria, it has been incredibly successful.
