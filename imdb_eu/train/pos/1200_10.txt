Do not hesitate, this is the story of morality. Granger is a former buffalo hunter, who once stormed Taylor into the plain. Granger can see that the end is close, and he feels deeply when cattle are hunted by the Indians and the land itself. Taylor, on the other hand, admits the fact that the Buffalo or Indians are dying of being a woman. Granger is the role of a huntsman who is tortured, but Taylor steals the show, demented and immoral, "everyman," for quick buck and holidays. There's not a lot of bang-bang here, but the story is moving faster, and Nolan treats us with a good interpretation of its superb characters. The subject of this story is as touching as it is today, a man of the 1800 with the earth and what is the relationship and the racism. Censors, in relation to 'bawdy house', Taylor's relationship and a large part of the conversation, had to shake their whistles. Although it is bad, it's really a great western image.
