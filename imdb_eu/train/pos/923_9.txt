I have never seen on TV, but I rented the DVD as soon as Netflix was available. I had a great hope and I did not disappoint. It's fun and animation is great. The level of quality I just expected from feature films, so I was surprised by bad comments about it. Maybe the DVD release was a better animation? A DVD bonus was fun to watch two versions of the rider. I have come and I like it for adults. They are not just children who like cute animated characters. As some people have claimed, "there is no where," but I know that some parents would not want to see their children. I am very disappointed that they have canceled. I want to produce more episodes. Or perhaps a movie.
