I have watched all the Miyazaki films and they are beautiful and fascinating. But this rises above the rest. This movie has completely impressed me! <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta and with their delicious and careful friendship. The movies were made for me. Of course, animation is superb and captures the feelings of music in the film. But the characters in this movie are a bright star: they are very well developed and full of personality. <br /> <br /> Now, let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie (in English) Subs). English dub is good (especially), but compared to the original language version. The voices are better, the conversation, everything. So I see and hear the way I was originally.
