Here's a real curious. The PSYCHO shower scene starts at another campus, and then it is foggy to spring up with some coeds and doofy boyfriends to the south of Spring Break. The problems have come into the gigantic region that runs the Sheriff Dean homilide. A University Cutie walks through the woods, witnesses to a sheriff's murder and the head is open. Later, the MACON COUNTY LINE-time exploits the Dean stems, captures them and kills one of the awful witnesses one by one. Tony March is a Happy Thanksgiving Shotgun. The overall tone of the movie is really disturbing. At the end it is so violent that you think almost the director is a short film; It is also a despair research. SHALLOW GRAVE is essential for misanthropies, misogynes and nihilists all over the world.
