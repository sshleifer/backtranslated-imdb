Yesterday, I saw the movie Turner, and I could not see it until the end of the observation, although I guess what would happen. Farrell had a great job, and the others did a great job. It seems that some limits were limited, but I absolutely love it !! If you can see it please! I've really cried in a few scenes, but I think you would have been a mother. Loretta is beautiful, and I was surprised to think that it was the same idea to wipe their moms, it seemed before that time. I have said, if you can see and do not listen to critics. As I said, I laughed, I cried! I like it!
