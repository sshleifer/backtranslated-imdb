No, I'm telling lies, it's not the best movie of all time, but the movie I know is not a really nice movie. <br /> <br /> Jay Leno is a police policeman with the protagonist. and Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi), a car prototype that is missing or some story about something fluff, but that does not matter. This film is a very fun reason because of the interaction between the two directors, they at first enjoy and mistrust each other, but the fate ends with a great tour. Every cultural difference is done very well, seeing it is very fun, it is totally ridiculous, but it is cheesy and enjoyable. The soundtrack is cool, it's cheesy again in 80s, it fits the movie, I'm trying to find a song in the years, but I'm working on some of them. The words seem I have not found. <br /> <br /> This movie is another thing that is the most fantastic payment for any movie, but I will not do it, ah! As a result, I would take this 48-hour movie by Eddie Murphys to Beverly Hills Police and Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence. If you are looking for a friend's movie and "will give you black police, they'll be feeding you with the white police," they'll feed you. It would be very enjoyable to be amazed that you have the whole formula "with the white police who come across the Japanese police force." <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this 7 honest one I like more than that. I would rather have 8 things than I would like to see. However, I know that this movie looks like it is a bit crazy.
