Compared to all other review opinions, this movie was really amazing! I gladly saw it, and I expected that I was bored with topical, jokes and excessive ones, which they ordered all the trailers. <br /> <br /> However, after 5 minutes, I really laughed and enjoyed enjoying refreshing. to act Only with a "humor of the toilet", Over Her Dead Body gets a really fun stage and, without too much damage, some moments of animals are hilarious. <br /> <br /> Basic ingredients are a good movie there; script, actress and actors and other recent romantic comedy essays, this movie is high. <br /> <br /> Surely, you will not learn anything, nor will you turn it spiritually, but if you go, it's probably safe to open!
