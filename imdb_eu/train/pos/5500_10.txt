This documentary (Now available for free at Video.Google.Com) is to show the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone should see it. <br /> <br /> Chavez was elected to the 1998 ballot. Its platform diverted its rich oil wealth, an average of 20% and the poorest 80%. Venezuelan waters were banned from foreign fishing nets. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors free of charge to treat illnesses. He eliminated Illiteracy and created free Universities. <br /> <br /> But it was a 30% tax on oil companies in the Bush administration. In 2002, Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain, the Irish filmmaker, interviewed Chavez in the presidential palace on their social programs. The CIA launched a state sponsored project. Taking chambers, Chavez was taken out of the country and captured. As it was announced on national TV, he had "resigned." <br /> <br /> But the Venezuelan poor did not believe the media. Thousands went to the palace and returned to Chavez. In front of these numbers, the military were raised by the leaders of the collective states and the lines escaped to the U.S. Chavez was saved by military helicopters and returned to retirement.
