First of all, first and foremost, I never frightened this weird gem ("Little Mermaid" on the other ...). As my title says, it was one of the films of childhood film I love as a teenager. It is a beautiful and sour film about a bad man called the German Shepherd (referred to by Burt Reynolds), whose leader has killed the crime (he has been named Carface). Charlie will be sent directly to heaven first and foremost "because all dogs are going to heaven, unlike people, dogs are naturally good and loyal and pleasing." Chalie returns to the Earth, because the end of his life's clock, his best friend, Itchy and Anne-Marie played a small orphanage. I saw the baby all the time and sometimes I see it. In any case, the nice movie is sweet and sour, as I said before, you can leave your tears in your eyes ...
