11 years ago I watched this movie with my best friend. I suppose I took my teeth, I did not feel very well. <br /> <br /> At last I liked it. It is a tough guard, as well as reconciliation, if you take a tough state that involves unwanted betrayal, power, money, drug trafficking and a foreign prison. <br /> <br /> The effect is on the first level. The two stars I liked best and that's good. Claire Danes as beautiful and charming as Kate Beckinsale is very hot and gives an excellent performance. Bill Pullman is also very good and shows its historical features. <br /> <br /> They play a lot of soil and a visual experience is interesting. It also shows difficult times in Thailand. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie. Many movies like this have not been created lately. You should think about many things ...
