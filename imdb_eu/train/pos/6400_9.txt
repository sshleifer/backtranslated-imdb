This film is an excellent example of beautiful stories. The play is excellent. The inspiring story is very manipulative or false. Some points were probably because people were really good or bad, but considering Hollywood's movie, they kept up. There were not any movies to explode, even if they had an opportunity. Although the movie, though suspensful fragments, has not become an action movie. So this story causes attention to a wonderful man, unfortunately, on ordinary occasions. Well done!
