One of the best dramatic films ever seen. We work in the church, and this is what can be used as an instrument that emphasizes all the good things the actors can do in their work. I recommend this, especially as a "must see" for those who are interested in acting. There are several notes scenes. In the scene of a cemetery, when Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows this scene going to elementary school), and he has done very well with himself. The logic used in this scene was horrible - I think more than a Shakespeare testament. For the second time, I liked Hamlet, Horatio and Robin Williams as the next character.
