Did you know that Anthony Kiedis (father of the Red Hot Chili Peppers singer) is in this movie. Blackie Dammit is Anthony's father. After reading the autobiography of "Scar Tissue" Anthony, I noticed and saw his father's picture. I thought, "Well, that type I saw in the eighties, it seemed like a guy in the movie, and I read more and said that his father had a few role-playing roles, compared to that of the site." Searching on the web, I realized that his father was really a movie. It's funny, because it does not mention in the book that it will be in this movie. Perhaps his son embarrassed his father's work in the theater, but he needed it. I think that his father, Blackie, made a great job.
