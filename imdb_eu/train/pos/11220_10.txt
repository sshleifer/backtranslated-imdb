Goal Up! Gunbuster is one of the anime series that has been written in the classic style. I love this series completely and I still remain a favorite anime today. Although Gainax's first animated product was not his first OVA series. At the end of the 2nd session, as a serious drama, when Noriko Takaya was forced to revive his father's death, man was killed in the initial mankind's human race with the insect race. As a result of his father's death, he wants to become a pilot in Noriko. But his lack of confidence proves that the path is achieved and shakes. His friend, Kazumi Amano, also doubts that he has been selected as a Noriko rider. However, Noriko coach Koichiro Ota believes. And he has found that he has achieved his personal role as a pilot, as he was survived by the death of Noriko's father. <br /> <br /> Other characters Jung-Freud, a Russian rider Boride, assigned to work with Noriko and Kazumi, Smith Smith, Toren, who has lost his personal interest in love, who has died in his first order and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko childhood friend . The participation of chemistry is also interesting, although Noriko is extinct in the space, Chemical remains behind the Earth to live normal life. And for the time of dilation activities, Chemiki usually lives on Earth, while he was at the same age school in Norita. At the end of the series, Noriko is about 18 years old in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> All, that is, if you want to see a great anime series that is a huge robot. Mecca and Gainax animation. If you want to see other shows from Hideaki Anno, or if you're a fan of Haruhi Mikimoto's work, give this show an opportunity. It will grow on you.
