Clara Bow's silent film since 1927 is Rain's spin-off. Bow is in love with Clive Brook who falls in with the English engineer.

She is ready to divorce her wives, when she's in the middle of a fortune. Bow fixes his fast hash. <br /> <br /> Bow has a great personality and has good scenes: his naked bath, her hula grass skirt and her dog's rescue scene with Bow and Brook. stunts <br /> <br /> Note: The bad credit listing is wrong. Movie Credits (DVD) are listed by Patricia Dupont, Mrs. Haldane --- not Margaret Truax.
