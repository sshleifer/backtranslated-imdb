I loved Dedee Pfeiffer (right is it written?) In Cybil. I did not see a bit to see and I forgot how much I lost. I thought I had a great job. There was also a pretty good support cast. In some corners, her daughter was like a young Nicole Kidman. The router was terribly awesome and the story generally had good turns. The young boy was a hottie. I thought the husband definitely needed something to do. <br /> <br /> Previously I received Lifetime Movie Network for Christmas and I love these films. I keep my interest and I will see it again when they restart. Does someone else recommend similar movies? Post a table or send me a private message if you want. Thank you in advance. Aboutagirly.
