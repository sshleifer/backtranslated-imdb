I really liked this movie. All the aspects of the film were the most important ones, for me, however, the script and the theater. This is one of the most powerful roles of Richard Widmark. It is totally incredible in his performance. Kuriosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum can play this role. This is the work I remember about the first work of Jean Peter. He was so surprised that I would definitely look at the other work. Thelma Ritter, being a charitable role, was nominated for an Academy Award nomination. This film works on all levels. Black and white photography is very convenient and connects the story from the beginning to the viewer. Widmark and Peters have a great chemistry in an angry love. Highly recommended, 9/10.
