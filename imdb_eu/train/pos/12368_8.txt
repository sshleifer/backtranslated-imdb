To get the white-haired companion turned on TV, I heard a "apartment with 400 fully furnished apartments." So I got into the TV room waiting for another 70's movie and much more. Luckily, I pressed the start button (DVR buffer) and the recording button to see it completely. (Cinemax uncut and HD less!) Apart from the holes in the story and the constant periodic interview / events, this is effective. Thriller worth the time to watch. Curious and progressive times: Beverly D'Angelo character faces Alison Parker, led by Cristina Raines, horrified by Parker, with her father, very bad. cinema) The 70's film has bad clothes (polyester suits and bad guys) and decoration, bad hair, more music scores and similar cinematography. You have an excellent Sunday to watch for the second time on the start page of this film. It was a surprise to see so young Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum. Sylvia Miles is always surprising! LIVE!
