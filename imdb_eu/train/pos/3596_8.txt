Finally I sat down and saw this film all the way, and I must say, I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my favorite actors - not only does she work, but rather selects functions that are more important than it seems to be the first and foremost. I have read some comments, that is, as previously considered feminist was not horrible, but I do not agree. Diana gives feminist. He follows his dreams and is contrary to everything that he thinks (Tiny, his supportive brother and his trainer and trainer, except Hector, who proves his father as his father), that is, the word "Feminism". This is nice to see films that see the real aspect of feminism, since they are not eliminated by losers - but they can dreams and do nothing. While Diana is falling into true love, she and Adrian have a more realistic and intricate relationship, than something that makes magic. Girlfight is a real taste of reality and people think my perception to me. Thank you, Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - The film that is aimed at young women is very important, but everyone who wants to go far away from life.
