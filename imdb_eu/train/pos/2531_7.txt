Very good horror films between Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) is trying to find an ancient meteorite in an African expedition. After discovery, Rukh is poisoned by its radiation. Everything that goes wrong dies and the dark side of Rukh will become a killer. Dr. Felix Benet (Lugosi) solves his problem and, at the same time, radiation can be used for human wellbeing to heal diseases. Both boys use radiation options. Special effects are pretty good. Others in the cast: Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Beulah Bondi and Frank Reicher.
