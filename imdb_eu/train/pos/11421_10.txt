I do not know what the previous reviewer was watching, but I think that these opinions are personal tastes. In this movie, the lost depth, the very deep film, the emotional layers. Unforgiving human beliefs, the taboos of the times and the races are not equals, guilt, excitement, hate, blurring, very dark emotionally, under the skin. To fight the air, shoot a movie that has not been mentioned before, release the movie's emission, reveal emotions, make the characters their flaws, their rough, brilliant and most cruel interior!
