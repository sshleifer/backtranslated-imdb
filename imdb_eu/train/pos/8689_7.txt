Perfect cast for some people's drama. Simon dies, but revives it somehow out of the way. Werner Henze is one of the few points behind a brilliant score of the avant-garde German composer Werner Henze. Simon is condemned by his death, he saw on the other side protecting his deaths. She tries to live up to her girlfriend, but she does not have to continue her death. Very fruitful and moving, very psychological, but a little slow and somewhat boring.
