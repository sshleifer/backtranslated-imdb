Winchester '73 was a movie that led to the big league from Mann B, and regained a strangely successful post-war career in James Stewart as a hero of the conflict (though Fritz Lang was inherited by perhaps Lang). that's worth it). Both men would go to much darker places - the dramatically sharp Mann Devil's Door, which keeps MGM safe until it convinces Broken Arrow's success? But a movie about a man huntling his brother as a gunfighter, is delivered to one person from his career, one of the lovers of the mountain's director, at the end of his life. system Wonderful conversation, spectacular double support? Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, and Rock Hudson? and Mann's visual significance rises dramatically.
