This video was the first exhibition with Eddie Izzard. One night we had a lot of friends, and for some reason we surfed the HBO channel in the afternoon. There was someone named Eddie Izzard. I tried to laugh at two jokes. I did not want to be the "group" of responsibility, of course, to enjoy something that they were killed. After being dissolved in more and more healthy laughter, I released them, like us (by the way, we were not surprised, neither insurance nor pensions ...). Then we were asphyxiated. Story lines, plots, sketches, and ingenuous connections make little light. Since then, Eddie-Izzard can add addiction to every piece of the comedy. His work is pure genius. His comedy effort appears. It seems hysterically hysterically hung up in your house hanging around and around this or that ... It seems fun. He asserts that the joke is yours ... and he, the only real fan of humor, ultimately. If you are disappointed in this video, you have no previous sense of humor - or humor, as it is in the UK.
