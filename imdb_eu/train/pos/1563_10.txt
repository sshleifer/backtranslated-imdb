I love this episode. It is so great that they are grouped into five and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also love this episode due to Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) !!! I hope Clark has joined the Justice League and we will follow this group of heroes around the world! =) It was really exciting and the next viewers are interested in what will happen. I think it's a good idea to include the Chloek team as a Watchtower, as well as the planet of the day, as well as being able to perform superpowers. Also, I want to know what kind of subject 33.1 will use, I wonder what other people in the world have with power !!!
