Very funny I went to 8 friends to watch the preview of this movie. We saw another, but after 10 minutes we asked that we were dressed for fun at that time and made fun and fun in the whole movie. In the first part, you only have to ask about "malinski" and "bellini" (there are many examples of this language) and continue to repeat jokes (with different cycling), it is more fun and fun. The main characters that are looking for Malinsky are the next ones. Until the middle of the movie was over, we did not know the name of this movie because there was no recent credit, and we saw this basket, but we had fun. The house was loaded (approximately 250 people) and I think half of them does not like it, and the other half loved the movie. If you like funny movie comic strips with great conversations, you'll love it. Not only Clooney, but at the time I write this movie, it's worth much better than the IMDB score of 5.6, but when it's seen I'm going to see it as a ppl, it's going to go on. 7.0 is reasonable. I think, I'll give 10 to 10 (10 beers after 10 beers) <br /> <br />
