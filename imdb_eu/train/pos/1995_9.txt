I recently saw it almost forty years ago. He maintains well, especially Lionel Barten songs. ("Who will buy" with the magical counterweight, it's just a lot of photos. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with another G rating comment. The valuation system, at the time that is new, never meant the G (general) value "without a conflict". <br /> <br /> He reminded me of the description I saw that was considered inappropriate for children. Oztar's Wizard: A girl arrives to a foreign territory and kills the first person she finds. Then he goes to a road trip with three friends and kills him again.
