It was a pleasure to see this movie ... Even though I felt a lot of time feeling, this film almost certainly copied Monsters Inc. It seems that there are some similar things between them, the relationship between the animal / monster and a small child, trying to break that relationship with other animals, etc. I felt a lot in the whole movie, for me. Scrat :) is a very funny character. , although it will not serve any purpose :)
