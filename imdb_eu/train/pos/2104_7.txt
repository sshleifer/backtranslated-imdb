Who does not know the three countries that are massively released by the trio Largo Winch France-Belgian-Luxembourg ("BD" French or "Bandes Dessin√©es")? Since the publication of 18 comic books, since the adaptation of a series of novels, he had to adapt it to the screens. After the first attempt on a TV show failed, the actual one begins. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, that is what most fans do not achieve, the goal of this film is not only. to adapt the comic series. The essential parts of the original, characters and actions are missing. The film itself is an alternative and more modern version of the series. Since I'm a first-time fan of the comic books I'm shocked. Actors are good, so it's the scenario, though it seems to be quick. So, I recommend this film to all those interested in financial and political thrillers, but it's not clear that I have read James Bond or Jason Bourne's alternative online.
