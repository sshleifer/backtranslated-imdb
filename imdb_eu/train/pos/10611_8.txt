Another reviewer calls for the lack of character development, I underestimate. The movie did not carry on with an excessive explanation or an unnecessary backstory. Yes, there are stories we can not see on more than one occasion, but this was especially a one-day photo in an event that catalysed the whole life of all the characters. Henry Thomas's performance was based on a very active reaction, which reacts more than action. Good rental
