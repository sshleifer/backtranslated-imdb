When the Tradition commits an artist to his great capacity and magic to an heir, an old and proud performer on the street, known as the "King of the Mask", becomes a disappointment for a young man to learn and cultivate. <br /> <br /> Its warmth and humankind, that is, the Chinese natural disaster pays a small person devastating, in this case, the massive flood of 1930s. <br /> <br /> He is a 7-year-old new friend in his straw bag, to live with a beautiful and beautiful "born" monkey. It is the child's childhood knowing that it is a child. <br /> <br /> Its way of life is transformed immediately, which is linked to the love that feels for this slavery, because it links itself to a sleek tradition that requires the passage of art only to a young man. <br /> <br /> There are several stories in it ... it touches many people and China's culture opens its eyes to the western world. Thousands of years of drama overwhelm, and a few DVDs with a dry eye. <br /> <br /> The technical transfer was not so great because I found it at every sound level. You can see the timer and the video transfer lines in certain parts of the movie. It is highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
