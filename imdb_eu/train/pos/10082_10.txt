The movie is really poignant, unique and exemplary. The story is universal, good, evil and the struggle between the world. The most important thing is that its rating is wrong, misleading and horrible. Blockbuster rated it as a X rated movie. Actually, it is closer to G than to PGs, and children who can read clear and simple subheadings.
