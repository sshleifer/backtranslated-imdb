Wow A really bizarre "trip" movie, a super-realistic image, dark intensity and a black and curious sense of how to see the world of cartoons. The fantasy is a very nice bunch of mischievous and throbbing characters. Like all cool fantasies, the plot is second to level in the face of horrible eyes, and we continue with a small cat and his zombie sisters, with death, flood, water elephant, samurai swords and pig fish. I never heard of it, but I love it now - probably reminded me of the surreal pencil of the American cartoonist; Bill Plympton. It's nice for strange and beautiful things and I've been stuck on the screen with no fear that I'm surprised. Simply, "Hello Kitty" is without 'o'.
