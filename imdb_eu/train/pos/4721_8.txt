False story of the fake pilot of the B-17 Brady is destroyed in the occupied territory. The local wine producers gave their kindness and protection to the cost of their lives. I never heard the movie and I spent two hours. After finishing the movie, I'm glad I took time. It's a whole story to explain the look of Brady's face.
