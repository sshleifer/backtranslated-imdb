This is a great book based on this movie; Houellebecq had to unite with some unconventional style, but when I understood it behind the writing, I was drawn to the sadness of the author's world. Actually, there is no other book influenced. This is not necessarily a good thing; I have clarified my personal struggle and I hardened the identity of my fight. The idea of ​​Houellebecq, depicted by Harel, is completely depicted in the face of a world that has rejected the apathy and indifference of the hero. This is a movie that reveals the contemporary society as being under the age of men. Fortunately, things will change in the future, but this time we have to accept the rat race as shown in this movie. It is better if Harel or Houellebecq did not create such a genius. One man is enough.
