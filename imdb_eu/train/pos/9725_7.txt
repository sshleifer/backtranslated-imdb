"How To Lose Friends & Alienate People" is not based on Tiger Woods's infidelity. It is a minimal romantic comedy based on the experiences of Toby Young's book. The film is Simon Pegg Sidney Young, a British journalist who works in a prestigious New York magazine. The young man is disturbed by the capture of people of all kinds who catch the title of the film. It is illusory, courageous and humble. But, in spite of this, it is quite a nice character because it is a very funny reason. Sidney recognizes a fellow journalist, Alison Olsen, as Kirsten Dunst has performed very well. However, Sidney Sophie Maes is the actor for the sexpot actor who plays Mrs. Megan Fox. Foxtrot is a short acting capability, but high-quality "eye candy". Sidney obtains a steakhouse of all types to raise the journalist's journalist's stairs. These are the most important comedies of the movie. However, I think that the director and screenwriter Robert Weide, Peter Straughan, would have lost some viewers and alienated real romantic material, developing a fascinated romantic plot between Sidney and Alison. Although Weidstraughan team formulated a funny narrative. Pegg hung up his character with the fun performance of Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges built "The Dude" bridges again with his incredible work like Clayton Harding's second-time magazine. But the rest of the film was not enough to appear here. "How To Lose Friends & Alienate People" is not completely alienated, but you will lose some movie friends as a giant romantic comedy. *** Average
