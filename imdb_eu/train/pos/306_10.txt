I just saw "They all laughed" <br/> <br /> When I left in Europe in 1982, I saved a purely but beloved memory. I saw it again on the tape, almost twenty years after ... Bogdanovich has a real tenderness about his characters, and he does not feel it difficult. Excellent comedy and actors, good lines for everyone and for everyone and pretty good editing. I laughed and smiled all the time. As we all do, sometimes. Go it
