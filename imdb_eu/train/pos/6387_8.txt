I thought this movie was very well-taken care of. The voices were also excellent. I really liked the conflicts that surpassed and how they got it. I would recommend anyone to this movie. It was worth the time and money to definitely see. Atlantis laughed me with some comic scenes. I felt the other scene sad. And others were glad. It's a movie that can enjoy some ages. From that moment Milo crazy "teacher" or crew gathered under the sea to a fantastic journey. After watching the movie, I read the book. It was good too, but the film gives you better shots in your mind. It's like a book. Go ahead and watch this movie!
