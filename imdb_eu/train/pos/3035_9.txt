MacArthur is a great movie, a story about a great general Douglas MacArthur. This is, of course, the story of a great American military character, and the image we know from the first moments of my memory. There is also a continuity problem (such as others). The MacArthuren talk film that was not presented to the portal made in 1962 for the approval of the US Military Academy Thayer, "the old soldiers never die, vanish, disappear." (That was rejected by President Truman in his speech in Congress), as a result of his supposed distribution in 1951 (these two were not looking!) Gregory Peck is the im-Peck-able general who returns to the Philippines during the Second World War. The movie is fast and easy to move from the start of World War II to his family and his staff until his professional career ends. This film would have a greater significance for what the Second World War and the Korean War would have known. However, Peck was the portrayal of this great man, who fought fascism and communism, and the only haters who hated the war hated the communist. "It's not a victory during the war period."
