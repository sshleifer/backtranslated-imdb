They show 'Stanley and Iris' the victory of the human spirit. Stanley is a struggle for literacy and its potential. Iris is finding the courage to find love for widowhood again. The beauty of the film is Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda dancing together, starting and stopping, each one having their own skills and courage to rely on each other and continue. In this sense, it gives us great pleasure how often you live and therefore be compelling. Unlike other reviewers, I've found each character to be consistent for each one of the boxes. It also carefully selects support and the main characters make the main characters meaningful from their supportive shows. Everything is a great movie. Hope is the best I get.
