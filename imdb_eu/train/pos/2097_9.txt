This movie was badly received and badly reviewed. Rebecca West's book was written in 1918 shortly after the WWI. The amnesia caused by shock and traumatology was not topical, since reviewers called them many books and films later on. It is difficult to retreat in time and as the characters lived, the realities of the era: the war and war experience diesel for the use of deadly gas; love, and the lover of the past still love eyes, as young and beautiful as 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < After seeing this performance, it is possible to identify the religious girl that does not match family and social predictions. Margaret says: "We were debated, and when you took it to your home, they pushed me away." We know, therefore, that the solution produced something that shook him, but he shook him with his memory with Margaret. I have not seen all his films, but I've seen a solid masculinity that also reflects the role of a disabled soldier. <br /> <br /> I did not even know about it at the beginning of Ann-Margaret and she feels she's underestimating her performance. After reading the book, I asked that the children killed had asked Jenny and Chris to say that they had a terrible feeling of emotion, though Jenny said "it's a cousin." Kitty's way of keeping Jenny's nursery in her nursery, Kitty says she always dries her hair in that room, Kitty seems to be hotter than sunburn. , or the feeling of a lost child, and Chris preferred to assure that he did not feel the room he needed to feel, as the baby was alive, he was in charge of the child's memory. Similarly, Jenny will be revealed at home, as a high-ranking server, as could be done by a society of the time. <br /> <br /> It was recently a lover's dream fantasy recipient. We are not sexually, keeping the customs of that age) 50 years ago, I linked Margaret and her husband's dilemma. I also disapproved myself that I was not sufficient enough for the family and I had recovered with the Internet, and had a great deal of harsh experiences in Vietnam and my wife's weddings. He did not believe he loved a class. My husband was an understanding like Margaret, but the tension was very real. In the end, the lover was able to reconcile his real situation with fantasy of love only with me. <br /> <br /> I really decided to show up very little in the war experience. Chris's head I thought of "Mrs. Dalloway" who made very violent memories of the WWI soldier and that Chris was suicide by his fantastic Margaret's joy. On the contrary, the action of Mrs. Dalloway's soldier seems overwrought. <br /> <br /> Psychiatrist Chris was struggling to understand what he had recently understood what was going on in a big problem with the whole group. Everyone seems to want to restore their lives, but is it the right choice?
