Sunshine Boys by Neil Simon, along with Walter Matthau and George Burns, is a funny comedy about the curious connection to life and its estetility, but laughter is always a good taste. Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns), after watching two great comedy comedy comedians, nowadays, they feel angry and blue as hard and constant as they are today. Willy never gives up and continues the job, while Al is tired of the players and will retire home from home to his daughter. His old couple was really fun and harmonious, but they had to stay out of the scene and fight, and they did not talk after eleven years after breaking. If they work now, they must go back to their oldest sketch for comedy stories for television. The meetings are explosive and liberating people to ask about ancient questions. Neil Simon's scripts have given a story to a particular corporation, and melancholy and blue gags and a lot of overwhelming laughter has led Walter Matthu's partner (Best Actress Award) and George Burns (Won) to create a good mix. Academy Award Best Support Actor). Both actors are very credible and real and their harmony seems to work together all the time and do not suffer from these realities. The film is also very moving, because it consumes all the reality that tells the story and the love-heat report that is linked to both actors is completely strange but at the same time understandable.
