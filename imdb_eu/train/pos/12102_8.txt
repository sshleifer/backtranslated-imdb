This begins with the bet of Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist ... Poe man is not willing to spend a whole night in a huge castle. Well, of course, but can not it be released? It is impossible to say anything with strangers that are not fake, including frozen Barbara Steele. This is quite a curious film, the presentation is in French and English and it varies a lot. Perhaps this is because dialogs have been lost. It is also dark and claustrophobic; It is much less noticeable than the candle and a small circle of light that they create, as well as fear and future misfortunes. This version (Synapse) did not make sense and I asked him to watch the topless scene that could be censored in 1964. In general, this is pretty good and black and white is dark. Barbara Steele also makes films unquestionably. From 10 to 8
