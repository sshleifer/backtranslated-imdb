First of all, this is inevitably everyone believes that they are! Actually, no one expected, especially Guy Ritchie. All those who looked forward to being a cockney-goer and good duck? And so, but it is much more mature than previous works. I agree that it is confusing, but all the events are there for us, we have to watch and listen harder, this film demands all your attention! Check out the fascinating and fascinating look of the movie, listen to the conversation, admire the shows, and I think the whole movie is better understood. <br /> <br /> Yes, this has it. The effects of modern classics (the fight club, pulp fiction, etc.) but the original is in all directions and pause with music score. I'm sorry to see this film over and over again, if I'd understood it much more, and maybe appreciate thanks to the excellent piece of modern cinema, and I hope that Ritchie prefers to continue to prefer that, I also prefer "masterpieces."
