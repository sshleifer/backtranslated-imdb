Gangster big film. This beautiful film directed by Sam Mendes directs a camaraderie for his father-son. The brilliant star cast, Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan) has given a terrific performance. The Great himself acts again. Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig also performing. It is very good. Soil is pretty good. You will enjoy the movie. An excellent portrayal of the 1930s. It will be established in the 1930s. It was the peak of all the gangsters of the time. Soundtrack is quite a good idea for the movie. A great movie that the father has to support his son. I am very fond of my liking 10.
