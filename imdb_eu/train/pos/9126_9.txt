This movie is outstanding and wonderful. Prince's music was a rich Oscar (many people did not know how to win one). In my opinion, this is one of the best DVD movies to watch at night. Excellent surprise: The Prince makes a great job and is pretty good for transmitting pain to the camera. Morris Day, Wendy and Lisa are good at supporting their roles. Very musical milestone movie.
