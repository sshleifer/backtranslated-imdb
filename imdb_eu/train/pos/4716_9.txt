This movie is very fun, absolutely non-PC gangster romp. If Mel Brooks had taken a picture of Mob in the 30s, it would probably look like this. They are overwhelmingly overwhelming to remember, and it's not everyone, even though it does not laugh, the whole magazine does not have the pulse. So put and write Iceholes !!!
