Dear readers, <br /> <br /> The last battle between the Rebellion and the Empire. The ending of the death of the second death and the end of the rebellious deaths of the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, a knight Jedi today, returns from Tatooine to Han Solo and Princess Leia, who is now revealed as Luke's twin sons! The attack by Shield generator agrees on the lunar moon of Endor, because Lando Calrissian drives the Death Star attack. They do not know that he has set a minimal trap and that the emperor Palpatine supervises the construction of the second star of death. <br /> <br /> Jedi return is my favorite trilogy. Action, drama, love, battles, fantasy performance, fighting scenes, and John Williams have made great music. Mark Hamill has now arrived completely at the Jedi Knight, he disappears to be a naive wild boy and there is a quiet and quiet Jedi to save the galaxy in his place. Leia is still cool in this film, including Han and Lando. 3P0, R2, and Chewie perform their duties with T, James Earl Jones is still the biggest movie film ever: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is too wicked and crushed by the Emperor Palpatine. The sequences of the actions of this film are surprisingly surprising and are a serious sword fight. The score of John Williams is still cooling and the film improves at different levels. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
