I agree with another user and I must say that this is Kung Fu's best film! I saw a child and I loved it totally! The scaffold scenes are superb and it can be really sensible with this type, as it is treated as excluded. This great fantasy and kung fu fantasizes the movie! If you like kung fu you would love this one !!!
