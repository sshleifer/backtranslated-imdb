The Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), was killed by her daughter, a wonderful movie based on a real story. Dingo has stressed that he has taken his baby, but the story is very suspicious. The film is about the media circuit that happened in the media, and in the end, on the basis of all the hard evidence, that made the whole idea of ​​the woman's belief. I like films that challenge the media, as well as the hard way the justice system trains and the people get. I always thought that the jury had to show 12 angry men with their own tasks. It is not, as we have often said, a liberal film, but a clinical look that is based on human beings' pretexts and revenge. Dark Cry is also in the clinical. Schepisi should be careful not to make the movies melodramatic. Some may find a boring or dry movie, but it seems to me.
