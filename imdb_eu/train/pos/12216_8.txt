The movie was filmed only in Indonesia this year (2007): two years after its release, illegal illegal DVDs came to the public. It seems that the success of the illegal DVD has led to the release of the famous theater, which is still open to the public. <br /> <br /> It's a great epic movie, bringing Japanese culture to your home in a wonderful way. Sometimes, in a humorous way, the story tells the story of a story that tells a story of his theater, because Kabuki's theater plays a tedious theater. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, the viewer might be a bit confused about the story, but when the story opens, we see the love between male and devil is a great story for Kabuki's new play. <br /> <br /> The viewers are in darkness if it is supposed to be a story in Japanese traditions and mythology, but that does not matter. <br /> <br /> The story relates to the love of theater, expression, vivid colors, humor and tragedy, a fascinating tour of Japanese film and Russian theater. <br /> <br /> Leave it completely when you see this movie, try watching it. In a movie, instead of a television in your home. <br /> <br /> A critical point: soundtracks are sometimes annoying. Although most are wonderful music, there are some moments in the movie, I think they should choose some dramatic music. But maybe the story means that it has moments of humor, and the director also chose music at the most humble moments.
