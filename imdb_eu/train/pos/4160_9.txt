A single word may describe the movie and that's strange. One day I recorded this movie because it was a Japanese animation that was old, so it seemed interesting to me. Well, the movie is about a young boy to travel to the universe so he can find a vengeance to get a metal body. On the way he knows very colorful characters and finally decides whether he wants the body. It's very strange, if you're a fan of animation / science fiction, you can look at this.
