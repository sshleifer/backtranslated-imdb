This movie is a great documentary. The NWH group's rap group consists of Ice Cold, Tasty Taste and Tone Def, with the gangster rapture, bass and ascendant. Through the problems between women, teenagers, police and white, this group has reached the upper gangster rap world, because this film will reach documentary documents. I know every one is a favorite mokumentario. This is Spinal Tap, for good reason, but I think it's a good mood that this movie is better. Laughter will never end, even if someone who does not enter rap culture. <br /> <br /> I am a white man, although I do not have any interest in rap music, culture or anything related to it, I love this movie. Rusty Cundeif has shown the potential of the script, the songs and the protagonists, and it is shameful that you do not see the fear of a Black Hat. However, I have seen more than you, and that is, to make you laugh fast I recommend you to be frightened. <br /> <br /> Remember, "do not shoot to see the white ones! ... from the eyes? Do not you see white peels. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> Before and enjoy the movie.
