I put this movie into a 10/10, a bit reluctant, horrified for many years and horrified by something that I was not impressed with. Threatening the face of black women is just dreadful and aggravates the fear of music. <br /> <br /> I first watched it when I was 10 years old on TV and I was disturbed for many years. I like that so many users said so much. A review of so many films is that a movie can be terribly disturbing or horrible, but you can think of all those who have posted this board, this is really powerful. I mean, I like horror films and, in general, it's a lot of fun for me, but it's really threatening and it surely makes people much more disturbing. I have not seen it at the age of 10 and I try to see it again, but I'm afraid that they will not sleep at night. I can not put my finger on my fingertips, but I think that fear is the biggest weapon of Women and that it is as vivid as the audience feels. It is noteworthy that the feelings of other audiences are so unanimous. <br /> <br /> In addition, I have also seen theater theater, which is a great production ... but there is nothing to compare.
