Disney's animation is just the stone that is written by musicians. Right? No Show me This attempt seemed a lot more enjoyable because Disney's Disney rate standard was not a hokey eight-year-old. <br /> <br /> While the story was not as intense as it was, it was still pretty good, kind and adventurous. I expected a little more, however, considering the subject, but this film has not done much or has failed to do so. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is average, but the interview is quite credible, as the story, plot, sub-plot and amazing story that I found inside this production. I refuse to determine the soil, as I have done and done, but the fantastic movie fan is worth the point of view. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, the best Disney. Animated feature film. <br /> <br /> Values ​​data from 9.4 / 10 ... <br /> <br /> Source :.
