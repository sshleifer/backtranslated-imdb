"The Straight Story" is a really beautiful movie about an elderly man named Alvin Straight, who runs his own lawnmower across the country to visit his unknown brother and kill him. But it's just a basic synapse ... this movie is much more than that. That was Richard Farnworth's last mission before he died, and it will definitely be remembered. The old man is a passionate man, unlike many of the old men we know about you. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is a movie that everyone can watch at least once in their lives. It will come down and touch your parts, if you have at least one heart, it will.
