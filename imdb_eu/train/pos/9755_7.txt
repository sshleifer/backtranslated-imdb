I saw the movie about the last seven years, so my opinions could be mixed with time. I enjoyed shooting at that time between cartoons and live action. I felt sad at that time for the blue camel and his sad life. Also, I enjoyed being the Contagious Captain after being captured by the heroine (a princess or a shepherd's toy) when the tables were turned on. Unfortunately, producers have never decided to change this film into VHS, so memories are thirty-one years old. I'm sure the movie once again looks crisp and sappy, but at that time I liked the movie.
