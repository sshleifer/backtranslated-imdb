This film, even though it is over 70 years old, is still a very mobile and strong film. Bette Davis, with Mildred, is a credible and nasty Cockney server. His performance is still amazing. The viewer scorns her completely and pity her at the same time. Leslie Howard's poor and obsessed Phillip Carey has no great performance, but I do not know how the actors can resist Mrs.'s performance. He landscapes them, in all its scenes, stealing the show altogether. This is the star that sealed his stamp with the movie and won the Oscar, but he lost. It has been an amazing day of pregnancy, multiple sex partners and Mildred's malignant language, which is a bit obsolete, but still an excellent movie. To see the scene about Phillip about Mildred (REALLY thinks for himself) ("Cad, you dirty pig ...") is one of the great exercises I've seen in the film yet.
