This movie I saw a dozen times and is very wonderful. However, in the beginning, there was too much talk on the part of someone. I think it would be interesting to do it again. However, at the official site they said they would not be rebuffed, seeing that people had kept so much. What happened to Patty Dunning? He is a very good actor. He has made several other films in the 70s and 80s, but we have not heard of it. I am sure that Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, is working on RD Films Accounting. But, in general, I have to say that the same series has left the old school.
