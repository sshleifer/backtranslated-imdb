This drawing is short on the plot, but it is visually astonishing. There will be very small sinks: <br /> <br /> This short story is a lightweight episode that is responsible for the return of the underground spring every spring, but it's still not ready to fight in the winter. remove it Gnomes and storms have their songs. That's quite a plot, such. This drawing is not plot, color and animation. The visuals are extraordinary. In 1936, bright colors were a novelty and here are some highly inspired works. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments in the short term move the liquid color movements through pipes. At more than one point, there are pipes lined up in a row, from the shortest to the highest and the colors move through the pipes and the music track seems to be an organ pipe. <br /> <br /> The fighting between the emerging greenness and the storm-free storm is very well executed. These short films were referred to by Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising, but surely they also helped MGM's final output, because cartoons had more than one quote and MGM finally decided that the costs could better control the animation departments. They managed someone who was more expensive than Harman and Ising. <br /> <br /> It's really a good cartoon and it's worth seeing. It is available in DVD Attack for 30 characters. It is recommended, especially if you want good animation.
