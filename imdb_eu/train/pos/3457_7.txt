This is a directed column by Steven Spielberg at the beginning of his career. In this movie, some of the great suggestions that Spielbergen has come up with are not extraordinary. Basically, Spierlberg's 70s movie and television work is the same style. This means that some characters may be strange in nature, and I'm not talking only about myself. A strange character that can be seen in Spielberg's 1975 film "Jaws". But initially Spielberg's not only a few small hints of typical elements, you can not call this a rise of this movie as an example of a star. It's not a bad thing, of course, it's not, but as I said before, there's nothing too much feeling. <br /> <br /> This movie started very well and was very promising, but after a good opening there. As always, the movie was slower and it had to be seen. Reddish is a Columbo movie because most times it is not the most memorable moment, it is not boring, because it is a movie that is bored to watch. <br /> <br /> The concept of murder itself was very simple and fair. A crime writer who kills the writer's partner showed a great and interesting potential. However, the story did not analyze all its possibilities. At least, this movie left me feeling. <br /> <br /> The film was still good thanks to the character of Jack Cassidy, because Columbo is believed to be intelligent due to mystery / crime. writing experience and trying to give him advice of all kinds, far from himself. But of course, Columbo knows it better and it is the first time it is suspected, but it's just as usual. <br /> <br /> The film has a good overall style and uses the camera's fine position. editing All this is fun, especially when it was consistent with Spielberg's subsequent works, especially with camera angles. <br /> <br /> Columbo film looks beautiful and beautifully, but do not allow the name of Spielbergen. That's how it's too much to wait for. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
