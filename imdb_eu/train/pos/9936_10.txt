The baby was my favorite series. The Swedish television company once again decided to give a couple of summer when I finished the first half of the medical doctor. I was surprised to see the explanation of the organs. Surely a few things are easier, but most were correct (22 years ago!) And very understandable. I would suggest that all the medical student soon should see. For example, there is a very good way to learn some basic medicine words. Now I'm going to see my 7th semester and the series again when I bought the DVD box :-)
