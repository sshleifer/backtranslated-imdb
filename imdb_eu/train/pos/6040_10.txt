I'm just never bored watching FREEBIRD. My husband was sensational, from the beginning I started to participate. Contact Jon and movie theaters and now contribute with the DVD promotion of the movie. Even with the promotion of postal postage along the transverse ferries and in various places in France. FREEBIRD expertly wrote and directed the perfect combination of serious and entertaining moments with optional casting. Phil Daniels would only have the role of Grouch. It's a great privilege to meet Jon and make his director's January portal. If you want to do something else, ask Jon, email or phone, you know how to take me. Sue xx
