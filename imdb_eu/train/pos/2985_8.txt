This film was one of the most beautiful first international photographs of the first ever film, made available to the masses. And he did so wonderful. People generally would not sit for a love story about young exotic lovers of ancient Egypt, with a soprano with more than 40 books and more than 300 books, to sing the glorious music with their voice device. Therefore, the visual representation of these beautiful directors (young Loren, a beautiful Della Marra and Maxwell Maxwell Slinky) make this story more believable, not to be a beautiful arias who do not know the plot and give them a better chance for musicians. In total, Verdi is a great introduction to one of the great works. I remember seeing that I was at high school, and, undoubtedly, it made me interested for me, and I did not know it. I still like this movie, and I would highly recommend it to those who appreciate music very much as beautiful music. Luciano Della Marra Radames was, unfortunately, the audience did not appear in other films.
