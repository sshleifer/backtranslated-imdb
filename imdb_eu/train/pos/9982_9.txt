I watched this movie after waiting for ages and ages to publish to Canada (still only posted). He deserved wait and then some. I am an avid reader of Margaret Laurence and I was excited to see that the novel became a movie. I really ended the favorite movie rather than the novel. I really liked the fact that Bram Shipley's character was a bit less, and it seemed that there was more love story between Hagar and Bram, which at the end of Bram's life was a much more moving scene. The loss seemed steeper. Hagar was not the most beautiful movie of the book, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in that role. He was once more. Christine Horne was superb and she has a lot more excellent things before I'm sure. Cole Hauser's scenes were crisp. I can continue and move on, generally from 9 * 10. I could not wait to get out of the DVD, which is essential for my collection!
