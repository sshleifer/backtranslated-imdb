Now, I can not claim that I've seen all the films of Jesse (Jesus) and probably many of them, but this is the best (and curious) for me. see I would say, probably, at the end of the sixties / early seventies, and lately, it has been very strange to me, and many have to be proclaimed for me. However, it is like a bad dream, where parts are performed in certain points. Woman is an actor or something that plays in theaters in Berlin, where "false torture" acts for a good audience (?!) And it seems that this problem is dreaming. It seems real and does not catch everything in this movie, real things are a sharp focus and no dreaming things. It seems that it already exists in a vu state. I do not say that it makes a lot of sense, but it's pretty wild and curious and entertaining. Berlin's film seems to be a lonely and horrible place, so it adds to the atmosphere. The end is very violent, although the movie is over and there are black ribbons, of course, it's not necessary to report this. My copy came from the Anchor Bay Euro-Trash collection, and I said, give me more Euro bans, I can not get enough penis. But the CHARGE is OK.
