I really liked this movie. Most reviews have been bad, but most critics believe that the movie must have a drama of ideas. This movie has little drama, but the rest is very funny and fun. Forget to be a pretty woman of Julia Roberts, Emma Roberts is a pretty young woman, and that's more than that. Emma was so fun to watch Nancy Drew's role. It's good to see a new face. I think it will go away. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's not based on Nancy Drew's books, but the story is still there. There is also a good mix of other characters, including Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan. I think Disney has not released the movie. Some people may not like this movie because it has sex, violence and curse. It's strange that time is a good family movie. So take your family, watch this movie and judge yourself what's good. I can not wait for the sequel.
