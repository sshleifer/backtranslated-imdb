This movie is intelligent. That is, rather than most of the other films, it exceeds the most common designator - stupid people do not appreciate it. The story is based on conversations too. Missed translations have similarities, although Sunrise is much brighter, somewhat less abstract and simply much better. <br /> <br /> The script, the characters and even the surrealistic atmosphere are completely realistic. Actors play brilliantly. I've rarely seen a movie screenplay and playmaking perfectly melt together. <br /> <br /> The conversation moves to very personal issues, because it has the risk of becoming somewhat at the top. However, it remains all the time on the right side, although at times it is humble and insolent. In this fine line, talented actors are required to balance. Sometimes it gives you excellent results, and, in general, the movie is just innocent! Very, very rarely, "love" is a movie that seems reliable and realistic. Every time you get it, the result is wonderful. In my opinion, this has also contributed a bit of stunning and timeless beauty that looks at the actress. It still seems stunning in this film, after 12 years. <br /> <br /> You can not miss this is just a treasure of a movie. One of the best films I've ever seen in the 1990s!
