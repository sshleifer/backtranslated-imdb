The story I've ever seen was stunning, shocking, and amazing. Actually, these adjectives can not be described as well. I can not choose a scene for me. If I have to list some of them, firefighters would have jumped reactions; The people who were trapped in the elevator reacted, because they did not know what was happening, they eventually came to the horrific scene; belief and disbelief towards observers; and in the end silence. <br /> <br /> That day, and now, it has also been reminded in Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says: "I felt a strong mix of strength, dreaded millions of voices and crashing suddenly." It's amazing how he describes it so precisely. He was really in a hurry. <br /> <br /> This documentary shows the problem clearly. The feelings are very impressive. Exert anger, frustration, excitement, fear, exhaustion and magnitude. Everything is there One thing is missing. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful and mobile documentary and worthy of Emmy. It's not just documenting 9/11, but because it has to be all. <br /> <br /> If you want to see, make sure a box with fabrics. You need I know I did that.
