The characters came into fun situations full of mind, nonsense and serenity. Movie comedy is great, pleasant, interesting, surprising. The best point in a movie: characters, humor, story and interviews. Humor is 'internal development', it's strange in Serb movies. So, it is the result of characterization, well-motivated, spontaneous and powerful. It's also sharp, intelligent and light. Unfortunately, most of the movies built a mood (a joke and put them in the mouth of the characters) or the usual situation comedy, burlesque, farce. Some of the 'immortality of art' are included in this film. Little work, almost impossible.
