Alexandr "Sascha" Luzhin (John Turturro) returned to a tournament organized by former former chess player in Italy. His shine is doubtful, but his obsessive chess has led to growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson), his mother, came together with the same station as Vera (Geraldine James) in the field of possible marriage partners. Vera becomes a beautiful heart, but, surprisingly, Natalia Saschu has been fascinated by a walk. Sascha will also be taken to Natali and she is going to have a wedding at the second meeting. But, with the concentration of Sascha in the chess matches and other events of the past, they can create problems with Natali's heart? Oh, can you become a chess champion? Nabokov is a brilliant movie based on a novel. The play is amazing, because Watson is very fine, as it is not a perfect little perfectionist, as well as Turturro's perfection, as charm fans as insolent. James gives a pretty pleasure to her amazing mother and the other members are also wonderful. As for the film's appearance, it can not be better. The landscape is beautifully dressed; vintage costumes are beautiful and cinematography is worth a lot of applause. Yes, the story is unusual and, sometimes, it's flashbacks, everyone does not appreciate being a movie. Then the end is saturated. However, if you love love, a period, a beautiful theater, the beautiful art of the creation of the film, do not miss this. You will be helpless in front of many charms.
