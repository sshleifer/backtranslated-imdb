This movie is really bad, but it's fun. Poor performances and poor management improve the hysterical film. The twins are very entertaining in their Conanesque roles. If you entered Conan or Excalibur to a movie that waits for the first time, you will hate it. If you watch good humor and accept fun, you will have a pleasant mute. Look at the scenes that hang your brothers, the funniest scene in the movie. Mystery Science Theater 3000 could do this!
