I think it's a nice movie; I think the movie is very russian through landscape and atmosphere; I think it was not sensual (sensuality is the result, not a goal); I think it's very natural; I think it's human; I think it was interesting; I think the actors never thought ... waw lame act (they are not Sean Connory & co) and it's not a blocked movie, it's like a movie ... you can play normal ppl ...; I think the movie is about to come by; I think it feels good (or I feel it again :)); I think I'm not targeted; <br /> <br /> I really liked ... I know it.
