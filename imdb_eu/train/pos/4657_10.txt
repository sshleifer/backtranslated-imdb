Hot Millions is a great movie of all kinds. Four great and fun performances of the four best professionals in business. Peter Ustinov is superb, as usual, and Maggie Smith, one of the greatest actors of all time, is very pleased. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart pulled out and they're perfect. If you want a movie with a perfect casting, that's it. This is so impressive that people work naturally and effortlessly, creating lots of laughter and creating fun moments. Peter Ustinov was a genius of humor, and this is one of his most memorable performances. Direction, photography and editing are also primary, and in the 60s, it is an excellent tabletop of London time. It's definitely on my favorite list.
