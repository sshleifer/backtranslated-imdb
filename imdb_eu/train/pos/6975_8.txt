If I saw the pilot of this show, I'd value it 10. I bind myself to this beautiful new world immediately. The following episodes have not been fully promised, but I will continue to watch and I hope that it will continue to improve. The production values ​​are incredible and the performance is first class. I do not like perfectly aligning with BSG I am fascinated with this premise, and admittedly, there are two different shows. I am very pleased that Esai Morales and Eric Stoltz are one of my favors all my time back in my life (only once a week), I lost both of them. The viewer is a show that requires a bit of thought and that's always good. You should surround yourself with some aspects of expression; Things are not always apparent, and they are definitely gray in color, literally and figuratively, in plot lines, in characters and, of course, in virtual worlds. We all know how it ends, but it's a fair ride.
