It goes without saying that in Norway, so many dumps can redo the release of the DVD, and such precious stones do not recover their past reputation. I'm giving it 7 because it's not very good, but it's a little ScifiFi film made for Norwegian TV. This movie is not a strange historical film, which is why it announces so much Alien movie in the first movie. And, my words, Blindpassasjer was the first! Was Ridley Scott or anyone in the crew seen the mini series? However, it is difficult for the scenes to be very similar. OK, the budget is lower in the Norwegian film, but that's why it's a great job in the over-run film that the Norwegians made during the 90's.
