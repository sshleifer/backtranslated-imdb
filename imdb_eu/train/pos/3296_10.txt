Mina Kumari shows you more style and grace, standing still and sitting on the floor that you can find in other films. The director has created scenes of touching beauty that is considered as beautiful as possible. Music and dances are of the highest quality. In the first dance scene you will notice that the director has all the things that are happening in the background: another dancing dance, drunk in the stairs, there are many activities, but knew that we were watching Mina dancing and I would bet this visit often, you have not noticed. Everything, perfection. JQ
