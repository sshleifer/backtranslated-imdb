The film tells the story of his best friend Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) - Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family will be included in a small apartment in New York, which has no cabinet space. A little bathroom Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), when he wants to renovate the apartment, Jim's advertising director makes a home advertisement (or he falls!). He loves to fall in love. After buying the house, the invoices and frustration are steadily rising, because the construction of the "dream house" in Jim can do everything wrong. <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy, one of three collaborations. A charming little comedy - it's not a great way to spend taxes, excellent messages, but one or two hours. Laughter comes from the beginning, when the alarm clock turns off and Jim stops trying to close, so Muriel can stop them at any time. Comedy lines and situations can only give time and giving up well-trained pairs, which is what Grant and Loy give us: performances, simple chemistry and great fun. Myrna Loy is very grateful (it is obvious that Grant's character is part of Jim's lines and actors, and Grant, as always, ignores both with a clear aplomb), but Muriel gives color, life and bite. Myrna Loy can only give a character. Melvyn Douglas plays perfection as well, marking one single mistake. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite scenes definitely gets into Bill's repository, and Jim goes. with him "save" ... get all the trapped! Each small problem that appears in the Blandings Reform Project - including small jealousy and Wham 'campaigns - seems to be all the wrongs that might arise when building a new home, but it's compelling and enjoyable. . 8/10
