This is the first movie I've seen this year! It is badly fun, very original, with a wonderful look (they wanted to see the elegant and beautiful look of a wide-screen technology), which is deep in nature and says about society. It's a really intelligent satira from the Homeland Security race, and at the same time laughing and how much the fear of the world is. Carrie Anne Moss turns comedy performance into a never-ending world! Sweet, fun and sexy! Billy Connolly is as good as Fido, and he can shake it! And father Dylan Baker is priceless. In fact, the whole cast is perfect. Henry Czerny is a bad guy, as Tim Blake Nelson's sexy neighbor as sexy zombie girlfriend (now getting the idea), causing even stirring and all the amazing turns! Go to this movie! It's like nothing you've never seen before.
