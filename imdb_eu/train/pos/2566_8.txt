The current viewer of any movie-related movie is a must-see, a story message and morality will always be important if we have a world full of mustache. <br /> <br> </ p> <p> Additionally, the movie is a really old love story ... girls and girls ... love the girl ... she gets the boy ... <br /> <br /> The weakest function is Kent Smith, a foreigner general Webster (Riccardo Montalban is the second place) ... how would he ever get my 3-star general question ... he's a character whose wife and military subordinates are in front of him, it's amazing to show any respect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, Brando's southern accent is bad , and some scenes have some holes, but I see the movie in general. <br /> <br /> The red button is great ... I always like to see dramatic dramas in the theater ... As in the case of Button, a comedian can often improve the traditional character that portrays a person's tragedy. cactus actor
