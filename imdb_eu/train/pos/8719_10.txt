I was amazed by the improvements made in an animated film. If you sit near the screen, you will see details of grass and skin structures. Details, colors and shadows are less than Toy Story. I do not know how to shut down the shadows. I hope that PIXAR will produce a documentary on how to produce this film to find out how to achieve this. Based on this film, I think future animated films will be judged according to this film.
