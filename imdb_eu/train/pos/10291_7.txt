After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very fun movie, something positive that can be said. It was not one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but it was still good. Morgan Freeman was as good as God. Jennifer Aniston had some great moments. With Steve Correll "THE Daily show!" I missed the name <br /> <br /> <br /> I choose movies by director Tom Shadyac. LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS, and ANAL MAIL PROFESSOR. Three of them and Bruce Almighty, he plays a great comedy star and tells him the story. The director who knows the comedy can get the talent he achieves and finding it difficult to find a meaningful and intelligent story. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint would have to use more Bible references. I only remember three biblical references and were the three most fun sections in the whole movie. I think the first drafts of the script have had more biblical references, but the producers cut their fear of attacking people. This is a bad thing, because I think it was a lost option. <br /> <br /> My Grade: <br /> <br /> 10/7
