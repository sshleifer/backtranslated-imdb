The title sequence shows the credits written on a paved floor; It's music that whispers the "Street Scene" by Alfred Newman. Then we discover Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be something that was not his old man: a guy at the right side of the law. But it's pretty good to get a good man. After several complaints about his diversion people, Inspek. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon) has been destroyed. Foley says that he is a good man, but he must be right and Det. Thomas Lieutenant (Karl Malden), who has just won the promotion. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrille, in an exquisitely slimy performance) has an illegal dice game and wants to make a sale. Rich Ted Morrison (Harry Von Zell) brought Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful wife Morgan (Gene Tierney). She will be too late to use her husband as an effort, and Pain refuses to go against her. Morrison horsepers intervene, but Pain gets cold. It seems worst, but later this guy is dead; and Pain is guilty of it. <br /> <br /> But this is not a Paine story. Shortly thereafter, Dixon fell in love with Morgan, but he does not try to cover himself again in the midst of the horror and start a great act. Morgan's dad, a taxi driver (Tom Tully), the storyteller, may be taken for granted. With Dixon, he's trying to blame Scales. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger directs Ben Hecht and another three by William L. Stuart's "Night Cry" script. This strong black cinema with brilliant performances and dark moral morality and morality that we expect from this genre. It keeps it as bright as the shadows, as something that helps the studio to strain the sensors. Of course, the classic noir, directed by Preminger, and Andrews and Tierney is the "Laura" star. You will enjoy this, but you can not miss it.
