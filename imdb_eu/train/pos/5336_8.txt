I really like this movie, because they do not show Chinese Australian film as never before. I must say that this is one of the best films ever, emphasizing the difference between the Hong Kong people and the Chinese in the continent. It really shows that there is a discomfort between them, but HK can only be obtained when they are in the class. He also showed me how China's indie rock scene exists in mainland China, and the Chinese knows how to break the guitar and smoke the house. Who said that China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely brilliant, with its clear and crisp voice, with an honest performance, and with a totally chick magnet. Many people who love people from Chinese western / Asian cinemas who have been wiped out of the Western stereotypes and do not know much about this movie. Check it out!
