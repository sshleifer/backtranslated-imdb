This movie is beautiful. Authentic and heartfelt, but completely crazy. The character is easy to fall in love, because they have so many minds, but each one of us could have at least one reference. In Canada, we do not have a lot of Eastern European films, and for some of the few I've seen, it's one of the best Loners. It's very funny and magical. If you want to see something new and refreshing, watch Loners.
