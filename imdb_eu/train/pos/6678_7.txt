I really did not expect much from this movie, but it was not bad; it was really good. This movie had some of the most curious writing I ever saw from filmmaking. Now I have not said one of the funniest movies of all time, but I laughed quite a bit in certain parts. "The police said his father's death was suicidal, he said they had fallen into an axis of the elevator. Sometimes." Now this movie is not for everyone, especially stupid humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; So if you hate these films, I would probably recommend you to be clear. In general, the movie was nice, a superhero team finally became real heroes. Many people probably have not seen a very bad comedy, because, as I saw, they hoped he was just a garbage for me. After watching this movie, I understand why it was a super-cast, Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria, and Good Burger. Because Mystery Man is full of comedy writing. It's a big surprise.
