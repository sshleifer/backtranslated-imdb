Some people loved the "Aristocrats" and hated others, they often came out in the middle. Eddie Izzard's reactions will not be extreme; For managing a comical transvestite (which she likes like a girl), it will be enough to use the vocabulary word "f". It would be a long beep on TV on the network TV. Many of Izzard's fans are incredibly invaluable because they do not make mistakes in their shows. On the other hand, I thought that this show was far more vague than Izzartz's chest, but it's often not fun and, in places, very hilarious. Rulings from a reference point forward the show has a way of linking its usual routines. It's not a story storyteller. It's not a joke. It's not a frenzied fantasy like Robin Williams. It deals with ideas, some of which work and some of them - such as the San Frantzisko telephony route and Alcatraz, for example - are completely unknown. However, it's in a good way to expand the flopped habits and unite them. I gave this performance to 7 and persuaded me to upload to 8. But 10? In no case.
