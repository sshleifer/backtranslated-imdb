My self and my 20-something groovadelic pals just got awesome for this Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried to rent it on the DVD, but I can not find it - bad, I'm sure it's "special features"! :) It's advisable for all of you this flickerish comedy for a date, or a cozy only at nightlife! This is like a purr-fect movie with your cat or, on the other, a party, like "Party Girl" party, as in the lovely, tidy and tightened Parker Posey movie. end Oh, and be surprised and amazed that the end of the surprise ... let alone, The Sixth Sense, you just passed a way to radder the movie! Sorry, it's not damned, so call! Pick up the lover of an old fountain, it's just a better comedy than "Party Girl" with Parker P. To feel! Your, Ronald Marie MacDougall (aka Cyber-Rap DJ)
