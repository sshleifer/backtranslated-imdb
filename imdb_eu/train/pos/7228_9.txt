The most prominent feature of this film is the performance of Peter O'Toole. At the same time, a horrible and horrible tragic comic. Is it better than O'Toole? I do not think so. What a man's face is! <br /> <br /> It is a bizarre story and quite alarming and emotionally intense in parts (especially at the end), but in a strange way it is also very moving and it has many successes. However, I felt the movie basically focused on the brilliant performance of Peter O'Toole and I'm sure I would not even have half enjoyed it, though it was not.
