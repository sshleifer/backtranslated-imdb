Unlike many other films, those that reveal unpleasant (Man Bites Dog) or their violence (most of Peckinpah's films) are disturbing, Deliverance is embarrassed by his belief. Undoubtedly, the buggery scene is pretty straightforward to its unpleasant, but the impact of the film comes in much as its slow build-up and isolation leads to four-way isolation, both before and after everything starts wrong. When they go under Zuberoan children, they do not even know men related to their first music, who show the love of them, are the most evil of modern movies. The voltage is continually increasing the number of kayaks during the trip, and it also lasts after the last credits - at the end, the plague of the characters is very real. The veracity of the film is very helpful to the director's game, especially Ned Beatty and the heroine of the victims and reluctant Jon Voight, respectively. Burt Reynolds was never better. The cultural impact of the film is a significant number of people who understand a 'banjo territory' - perhaps Get Carter has only made so effective a hatchet work in a regional tourism industry. I can only think of a few short films that have come into a serious depression when it's over: it's the best comparison that Se7's oppressive atmosphere is. Especially if it's an excellent spot, Deliverance is especially classical, because there are no good points to compare with it, it's the only one.
