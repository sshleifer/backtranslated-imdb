I do not know why the review of this movie is so universally wrong, if only I have my rocker. I found a patient, brilliant, twisted, and psychologically sophisticated. You have not deepened in the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood movie. The layer has layers inside, with a hue in Stone, and after a plot has begun to guess. People have to overcome 48-year-old Sharon Stone and is not with Michael Douglas. I'm going to announce that this movie will be a great success on the DVD, when people watch them and then pay attention to their professional reviewers. Give a shot, you'll be happy!
