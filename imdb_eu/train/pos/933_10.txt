I watched this movie at the sixth level around Christmas Time, and I was really excited, and when I heard that George C. Scott was there, I was really excited, I really love George C. Scott! When I saw myself and my lesson watching this movie, I really entered, and when it was over, I was really surprised, I thought it was so wonderful! I have seen the best version of the classic novel Charles Dickens so far! George C. Scott's Scrooge's acting is something else. I thought it was an excellent choice, it was Scrooge, it's definitely Scrooge! I've seen two Christmas versions, and another with Patrick Stewart, but it's better! <br /> <br /> What is really true, I thought they were great actors, everyone was, little spirits, Tim Tiny, Bob Cratchit, everyone could not find anyone better than anyone. parts were being made! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott! When I saw it, I thought it was the absolute best! It's definitely Ebenezer Scrooge. I do not think anyone could have better! I do not think anyone can find anyone replacing the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the adaptation of the classic film of the classic Charles Dickens and I think it would be okay, we could think that this movie is wonderful! Surely, I have to buy this movie on the DVD, because I thought it was really wonderful! I highly recommend that you see this masterpiece! This is the best Christmas Carol version. <br /> <br /> 10/10
