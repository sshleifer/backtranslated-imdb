Henri Verneuil's movie is not so famous as Parallax View, 3 Days of the Condor or JFK, but it is definitely not worse and sometimes better than this classic genre. The action takes place in the western fictional state, where the fictional president dies. After several years of research, the special commission of the government decides that a president killed only one pistol. A man - the prosecutor Volney, directed by Yves Montand - thinks to investigate something more and, therefore, the movies begin. This film is not related to specific theories, but in the current world it encompasses the whole structure of the relationship between government and society. This movie can only be done in the 1970s, but never affected. Also, it is terrifying that oracles are accurate. 10 to 10
