Full House is a great show. I still grew up today. I started to see 8 years old and now I'm 12 and I still see it. I fell in love with all the people, especially Stephanie. it's my favorite. he was so humorous. In this view, people will not see the show, you will enter. The first performance was the first show I saw in 2002, it's a good show in 2002. I truly believe that this show must go down in several generations in families. and it is very good because it is a good show for all ages. and teaches all parents to learn children's lessons. nothing terrible happens, such as violence or swearing. The seat is really great. I give 5 out of 5 stars. what do you think OH and the best time to watch it is when you are home to an old school or an old office. It makes you feel much better. I am confident that I am hardly sick at home, but I know it will make you feel better. and everyone who thinks the show is stupid, it's good for you, because you are not happy with your life for a lifetime. You should really see and enter. I swore to all those who started to see wonderful shows. I have a good meal for lunch. Remember to see the house full and you'll have to start it soon!
