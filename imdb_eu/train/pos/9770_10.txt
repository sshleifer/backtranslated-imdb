This movie is great and I would recommend renting any of the local video stores. Or, even better, you can buy it this time you can see this opportunity again and again. I remember watching this movie, and it was very good then. But after seeing it yesterday again, it seemed amazing to me. <br /> <br /> Good mix of comedy (though my favorite "Mr. Magoo" is not my favorite) and action. That's worth 10/10, and I'm hoping they'll make a short series (crossed by the toes). If you take care of your kindergarten or have time to take care of your children, I would recommend renting this movie because it will keep hours entertained :).
