Since I watched the trailer I watched the movie, I was surprised with this movie. While some of the characters 'and actions' characters seemed to be very cartoons, the dark nature of the movie is really different. Instead of happy, happy story, this movie will take you to another direction that is exemplary, but also disturbing. Most kids will not understand some of the darkest moments in the movie, this is a pretty movie for adults. I was also surprised at cinematography, creating a network of pans and tensions using digital animation and animation. The musical scores were once again solid, as Hans Zimmer proved to be a costume for animated films, and I never thought I'd really enjoy Brian Adams's music.
