For films such as "Anchors Aweigh", few have been awarded the Oscars for their happy work. 1945 was a good movie, or still Billy Wilder's "The Lost Weekend" was a cause for excitement, which he wrote in the best picture of the best faithful advertising musician. Since Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance, when he replaced the role of "Singin 'in the Rain", then there was something wrong with the MGM sculptural systems behind. Of course, one of the best performances in the studio is at the top of the great shows and major Hollywood shows, available for those who stick to the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the seamstress with music The great talent of Gene and Frank Sinatra is a fun farce, undoubtedly, instead of dropping more people into the precautions for this music, today's audiences would not be required to spend unnecessary time. It has been a much longer and larger piece before, but in this case the scenes of the charming Kathryn Grayson could be erased. Until the concept of "Kiss Me Kate", perhaps non-operative enthusiasts were able to see any movie that had remote control over their hands. <br /> <br /> If you were to receive women in 'City' in 1949, maybe the sailor did not let Jose Iturbi listen to the shore and had to knock the piano. Full interpretation to listen to "Susie". It's hardly lucky to get a screen test at MGM gold studios. Then a few are even happier. There is no regret over the success of Susan Abbot or Kathryn Grayson's screen test, but he is hoping that he will not be able to give him a two-way rehearsal. <br /> <br /> But, for all, star talent is a good form and an average average score is mixed with young navy boys that sail with young sailors. The media at least does not question the selection of the wrong MGM movie. The director will continue working because of the color in cinematic cinema. When anyone has a music or song, the movie is happy. <br /> <br /> The most prominent feature of the movie Gene Kelly is the adventures of fantasy and cartoons, creating a superb dance with Jerry. It's a well-deserved piece of work by Kelly's career, and it's nice to think Fred Astaire before dancing in the walls and ceiling. <br /> <br /> The taste is not triple. , rainbow sprinkles, chocolate oils, cream and cherry, and banana sundae fragments, but sugar is a solid square cone, although it is melting and blaming in the mouth, it's still nice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
