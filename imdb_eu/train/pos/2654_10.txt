Everyone should watch this movie! The terrifying thing is terrifying, but it does not mean that you have "jump-to-just-do-you-miss-and-over-over-terrifying" things. It is very good. See this awesome movie !!! The director is Stanley Kubrick, the greatest director ever. In all his films they are masterpieces, including this one. Shining is a family that goes to a Colorado Rockies hotel, taking care of the winter, and the snow has entered. Well, the house goes in. It's a psychic child. Husband will easily find bad hotels, and ... well ... HUMANITIES! It's not really. This exciting thriller turns out to be a scary thing from different directions to the viewer. "Here is the classic Johnny" scene. It is memorable, but it is not possible to speak in every movie. The words are not explained correctly, and you just see. So go to Netflix, and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTTTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
