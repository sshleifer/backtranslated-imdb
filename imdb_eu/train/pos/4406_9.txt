Surprisingly, this movie never came to the big Danish screen, so I had to wait for the video release. My expectations are high, but they are not disappointed at all. As with Ang Lee, it's a great performance, an intelligent and exciting plot, you end up guessing it and excellent footage. Together with Unforgiven, this is easily one of the best two westerns of the 90s. <br /> <br /> Mel Gibson's people in the Patriot (Corny) or Braveheart (acceptable) line will be very enjoyable. disappointed, everyone who enjoys the mentioned qualities will have a wonderful time. 10 to 10
