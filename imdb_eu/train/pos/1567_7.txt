It's not too bad that movies, along with Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best, would be Charlie Chan, Moto, Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or Saint. You can spend another hour with some old friends, from one commonplace to one city, killing and dying, always enjoyable in a book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < This probably had an opposite effect! Sanders makes fun at dancing right club, right in the right place at the right time, right lighting and attacking the first killer (at the right time!) And killing him. > <br /> The story and acting is fine, the only thing I got was near the end of the discovery of almost evil genius (Waldeman) with an almost unexpected discovery - the importance it has forgotten about the plot? That said, the series is a good entry.
