A comedy about another world, a comedy that is struggling throughout the jungle of the modern world of the 1950's, native to birth and driving, that is, the beautiful Ealing cannon. Terry-Thomas shines as the Prime Minister shines as usual, a man-made ministry maneuver has led the nation to a disaster that catches an interest in the world, Ian Bannen makes a great romanticism. Corrupted politics and his leanist John Le Mesurier is a silent play as a leading revolutionary leader. It's fun for everyone, especially for the audience; Maybe not at the top of Ealing classic, but very high.
