In fact, I bought a satanic metal and other things that I never bought, but this film played with this idea. Although it does not take seriously the movie or it is highly valued, it is intended to entertain while playing. The story has a metal band that smashes death, a fan has such a dream and the team begins to kill him. So, yes, it happens a bit "Nightmare Elm Street". When Freddy was hit, he never hurt himself. There was no other heavy metal band in the film, but it was very different how the band played, because the kids took a town and crazy. This is just trying to stop the first kind of bandwidth that helps the killer spirit. There is nothing memorable, as I remember everything that kills gory. Actually, the scene I remember, the scene of the girl wearing the headset, and then annoyed the creature of a band of flesh. Nothing wonderful, but it's a nice time.
