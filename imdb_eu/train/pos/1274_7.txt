Note that all those who did not like the movie commented that the book was not as good or that it was different from the book. <br /> <br /> I do not understand criticisms. Books and films are different supports. While books are hours and hours of developing characters and story lines, the movies are about 120 minutes. However, the film has the advantage of stimulating some senses: audio-visual, audio, and imagination. I do not like whether it's as good as the movie or, indeed, it resembles a book based on it. Who is it for? I judge what it is. <br /> <br /> This television movie was charming. An old and often-watched story, which tends to cling, could be a shame. However, they come up with Riffen and Reeves. A reviewer has found the old Riffen. I would never have guessed it was 40 when he made this movie. The actress is as good as 23-24 years ago she's playing well. I also think that Reeves is the best ever. The story could be stronger, and I agree that the screen theater can be "tightened". However, it is worth seeing; Clearly, it is not a powerful love story, but a love that is pleasing to love and delights you with a charming love that overcomes the evil. And it's nice to see a "love story" without compulsory preamble, without kissing at the throat of nakedness or kissing.
