I can not believe the comments made on this movie. <br /> <br /> When I read the terrifying opinions about movies I really asked if I saw the same movie I made. <br /> <br> /> The sight was incredible! Supposedly the actors and directors have done wonderful works on the film. <br /> <br /> I did not have the pleasure of being a prelude to the actress and I could not have added more the most believable movie that I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> I do not know why everyone can have a problem when deciding on Deanna's attempt to commit suicide in drugs, according to comments by selected actors and their stupid option. I do not understand, as someone else writes a movie and as directed by someone else, I can not see how the actor is. I think it's a real movie that I'd have to watch and recommend again. What are the opinions and the bad things are so tight. I hope to see an actor soon. Anyway, I think they were great roles. <br /> <br /> Lanpetuta Philipps is a paid actress someday and I hope she can laugh at everything she criticizes! Girl Go You!
