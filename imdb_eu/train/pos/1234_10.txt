I grew up watching this movie, and I still like it as much as today's baby. Do not listen to critics. They are not the correct ones in these films. Eddie Murphy shines in her role. You can sit down with your whole family and everyone will enjoy it. I recommend this movie to everyone. It's a comedy full of fantasies. With demons, dragons, and a small head of God, like power. This film takes you from LA to Tibet, with a wonderful view of the wonderful temples of the Tibetan mountains. beautiful view! So, go yourself aside and take it! You will not regret it!
