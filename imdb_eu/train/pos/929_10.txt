The father's arrogance came to TV series on Family Guy. Dreamworks Animation was another talented masterpiece. In Simpsons mode, the show is located around a nuclear family (in the case of whites, in this case). Likewise, there is a mild orangutan called Roger, the Vincentian Italian-American Flamenco, the Blake and Victoria eccentric white tigers, the Abertzale extremists Blout and Victoria, and numerous Chutney elephants. The other star shows are Sigfreid and Roy. They are very eccentric and they do everything in a great way so they can entertain most of their daily activities. Interview with boys 'boys' characters with dialogue and controversial issues (drugs, prejudices, etc.) is the source of the program's brilliance. <br /> <br /> The fault of this show's fault is NBC. The episodes opted for a particular order (perhaps affected by the invitation of the invited stars) than the logical production order. Several times, the show was expelled as The Biggest Loser (for as long as 60 minutes was not enough), for example. Indeed, in the future of television, it is a bad precedent if a bold and original show like this fails while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the whole series on DVD and the show was released. Now there are more options to follow. 10/10
