A mid-male parent (William H. Macy) decided to end his family business (Donald Sutherland) with a more relaxed father (Donald Sutherland), while he was smaller (John Ritter). ) and another patience with flirt (Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> Talking about an important dilemma, but "Panic" is a brilliant thriller that meets "American Beauty" "The Professional". Macy and Sutherland stand out here. First premiere of Henry Bromell's first writer and director. I'm surprised I did not have the opportunity to stay in theaters a few weeks ago.
