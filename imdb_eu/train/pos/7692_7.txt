First, I will give my rating to the series; ******* out of ten stars 7. Three drop me down slides after John Amos started. Do not be misunderstood, because later episodes were successful, but Esther Rolle returned to a season and then returned. <br /> <br /> In February of 1974, it really was a magnificent (dramatic) seats brilliant. CBS. It was a first television show about an African-American family living in Chicago in the 1970s. As a spin-off "Maude" produced by Norman Lear, he once again directed the audience deal. <br /> <br /> In this show, there is no comedy scene about boring families in the interior. (Well, "Fox" was "South Central" in '94, but it was not renewed.) <br /> <br /> James Amos, James Evans, was the last father of this family and had to keep it as if he were any father . With her family and her children down the wrong paths of life. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle as her husband was as presumptuous when she got to the children's education on her husband's page. . <br /> <br /> Stuck in a school system that does not meet the academic needs of a young but very young Mikel Carter. His character's name is founder of Mike Evans, Lionel Jefferson was called "The Jeffersons". (Mike Evans died in December 2006). Thelma is a young 16 or 17 year old girl and has a young woman who has to face the dangers of ghetto streets. Jimmie Walker J.J. Evans Jr. The young man does not have enough young people to earn a serious life. <br /> <br /> Simply my favorite episodes are all with John Amos, except Penny. Gordon / Janet Jackson's lines. <br /> <br /> After the disappearance of the character of James Evans, the show lost its stability and the audience left. Esther Rolle left it all year long when he did not want to play JJ's "Dyno-mite's"! <br /> <br /> He returned to the next season after obtaining a guarantee that would guarantee the writer's things. Wilona Woods was a woman who divorced her neighbor, and when she finished, she took a little girl Penny Gordon (Janet Jackson at the age of 10). Penny's endless mother was at Totie Fields, mother of Kim Fields. <br /> <br /> In August 1979, the show was over and all of them came out of a better life project. JJ artist sold the idea of ​​a comic book company, Michael went out to the university. <br /> <br /> Wilona and Penny, Thelma and Keith + Florida soccer players, entered into the same building as Chicago. It's not the realistic end, but it did not matter.
