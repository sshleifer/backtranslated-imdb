"The Invisible Mouse" Tom and Jerry are a beautiful cartoon. He has regular leaks and battles with cat / mouse, but this time they are in a different way. Jerry unexpectedly falls into an invisible ink bottle and, therefore, is very happy about it, because it can cause many "surprises" for Tom to be afraid, scared, and confused. <br /> <br /> Because it's so strange, it's really enjoyable and fun to see what we can not see: Jerry invisible. It's fun to do things without seeing those who do without lifting in the air (who knows it, right?) - that's like it's like life or almost a ghost story. It's also fun to have Jerry visible while eating sweets and fruits. I really do not see this instrumental music I like. <br /> <br /> Some of the best templates on this short term Tom looks at Jerry's shadow and strikes him and even tries to make Tom's skillet. and Jerry writes "Losing me." I like Jerry when he drinks Tom's chocolate pudding, which is once again visible and looks wonderful on his face. <br /> <br /> In general, this short one has the basic ingredients for classic cartoons: humor, entertainment, fun and some beautiful artworks.
