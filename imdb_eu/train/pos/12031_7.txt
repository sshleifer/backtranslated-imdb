(NOTE: small spoilers) Certainly, he was paying attention; I did not know that it was based on a real story until the end! The boy who made the dirty act took a guy like a nice girl who sucked herself; I need to question the reality of real life. Anyone who would kill a husband and wife can not be completely enjoyable. However, he was pleasing to me, because he gave me the advantage; It was much clearer. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is the end (here is the biggest spoiler! If you do not want to learn this paragraph, if you do not want to learn). It was finished a few minutes before, there was no need to find the truth. The way I found "sting" was in operation, but my question is: how did the police persuade him? The movie did not show us this, and it seemed to me that it was very comfortable with no explanation as to why they were convinced. <br /> <br /> I think what they usually did for dramatic purposes, that is, the accuracy of the explanation was given to a suspense star, otherwise there was no essential scene (what we already knew was the scene, and what happened to Brad with). <br /> </ br> Otherwise, this is pretty good; I give it to 7/10. He thought to me Now, I want to know real incident facts. <br /> <br /> Another thing: the movie was made in 1996. Here one review seems to be a new movie. <br /> <br /> PS Prairie Sisto is beautiful. I did not see It may work a bit (it's always an advantage to work).
