The 65 minute length is not a tiny little potboiler that is second to none. My name is Julia Ross, it seems that things are not English. Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes is an example. Outside the work Julia Ross (Nina Foch) is a work of dreams in a new employment agency in London, whose sincere representative seems to be very hungry for a relatives or relatives. After informing the duty, he wakes up (He has been prosecuted) in a great similarity to the Koldish coast on Manderley on the coast, showing how wife of Barry-in-Crumpet, wife of George Macready, shows up with knife and frozen stuff. . Her majestic, damning mother, Dame May Whitty (this time, she is more than a model of bustling efficiency in the vicinity of Lady Vanishes). The vision of this story's nightmare is developed in a claustrophobic way; We know what is happening, but they do not know Mr Julia. Curiously enough, this movie is an honorable place in the usual first films (and very few British) noirs. I think the gothic tradition of the old dark house, more than the dense sock and the corruption of the city; However, psychoanalysis of the mind is more modern. Whatever you call it, it is very encouraging.
