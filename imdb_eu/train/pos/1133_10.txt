This is my movie, wife, daughter, and I think it's a beautiful movie. The plot is crazy, but it's a "real ring" in the world of telenobels, with its many disabilities and disabilities. <br /> <br /> Especially I enjoyed Kevin Kline and Sally Field performances. I'm not better than Klin, who plays THICKheaded. The need for attention and confirmation of Field's character was disappointed, and almost a bipolar mood in good mood - they played well on the back of the renowned Field's famous (famed) man. Oscar's exclamation People that can bring in great salts are very rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think it's the only movie that I did not feel when I was using Usopi Goldberg characterization. Every thought I considered was "standing still". Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue were also first class. If you're just a great movie, you're just going to enjoy it!
