This movie is one of the plots I've seen. For me, that is so horrible! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at the Munsters series series. Although Slapstick was less, they still worked "comical." Yvonne De Carlo, Lily, would like to have a more participative plot. The original series showed that he could do the comedy, but most of this film was wasted. This movie also features Sid CÃ©sa, but unfortunately it does not interact with Gwynne and Lewis. I think that such a better job would be.
