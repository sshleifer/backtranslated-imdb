I like the sports story to do well. It was so much so tidy in the past to see it shameful. Not this. The movie is really enjoyable, based on the true life story of Dennis Quaid's film, the old type of story. He plays a high school coach who tries to test his life athletically later to become a pitcher in professional baseball. In the end, he achieves the goal of reaching the main leagues, although it has been very short. <br /> <br /> All the people here are gentle people from Quaid. The players of its secondary school, their little boy (Angus T. Jones, now a little television star). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <span class = he knows the boot It seems like a pitcher, a guy who could burn a 90 km fire at that time. And, a big part of this film is true, as documentaries on DVD are shown in the real context. <br /> <br /> So, if you are looking for a really nice and inspiring sporty movie, you can not go wrong.
