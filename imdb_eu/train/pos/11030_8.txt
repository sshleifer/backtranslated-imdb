Seeing Cliffhanger in the early 90's is a nostalgic one. Almost all of the action movies may be "Die Hard in a / on a". Cliffhanger is "Die Hard on a Mountain" and is pretty good, what it is. <br /> <br /> Baina Passenger 57 eta Under Siege ez bezala, bere termino propioetan Die Hard clones duin ez bezala, Cliffhanger-ek ezartzen du ekintza-film ugarien sentimendu itxi bat eta paisaia paregabeak biltzen ditu, haien izugarrizko abantailetan gailentzen diren The conflicts between peoples and the conflicts that overcome the conflicts that die. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zenbait urte A simple plan eta beste film batzuk lehenago Fargo dramatizatutako krimena eta hilketa elurrak estalitako kokalekuetan, Renny Harlin zuzendariaren Cliffhanger zuzendariak onartu zuen indarkeria brutalak eta borroka latzak ondo-ondoan The effect of living against the cold and indifferent natural environment. <br /> <br /> <br /> The initial sequence has already been awarded thanks. All this deserves: the intensity allows us to forget the camera and actors' artifacts and only what we really believe is happening. Halaber, Harlinen erortzen diren animalia beteak, oso indartsua baina oraindik mehatxatzen duena txantxa gehiegizkoa bihurtzeko (eta errepikatzen du Deep Blue Sea-en), edo Ralph Waiten aurpegiaren adierazpen barregarria ere, sekuentziaren ahalbidea lausotu dezake. <br /> <br /> The next spectacular piece is the whirlwind and the robbery stroke. Written by Stallone and Michael France and directed by Harlin, the viewers are immersed in action, initially robbing and not knowing what the agents are: the bloody double cross is unexpectedly unexpected. As Roger Ebert has seen, stuntman's transfer between the planes between the planes deserves special recognition. <br /> <br /> Later, in the sequence of mountaineers, it seems that a terrorist or a thief falls. it rolls the snow walls down the mountain. I know, no one was killed during this film (a small miracle, considering the extreme nature of some states), so a fake shot was used. But the shooter is horrible. Harlin (or possibly a manager of the second unit) knows how to find out where the camera is. <br /> <br /> I will take my Sly Stallone to the hero of the action every day of the week, because someone I have ever seen is absolutely compelling for many physical and emotional pain and, at the same time, a movie that feels painful. Gabe Walker's mission is to make Stallone's strengths: he acts as an older and most vulnerable hero, recovering himself as a mountain retrieval. Stallone's Walker today's post-Matrix, a comic-inspired action hero, will become an ordinary hero without paranormal or computer skills. In Cliffhanger, the hero almost freezes death, and his clothes have begun to show great tears, as he escapes from a stranger to a dangerous situation. He strikes the cut-offs when cut off and, above all, in the sequence of the cave, when he attacks a giant dog, he takes it from one of the wicked foolish dogs. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that all stupid criminals. We really help the film's effectiveness: for the first time I watched this movie as a teenager, I was good at guiding every step of the way and anticipating some other bad guy (or rather, ice). At one moment, I had a really cold character that filled my cold character with a cold movie that I really encouraged. <br /> <br /> <br /> The British accent of Lithgow is not so believer in some exemplary movie models or helicopters. essentially a good actor, and one of the few reciting foolish conversations: trying to decide on the tasks he hands down for the Stallone and Rooker guerrillas, what you really say. " Nahiz eta aktore hobeago bat, hala nola Anthony Hopkins, arazoak izan lerro horrekin. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger-ek noizean behin sinesgarritasuna botatzen badu ere, ikuskizun dibertigarri baten mesederako bakarrik egiten du. > <br /> Filmaren hasieran for example, Lithgow his men to "open [Stallone] down the matches," he says. there is no doubt, no errors will be a real punishment dominant: its negligence Rookerrek Slyri warning before a loud voice, allowing him, and Stallone and txarrak harrapatu nahian dabiltzan gatazka sarkorra sortzen du. bere sokarekin lotuta dagoen soka. Lithgow-k bere eskaera modu sotilagoen bidez eman lezake, baina sekuentzia ez da hain dibertigarria izan ikustea Rooker-ek ez balu eman bere kaptatzailearen harrokeria defy. <br /> < br /> Saturday that challenges much of the Matinee series or (sometimes) Western style, Cliffhanger is built on a solid base, element ah Some ula will survive. They have weakened a smaller movie. The heaviest models of the previously mentioned airliner have been dramatically striking, some of the weak moments have filmed a cheap set of interior with REALLY snow snow, and two other batch scenes and Now unnecessary wolves, already in a narrative full of actions. In the end, Harbin's decision to shoot some scenes of death seems to be astonishing, because this technique does not bring anything back. <br /> <br /> Pena is the Stallone theater theater for the old film, because it's his character. I think it's so compelling in this film, I wonder what a year later it would be. However, perhaps the best Cliffhanger can be on his own without a break: old and obsolete movie franchises. There was a sequel to a vertical constraint: Cliffhanger is included in the Top 250 listing on Clinker. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8 (Very good, especially considering most of Stallone's films).
