"Written wind" Douglas Sirk is a melodrama. Douglas Sirk "Cahiers du Cinema", Fassbinder, etc., were recaptured as a senior director. I think that due to the sophistication of his filmography, "Wind Tyrant" offers beautiful, colorful images and beautiful decorations. . But I ask myself: Is it enough to take a movie? The performance of "Written winds" is weak and reasonable (except Robert Stack), convincing it as a weak and damaged playboy. Lauren Bacall, usually a powerful presence on the screen, fails in this movie. The seductive Dorothy Malone, responsible "femme fatale", is well, but she lacks the function. Rock Hudson is effective, but it's just. <br /> <br /> The plot has very interesting components. The main characters are: <br /> <br /> Strong Patriarch Kyle (Robert Stack) Alcoholic (never a disappointed father) <br /> <br /> his frustrated and Marylee daughter nymphomaniac (Dorothy Malone) <br /> <br /> Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a woman in principle, a first secretary and now married to Kylie <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought with Kylan and the love of the patriarch. <br /> <br /> Secrets outside the door, love triangle, frustration, fistfights, laughter, death, etc. - Well, I thought I read the summary when I read the back cover of the story. to treat it. My mistake! Why? I will try to explain: "The wind is written" is taken seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. As the play is said, in general, it's not enough, the intensity is lacking. The scenes of the story are very strong, but the actors work efficiently. I think maybe Italian or Spanish actors would be fully exploring these scenes - they would end up (for us) in a laughter or tear explosion. <br /> <br /> Douglas has a fine cinema in Douglas. Sirk. It's not enough for me. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, see "Aventurera".
