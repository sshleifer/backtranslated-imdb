My husband and I enjoy DoodleBops as much as 8 months of age. We have purchased DVDs and CDs to see and hear ourselves. It is fun, energetic and very fun. Children encourage, share and care for children. They always have a positive message with fun entertainment. Every time he listens to our son, he instantly turns to himself on television, and goes up and down with enthusiasm for the return. Dee Dee is a great singer, she has a great voice. Moe is a great dancer. I would recommend it to DoodleBops with kids. Our favorite song is The Bird Song. You just can not help smiling and dancing when you want to hear.
