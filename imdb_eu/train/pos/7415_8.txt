It can be a simple and attractive movie quality. This movie tells her everyday scenes and she gets a tremendous joy inside her. As others have said, this movie shows how Hollywood's loss of special effects, overwhelming emotionalism and climatization overlooks the essence of a significant story told by mere realism. What's happening with these characters is a significant scene in the dialogue. A party that liked the film was a contrast between the brothers, clearly expressing it as a child, and the other being absolutely stoic, but also a reminder of deep emotion. The old brother needed little to say, as usual, everything came on his slow face! Beautiful cinematography, performance, great direction! Do not miss it!
