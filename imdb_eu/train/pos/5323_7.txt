There are a few things that are not correct, but this is not very important, since what happened to us and from what happened. In my opinion, most prominent freedoms when they started playing at the Kaiserkeller Bruno Koschmidder when they played Indra and later hit Kaiserkeller. <br /> <br /> I agree with the movie Semprinni20, because it was a supporter of the Pete Best version, but as a story consultant, I call the plans. I also agree with Semprinni saying that they are the last word to play Pete Best recordings. <br /> <br /> Although the film does not have such a large production, later on, it is the "Backbeat" movie. I prefer this movie because it is more accurate and because it has a better script for deeper characterization. <br /> <br /> There are quite a lot of movies, such as Brian Epstein, who is trying to hide the truth. It was "weirdly bashed", only to know that the band was Gay to find out together. To introduce the groups to a cafe and request "Corn-Flakes mit Milch". My favorite scene has some bass, in which audition Stuart Sutcliffe has bought a low guitar, but he can not play it, so he's in the back of the imprints and tries to imagine it, but he gets caught. That's rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br /> Well worth watching.
