Purple color masterpiece. Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover show amazing performance. Not only Steven Spielberg, but also the most incredible director of all time, but its versatility is reflected through that film. If you ever want to see what I can see. It's a great portrait of all the most exciting stories of all time!
