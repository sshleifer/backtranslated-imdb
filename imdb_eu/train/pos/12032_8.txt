The movie I'm going to review is a small TV movie produced in 1996 and featured Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. The main character and antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) are all American teenagers. who is feeling the pressure of controlling that dad (Baldwin). However, when Nick Ryan is known as an ex con (Jeremy Jordan "Never Been Kissed"), they immediately fall apart, but Jennifer has another idea of ​​where they are related. He manages to kill his parents to protect his "love", but he used to get rid of his parents, to be with Brad (David Lascher's Hart mate of the future "Sabrina"). Melissa Joan Hart really shocked me with the role of her evil manipulator and she's been working with her friends and Nick, so she can literally escape with her murder. The rest of the parts help to work well and each one has their own time in the screen. Similarly, that year I made this movie and released it, I found it interesting, in that, Sabrina, played with Teenage Witch, which shows that I can make movies and TV my genres. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is still the best work of theater or thrill, the 'Nine Dead' is on November 17th. It shows how other people called "Clarissa Darling" can be seen. or Sabrina Spellman "<br /> <br /> I'd recommend this movie to Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina. You can watch it on the Internet, so I recommend you check it out.
