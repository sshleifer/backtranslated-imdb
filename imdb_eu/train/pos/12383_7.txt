Christina Raines is looking for a new apartment in New York, looking for a new apartment, and she begins to encounter strange neighbors, reveals the secret to the building, and slowly builds herself at the end of the film. This film has all sorts of flimsy elements in front of the Catholic Church's Devil, hellish portal, strange rituals, increasingly conspiracies, and finally, with many famous actors and actresses who fill the movie. Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly De Angel, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger and Jeff Goldblum. To forget John Carradine as an old priest. Many of these actors rub it - especially Burgess Meredith as a comic / dementia performer with a small bird and a neighbor with a cat. Meredith is a memorable Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some interpreters have almost nothing to do with an effort like Jose Ferrer, although it's just a cameo. Sentinel is a beautiful horror movie with many psychological elements and some truly horrific scenes. The final scene is satisfying and still cold. I am guilty of having sexually-fledgling movies and violence, especially DeAngelo and Miles with the whole scene. Was this necessary? I do not think so. Likewise, there was also a bit of dad / daughter's, but in general, the film has a winning pace. The director Michael Winner does a job and it is effective in creating strained and terrifying moments. Carradine's scenes are particularly effective.
