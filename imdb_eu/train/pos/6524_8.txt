<br /> <br /> If you are fully interested in pirates, pirate movies, New Orleans / XIX. American history of the 20th century or Yul Brynner, see this film yourself and give it to your mind. Do not have any comments. My reaction was fun and well-done (in most cases), it has some incredible conversations, and Jean Lafitte works to portray the charm, imagination and fascination of the rookie. Although all the events of the film are not historically correct (did you show me such a historical film?), I believe that the film is the correct treatment of the role played by the history of New Orleans. The respectable "citizenry" of New Orleans was one of the most popular and popular places in the country. Do not worry what the filmmaker does, but see what he does, that is, in New Orleans, and for one of the most interesting American historical figures.
