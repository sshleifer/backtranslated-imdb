I only went to cinema yesterday in Mexico, where films from other countries are part of an "alternative camera". After seeing this movie, I noticed that all foreign films are not alternative. To be honest, it's a good example. But I must say I liked the movie ... I was finally happy ... this movie is a little hope these days. And the main lesson for me is, finally, love ... it is the main force for us. It's a good option to watch a good movie in Spanish ... and I have to mention good music ... especially the main song of the movie ... Things that make life worthwhile ... A great song! !!
