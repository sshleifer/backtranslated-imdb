I loved this movie, at first glossy graphics seemed odd with sour graffiti, but soon I went in. Hundreds of hours have been filmed and I admire their work. If you are amazed by drug or violence, this may not be a movie for you, but here are some great characters (and some real tossers). Although I liked it technically, I had to use a new deformation algorithm, or maybe the footage was so dark, but I was not angry at the video clips that I saw on conventional objects. (Open Water took me out, especially since progressive cameras are available, and I do not see any excuse for swearing what's in the movies). Sorry for me If you have taken part in the field of music, we have some tragic moments, but most of them are hilarious, laughing at the misfortune of others, but it's classic.
