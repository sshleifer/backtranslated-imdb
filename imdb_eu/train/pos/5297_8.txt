I watched this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. The place was packed and everyone laughed so hard to lose the lines. I know it seems to be good, but I think it would be much more fun. I liked it with Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, it seemed really strange to them, just like ordinary folks, if it's sensible. I will fall into movies that show teens like cookie cutter, like "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader" ... They were two unique characters, but still very human and normal enough to connect. I recommend this movie to all my friends and it will be very eager to appear on the DVD, go to this movie with the most fun part of your life with your friends! Again I want to see in the theater and I do not see things more than once.
