This movie was a 8-10 year old in a dark and cold afternoon. I was playing all day long, frozen, and when I came to 16:00, I had a cup of hot cocoa and sat with a blanket in front of the TV. I was surprised to see that I was seeing cartoons that were not happy and absurd and, in fact, it was dark and moral. He caught my imagination. I'm sure the text fails, and it's summed up in all the wrong places in Tolkien's purist. However, it preserves the spirit of the story, the possibility of carrying a burden of others, selfishness, cunning decisions, etc. As a result, the quality of the animation is complaining. The only place that is clearly emphasized on this new movie are the voice characterization. John Hurt is great in that. If you do not want to draw the character, check it out and just listen. His voice is extraordinary. I have seen it again many times and always brings me a girl and a magical adventurer at that time. That's why I'm lucky to say it's nostalgic for me, so I forgot its shortcomings. But between John Hurt and Tolkien's fantasy, I still get it and it still does.
