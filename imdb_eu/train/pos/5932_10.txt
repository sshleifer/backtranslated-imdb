The best movie Stephen King, along with IT, is even more fun than this. <br /> <br /> It has all been accomplished: <br /> <br /> -All cast with Alice Krige and Brian Krause and King himself a fun camera; <br /> <br /> - A well-written fear in a fun story: <br /> <br /> -Museum of great use, particularly the "Sleepwalk" of Santo and Johnny; <br /> <br /> -Ley-character typical characters in a King's setting: half the country nowhere; <br /> <br /> humor. You can not get any fear here because it's funny and upside down; <br /> <br /> -And the makeup effects are really enjoyable! <br /> <br /> <br /> 4.5 points: I do not really get it. When was this last time as fun as a horror movie?
