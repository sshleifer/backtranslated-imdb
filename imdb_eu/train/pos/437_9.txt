Enchanted April is a tone poem, an Impressionist, a masterpiece to send a message with little words. Since its inception, it has been one of my 10 favorite films. The film continues to look like DVD format, though it's less. Apparently, I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> If your mother's business is Amazon's listings, there's a lot of people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this movie in their libraries. Theatrical performance is spectacular, cinematography and the perfect direction. The movie is definitely the door. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list.
