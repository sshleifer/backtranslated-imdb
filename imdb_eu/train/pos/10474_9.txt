This movie seemed amazing to me. Depression, pain, loneliness, disappointment, hope, dreams and companionship. It was not just a musician who jumped at the bottom, but he was worried about a man who was trying to overwhelm his music. He finds a friend with his affairs. Claire and Des could give each other friendship and love, but more importantly, they concluded that they had a worse life for the events of their lives. <br /> <br /> Today, the character of a rock star is a different character. However, it has a genius of music. Additionally, a past event has stopped and things around him are literally ruining. His focus is on the creation of his Whale Music, which becomes an obsession with him. <br /> <br /> Claire is a street child who needs a place. Desano finds hidden talents. He also finds a mutual friend who accepts him. He learns confidence in a while. <br /> <br /> These two find love together. It is not an intelligence that stimulates the love of infusions, love, and intelligence of the type of passion. For two people who have been hurt, they find themselves confident.
