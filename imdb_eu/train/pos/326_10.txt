"Jag är nyfiken? Yellow" is very funny. Like at least another reviewer, I laughed. Yellow is powerful, playful, self-conscious, an explorer. Do not expect Bergman here. This film is about young people from the early 60s of Sweden, with regard to these issues, * read contradictions *, the nation and the world. Sometimes, a serious political societal documentary, Lena, the main character, and others, is shown in yellow, as people and politicians are interviewing (for example, Olaf Palme at home). In other cases, Yellow seems to be a parody of this kind of document. Meanwhile, Yellow is working as a personal documentary about Lena's life - her home life, her love, her political views, her own vision. Is the whole person complex, mistake, contradiction, happy, dull, curious. And all of this is documented by documentary Lena, adding a wonderful extra dimension to Sjöman and his crew. This is what, for me, it really gives a yellow wing. Suddenly, they are very entertaining at times and in fun ways, reminding them of fiction and artificiality, but their presence is another layer of the film; they are shooting themselves. Bjork music video reminds me of the same quality? a music video, ad infinitum, a video clip, each and every curious and cartoon animation. I think Sjöman can have something like that. "Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow" may not all be tea cups, but intelligence is spirit, refreshing, quick and genuine.
