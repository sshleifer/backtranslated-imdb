THE BLOB is a great horror movie, not only because of these horrible images of almost incredible title, but because it has a real social message. In many ways, horror film is sensitive. The strong interpretation of the cartoon contributes to a clear story. The romantic directors Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut bring a great deal of depth and feeling to the process. They are misunderstood, but they are very well thought out young people, and it is very easy to promote them. <br /> <br /> This is a film of society, and especially for young offenders, they create problems that cause boredom, but not bad mistakes of evil characters. Steve McQueen's racing rival is almost an enemy at the start but quickly joins the McQueen campaign to save the citizen when he sees McQueen's seriousness. Thus, the sudden appearance of a cartoon character suddenly develops depth and realism. <br /> <br /> The early idea of ​​savage claims by children is proven to be wrong and once the threats are acknowledged by all, all social conflicts disappear. The consolidation of these goals and the adventitious "goring" of teens, when Aneta Corsauten's father enters school, becomes an officer to obtain the necessary extinguishers for Blob freezing. On any other day, joining the school would be the vandalism type of youth delinquency. In this specific day, an image of an adult authority is required. At this point of inflection, it is clear that there is no distribution line between minors. <br /> <br /> This is an unusual movie because it recognizes the perception of "pure generation", but suggests that this is more imaginary than the real one, and because of the real crisis, people will naturally meet the order to restore order. "The Blob" is a perfect tone, generally the type of depression that comes with "Night of the Living" (1968). <br /> <br /> The price of the movie is cheap but innovative. Effective!) visual effects. It is definitely clear. The gravity of the blob performance has been challenged with the miniature sets designed to rotate. The camera was usually attached to the set in a "locked" position (the lights had to be added in the same way while keeping the light steady and thus activated). These scenes often photographed at a time, the room slowly turned - the silicone blob poured slowly and had to increase its actions. Somehow, it was similar to moving photography photography, but using a silicone bubble, rather than an articulated puppet. Even today, the effects are amazing and extravagant. <br /> <br /> With the title of the very best film, THE BLOB is essential.
