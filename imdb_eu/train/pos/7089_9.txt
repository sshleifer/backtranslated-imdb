Without a doubt, 12 MONKEYS are one of the best Sci-Fi genres and director Terry Gilliam is no stranger to the originality of his film. A wonderful Spanish apocalyptic movie, 12 MONKEYS will never leave and guess it all over the way. The good use of local Philadelphia and the world's bands create a Gothic sense of tragedy and two badly trapped friends create a bad place. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis flaxes his imaginary image and portrays the truth that is directed to him. all this will happen. It is really sensible, but if the future people (or if they are present) distorted the head of this type so badly in trips over time, it is not surprising. World War One has been sent to the WWII after an eradication of the abolition of civilization by twelve monkeys. In the end they are well understood, and we will see worrisome Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt for 6 years in a unique script that matches the play. <br /> <br /> Stowe is sensual and strong, as it is a risk-reducing factor, as Willis begins not realizing how passionate it is. An attractive element of relationship between Willis and Willis is meaningful to each other before, in another place or in time. 12 MONKEYS essentially include people of times and madness, and nowadays, when murderers and psychotic geniuses can change the world. <br /> <br /> The city of Philadelphia is terribly and dark. That Willis's difficult situation is to play a role against all the typical Hollywood stereotypes, not to save the world. Collecting information. The movie also tricks the viewer, Willis puts it in a new setting in a drop of a pin. This was a very difficult image, but Gilliam seems to be a master of hard-core films. However, he goes down a bit of humor, remembering some of his great works, such as TIME BANDITS and BRAZIL. The screen is the canvas of the man, and he knows how to paint a horrible world of imaginations and a budget for his possible future in high-budget films. If you want madness insanity and ironic tragedy, see 12 MONKEYS. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9/10
