I only saw this movie after hearing about raves for many years. Needless to say, he proved that the real experience was somewhat antigone. However, Alec Guiness energetically portrays the wonderful vote, if it is a formula, through the Second World War II World War II industry. <br /> <br /> This is a misfortune to guess the perfect everyday product. Remember the car running the water? Remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, there is no fabric, wrinkle or even dirty fabric. Of course, a hundred manufacturers and workers are horrified by their hopes of not being out of business, so the plot continues to grow thick. <br /> <br /> It makes an idea that deserves all the company, and it sees a blow. The factory research laboratory is again quite blasting! (These bitters ... always when the sword is hard and hard). The film is similar to the invention of Guinness, but a good career.
