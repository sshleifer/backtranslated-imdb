I have always said that animated Batman films are much better than live movies. <br /> <br /> I've seen all the animated films, but the outer series, which is poorer, and quite bad. <br /> <br /> "Fantastic Mask" would be the best, then "World's Best", then "Sub Zero", then "Return to the Game" and eventually the latter. <br /> <br /> In this new animation film, there is a mysterious new Gotham Batman and Batman seeks to find out whether his friends or enemies start revenge. <br /> <br /> But as Bruce is involved with three young women, he starts investigating and knows who he is. <br /> <br /> The tone of this movie is unusually lightweight, since most of the movies are bold and harsh, but they were quite disappointing. Bruce is very active in most characters, the criminals re-used by the latest films, and while action scenes are exciting, there's really nothing new. There is also a dramatic impact on other films, especially the title of "Sub-Zero" and the development of the characters. <br /> <br /> Everything in the movie feels quite recycled and charming characters are charming, but nobody is really worth the effort. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I really liked it, I had a blast, and the new batgirl's personality is amazing, but I was not as exciting. I hope <br /> <br /> (** **** half)
