I've seen the Holes movie and I can say that the movie was the best throughout the whole year. The child has come out for everyone. I would like to say that the idea that he would intend to punish himself was an intention to hurt his disturbing boys? This is Louis Sachar. Although the film was different, it was very good. For example, Caveman / Stanley was supposed to be the biggest there. He was a cautious and tallest guy, but ZigZag / Ricky was taller and Armpit / Theodore was bigger. He was considered one of the smallest X-Ray / Rex boys, but not. I did not like the movie, it was the only thing that the flashbacks were, and long ago. I'd rather not see it before in the present, but that's my opinion. Especially, I like the work of the boys. Like Squid / Alan, as Jake M.Smith did, he was a tough guy. Jake M.Smith has only worked, and has done a great job like almost all the actors in Holes. So, I would not say if you did not see Zuloak, then I should see again if you should see it or much more fun.
