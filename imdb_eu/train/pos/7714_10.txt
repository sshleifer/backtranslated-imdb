In the 1950s there were many science fiction films. Drive's great drawings for theaters. Many of them were proud then. This movie and 'The Day the Earth Seasons Still' stand out and both are well in their old age. From the beginning, the terribly heavy theremin (which is still unhealthy, as it is hardly ever used) will take you to the planet where no one has gone before. When talking about Star Trek, Star Trek is a pilot of the TOS series that featured so much material; interactive captain / first student / doctor, mad scientist, strange creature, short skirt, computer intelligence; Now it is not so absurd, but it was the first of its kind. It also has a good performance and well-done works, and nowadays it reminds us of a certain fear of the images. Let's say that the huge machine Krell is fully depicted. I saw the baby (in the drive: 0) when it was a new movie and I was scared. Of course, it was so scary that he made all the films, but I remember the invisible monster that was a real concern. Forbidden Planet is a movie science fiction fan can be seen several times and watch to see something new every time.
