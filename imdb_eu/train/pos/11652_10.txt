I filmed this movie while listing the movies I wanted to record for my accident while on vacation, and I am so pleased to include this. Most of the directors are addressing issues that are deceptive, my only problem with the movie is television, so I could not buy a copy to my friend! <br /> <br /> How is a moving story? people with eating disorders do not necessarily embarrass everyone and how much they help them. My attention has been given to the fact that Bulimia is a relatively permanent weight, with many people who do not know about health.
