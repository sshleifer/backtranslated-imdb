Kim Novak is a witch for lovers of lovers, and James Stewart chooses. A wonderful comedy mode from the Broadway stage; Shooting by James Wong Howe by Witch Color and a sterling cast. Ernie Kovacs is wonderful as Redlitch writers are constantly scorned. I love this movie, but it looks like others too. Kim only gains in my book. Ha! 1958 in my # 5 movie
