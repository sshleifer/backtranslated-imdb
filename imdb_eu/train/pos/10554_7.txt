NOT (3+ 5 stars) The curious premise of the director of "Cube" film. This time, they find two main characters, their house and their empty spaces. There is literally no outside two-story house. It's probably attractive, but I thought that the comedy tone created for this movie was very badly done. I should definitely have a bit of humor ... and I did not create any problems with the humor that came from the bad state of our two heroes (the last "discovery" was definitely) ... but I think the movie. It would be much better if initially it was rooted in reality. After watching the movie, I watched it on the DVD "Making of" and finally saw a short trailer almost entirely "non-comet" elements ... making a completely different (and a bit better) film. The last half hour of the movie begins to really unite things ... It's similar to the new "Primer" movie. Actors are well off when the comedy shtick does not pass. They are really incredible at the "normal" moment. I'm sure this movie is ready to write this movie as a half-test ... but he finally won me. (And follow the credits for the final scene ... simply do not ask to explain.)
