This is my type of film. I am fascinated with the mysterious psychotic nightmare and this is just this film. But it is also a dark comedy. As I see myself as a horror thriller, there will be others who see it as a dramatic black comedy. <br /> <br /> But nevertheless, madness is wonderful. He caught the end, but what an end! It allows the spectator to think a lot. <br /> <br /> The great script, a complex and detailed plot, a script full of dread and dreadful moods, and a mysterious atmosphere that is worthy of a film. <br /> Personally, I think I should see them several times to see and understand all the subtleties that fit inside. But that movie is nice and not so intricate.
