An excellent movie! Jiri Trnka, master of puppet animation, is facing totalitarianism, his latest film. The Czechoslovakia communist government was prohibited (at that time), despite the country's biggest animation prize. <br /> <br /> In this dark and entertaining film, an artist tries to create a new pot of his favorites. plant Luckily he makes his creations while his plant is dreaming to become a beautiful rose. Suddenly, he knocked at the door and came up with a generous giant hand that tries to detect the statue. The artist resists the artist as he can, but eventually overcomes the constant effort that fixes his hands. It becomes a brain cleansing; an intellectual zombie At this point he attaches his hand to the artist, uses it in a cage and uses it to make a statue by hand. Inside, he has glorified the work of the artist and has given him medals and honors. <br /> <br /> The artist who tries to express himself freely about himself helps endocracy more than he can and escapes his jail. whether literal or minded, and to return to his home, where he now has to live the fear of generosity. He shuts himself up, thinking he is out of the hand of generosity, but in the process he raises his plant and the ship is waiting for his hand and ends in his head. they killed him. The artist is indissolubly destroyed in his creation. He lived with all his fear when he ran away from his hand as he was definitely afraid. In the dead, his hand is a great artist, as a national hero. Unfortunately, there is no reason to remember circumstances or artists. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It is not surprising that the government has banned, because it is the kind of media that people admire and maybe even hear. Of course, this is not acceptable. An excellent example and a potential example of a civil disobedience artist. And it is still very important in many parts of the world, from the US to the Middle East. Must see from 10 to 10! Speak!
