After reviewing the lively film of martial arts for almost 18 years, I must say I did not miss a bit of mysticism, nor a brilliant show of his martial arts, as I remembered in my youth. The story of a martial arts teacher who is dying is "a" unfinished "student to find five of his Poison Clan members, so the master does not seek the money they keep hiding from his friend. His latest student will not be afraid of training, he will order him to join five "steamers" to defeat another four. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about choreography or camera work. A good film about himself, and quite possibly, one of the best film arts films ever made. CLASSIC!
