We thought what we thought was what we thought was a great Henry Fonda was like Abraham Lincoln. It's a scam. Through the performance of Fonda, we thought Abraham Lincoln was a bumpkin (on the surface). But with the lynch mafia and especially before the court, in front of him, under the outer attitudes, he can be seen as a brilliant man, who controls his surroundings very well and affects his people around him. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda shows this how she presents humor. It's a party that has been lost over the years. When it tells stories and jokes, time is fine. It seems like a very bad sequence made me laugh. This gift shows again The Lady Eve in 1940. <br /> <br /> The end of John Ford is magnificent towards the top of Henry Fonda, and in the distance with the incredible storm of the Civil War. . It progresses in history. The movie is a fiction, but Lincoln's great vision. Without a doubt, it is worth seeing again.
