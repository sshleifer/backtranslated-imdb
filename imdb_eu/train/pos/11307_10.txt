The great sound of this movie's movie is not only good music but also music, but it also helps to sow images. A beautiful opening that sets the theme of beautifully ambiguous cause of Gino's expulsion! Keep in mind that as we enter music characters in the marriage of Giovanna. Do not think much about Italy's political life in 1943. That's not it. On the other hand, in front of the music of the images and the sounds, it will take you to a word that goes beyond neorealism. At the end of the film, Antonioni has an unparalleled landscape, rather than the real life of the characters and the real places. This is one of my favorite Visconti films.
