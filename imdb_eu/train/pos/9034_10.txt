This movie is completely BRILLIANT !! The great performances of this film are excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. Mr. Gyllenhaal seems to have a terrific film career, though. I thought Joe Johnston was a curious choice as a director, because it was tied with blockbusters of high budget (Jumanji, Honey children I shattered). Each scene pulls with its class. My favorite scene, Homer descends below the pain and looked at the sky, because all of his dreams were beautiful. It should be directed to those superb films directed by Joe Johnston, and his great budget fusion, which is superb. Kudos !! all those who take part in this masterpiece!
