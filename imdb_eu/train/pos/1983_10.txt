I recently saw it in a cable channel. The movie is great; I have seen one of the few musical ones I have seen, which is far from clear and obscure. It represents a part of the splendor of that period, because it is very bad. Several pieces of dance sequences are happening, I did not know where to look. One day I'll go to see it on the big screen to see what happens. But it is really a performance on Oliver Reed's Bill Sykes. He is a giant and mighty man, but something else, some internal demons. If you pushed in a corner, it was something that could be done. Almost Sykes was like a character on the edge of insanity, the launcher waited. I saw Robert Newton's Bill Sykes in the 1948 movie, and I thought the egg was bad, but the interpretations of Oliver Reeden were scared me in my living room.
