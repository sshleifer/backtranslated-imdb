In 1987, Hong Kong released a movie in the world by Sammo Hung's "Spooky Kind" Chow Yun Fat "Meetings" by John Woo's "A Better Tomorrow", "Zu Warriors" and "Mr. Vampire" classic. Jackie Chan had an international hit on the video, but it was with "A Chinese Ghost Story" that HK cinema played its first true cross in the West for many years. <br /> <br /> Western movie makers did not see anything. Like it HK was a movie that took several parts of the film during the years (winged sword, martial arts and supernatural choreographies) and confused their appearance, feeling and execution to create a unique movie. Let's forget about the unnecessary and unnecessary succession, which is the original and the best. <br /> <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching (still known as Woo's 'A Better Tomorrow 2' /). The Killer ') created the fantasy / horror film masterpiece under the look of legendary producer Tsui Hark. And with such expert team (less than 6 Martial Arts Co-ordinators), it would be unthinkable that the movie might be wonderful. <br /> <br /> He edited David Wu (an amazing writer). / "The Bride With White Hair 2" and "A Better Tomorrow 1/2/3", "Hardboiled" and "The Club" were the classic titles that were released as a cult hit. It's just a genius. He choreographed with different choreographed warriors, and makes it one of the best HK films ever created. They are moving fast, curiously but never confusing, even today, they are the culmination of their art. <br /> <br /> Cinematograph crews have also done wonders. Each shot in this film is painted very well. The wonderful marvelous blue night scene, always hidden in a dark misty ghost, is a great platform that opens our story. It's a movie that is used to weave everything like beauty. The silk dresses and dresses made by Hsiao Tsing have also become a part of the animated pieces of the film, in romantic sequences or battle scenes, that emit silk silk that cross the silk screen. Hsiao Tsing is a simple scene that transforms clothes into a stunning beauty, since all the skills in this set combine to create a memorable scene of this simple action. The sets are also astonishing, giving a sense of the world to another forest, and the temple and grief of the depleted desert of hell to obtain a wonderful end. The design produced by Zhongwen Xi deserves the greatest praise. <br /> <br /> Another important factor in successful films is Romeo Diaz and James Wong. Hong Kong's films have earned a great deal of music and choreography for the success of a sequence, but the music on "A Chinese Ghost Story" is vital. From the beginning song, it's as important as music as the characters. <br /> <br /> It is a perfect mix of modern and traditional score instruments. The drums, bells and guitars are far removed from the action sequences, but they go in more romantic and slim pieces. here; Flute, chains and women's effects are the best pieces of music that are heard in HK. Add this beautiful stunning song that tells Tsau-Shen and Hsiao Tsing's love (it's never seen anything, but the effect is wonderful, this movie is the innocent love of innocent love) and a brilliant example of power. It can have music from the movie. <br /> <br /> And, of course, we also have the talent of the theater. Leslie Cheung ("A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2" and a well-known singer) is notable as a tax collector innocent. His work (fortunately gentle) never exceeds the comic sequences, and his scenes play Joey Wang's passion and innocence right. <br /> <br /> Joey Wang (later, especially, it would fall) Chow Yun Fat / Andy Lau's "God of Gamblers" class roles in movies like this will never be brighter than here. Ethereal beauty is essential. Hsiao Tsing's tragic portrait is amazing. His character shows sadness about what he has become and what he needs to do, but also a subtle eroticism that man gives man to death by his death. Wu Ma, a veteran actor ("Mr. Vampire", "Swordsman") is very funny, brave, but always grumpy, Yen. A delightful line of excitement between the eccentric and the annoying, practiced with ease. And the character that can damage the movie so easily can be really entertaining and memorable. <br /> <br /> But what about monsters and beasts? I hear that cry. Well, the lifestyle of the area where they live in the temple and their stunning but entertaining movements (trying to constantly avoid trying Tsau-shen again), Lord Black is quite surprisingly effective. With the arsenal of evil heads made and excellent work of wire. Most of today have never been completed. <br /> <br /> But the most obvious effect and creation is the killer of the tree's spirit. First of all, we encounter the "Evil Dead" style camera, while the victim delivers the throat of the throat, sending the deadly kiss that the victim makes. But later he shows all his crazy glory. They can grow tall and long through the woods after the prey, divide the trees, surround buildings and coils that people have a long, long before it rolls them together before throwing the tree trunk! Even openly split, to show your mouth full of mouth! It is a wonderful idea to not give up deep romantic masterpieces. But, nevertheless, a wonderful and unforgettable effect. <br /> <br /> So, all this adds to a classic example of Hong Kong movies. A genuine team effort has given us a real team effort. Spirits, inventions, actions, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, fantastic ideas, images, beautiful music, and most importantly, is a permanent charm. Between movie theaters.
