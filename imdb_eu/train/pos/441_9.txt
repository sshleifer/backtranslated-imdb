It's a great movie search for daily life's happiness. Pacing, camera work, emotions, musical scores and the charm of this image is essential. He is not totally loving or emotionally retreated. The only mistake that can be seen about this movie is not caught in a technically perfect film. Todd-AO, Technicolor and the sound of the most deserving format (an intimate 70s movie can be made.) The inhabitants would also lushly give their exquisite Italian effects, and even the most beautiful moments would be even better seen and heard. However, he still needs attention as a sweet little mobile movie. I can not see myself from the satellite look. The content of the characters, squeezing and suspicious transformation is a joy to always see and often recommend. <br /> <br /> The casting is perfect, the humor is perfect, the performance is more than amazing. It is a film about medium-sized films and people's choices. It is profound and thoughtful as it shakes the viewer sharply. Look seated and leave the effect. If you do not get it, you might not live enough or something else is wrong with you.
