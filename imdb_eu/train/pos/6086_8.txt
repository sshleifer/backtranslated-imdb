I saw this movie a year ago and I said it was totally fun. The true winner in my mind. He stressed a stupid comedy, but he had a plot of land. Much like a successful comedy, Elf. He had some serious moments in the darkness. When Stiller sparked Black's horse, a simple and ordinary moment laughed at him with his old rumors. You can really find it in the place, I am sure that many people would have done something that you would not want to know, that you should end your friendship. <br /> <br /> When I knew how much people liked this movie, I totally annoyed it. The absolutely wonderful movies like Napoleon Dynamite had more views than the people in the IMDb did. Take my advice and rent it. If you do not laugh at least once, I will compensate you for the rental rates. = D
