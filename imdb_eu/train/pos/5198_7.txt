What can I say about Mr Moore? He is a pioneer in the rage, he is the one in the field of filmmaking in Z, and here he has returned to the most famous character, Dolemite! Can they punch? This movie is a riot of humorous politically incorrect humor, kung-fu trippy, nudity, cheese, violence and other modern movies (or any movie, not really found) for a lot of whacked-roll humor. haha!). The routine that initially goes should not be missed! D2, however, is an entertaining way of wasting an hour. Dolemita: "He thinks he's bad and he has no class! I do not manually armed my manual badge * his ** bip!"
