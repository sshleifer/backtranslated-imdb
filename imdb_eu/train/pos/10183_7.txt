This is probably his best Karisma, in addition to Zubeidae. Nana Patekar also gives her the best, without even trying. Sometimes the story is very good, but at the end it seems dragging, especially when it comes to Shahrukh's image. They told me the story, the story and the story about what they were really doing, what it was. It could be better targeted and edited. The help case was very good, including the main Karima mother, even though it was a bright moment, although it was very good to watch. <br /> <br /> The sets were also good. I really liked the portrait of a Canadian family, but after arriving to India, it's real. <br /> <br /> Generally, I would give them thumbnails!
