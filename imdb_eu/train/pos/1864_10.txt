I saw Antwone Fisher in BRAVO. Film incredible and incredible young man. This movie is essential for overcoming childhood abuse and interruption for adults. Denzel Washington puts on him a young man who plays with a great theater and with Antwone Fisher. Kleenex alert - Feel good and tear. The most amazing time is the time when the mother is finally acquainted with her. And one of the bravest was when he was in the presence of his mother and his unbearable sister. I watched this movie in Bravo in 2008, and I've known recently. Certainly, the movie to add my DVD collection.
