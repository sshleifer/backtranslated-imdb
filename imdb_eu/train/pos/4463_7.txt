THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT has recently given me a vision to see many of the classic MGM music of the 1950s and '50s. AWEIGH ANCHORS is a movie that's smaller than AIDS. The songs are not good, and it's not the character's chemistry. But the movie loves classic favorites, such as Tchaikovsky. And the Hollywood Bowl scene, when Sinatra and Kelly go out of the woods, then the stairs go down, dozens of piano plays on the piano, the scene of the movie is the best, even the scene. Dancing with Kelly Jerry Mouse is more famous. Classical music enthusiasts will definitely identify the music they play for pianists. Sinatra, then, "He will fall in love so easily," before his epiphany against his love. The color is beautiful, Hollywood has a pretty mountain and the air is untouched (has Hollywood imagined you in the twenties, only mid-1940s?), And piano music is so huge. MGM definitely wanted to create lyrical moments.
