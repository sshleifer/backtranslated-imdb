Every time I see Nicole, I like it more. I love such a movie. You just have given a woman, but your heart breaks down. The first movie As I recall, Human Bondage was Kim Novak - a version of Laurence Harvey. The small cows about the correctness of the Russian-speaking Russian in this film are small, I am sure that I do not speak Russian or deceive anyone. It's fun to lose people. The Russians were not good enough. In the end, I have to send my hat to Ben Chaplin, as someone else has indicated, he sweats it with great dignity, and there is a definitive heat between him and Nicole. Let's think, so, that the boys are ENJOYED.
