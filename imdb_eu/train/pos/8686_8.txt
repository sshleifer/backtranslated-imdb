The second official episode of "Columbo" ("Murder by the Book") was later filmed. Robert Culp, who joins Peter Falk with a series of future fragmentary detectives, is a brilliant sophisticated private detective agency who does not wish to refuse his blackmail schemes when his wife's wife dies. Both stars fit well in this intelligent cat and mouse that is one of the best in the series.
