During the years I participated in film festivals, I have seen a lot of short films that have never been to theater distribution and will end up in the $ 3 bins of WalMart. There, I found the Yank Tanks DVD, elegant, but the hope is that it stays at the bottom of the rock. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, it's everything I could see in the cinema. New Yorker Films would return the title straight. It's good for the Americans to stretch a bit. The title of the movie will help US audiences to explore random chaos, much better. Cinema life and visa vary. <br /> <br /> Also, I found out unnoticed that the subtitles put prices in dollars. Come on! The euro is not difficult to imagine, so the public gringos make math. While watching a movie, especially in Paris, the viewer would not be affected by it: I recall seeing an American movie and the dollar returns to me for me. <br /> <br /> These actors are more and more looking to see more writers and directors.
