First of all, I do not understand why some anti-American films find out. Yes, they are directly accused of the United States, Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to a certain extent, Mira Nair. However, accusations are not na√Øve; Instead, they are based on real and documented, and all of the CIA's documents published by the author, for example, are confirmed. <br /> <br /> But when he returns to the same movie, the thing that most pleases me is the great mood we find there. Children are losing their respect for the people killed in this event; We find an unhappy couple who will change according to the tragedy of that day; We find ordinary people in the shadow of events on September 11 that have recovered feelings and react differently, with dignity or frustration; We find someone in the movie for a moment of true happiness. <br /> <br /> All these and others, as powerful as these or even more, make mistakes and support consistent. People watching the public around the world have seen how they reacted on September 11. Thus, we see a panorama much more complex than white and black, which can annoy people; But this is where the world lives, and there is no place for manicists ideology, whatever the president or priest say. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is shameful not to mention that it is not the US version of the movie. It's hardly because most Americans ask why the disaster happened, and the movie could give them some trace. This film clearly shows - in a way that people in this forum think differently, everything we do today will determine our future and that past mistakes will affect today.
