I love this movie as anyone else. Once again, I will try to explain its virtues to beginners, but for some time now I have mentioned some great dialogues, please remember, it's my tongue. Will Aussies and Poms understand everyone else? (A lyrical song of the title) "It can sink a beer, it can get a sting, in the final double gear of Bondi". > <br /> (another lyrical song) "All Pommies are wild, shaky or worse, and England is an e-hole in the universe." <br /> <br /> <br /> (during a television interview "Arty program": Mr. Mackenzie, what artist is most surprised by what you have been in England? (Barry's answer) Flaminen 'bull-artists! /> <br /> (when she was saying a naughty young girl): Mr. Mackenzie, do you think you're a horde of Australian aborigines? (Barry's answer) Abos? I have never seen Abo in my life. , hard work). <br /> <br /> This is just a tasty hilarious ridicule of Aussie Flick. You can get a copy of it, watch it and enjoy it.
