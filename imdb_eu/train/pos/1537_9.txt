The movie is played in a small Swedish town where everyone knows each other. Here Mia visits her parents for her father's birthday, since they are always a kind of tragedy. The question is what will be this year and you will be amazed ... It is a very composite movie, a story that is a perfect balance between humor and seriousness, rarely seen. You'll be happy, you're injured and, above all, everything. In the end you can not fall into love with Mia (if you are a boy (you are a major actor)) is a well-chosen actress, like many other actors and actors. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
