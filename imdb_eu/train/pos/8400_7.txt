In my library I got this movie. After getting to know the director at the Festival Festival, I was curious about "knowing" his work. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> The film knows new topics, love, infidelity, friendship, jealousy. Sometimes, it may be "talky", but it's never been completely sunk. I like to see a love story with the characters I like, and they like to see conscious decisions rather than falling into something that is just as important as love. The prolific film is quite different. Check it out. If you are lucky, your copy will come with a copy of mine. Good things
