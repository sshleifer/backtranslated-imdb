It is a perfect, memorable, intelligent and suspensible Henri Verneuil, a true French film genius. The territory is a parallel parallel to the JFK assassination, which occurs in a non-fiction country description. Movies, visuals and plots are faster. Shot with great precision, Henry Volnay is the one who takes control of a coup d'Ã©tat. In many ways, the film is very disturbing, the cold and analytical accuracy of the comments of the internal functioning of the modern state. Giroak and characters are completely unbelievable, and Verneuil does not give anything in the narrow line. On another level, the film is quite unknown 15 years ago in the film Oliver Stone, which was acclaimed in the movie "JFK", a film that is less than in many areas, and at least not credible ... <br /> It's a master's degree, It should be seen by any lover of the movie, it's better in its original French version.
