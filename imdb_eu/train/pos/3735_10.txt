A really moving story of a American recruitment camp where young men have been ready to fight for Vietnam. Human investigations always focused on warlike films, as they turned the personal and subjective opinions on the war into action-related warfare actions that were being investigated by human action and technical data. <br /> <br /> The film puts on a new spin on the old theme and moves away from conventional warfare, especially from a traditional anti-heroic standpoint. The film deals with the tragic nature of Bozz because he does not try to absorb the dehumanizing machine of the war and does not prevent him from controlling his destiny and does not hope to fight something he does not believe. sent by the sea, for him and his friends, and, ironically, to find his own reason for the end of the war. Perfect irony <br /> <br /> The performance is really amazing and documentary films make you feel completely in the film. Similarly, the film will offer thoughts to those who have encouraged traditional action war movies or hobbyists. Fortunately, they will raise the minds of some generations, afraid of being lucky to have escaped.
