Developing the cinematic eye-catcher and the love of good cinema, I saw Symbolically breath I saw Antwone Fisher. While I'm just a fan of Denzel Washington - both as his actor and his public attitude; I'm a fancier (I've had a lot of good films in two or more films). And I was wrong about them - after all, I'm not the actor. But this was not different - Denzel will spill and guide his career as a film that manages the most sensitive issues amongst men, child abuse. Direction debut, no less. And, according to the film, he stated that he would present the victory of man. I did not want to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I was not there. <br /> <br /> The audience is a movie full of audiences, and is given to inexperienced people. The viewer was a short, but true, childhood hell of childhood but the life of a young man who lived in childhood, but he won all this. He made this movie - and in the theater he has proven a dry eye on any color. We know about the issues in this film to find out the truth. A talented filmmaker is required because the story is considered conflicting. And if you can draw more audiences and respond to emotional emotion, the filmmaker has done his job. In any movie Black, white, purple or stitched. This makes good cinema. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and, above all, Antwone Fisher - you've really won.
