Over the years, I have seen the "80's rocker horror" incredibly fun at gems like "Slumber Party Massacre 2" from dumps like "Terror on Tour". Somehow, I got rid of this, because it's strange, it's probably the best one. Well, I've finally caught it and it's easy to get this huge insight (but almost always!). The Earth ("Black Roses" was pretty much lifted) is about a message message by Eddie. All this offered to her a fun mix in her school music. He loves the metal of the 80s, especially the idol Sammi Curr (played by Tony Fields himself). After Sammi's death, Eddie's favorite radio DJ gave Sammi the latest recording. Regardless of the Eddie record, he realizes that he is a little bit harder, and bad things start for those who hurt him. Does Sammi have music? "Trick or Treat" is well done. The special effects are wonderful, even though they are laser beams of the 80s. I grew up in the 80's and I was not a fan of heavy metal, I remember recording the record backwards, as well as listening to the worship of Satan. Haha! I remember that my older siblings and neighbors also worshiped KISS and Ozzy in Satan, so it's so funny to see both cameos as an undamaged radio DJ and an anti-rock priest. This movie was only seen by the baby! While it is believed that the movie is enjoying fun in the 1980s, it seems that the spectator does not know why Sammi Curr is back in the dead, creating ruin and killing anyone on his way. It's the weakest part of the movie, but if you can not forget it, it's fun.
