It's a story of Shin-ae, which moves to Seoul Milyang, starting with his young son with his young son, after his unexpected death. Her husband was born here, and she opens a piano school, but she also intends to take care of the death of insured mortgages. It was probably about a movie that was around the cinema, it would fall to a man and be happy with his son at home. But that's not Hollywood. His son kidnaps and dies, because he apparently has the liquidation powers. The pain process, the attempts to progress, try to cleanse the conscience of guilt, all do well, and the actress is excellent. The only note is that the film is boring. You need to know that. Shin wants to cross her pain and find the measure of happiness. Again, this is not Hollywood, Korea, and Korean cinema, especially drama, do not have punches. Life happens to you Great play, but sometimes to watch a hard movie. If you have a stay, you will be rewarded. Do that
