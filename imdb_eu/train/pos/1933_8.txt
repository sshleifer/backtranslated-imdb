This Indie film explores the life of a person who makes a bath class for adults in Connecticut. The plot is pretty thin. The character that drives the movie is the characters that play brilliantly unknown actors. Brewers expanded with Brewster as a high school teacher as civil problems and Mark Weixler marking stripper as a casino. Both actors perform natural performances and work well together. Schechter writers and Setton director have a great debut film. The latter moves the narrative fast. The title and poster of the film suggest something rough, but it is a wonderful dramatic comedy.
