Kells is one of the most curious animated films I have ever seen. Before seeing this movie, I am sure that I could not make any money to charge and win in this category, but I found a serious opponent of Kells. <br /> <br /> The Kellsen Secret tells the story of a young orphaned Brendan, whose uncle, who lives with Kell's abbot. Abbot is a loving guardian, but perhaps he is too harsh and much more distressing than protecting the fortress from the fortress around the city, rather than feeding the child's imagination. Although Aidan looks like a mythical monk (though she looks like Willie Nelson), the boy will appear under his wing, and Brendan travels through the woods and meets the nymph of a lovely Aisling forest and likes and saves his life. more than once). With the help of Aisling, he tries to save the town and helps Aidan Ana Aiden to complete a mystical book in the dark in the legend. <br /> <br /> See the full review of my Kells secret. : http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of-kells.html
