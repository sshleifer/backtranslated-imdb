Does George Ede want to know about Father's "love and time" Father Fitzpatrick moves? Did they go on Sunday when Charlie and Annna were talking? Otherwise, I will have to rent a movie. It was a great movie. I love serendipity too! A great love story for the soul! <br /> <br /> I met my true love (my friend's soul) and although I had hoped to know it least I expected it, I was not prepared to be ready for this emotional relationship. <br /> <br /> However, we were married, I did not give enough to be as mature as I thought. I was glad and I took the love I gave, and it lasted for 7 years. <br /> <br /> In the end, he resigned, but we are still hurt and angry and we wait for credibility. I had very hard lessons and now we have 3 years. <br /> <br /> This film has brought a lot, because I'm still waiting for me to join my true love. I appreciate NOW for a different feeling for me and Father Fitzpatrick's quote told me the truth. <br /> <br /> I know when he will heal when he believes again, we will get married. <br /> <br /> DO NOT ENJOY AND ENTER APPROACH! IT WOULD LIKE MY LIFE OF MY LIFE. <br /> <br /> The great music in this movie is SINGLE! This movie is DEEP and spiritually exemplary. TRUE LOVE is worth awaiting, if applicable, no matter what, PLEASE! Nothing is impossible, even if it happens the second time! Thank you!
