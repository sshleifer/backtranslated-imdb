I recently read the novel "Mother's Night". I have already had a dvd for a while, and I see it again and again. I see the movie I have owned and watched and I was questioned and questioned by Mother Night. I am not surprised at Vonnegut, but I am shocked by the text's display translation. <br /> <br /> Do not rent or watch the movie on VHS, it must be done on DVD, and must be accompanied by the director's movie commentator. I thought it was a simple story to see, but its a substance and a complex conversation, and I think it worked well, I think the audience will be surprised. <br /> <br /> The gaps in the movie are little text, and they do not take much less, the movie can also be a book, and it's the best adaptation ever seen. I would recommend that you only read the book and the movie together to make it very sad. <br /> <br /> You will change.
