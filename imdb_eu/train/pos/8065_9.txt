This movie caused Irish problems in the 20s and then the sad Civil War, after opening the treaty, because I saw the signing of the treaty. In any case, he eventually turned the tears in my eyes suddenly. <br /> <br /> Today Victor McLagen is not so famous, and should remember better. In this movie, I think he plays himself without his original talent and brains. For example, McLaglen's challenging friends against the public reminded him in the first years when he was a world class boxer. John Ford is in charge of it; The Curious Review section shows how McLaglin tried to make a horrible scene for the test. This director can also bring a lot to his actors, even without such a trick. In most cases, however, McLaglen has a strong control, especially his character, almost entirely blot (which can be more believable by an actor), and Gypo Nolan also plays only the depth and emotional power. He later saw McLagen in his career in "The Quiet Man". I like the contrast between IRA's male role and the performance controlled by the "I Hummm's House" as the IRA. <br /> <br /> "The Quiet Man", of course, is the squire of the McLaglen town with the local IRA. Victor McLagen was a great and courageous, in the old sense of the word, but was also a good actor, who was able to expect a lot of performance and good nuances that we would not expect from today's man. It's a sad comment on our hopes and prejudices. <br /> <br /> As usual, Ford decorates a lot of movies. All the characters are excellent (the commander mostly detects the American accent) - NOTE: Before there are disasters! - Gypo wanted to draw a short straw and he was ordered to kill a man, but to let him out of this way, Gypo draws on a conflict, and most of it is humanity. When Gypo was taken up in Mary's room clearly. <br /> <br /> John Ford really shows his genius here, taking on an enormous and unexpected result, and instead creates an unexpected and extremely satisfying ending not only for Gypo and other characters, But the poor Ireland was tortured at that time.
