According to what Hartley's public work has seen and continued, I think much more than what he was talking about in fiction for years for much darker philosophical games. <br /> <br /> Although it's entertaining, Fay Grim is another. Hit the Henry Fool's thinking line, which reflects the quality of the movie's own movie object. In Henry Fool, objects are memory ... In Fay Grim, they are the object's encrypted memories - they've been screwed, forged and trans-mutated in something so dark that it can not make sense - that is, the script process. write and film in modern times - where most of the most successful films are not just a mixture of the past. That is, in the philosophical sense, all about Fay Grim. Objects, perhaps, this blow is topical and sad (at the sites open at the publisher's office). <br /> <br /> That said, many of the best films are lost, it does not understand the importance of Henry's and the memory they are looking for. Henry is a thorny demon, he first visits modern Simon Faust, etc. Understanding the tragic nature of Henry, Fay Grim's argument and the quality of the story is lost. <br /> <br /> And there is not enough 'detail' expressed through verbal delays - it is impossible to compare the "feeling" of Henry Fool's character on Henry Fool's plot, so I think someone in this movie gets cold 10 minutes It's about that. For the built conversation, 'so what is the answer' and then that's it. <br /> <br /> However, Henry Fool was also my favorite favorite until I noticed Hartley's favorite movie - putrid and infested - because Henry Fool is indeed. The statements were bad ... not only rude or dirty, but rather broken. Henry can not be wrong - and maybe this is more beautiful, as in the works of Gollum Tolkien, Henry is wonderful. <br /> <br /> That Fay did not meet Fay. Grim, even if Henry had a great conversation. What happens is that the whole movie has been built as an encryption - another plot ends with something else, it's still another adaptation to add bad luck to Henry's grandfather. The tour is interesting, but can not be digested without seeing the first movie. Perhaps the first movie to show more about Henry would be better than describing the basic story of the first movie - although this plot was not the first movie, perhaps a temporary observer. <br /> <br /> Encoding part? It's hard to say ... even though they are a bit desperate to play badly. Cursi
