This video was held in Birmingham Southern College in 1975, along with Red Balloon. Both films are similar to the quality of dreams. A large part of the movie brings the fish to a swim in their bowl, their owner, a little boy, while away from school. A cat begins to fish and into the room of his ship and begins to retain his "prey". The boys start to go home from school, and the audience asks himself if he will be able to save his fish partner at the same time. Fish is influenced by the presence of the cat and will eventually leave the ship! The cat moves quickly to the fish, gently stops it with his paws and returns to his boat. The boy happily returns to his fish, not the most wise. <br /> <br /> The endless one is surprising both ironically and in technical complexity. It's hard to imagine how the director can perform the technical function in 1959 - it seems like a trick in 2003. <br /> <br /> If you can find it, see it - you will not be disappointed! And if you find *, know me to get a copy.
