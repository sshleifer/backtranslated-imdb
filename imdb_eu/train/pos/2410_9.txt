This movie is one of the most provocative films I've ever seen. He does not try to tell the whole story, but represent the interpretation of the last day of Jesus Christ. The interpretation of Jewish tradition and modern writing is fundamentally ardent, playful and serious. Judas is much more ordinary than some other portraits, not sometimes, we imagine the dark and wicked evil, but the innocent innocent man, in his zeal, very wrong. Chris Saranden Jesus is playful and serious, faithful and committed, while he is very god. The last conversation is thoughtful and serves as a small talk that powerful two men can do. I'd like to see this movie again and I recommend it to others.
