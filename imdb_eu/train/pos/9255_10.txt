If you want a fun load of subtle humor, you'll like this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why anyone would not enjoy it. Take what is: Dennis Hopper's vehicle to shuffle and laugh at you. It's not Shakespeare, but it's fine. Ericka Elenia is absolutely beautiful and it has: that is, it's better than any episode of Baywatch, and humor. It's nice to have plenty of opportunities to find out about it. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger adjusts the role of "real army" and William McNamara works as a driving force. <br /> <br /> Hopper throws a "Sundae on this of the Cherry" back pocket, and you've got a movie that keeps my attention and laughing. I used it when I bought it. <br /> <br /> Brain-sweets.
