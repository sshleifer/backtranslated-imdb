I'm glad I'm glad I'm at the start with the Bourne trilogy. Please, please do not ruin it for a year or a preview. Leave alone As Matt Damon is talented and versatile ... it seems that Jason Bourne would like to play. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the first two Bourne films. You're not disappointed with a third installment. It works well and adds a bit more. I was very pleased to learn how to get all the information "Identity" and "supremacy" through "Ultimatum". In the end, they will paint the whole picture of Jason Bourne's disturbed past. The sequence of actions is a fast pace and keeps you on the edge of the seat. The battle between Bourne and the murderers is always fun to watch. I have been a caress in the film's CIA agents and how the CIA collects its Intel and this movie is included in the street, making it even more exciting for me. <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch The Bourne without watching the previous 2 periods of Ultimatum, you will still enjoy the movie, but I would still recommend watching it first. This will make Jason Bourne fully understandable and become part of your world. This allows the movie to be appreciated and enjoyed even more. I'm not sure which is the best of the first 2, but I personally think that 'Ultimatum' is likely to be rich when comparing the trilogy.
