Cast is really pleasing and enjoyable, in the face of the love-males-like love of Hollywood comedy love with the love of love of Hollywood love. <br /> I usually do not go for those types of films and that difficult story, but this was refreshing, fun to watch and charm. <br /> <br /> Each and every Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off well and make a very beautiful pair. Assistance is remarkable: Felix Bressart is always pleasing to the evil Joseph Schildkraut. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also considers one of the most interesting characters I've seen on his career. He takes the movie and makes it a completely different mood for a moment when something is dramatic. This "blow" movie is another reason that rises above its kind. <br /> <br /> Again, when a movie has a good mix of categories, it's usually successful. This is an excellent example. In this movie, it is love, comedy and theater and it is well done. I will take over the re-use of the day "You got the level." No comparison.
