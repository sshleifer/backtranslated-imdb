Following a lesser experience in Finland for a week, this film shows the very specific nature of Finnish society. Particularly, the phenomenon of a serious problem with young people is very well known to me, just as I saw when I was in Finland. People's relationships and problems, the fragility of the husband's organization, drinking culture, unemployment and rising money problem are all very well placed without any subjectivity or abuse. <br /> <br /> There are some unforgettable films to unite and unite some points, but the great images are very rewarding. Each story is not exciting or deep, but, as we have already said, the great image does not fail to give a feeling of "real life" and captivate the spectator. I think in a quiet moment: what happens in the lives of those people in the street? Well, that is happening. Such films are good for feeding your imaginary power. Surely this movie would suppose that it could be applied to many countries in life, but particularly in Finland, such as, and quite damned. <br /> <br /> A comment on a performance: I'm a Finnish fan of cinema, I've never seen one of these actors in any other movie, but I was acting next to it next to it. It may not be a masterpiece, but the team will try very well. I'll look at the future comments of the director and the cast. 7.5 / 10
