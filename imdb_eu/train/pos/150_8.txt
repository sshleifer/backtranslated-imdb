The latest film by Spanish director Agusti Villaronga analyzes a study conducted by children living in violence and isolation in the children's community, in troubled young children who need psychic instruments to face their hidden psychopaths. Whether these tools continue to be fanatic religious levels, looking after others, or simply engaging in a Macho image as a male prostitute, Villaronga is successfully examining how Francoism affects three teenagers in Spain. A disturbing double death test or his friends are teenagers before and after, they bury their wives with their classmates, once again, the corpses rejoin among those who suffer tuberculosis in the hospital again. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. An element different from the two directors is a supernatural supernatural, claustrophobic realism and realism that is opposed to the use of surrealism Villaronga Almodovar, although it has two similar styles. <br /> <br /> It's a confusing piece. A young psyche and disturbing violence and sex scenes. I recommend watching this movie because it has elements that will keep the audience with the viewer for a long time.
