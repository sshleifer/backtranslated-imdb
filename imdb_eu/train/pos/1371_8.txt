This movie is a beautiful and indescribable mixture of the "kid club" rave scene with the world of performing arts, music and performing arts in New York. This is "Torch Song Trilogy" as a perky-post-teen girl. "This girl" for the times of our disagreement for millennia. <br /> <br /> The conversation is fast and fun, and Parker Posey's client deserves to say goodbye to the "wave" stadium, if at least not an academy award. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film is based on a very elegant Miss Posey platform that fits well. Like many of his plays, it may not be very deep, he is often self-referential and, well, posey ... but he works everything. It is a talented comedy, an incredible animator, and entertained by this film, like the leopard faux look on its shoulders, and never let it fall to the ground. who is not the closet of a friend to rob designer clothes, or with someone else's friends. In a deeper level, that is, the story of a girl and her friends, who do not look after every word of the word, among other things; and the process of learning necessary to live vigilant. <br /> <br /> The script is beautifully crafted, the spirit, and the only performance that condemns perspiration is the aunt; His offer more a hue, he would deepen the relationship between them ... but ... yes ... this comedy is. The boyfriend that falls is a surprisingly profound role in the role of an amazing role and world view. We should be glad ... Mary is it? or is it coming out? <br /> <br /> I value this 8 because it is not a great moment in cinema history, it's not classical, and it's not a great art (they all become richer when inspecting again). In "Desperately Seeking Susan", something like something about the time is true, but it's not important at the time. However, it requires an entertaining movie, and it's worth it to watch only a few clothes!
