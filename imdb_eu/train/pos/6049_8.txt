Freebird Road Trip is the perfect wedding of comedy, binder, stoner and the most brilliant British film stars. <br /> <br /> This film has been abandoned by other films in this genre. Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have a great chemistry and they make the characters very fond and realistic. The main story is the adventures and mishaps that take place on the road trip to London and Wales. This small movie also has a good heart: it's not just for bicycles for lovers, because the relationship between characters includes dreams and dreams, such as Gary Stretch's Fred's longing for family life. There is also a great cinematography: a love letter for Wales, as well as the typical London streets and the detection of typical Greek pubs. Towns of the towns of the towns of the towns of the Greek cities. funny story - I would freebird to heartily recommend it!
