If you like science fiction, monsters and ancient legends, you love this movie! <br /> <br /> The special effects I have seen far from Juarassic Park have been on the big screen for years. Although the play may be less than desirable, the story and effects were offset correctly. <br /> <br /> Now I've seen the screen TV on the second screen of the 42 cm screen. <br /> <br /> If you like action, reputable images and myth and admiration ... you have to watch the movie!
