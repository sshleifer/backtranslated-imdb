49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller / horror, 1988) Anna's childhood bed (Charlotte Burke) is 11 years old and has only one draw for her company. His health gradually worsens, as some mysteries "outsiders" attack him. In each of these episodes, the house destroys the area in the desert, only by a sickly ill illness called Marc (Elliot Spires). When a dark and unknown risk threatens his idyllic "paperhouse", Marc's life is compromised. His life is also endangered because his dreams reflect his health status. <br /> <br /> Criticism: Bernard Rose's director is the first British feature-length film. With Catherine Storr taking her from a fabulous "Marianne Dreams", she leaves many other fantasy-related works. Whenever a story is dreams and nightmares, it is difficult to confuse fable and reality to work in cinema. Rose director captures the fantasy world with a surprising party and finds the darkness that tries to usurp. <br /> <br /> Strongly attacked by Phillip Glass, Rose allows her to use music in a sensible way. moments Most of the emotions are unfortunate, as regards the fear of the audience in terms of knowing what the next party does not bring. It also honors and never lets fall or stop the next sequence of the event. Likewise, marking the placing of objects in the frame (as in P.O.V.shots images) gives an added dimension to cinematography, because it lacks it. In Europe you will only find the appearance of the pains here: here the house, the land, the coastal towns, the watchtower, etc. <br /> <br /> Rose continued with "Candyman" (1992), a real horror of 'thought' and a true horror of true faith in horror.
