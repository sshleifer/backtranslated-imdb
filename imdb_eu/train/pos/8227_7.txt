Paul Winfield is an interesting thriller as a detective in a murder case. Paul Winfield was the actor, so much so that he was able to make all his tasks easily, it was difficult to say that he was also a man. Perhaps the youngest audience in the voice / narrator "City Confidential" is known, Winfield finished his career with this film; But as always, Winfield shines brightly. Pleasant viewing. <br /> <br /> Erika Eliniak is well, Erika Eliniak, she looks nice but she likes her in the acting department. Reasonable, though, is one of his greatest efforts. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: An invisible thriller missing from any fan of Paul Winfield. A decent phone to send Paul Winfield to heavenly celluloid. What is the actress It will be lost.
