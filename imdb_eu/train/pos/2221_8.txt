One night, I stopped at Bravo Street at the satellite station. To begin, I thought I was curious to see. I was not entirely honest. The main character is beautiful and shows his body well. The executioner was wasting himself, but apparently he did not see the whole movie! My true hardness is only the film given to the contributors, especially the actors of Melnik. Christ is his evil! Drowning and misguided efforts can be made by his co-patron Wanda, but fortunately the viewer and Hank are spilling and wasting to the finish line. The music used is quite tense and creates an ideal setting for executions. This movie is very good for Jennifer Thomas, only beautiful and very sexy talents
