I rented Zero Day last week from the video store. I did not hear the movie and I had reservations about it. When I looked at the box, I knew that the film was an indie movie, so quality would be less than the main movie. <br /> <br /> After seeing Zero Day, I tell you from the start I started again. The film clearly followed the basic scheme of Columbine High School in April 1999, but I believe that two main actors have been credible. The first time I saw this movie I was not quite sure that I was watching the real ribbons that Columbin shot out of. At the back of my mind, I knew what I was seeing was not real, but at the same time the performance was so compelling that you should shake yourself. <br /> <br /> Is the movie alarming? Of course! Do you see things that will help you question the merit of the movie? Probably. Most people find it alarming to me that they think that the feelings of the two main characters, Calvin and Andre (Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck) really will be. Why is the problem for some people? Calvin and Andre are planning a massacre in their institutes. I know myself, I felt sad and sad feeling with Andre and Calvin. I had empathy for them, because life was so horrible. The cracks fell so deeply that they could go down the road if only the people around them were aware of it. <br /> <br /> Zero day is a horrible movie. Most of all give you a close and personal look at the events that you will see more than once. It allows you to think about the implicated life. And it's hard for people to get to this point. One week after watching this movie, I still think about it. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Zero Day, those are aware of the following: The movie is independent, with no budget and a movie. It is filmed on both cameras. The stuff of the movie is disturbing. This is not the main Hollywood and happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you ignore this, Zero Day is a movie that will continue with you, and maybe we'll be opening your eyes a bit.
