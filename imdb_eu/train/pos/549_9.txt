This year is 1896. Jeff Webster (James Stewart) does not like the people. He has only one friend and Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), a loving man. They are driving a trip with them. the key to wealth Skagway creates problems when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes cattle. Now, he only needs to get Jeff and he must push Dawson to the US border. Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet). Both men enter into a gold business. The fourth collaboration by Anthony Farren and James Stewart is the western side of The Far Country (1954). This is a great play. Walt Brennan has made Stewart a great success with Stewart. He is Roman Magnificent and is very good at Corinne Calvet. Jay C. Flippen's Dawson Marshal is very good at Rube Morris. Big Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman can be seen in smaller roles. It's really wonderful to see how Jimmy Stewart overcomes his problems on his way. There's just man and his rifle. But he was vulnerable too.
