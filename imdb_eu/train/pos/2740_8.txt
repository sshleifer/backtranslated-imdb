Black and white nightmare, and many of them murdered in the 1950s, emphasizes this real life in Kansas, which destroyed the whole family by two men. <br /> <br /> The story was written by Truman Capote, so you will get a liberal, unpolluted message of death at the end of the film, that is to say, knowing facts in this case is wonderful. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson have two obsolete views of life that have lost two losing gates and a family that is unnecessary killer. <br /> <br /> Although it's an annoying ending, it's a terrific story from the start and cinema is more fascinating. The famous photographer Conrad Hall did a great job. I want to be made in black and white today. Watch on DVD <br /> <br /> <br /> Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and double supports are here. The third show of this film came in early April 2005, when Blake, in real life, was innocent in the murder trial of his wife. Blake and this movie can not be looked at in a different way.
