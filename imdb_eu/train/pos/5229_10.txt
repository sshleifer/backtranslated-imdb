This movie has gotten awful scores on all those who voted here, but I'm here, like movies like Dude Wheres my Car and Dumb and Dumber. If you have access to movies like Kane and Casablanca id in other areas. However, I still love this movie and everything about it, even if it's a "kiddy", that I have been one of my few freinds and only a few years of watching and watching over the years. ALL BODY This movie should be numbered AFIs because their classes are so dirty. The only problem with this movie is that it could be seen, a television channel that does not exist in a channel. So I do not know how to get this movie, that is, to buy a DVD, but I can not find it anywhere. Since I was first recorded, if you want, you can come and sleep. This movie is rocked and this is basically everything you need to know.
