I really liked the movie. The animation was done well and the love was very nice. The likes of Bryan Adams really liked me and Hans Zimmer scores were great. Many people do not realize how linked to the hearts of Darkness / Apocalypse Now (what happens when "civilization" invades someone's home, what does "civilization" mean?). The initial landscape and music were very confusing. Once upon a time it was a lovely movie for America.
