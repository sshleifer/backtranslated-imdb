I like it with the movies I see. I heard Moon Child completely telling. For some time I've been an entree for L'Arc En Ciel and has recently been a fan of Gackt and Mizer. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the movie was released again and I did not receive it. second thinking <br /> <br /> Being as critical as cinema, I admit, sometimes scenes of action may be unforgiving ... but they mean too much, as suggested by another user. The guy before the storm, cited by Gary Oldman Leon ... without getting into the spoiler, the film puts me very hard, because the limits of friendship are unlimited, and as usual, true friendship is loyal to marriage and death. <br /> <br /> Hyde and Gackt give some performances on why they can show the lyrics of their songs so they can show off their passion for music on the big screen and in the process. Creates a generic film that will fit into one's own age and create an emotional response. <br /> <br /> Looking at the movie For the first time, I'm sure there will be a huge rotation in my rotation. If you want to get this message ready to help you read, I would like you to get the movie out of today's Hollywood movie ... this is totally straightened out using classic Yakuza movie elements and how you can go wrong with the kameo Ryo Ishibashi Takashi Miiki's "Hearing" and "Suicide Club" fame <br /> <br /> Men ... I can not say enough about this movie, but I'll stay here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
