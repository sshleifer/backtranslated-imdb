For anyone who wants to see a Soviet view of modern Russian history, this monumental film is a treasure. The story begins at the end of the century (1900) when the old photographs become the sepia colors of these sharp colors, which turns black and white in the middle of the century, and the story of everlasting color comes to modern times (that is, in the 1960s). /> <br /> The story goes to a boy from a remote Siberian town, an anarchist's beliefs and arrests in the era of cigar. Later, he joined the Bolsheviks after the revolution and led the Soviet communism to his own country. His son, for his beauty, is fighting for the Germans in World War II. When returning to the village, the oil industry begins and we respond to Soviet economic idealism. <br /> <br /> It's a long and slow film, but it's totally logical and well done. It can be seen in three parts.
