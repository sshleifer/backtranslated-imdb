During the time of magic, the barbarians and demons have Nekhron and his queen's mother, devilish tyrant called Juliane, who live in ice and King Jerol wants to conquer the fire district, but when her beautiful daughter, Teegra, has been kidnapped. Nekhron's goon, a warrior named Larn needs protection and Nekhron needs to defeat the world and the kingdom with the help of a caller called Darkwolf. <br /> <br /> An excellent epic fantasy and fantastic fantasy. It combines live actors and rotogravure with Ralph Bakshi's second best movie "American Pop" and "Heavy Traffic" with the third and fourth "Wizards". Without a doubt, it's better than "Cool World" or "Lord of the Rings", the artwork has been designed by the famous artist Frank Farzetta, and the animation has good colors and there is also a hottie for boys. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for fans of fantasy and entertainment everywhere, about the new Blue Underground's 2-Disc Limited Edition DVD. <br /> <br /> It is also recommended: "The Cauldron Black", "The Crystal Dark", "Conan The Barbarian".
