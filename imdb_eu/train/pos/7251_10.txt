I only saw this film about 25 years ago and I have always said that I have never seen the best movie ever. I did not think about the conversation, and I only thought about the conversation, the movie seemed to be brilliant and I breathed, although I did not sound. I'd highly recommend this movie, I'd be available at the DVD.
