Jan Svankmajer's film discovery opened my eyes to a complete tradition of Czech animation, which was a pioneer Jir√≠ Trnka. Ruka is one of the best and best animated films ever seen. <br /> <br /> A potter will wake up and his plant melts water. Then he started to bathe. However, the hand that turns the pot is horrible, and a potter demands the statue of himself. He has thrown his hand, but he will soon return and detain him in the cage for a stone sculpted by his hand. It begins around this, drifting out of exhaustion, but eventually completing this task. <br /> <br /> In a wonderful sequence of metacinemas, the potters use a candle to burn their stunning puppet chains. he fled home. He closes himself and his beloved plant dies suddenly when his head falls. <br /> <br /> This film does not conceal the mere animation, unlike modern cinema to be realistic. ?). Hand, for example, is someone's hand in the bracelet. Everything else is clay. The chains are visible and part of the story, leading to the Strings movie. The atmosphere is horrible: the hand of this pottor has managed to attack him more than fearful fear. <br /> <br /> The film is obvious, but it does not prevent manipulators completely by their simplicity. It is a matter of artistic freedom and tyranny, which can not win the heart and the mind of many rights as natural freedom.
