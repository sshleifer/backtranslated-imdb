This is a very strange movie and probably is the most popular in Shirley Temple, since it is not in any of its collections. For this reason, he has no happy ending, unlike all his films. musical, although it's a song called 'The world owes its alive' to its belt. The movie was made in 1934 and was originally white and black, with versions of colors and VHS, I said they did. The beautiful work looks like a realistic color, as Laurel And Hardy's coloring film would have been terrifying. The film has a good age and the story is not in any way, no one tried to Make a remake. Sometimes, there is little film with Gary Cooper and some scenes with Carole Lombard, which sometimes require fifteen minutes to say what they say in five minutes. Do not worry about the movie, because it's good times, especially {Jerry} Ga ry Cooper steals the collar and hides it in Shirley's teddy bears. The tensions are slowing down and slowing down their actions. At the same time, her daughter is listening to another room. It's very well-directed. Gary and Caroles's edgy Explicit facial expressions are very good. All this, at the beginning of the 30s, is a good movie, admitted for its age.
