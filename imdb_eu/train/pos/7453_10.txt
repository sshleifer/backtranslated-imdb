James Bond has always been a fanatic! I have seen almost all the films except Die Another Day, and the World is not enough. Graphics for all or none are amazing! Voices talents ......... WOW! PIERCE BROSNAN LOVE! In the end, it's a video game Bond! BONDO DA! I enjoyed the previous Bond games: Goldeneye, The World Is Not Enough, Agent Under Fire and Nightfire. This is definitely the best! Finally, Mr. Brosnan, (could I call Mr. Brosnan as a sign of respect? Yes, I can!) It was an exciting phenomenon to hear in a video game ... LONG! Duh! I have played with Robin Williams, and he told me they do a great group. Pierce Brosnan is funny, it's a pretty bad thing (I mean in a bad way in a good way), and it's just one of those actors who would like to ride and gather arms around and hug, saying: "Pierce Brosnan, thank you for being James Bond," " If it was not for you, I would not know James Bond. " It's an excellent actress! I am a fan of Willem Dafoe, although I have seen in both films. Nikolai Diavalo's role was great. (Did I write the name of the character correctly?) LOL !!!! It works a lot with the accent. Sometimes I can not hear an accent. I have seen Willem, I mean, Mr. Dafoe, to play in two films: find Nemo and Spider-Man my favorite actress: KIRSTEN DUNST! ROCKS! However, never be surprised. And Richard Kiel, wow, definitely had the nailed part of Jaw's. I've watched the movie and it's wonderful! Actually, my grandparents met Mr Kiel and they told me when I was jealous. Kirsten Dunst, however, will find my Celebritie list. John Cleese was horrible. I've never seen anybody better than just play better, and creating a gadget Q! Mr. Cleese was ridiculous! I've seen work with Pierce Brosnan in Goldeneye and Tommorow Never Dies. It's wonderful! John Cleeser's latest project is Shrek 2, featuring Mike Myer, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrew and Eddie Murphy. (It's put on the Shrek 2 theater!) TASTE 007! Yes, yes, and Q has always said: "Grow 007!"
