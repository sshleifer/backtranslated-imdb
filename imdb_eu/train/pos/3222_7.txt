The first two sequels of this film created two conflicts: the thematic conflict between Todd's soldier and his humanity, and the physical conflict between Todd and the replacement of bio-engineers. Both sequences are very enthusiastic in different ways. <br /> <br /> The script of the people is somewhat disturbed by the fact that the first of these arches is centered around the middle of the film, which means that the second semester is slightly more than a simple little action. <br /> <br /> However, the authors have a lot to say that those responsible for creating a heart and even a bit of soul, and above all with Kurt Russell, say little. <br /> <br /> It's not an excellent movie, but it's worth seeing.
