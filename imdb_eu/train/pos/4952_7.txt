At Paramount 1, the Toronto International Film Festival was reviewed on the second day of September 12, 2006. The film premiered for the first time in the world at the Elgin Theater in the VISA Screening Hall. <br /> <br /> At the bottom of the plot, Morgan Freeman plays down the downhill slope of his career and a popular actor. The roles that may be under him, but still with positive attitude, knowing that he needs to pay his rent. It is a long downward slope that indicates that the front bins on DVD are for old roles. a local production assistant returns Freeman to the local community market, as a supermarket manager. It describes how real life markets the "10 lesser items", which is in charge of iron and is led by a line of boxes that Paz Vega plays. Freeman's tour ever returns and Vega needs help preparing a conversation. In fact, circumstances make the way to the whole country, to take Freeman home and get a job that Vega will carry on his mobile career. <br /> <br /> While the movie was nice, it was still a sketch or a work. Two musical sequences were extended (along with One Vega and Freeman, they read other cars, that is, literally playing as a video clip from Paul Simon), and only 80 films had a long time. <br /> <br /> Well, Morgan Freeman, who likes to be very much like it's the same, would be very little. It was surely a fun thing and also the enjoyment of Paz Vega, but there was not enough full cinema. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman stopped me when I stopped the car. He asked for instructions and Paz Vega never said that he was doing it. Who has heard a woman who wants to ask for a direction and ask her to be a wife? It's the opposite of the real world. <br /> <br /> Make sure you get out of credit. With a sales outlet from Target Store, Morgan Freeman's just how ridiculous he is selling sales, he's just ridiculed! Freeman's driver emphasizes that at the beginning of Freeman's "Book of Tape" voice, it was quite fun. screening Silberling replied to some questions that the script had not been written specifically for Morgan Freeman, and that Freeman's final role was not changed at all. Both Silberling and Freeman write into a role and how they are supposed to feel like being born.
