More than ten years ago I first saw the premiere. I saw it again today and it still has a great effect on me. She Fought Alone, Caitlin (similar to Tiffani Thiessen) is a girl who is raped by Jace (directed by David Lipper). Caitlin is in a popular high school bass player, but raped when he was raped, directed by Etan (played by Brian Austin Green). <br /> <br /> Caitlin explains the fight against a whole city. , allows the athletes to gain access to the social environment, enabling them to escape with what they want. <br /> <br /> Thiessen and Green are the ones who play, and there is a real chemistry between them. throughout the movie. All the actors in this film, inspired by real events, made a great job. She catches the essence of She Fought Alone at school (at least in 1995) and self esteem and reputation. Recommended. 10/10
