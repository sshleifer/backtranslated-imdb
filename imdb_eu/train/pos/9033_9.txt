I saw this movie without any knowledge and found a thematic similar to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on a confused relationship with father / son. In both films, the son does not want his father to dream of pains and better life outside his home. The two children move away from their classmates and they both teach them a giant female model. <br /> <br /> The main difference between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and moving film. Laura Dern has played a moving role and Chris Cooper is the father of condolences in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subordinate direction, different from different film directors like Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
