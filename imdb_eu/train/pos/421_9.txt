In the box office of "The Crusades", Cecil B. DeMille did not stop making films about American history. The films for the next thirteen years were about World War II history of Jean Lafitte (Dr. Wassell). The first production movie, with Gary Cooper Wild Bill Hickok, with Jean Arthur Calamity Jane. James Ellison was a Buffalo Bill, John Miljan (not an ordinary criminal) was general George A. Custer, and was an Indian who fought Anthony Quinn Little Big Horn. The evil ones led Charles Bickford (soldier to the Indians) and led Porter Hall to Jack McCall (who was killed by Wild Bill Hickok). <br /> <br /> Essentially, the film takes on a US history after the Civil War. . Lincoln initially shows what the next step that Lee has given him. Lincoln explains the need to secure Lincoln west (later this point). He then announced that he must go to the theater. Abe had to be very busy with Abe. "In Virginia City," he pardoned Errol Flynn at the request of Miriam Hopkins the same day. <br /> <br /> Actually, Lincoln was worried. In the West, on the last day of its presidency, immediate thoughts were about confronting the confederate states and the Union as soon as possible. Focused attention, not on the west (except Maximilian and Mexico's controlled forces against Juarez). But he took part in real Western affairs. In 1862, John Pope sent an unpleasant loser of Manassas to Minnesota, with Sioux (Indian, McKinley Kantor's "Sprit Lake" novel to establish a serious Indian war). to be very effective here, when the rebellion was dismantled. <br /> <br /> However, Lincoln has all the real attentions about Western problems, it is doubtful to say that (as Cooper repeated at least once), "You're sure to limit it." It does not mean that he does not have to say it, But it's hardly a deeply-spoken state. As I said, Teddy Roosevelt said: "Breakfast for breakfast every morning for your health." It's a profound expression of politics. In fact, at least one act is known. Becoming a Cooper's Little Mantra, like in Lincoln's Monroe Doctrine version, is ridiculous ... DeMille's script is really like bad mistakes. in common sense. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a bad misfortune. "The Plainsman" is an adventure movie, and thus has the full benefit of the movie that generates DeMille's show. That is why it is worth watching. But not a book about Lincoln's political ideas or his outstanding heritage.
