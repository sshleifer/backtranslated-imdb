This movie is much better than asylum versions, especially the war of the world. The tripod looks pretty nice, but walking and death can be better. The scenes of the events were very excellent. On foot ... on foot ... on foot ... on foot ... Oh, please stop my god or I'll die. The trumpet child was the favorite scene, especially when a ship came with a set of tripods. I recommend the good movie people I read the book. The music is horrible and the directors seem drunk. <br /> <br /> Pros. Soundtrack 99% book Cool violence Tripods and handling machines are cool <br /> <br /> cons. London's nasty act
