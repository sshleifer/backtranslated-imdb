** Possible Spoiler *** Adam Sandler usually uses comedy mode, but profits in "Reign" performance. Courage that has shown to the September 11, 2001, is loneliness. and "lost in his world." Johnson (Cheadle), a practiced dentist, finds his old classmate (Sandler) and wants to get the name "Old times". See, Rain Man (Dustin Hoffman), like Fineman. It also gets emotional and stress occurs. It seems Oldies's music, comfort and a "psychological" crutch to lean. <br /> <br /> In Johnson, Fineman, there is a certain kind of pleasure and ease. His family. He feels bored and happy in his job. In the same example, his friend wants to make sure he does not fall into a "crackdown" society. I came out of this movie, a different and sympathetic perspective. Famine distress compassion.
