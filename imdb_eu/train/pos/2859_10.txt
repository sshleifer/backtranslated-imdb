I know that after almost 15 years, someone has created the strange sound created after airing the air, but I love this show. I do not know why, but I like to see it. I love Adam the best. The only disappointing thing is that only DVDs were purchased in Germany during the seasons, and that was only during the first two seasons. That's disappointing, but it's okay. I'll continue looking online. If anyone has advice on buying for the second twelfth season, send an email to darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I am the first owner. The only difference is that the DVDs come from Germany, they play only on my portable DVD player and on my computer. Okay I still own!
