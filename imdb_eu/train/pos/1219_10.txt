The Care Bears movie is much better than the previous one. It has a deeper picture, a better character development, and melodies (especially the close song) are both enthusiastic and warm. Surely the film looks after the stress, but you're going to be the movie Care Bears. This movie is a great image to show off to children, because it is friendship, love and re-engagement. Care Bears are remarkable, even more adorable!
