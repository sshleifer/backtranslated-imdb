This 10 of 20 is a wonderful story about the inhabitants of the War and a carpenter, Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beech) comes out with Tom and immediately explains that he has serious problems when he has spent the first night. William is illiterate and terrifying, but somehow they both meet together in the loneliness of others. William understands that he is talented as an artist and Tom's talents are seen as a poem director in a entertaining interpretation of Jerusalem. William is Zacharias Wrench, accompanied by a young Jewish youth in London, and together with Tom and Zacharias, he finally learns to read and write and the narrow community feels part of that small one. As soon as he settles down, his mother reminds London of London, and here we see why it's so wrong. Mum is clear if her headaches and if William does not hear William, she travels to London to look for it. In the end, he kept his sister's deceased baby in a winery. After being in the hospital, Tom realizes he must be kidnapped and taken home. Finally, it's a good ending when he says that William will accept Tom, at the same time, he learned his best friend Zacharias in an air raid in London. For me, one of the most amazing scenes in Tom was talking to a civil servant at a home office. <br /> <br /> I love "im, that is, what I deserve, I love myself". <br /> <br /> Does it just improve that?
