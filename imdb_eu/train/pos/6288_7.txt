60 seconds / (2000) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "60 seconds has passed" a dynamic, sharp and elegant action, with a great star power of octane and a lot of wonderful automobiles. . If you are a car interested in a car, producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air", "Rock") will be able to see this product for the eyes of bright vehicles. Although the film hides in many areas the smell of weakness, its strenuous action and enthusiasm make it a great emotional summer. <br /> <br /> The film is the star of Giovanni Ribisi ("The Mod Squad"). A young crime called Kip Raines, as the film opens, fails to offer a long list of expensive cars to criminals criminals Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip's life is threatened, his older brother, Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but talented robber, is called for the survival of his brother: a model of fifty cars, model, year, and age in only four days. <br /> <br /> Memphis sends a group of bandits in the first three days to collect the robbery. The crew is Sara "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), but a retired sexy auto sexy thief, Mirror Man (TJ Cross), former Otto Halliwell and wise (Robert DuVall), known as Memphis previous business. Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott) and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde). <br /> <br /> With the help of the film and the tension, two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant) are implicated, because Memphis and its crew were not in previous experience. Good and closely look closely at them. <br /> <br /> There's not much time to develop the character here; People know about people despite their rugged lifestyles and harsh people take hard films with a stunning atmosphere. To make matters worse for the movie, dialogue fails to define the characters with a solid cultural tone. I do not say that it is necessary to get rid of vulgarity and thriller; I'm really anxious to make the decision of the director from an incorrect language, it could be very easy to make a R-grade film. However, I believe that in a movie called "Gone in 60 Seconds", the development of the character's great clarity must be a compelling and genuine dialogue. <br /> <br /> Although they are a problem, the characters are effective because of their high standards, so they can handle the intransigent interpreters. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is vivid and compelling. Angelina Jolie's look is right here. Delroy Lindo is compelling and compelling. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston give support roles. <br /> <br /> The film has a standard structure, with the first good act of story-style and motivational motifs. It sets the Quick Action theme, but it lacks the depth and stiff character input. In the second act, we have gathered more problems: the story's time is wasted in a large part of that segment, it's never really built for the third year. While it takes a lot of time in the midst of the movies, and the sex scene offers a solid central plot, it happens a lot. The third mission is a whirlwind adrenaline, a wall that is full of horrors and one of the most bizarre sequence of cars ever shot. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack "The 60 Seconds" featured in inspirational action scenes. Although this film is a kind of destructive crash, they are scenes like car leaks. Dominic Sena, in addition to directing her commercial career, has an attractive style and decisive attitude when it comes to "60 seconds". In which the audience will be both nervous, emotional and enthralled, but not much more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
