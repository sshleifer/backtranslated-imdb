Richard Willaims is an animation god. The producer was prevented from correcting this film. The final product is a very different movie, a very confusing story, but some stunning animated moments (like Emery Hawkins's "Greedy"). Joe Raposo's repetitive music is not allowed. It was done on the big screen because the VHS did not show all this, so we expect a DVD in the bins a day. Still worth watching eye-popping animations.
