I would not be surprised if the pre-revolutionary Soderbergh had not been pressured to prevent the Cuban graphic from being corrupted. Some statistics are not used for young people. However, in the first part, almost entirely shot in the jungle, it senses the sensation of that place, especially through the Cuban mountain ranges. Del Toro liked the interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And cast, Castro, Bichir, the actress performed brilliantly on all sides. It is clear that Soderbergh does not look at these people, but it is clear that it will not take away from the past of the past that the "Yankee" will repeat its case. Some of the most important historical parties contradict what I have read. In my opinion, Castro did not face all the efforts made by the United States to face the Soviet Union court. But it is well on other sides that the expeditions did not include the robbery of the islands, but the island had control of other rebels. The country treasure was empty.
