This program is very fun and the title song is so keen and I can not get it out. It seems to me that I am older than those of the wrinkles that make things, and these four are excellent in their efforts. Some of what they do are sharp, but excellent, now that our PC world will never be in the real life of life. I always learn something from learning. But you like a little mystery, drama, comedy and court work. Quincy, ME reminds me in a way and Barney Miller works in another and reacts together. They create a lot, but they work, and that's why.
