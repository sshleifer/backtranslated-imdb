How does this worship become a film, I do not know. In my opinion, I've forgotten the comedy as really simple! <br /> <br /> "Runaway Car" tries to quickly pass on as a thriller, but taking the acting quality (Good God is a bad one), the story, the devil's ownership of the car and the scene of evacuating the baby, you can not really do it, but you can laugh And you laugh. Films making film invitations are made, and those who do this can be an indicator worthy of a movie. This movie is the culmination of entertainment, from the beginning to the end I laughed. Sometimes I did not breathe and I almost drowned, it's really fun to have some points. When the baby came out of the sun, when a helicopter pulled out with a pilot riot, he kept a constant speed that was identical to the car and kept flat flight flat. I laughed at him laughing. But when the baby started dancing in the air, almost asleep on a bridge and almost in a tree, the tears fell on my face. <br /> <br /> This black police also happened to me. Jesus played in Madonna's "A Prayer A" video. It seems everywhere has arrived.
