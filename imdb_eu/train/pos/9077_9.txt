The driver I really enjoyed was as amazing as I expected, if it were not better. Patrick Warburton was a rebellion, but at first I figured I could not bear his character. Him and Megyn Price had a bit of chemistry, but we hope that as the season progresses, they will be more comfortable with each other. It must be very unusual for Megyn to come up with his latest show as "Life Reason". <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson are really new to the whole Sitcom scene, but I think they will improve over time. David Spade's character, I think, was not the focus of this pilot. The lines are as different as I've watched on TV, but I think it's just their style. She works for her. <br /> <br /> I think the couple, or alone, can connect with all the doubts and struggles and be sure about your decisions, that is the show. The situation of characters seems like real life, not just like most shows like sugar coating. <br /> <br /> I hope that all the actors give CBS a chance. This show has to be one of the best options, given the opportunity and time.
