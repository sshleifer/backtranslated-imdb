After watching this movie I know a little bit more about the US. David Lynch is shocked and simple for strange synonyms, and in fact, these elements are not missing The Straight Story. However, Lynch did not have a clear witness. We start a quiet life with a simple family, but lately we find interesting and interesting characters in the depths of their lives. Especially the scene of the scene was moving around two veterans of the Second World War to debate the events of fifty years and how they still affect their current lives and emotions. If you are looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, do not look here. Really, if you're looking for real stories, the movie is yours.
