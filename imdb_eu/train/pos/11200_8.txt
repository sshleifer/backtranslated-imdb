He is also the most stylistic expressionist of his films; Note, for example, the curious distortions used in the party sequence and the rhythm of the image title and the plot of images. <br /> <br /> However, its core continues the final game. The most exciting examples of cinema boxing. Although you know that he has to win the hero, he becomes very credible and loses his wife to the corner of the champion, motivated to return to the final plot, the game is very well placed.
