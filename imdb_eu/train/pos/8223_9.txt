When I first watched this movie, I attacked London in 1958. I never saw such a movie. He had a curious and hypnotic effect, unlike the films I've seen before, which has left a lasting effect. <br /> <br /> I think Odile Versios and Marina Vlady are sisters, if they are not twins. Undoubtedly, interaction is amazing for the audience. <br /> <br /> If this has become a DVD - in Region 2 format - and in French, I'd like to hear about it and buy it.
