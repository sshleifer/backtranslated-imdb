This film is basically about human relations and their interaction. The main character, in the dusk of his life, is an old woman who begins his journey to the past, studying how he lived his life. This trip is intended to be a child's economic crisis and a nursing home. At some point in life, we look at the issues we are asking for are very sincere, and there are many ideas to discuss this movie, such as family legacy, true love, marriage or fate. Although this type of melodrama is not new, this is useful for some family members to discuss some ideas. The performance of the actors is good and the characters are very credible, but some characters are not fully developed as a result. I recommend this movie on a Saturday afternoon in a quiet place.
