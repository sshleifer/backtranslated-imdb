At first I was not sure I wanted to see the movie when my guide was created, so I looked at the IMDb and I thought it was very nice, I thought I would wait for a movie like Elephant. <br /> <br /> When busy Phillips, after overcoming Alicia's character, I realized that I had a good job of setting up a relationship between Alicia and Deanna. Alicia Deanna is very hardcore for Erika Christensen to play almost all over the movie, but in spite of being polar opposites, they have one thing in common, as well as being in the movies. Loneliness and the extent to which the movies are progressing. <br /> <br /> I loved how I loved this movie, and was glad to see all the positive comments on it. I could not get through Elephants as Columbin exploited the tragedy. On the other hand, this movie was compelling and real. Occupied Phillips plays KAT !!! This is good and I would like to see its progress in full-fledged roles.
