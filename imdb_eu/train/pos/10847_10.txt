I'm 60 years old, guitarist, (move / rhythm), and I've been in four bands for the last fifty years; Everything is fighting, trash, corruption, worse places. , who are always traveling, who have little or no money, and who either drank or drank. But clubs, fans and music have been worth it! Strange Fruit! I'm already deceived because of this now, and my hands and hips do not affect arthritis, but as far as video clips are concerned, everything has gone back and it's all! Birds, brawls and booze! And I was young again! It's like Billy Connolly's voice, God likes the 70s! Rock On Forever!
