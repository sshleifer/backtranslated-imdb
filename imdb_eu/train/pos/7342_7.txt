I will not be a fan of Ralph Bakshi, because I'm not. So far I have seen 5 of its animated films: Coonskin, Wizards, Fritz the Cat and Lord of the Rings and finally "Fire and Ice". I can say, I found the one I like the most "Fire and Ice". Sword and witchcraft are a fantasy story in Conan the Barbarian's lines, but beautiful works, realistic animation and vivid film score effectively give a classic charm to this movie. <br /> <br /> The first mention is worth it, it's the same animation. I do not like what people say about rotoscopy, but I think that Ralph Bakshi used this technique very effectively here. I was shocked by the realistic movements of the characters. Directorial style and photorealistic nature felt that "Fire and Ice" was a superb production of fantasy budgets rather than a cartoon. Unfortunately, the level of art details is not at all consistent, especially at the end of the movie. Some scenes are really flat, details of the body's details, or cloth folds and shadows on the characters. <br /> <br /> A realistic mobile person would follow realistic actions. The action was well-choreographed, but it was really wild. I was so brave that the brutality of this action was compared to direct movies like Zack Snyder's 300. However, I noticed that although there were bloodshed, blood splashes remained at least. Once again, the creative team that increases the audience's experience only gives you an excellent opportunity, not taking things "over". <br /> <br /> Although I do not know "great names" in Castei. The actors are delighted to achieve their performance; keeping the distribution of all row rows and boys. <br /> <br /> I mean little boys? I did yes. That is exactly the story, the good story versus the standard of evil. There is nothing really original, it seems to be a mixture of topical fantasy movies dressed in warriors and little girls. Anyone who looks for "Depth" would be disappointed. The characters are not much developing, and some of them are as dimensional as Nekron and Darkwolf (however, I heard Darkwolf heard rumors of some of the Necron and his dying mom. Deserves such deserve a deserved restoration and they should. the board went into the depth level to add the depth to the level, I would not be surprised if the whole movie was a "tech" demo that was a great show of animation and art, just like the "movie." br /> An earlier classic, "Fire and Ice" captivates the passionate nature of adventure and mysticism, with beautiful performances of fantastic creatures and charming characters, a unique vision of the world created by Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta with good action and suspense. <br /> <br /> Are they going to receive standard animation movies today? No doubt, no. I'm excited by the animation enthusiasts in general, "I'm going downhill" and I'll be able to grow this simple but beautiful movie. A treasure of the 80s is really worth the checking.
