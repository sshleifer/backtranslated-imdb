I remember seeing this movie, thinking it was very interesting. I wanted to know what happened next day. They ran into a summary of 8 minutes. We start in the school yard. . Two discussions are being debated in class. Kid B says Kid, "Today does not go to class." And A A has been denied, claiming to be something that is really important. So, the child B and the baby goes to class. Upon arrival, the teacher will inform them that they will learn the only and most important lesson they will learn today. They would learn the meaning of life. They will give them all a pamphlet, and when A girl gets out and tells her neighbor's boyfriend. Children will not share, Kid A is looking for a teacher. When he finally finds it, he gets an amazing revelation of the true meaning of life. I suggest everyone see this short. Only 8 minutes of your life will last, but the message is so important that it will help you for life.
