Fortunately, I was not enough to hang out on TV, without knowing anything about that movie. Then the tape finished before it was exhausted five minutes! <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I got the most spy movie because I got it. There are typical toy submarines and plots that are slightly flat, but they are also very cold and brave moments. Taking into account the 1969 production year, some lesbian shades were required to lift some eyebrows. Of course, today no one is amazed and, in fact, it seems that these scenes are pretty well done. And it's not just two of George's actors. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The gas attack seems to accelerate the viewer's pages, it's not surprising. Very effective Likewise, the views of both sides of the opponents give a deeper understanding of the usual suspense and action to the whole story. This is not just the story of a heroic war in favor of a victory, but it shows what good and bad is behind the victory. Well, being a war case, especially bad. <br /> <br /> Ennio Morricone is a must-have for composers. His work is always excellent, but more than ever. And I think Suzy Kendall tries to get more films. Talk about Fr√§ule! Let's hope they will soon get it on the DVD, so that the whole movie can be in my collection and more people will know this strange piece of jewelry.
