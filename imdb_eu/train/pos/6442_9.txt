It's a great Swedish movie ... I saw it was the first Swedish movie ... it's simple and it's a profound ... what a great combination! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist performed a magnificent performance as a celebrity who is looking for peace in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Frida Hallg was excellent to keep her girlfriend as an inspiration and help her never give up. <br /> <br /> Direction and inter-fight Mikel Strogoff loses his battle with his wife and defends his noble cause for his people from the hometown to find peace in music. <br /> <br /> I do not like the final thing. It was not good, but it has a deep meaning.
