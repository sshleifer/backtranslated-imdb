This film would give me little stars just because it was filmed in the movie "Life" in the story, here in New York. Most of this channel, "established" there, Iowa countryside, Oregon, Virginia, United States of America, etc. They are shot at Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or elsewhere. <br /> <br /> But if there is one of the main Scores that is worth a - 10 * on this site, this is the movie. No doubt, for its originality, this story has been done several times, in many variations, similar to that. Often it has also been done on the big screen, mega-stars, past and present, Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, et al - and Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan, and many more. I can think of at least 10-12 more, as clear as the past, from the top of my head, it could now add and surely others would think about it. <br /> They do not work, but it seems to me that, in my opinion, this is one of the best genres I have seen. On Wednesday, I casually caught it, the only one I took after a couple of hours on the TV. I have never crossed this film since it was made in these 8 years. And, despite the fact that both directors have done enough to make the most of them, they were completely unknown to me. The only two actors that I had known I saw some things I saw from Phyllis Newman (Anna's mother), and Michael Rispoli (Henry, Charlie's best friend) was as "Grammatic". The guy in "Rounders" on the street. <br /> <br /> The encounter and ties between the best friends of both characters, just like in love with stories below, only show the relationship between being with Anna and Charlie, when they are only revealed later, is often done. The play is part of the genre, but it does not enjoy the difference here (it actually improves). <br /> <br /> If I check other comments, I am totally positive. The word that describes this movie is INGAGING, in caps. This adjective describes interpreter; characters; Chemistry between all the characters, in any combination presented, and on all supports and even smaller ones. <br /> <br /> "Sharper: Rounders;" I love movies "; the Schwarzenegger / Stallone fugitive rate," Goodfellows; "" Casablanca "," Kanye "," Windy "," Kane Town. "But with clear and easy enjoyment, this was outstanding, with their quotes," You Mail Got " and "Sleepless in Seattle." And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan could not do better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan, stars and co-stars like those of the mega-movies that were here.
