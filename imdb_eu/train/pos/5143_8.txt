Asylum is a very fast and compact scene that attacks people, and the editing / superimposition of images, and fuzzy narratives and links, is a very hard film to follow. It seems that a man (Masue Inoue) will take a job as a concierge or janitor, so that the imprisoned wife may be near and perhaps rescued. But, clearly, he is mad, huddled on the ground, with time and intimidation, misery, and too much time with a written expression on his face, the rest of the time. Film director sometimes changes from point of view, and we blur our images alongside a pond that we are seeing, or the retention of a drowned child. Something tortured. When he looks at audiences or other crazy people, the filmmaker uses the distortion lens and things like that, what people see and how they react. And the place is crazy, laughing, hiding and dancing in one case and dancing at night. At one point, the man tries to take his wife out, but the night outside the door frightens her and returns to her room. Gradually, the man enters a nightmare that interrupted the nightmare, and he dies into a nightmare, and kills many doctors and assistants, and at the same time madness and laughter. When he awakens, he is distressed and sank on the ground. Japanese life, streets, some wonderful 1920s buildings.
