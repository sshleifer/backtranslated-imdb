As I saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, the nostalgia for video hanging is great for me. At the age of 15, it was easy for me to become the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now, perhaps, I am very interested in the future professions of major players. As soon as she got up from her Dorsey days, Sinatra immediately made shorts as a singer-songwriter, this was his first feature film. As other viewers say, On the Town seems almost like warming. Sinatra had to work hard, but Kelly's dance is compelling and better in the next couple. However, respecting his body, it is easy to understand why he was carabinist as a bean. Who would think he could win the academy for a decade, and would play a great deal of fighting. While Gene Kelly's personality and dance mastery of this film, his excellent performance did not suggest that MGM became a major creative force on music, he developed an additional dance by Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to see Dean Stockwell of fresh face, and remember, later, that "Emotion" was a murderer in Compulsion, based on the murder of Leopold-Loeb in 1920. An additional note: a reviewer praised the performance of the Betty Garretten Signature's love affair. Later, he played against him in the village, but Pamela Britton was in this movie.
