This movie is from all time. First of all, once I saw it, it was my favorite theater. Why? simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director) has completed a true work of art. 99.9% of today's films are purely entertainment, the director Ben Coccio gives us a reality, gives us a learning tool to find out why it has happened. The mainstream media revolves around and they turn around, but Ben Coccio plays face to face with the school, so that the two young men intend to kill both hearts and hearts. It's definitely a graphic and horrible, how could it be? Gloves are depleted, the lies and sugar coats of our media teachers take us to the place where we can find the truth. Sometimes it's not just like a converter, but sometimes, hate and isolation are deeper, they are humans, we can see these guys ourselves and us. The society left behind and the effects were enormous and real. <br /> <br /> Respect and love your classmate. Lesson to learn all lessons, thank you Mr. Festival For cooking I look forward to the progress of your movie career.
