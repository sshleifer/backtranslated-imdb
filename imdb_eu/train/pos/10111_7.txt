Edward D. Wood, Jr. Haunted World does not have a good document. Aesthetically, it looks nonsensical and inexpensive. There, people are very inadequate and cohesive, but this adds charm. I say this, because it is a documentary about some bizarre movie-making cartoons and is surrounded by its teammates, so there is no other way to document the life and the journey of man and the way. It seems that some images about Wooden engineering and inepticity, and the portrayal of both features is a real documentary. In general, Wood lovers and the whole movie watch deserves, but do not expect here to shine. Wood is waiting for a documentary after his heart.
