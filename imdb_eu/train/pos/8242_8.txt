I saw the movie FIDO in some channels and I must say that it has become an instant fan. The film feels like a comic book that captures the look and feelings of the 1950s surrealist, knowing that you had a healthy decade when you danced with Elvis, just dropped the desert nuclear bomb. People were so fervent that it was scary when it was scary and the people of clean cuts usually think they're zombies that they really work for pets. <br /> <br /> This Canadian production, crisp and colorful film. Excellent work, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and baby. <br /> <br /> It's a shame not to make this movie bigger. He deserves more recognition. Tim Burton or SHAUN OF THE DEAD is much better than the team. Okay However, it is an instant classic.
