The Austrian film has something special, not just Seidl, but Spielmann and other directors. It's a strict sense of reality that never stops throughout the movie. Hundstage is no exception. They only get stories that depict this effect, but also the actors. In Hundstage I have never felt the feelings of the actors, but rather the real people. The viewer's feeling is real ... almost a pensioner, a resinous or lonely woman in the movie lives on your block beneath you. <br /> <br /> No doubt, no doubt, live in Vienna, no doubt the people of the movie know about his meckern / sudern (complaint), hidden sex and prolo macho. This is the Viennese dialect, which, in many cases, reinforces especially the complaining as a way of life. The usual parochialism and arrogance of Vienna are very well represented. <br /> <br /> Viennese neighborhoods have a lively presence of the film, with nothing to do with testimonial and lofty. In addition, shopping malls and large stores have become a celebration of materialism. Among all, there are people's houses that are involved in pleasure activities, trying to get in touch with their human being, but in vain. Examples are the sexual game of the old woman, men with rape limitation, the girl lost, and the girl who strikes her girlfriend and the young girl who strikes the hardness of her drivers. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a soundtrack because it focuses on the normality / abnormality of its images. With Seidl (and other Austrian directors), another typical feature is the image sexually disturbing exhibition. These include the death of the old woman's husband, her sex scenes, her sex with her husband with two men in her apartment, etc. <br /> <br /> Hundstage Seild's portrayal of people who may be Vienna's population, like Paris, New York or Madrid citizens. The viewers may not despise the senses of Vienna or feel it in the movie, since they themselves may become victims of human conflict and alienation, even though they are in different situations. In the end, I think that Seidl's film is a warning about the awful situation of human relationships that are so evident in Hundstage. And if the viewer does not refuse the reasons for this bad transformation, Seidle has achieved his goal.
