My god Buttgereiten's masterpiece is one of the best films I ever watched. Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard's films are a bit more disturbing, but it's not scary as Necromantik's. All small stories have a profound philosophical interest and management is completely imaginative, despite the lack of money (see "bridge"). Very discouraged!
