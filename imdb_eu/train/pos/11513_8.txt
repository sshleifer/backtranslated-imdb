One of my favorite shows in the 70s. As I recall, he went to Australia on Friday (or Saturday) to go to the air in Australia on the night. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were brilliantly together <br/> <br /> <br /> Each section was usually superior to what Kolchack had to do to fight with some kind of natural opponent. In their view, writers tried to make the most of the vampires and ghosts. <br /> <br /> I remember the conflict where the opponent was the spirit of a former Indian leader. He began to kill people in a city hospital as a massive electric current. Latest shows Kolchack tried to avoid cycling when spark blasts and flames exploded. Well ... you should be at the time but the idea was interesting. <br /> <br /> McGavin always had the energy and excitement in his roles, and that was his best. <br /> It's definitely worth the TV "Hall of Fame". To mention Tony Vincenzo ... 'You are a Kolchack IT ...' Or, in the Hall of Fame, 'IN it'!
