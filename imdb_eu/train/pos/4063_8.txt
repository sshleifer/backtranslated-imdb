Castle in the sky is definitely a film by Hayao Miyazaki. After seeing it first, I'm glad it's not disappointed. On the other hand, it is worth your time, that means (as for the films of Miyazaki), this is just that great! / Very interesting (and sometimes lovable) characters to help. And, of course, the usual battle of nature and civilization, flying machines (many !!), beautiful landscapes painted? But oh, no pigs (I realized at least once, I only saw it). However, two years before, Miyazaki made his debut film, with Nausica, that is, Mononoke Princess was a sound rehearsal for her great work. Castle in the Sky is a bit a bit from these two. With a smooth performance of the first 30 minutes, similar to the Conan series, and similar to Meitantei Holmes episodes. Here, Sheeta, a girl who literally falls from the sky, discovered a young man who works in a small village in Pazu, a rural mining town. He suspects his amnesia and his connection to the mysterious southern Laputa, helping to find out where Pazu was coming from, fleeing the army and fleeing a group of air pirates. As the film progresses, land gets heavier and much more interesting, revealing Myiazaki at its best. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack reminds us that Spiritu Away (or vice versa, because the castle was first produced in the sky), and the director, Joe Hisaishi, begins with a lightweight composer. It gets more complex and beautifully fitting! The earth goes on! <br /> <br /> A duplicate note in English, with the correct interpretation of the two main characters, even Anna Paquin Sheeta, a strong accent (the actress was at that moment in her career). Mark Hamil will direct Muska to the musician, for the evil yet demonic criminals! <br /> <br /> Do not miss this person!
