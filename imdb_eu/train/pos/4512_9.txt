I watched this movie today and I must say it was much better than I had seen before about a couple of hours ago. Personally I was harmed by its language, but it changed my mind completely. Films in most cases was surprisingly good with great actors and actors. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and he did everything to do it. This really touched me and a movie, based on a real story, convinced me. A young boy who knows a new school, a psychologist and a new teacher, even if they are not different from others and fight against things. A few things show a great deal of change and, sometimes, the difference can cause difficult situations. At the same time, I think that the actor's selection was perfectly successful. You really felt like some episodes were happening as an outside person. Before praising this film, I must admit that there were no things and situations that were not realistic and realistic ... for example, the school's school director struck him with Frits. Martin in front of the class, at the end of the movie. He really beat him badly, but the only thing he could do was to compare the start with his nose when he first hit it, when Frits got some bumps ... Well, I think every movie has its own mistakes. ... I need to say, someday I found this store DVD, I'm sure it's going to be with me.
