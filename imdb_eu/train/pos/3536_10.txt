The EA has shown us that it has made a classic 007 agent and make you feel world-wide in the 60's. Graphics of the game are remarkable and the voice recording is very professional. This game was released in April of 2007 (after two years after its publication), and I am still amazed at playing. It's hard now for the EA to make 007 free of charge. <br /> <br /> I will give this game 10/10 for the levels it has in these levels, especially for the "consulate" level. I would recommend this game for over 13s. The only thing that I did not like in the game was the level of the Russian ship, it was too much pressure. Overall, I like the game LOT !!
