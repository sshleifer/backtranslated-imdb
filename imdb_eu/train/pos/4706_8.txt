It can be sure to be classical, but full of classic lines. My only friend and one of my favorite movies all the time and fifteen years later (maybe Cinemax was too regular!) Michael Keaton is the worst actor in this movie. Know how to play, but it is surrounded by a fantastic drawing, that is, how exactly they play. Are you looking for a movie you want to animate? That is, but rent it with your friends, it will be even better.
