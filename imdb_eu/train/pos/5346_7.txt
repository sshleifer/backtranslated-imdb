Carol, the girl in the middle of the story, has been taken to foreign lands in Spain, the Civil War conflict in the late 30s. For this girl, everything is new in the past. War and his father are in constant concern, but must be immersed in a provincial culture behind New York. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Imanol Uribe. Carol's family is divided, of course, while someone is married to someone with Carol's left wing patriotism, the rest of the family's sympathy with Franco and the fascist wins. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story is added to what has already been said, to see it better, but it is a simple movie. A splendid landscape of the North. Do not take much action, because most of what happens is happening around young Carol and young friends. <br /> <br /> Clara Lago plays with honest and innocent Carol. Maria Precipice Carol's mother, Aurora, went to America. Rosa Maria Sarda Maruja, a teacher with Carol. Carmelo Gomez plays Alfonso, when he left Aurora to go to America. This actor, who plays the leading roles in most Spanish films, does nothing, because it continues to be a complete enigma in the whole movie.
