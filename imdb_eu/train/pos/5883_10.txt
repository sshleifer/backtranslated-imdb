I heard, scared and hypnotized my physical activity and voice. Each character had their own brilliant functions. Letters, words, gestures, the sun, everyone said. The movie talked to me. He clarified a different perception of a person who believes in humanity. Peace and gentle behavior that believeth. I kept credibility, represented sacrifice and human dignity. Without power, grace is without feeling. Power at the cost of mankind is so unbelievable. I was afraid of this movie because of people that are no longer in the world. And, sadly, I think about them. I like this movie to face conversations and everyone's expressions. Bless this movie.
