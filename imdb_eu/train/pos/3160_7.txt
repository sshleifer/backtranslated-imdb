This show has all the characters of a comedy: good man, fool, pervert, rich ... but it has been set in the 70s. That's the only difference with the television's other comedies. I do not know how you like this show. His humor is pathetic! I mean, jokes ... a direct interview is: "Fez: Oh, Jackie wants to be with you. (Laughs the audience) Jackie: you are a pervert in Fez. (Laughter laughs) Fez: Oh yes , I am (the audience applauds) "It's not fun. If I do not think I'm laughing (I do not know how to call you in English, sorry) I would not laugh. This is not a smart comedy, this is an insult to the public. I like most American comedies, but that's not good. I will give 4 out of 10 (sorry for my English again).
