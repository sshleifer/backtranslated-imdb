I do not know how you can say that Freddy's Nightmares is cheesy and rip-off. Of course, you do not watch good TV when you see it. The episodes are full of drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way people die. I love Freddy's Nightmares and I expect 44 episodes on the DVD. Among the best episodes: Saturday Night Special, School Daze and Love Stinks. If you think this series has sucked you, you have the right to have your opinion, but remember your opinion and it does not mean anything. Freddy Nightmares will always be one of the best series, and you'll just have to accept it. If you do not like it, do not see it, but do not deny it.
