I loved this movie! Excellent. Although the average watchmaking of the film may be small, it can not be interpreted in the film (for example, our heroine is Achilles, and the last battle between him and Alexander has rocketed the heel as he shot it in the mythology of Achilles mythology). That's just so little fun! However, a great movie, a good story, could be reminiscent of special effects today! Oddly enough, Gary Graham has been an average success, featuring the T.V show Alien Nation. This movie is a fun watch and it's worth more!
