This film has a strong philosophical ending. But only if you see the beginning of the ending movie you have a meaning. <br /> <br /> The alienation of the late 1960s, from a point of view of a young man and a young woman, is a "Zabriskie Point" theme. "Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin have a much-rehearsed experience, which improves the message of the film. Acting as an actor does not make sense of realism, because the two players are emotionally distant from their disturbance. <br /> <br /> Not this It's a script-oriented movie, except for the first ten minutes, especially impressive with stunning cinematography. Beautiful naturalist images seem like a different world, and Mark and Daria's emotional detachment are synchronized suddenly. <br /> <br /> Pink Floyd music would weaken thematically with the toughest music of The Doors. Many scenes cite "Storms." <br /> <br /> <br /> However, I like this movie, it's different It's unique: it's artistic and imaginative. Deserts in the desert are beautiful. <br /> <br /> Over the years, "Zabriskie Point" seems increasingly attractive in the 1960's of the United States of America It tells the atmosphere it was. It is an artistic, bohemian way. The film fascinates philosophically the last eight minutes.
