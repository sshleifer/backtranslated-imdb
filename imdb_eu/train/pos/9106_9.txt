The first time I saw it, Piedras is my favorite and I have seen one of my few photos. Excellent screenplays female series (somehow interconnected) represent life understanding and sensitivity. Ramón Salazar achieved a compelling film in his first feature film and proved himself as an effective director. <br /> <br /> Not all performances are excellent. Among the main ladies, the average (Najwa Nimri) is very good (Vicky Peña), but the announcement will be Mónica Cervera, the late retired daughter of Antonia San Juan. Enrique Alcides is a charming charming girl, and Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo, and the director of the same, are Ramón Salazar. I saw that I was so afraid I could not think of it the day. I recommend it.
