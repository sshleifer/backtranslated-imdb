I agree that the movie is a bit slow in many everyday scenes and no conversations. And I did not feel surprised when I saw him. However, after a few days I realized that the movie was with me and that it still has a melancholy that stays in my head. The appreciation of that movie is increasing. Without a doubt, it is worth more than an immediate unforgettable movie. <br /> <br /> Many have commented that the film is not linear, and this is the main feature of European cinema, rather than a line-up of Hollywood. I do not know whether it's true. Many do not even have their confusing structure and lack clear explanations. To the audience, I do not think much I can say to change opinions. However, it is expected to challenge others who have not yet seen, and you do not want to provide the movie with all the answers, and you should enjoy it more than anything else. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Pay attention to hair style and you can easily distribute 3 periods. It is not as confusing as it is also proposed; Just enjoy it and it will all end clearly. <br /> <br /> Yes, a lot of things remain or are not showing, and many situations remain unexplored. Is not it like life? It's been a long time since you can not guarantee the reasons for your friends / dear ones, and you can even make 100% sure if you are told they are the whole truth. This kind of film we interpret the causes of these actions. The movie, however, leaves enough instructions to make some reasonable assumptions. For example, Mathieu is a depressive mania until the suicide point. Why? I do not know, maybe his life is not as expected as he expects; Perhaps he is missing his family, but does not allow forgiveness of his father to forgive pardon, his need for hours; Perhaps after being sacred, for Cedric, he was reorganized and, in fact, if he were to break his life with him, he would realize that all is "undone." I think the director always showed us a little bit of it, the scene's mindset with a fragile bird. Perhaps the psyche is very sensitive and all these tensions are considered. But we also show that it is not a touch of torture with some psychic animal. In addition, there is a conversation between medicine and Cedric, the reason for this breach is a clear suicide attempt. The doctor asks him all well and Cedric thinks this way, Mathieu has deceived him once, but nothing, according to Cedric. The only reason is that we do not know, surely others are all confused. Is it important to know exactly what it is? I do not think for this movie. Finally, another sign that is incompatible is the scene of historical waste. Mathieu is interested in studying debris, Cedric is not. It's obviously a wild wall that Mathieu needs, just like the intellectual aspect that Mathieu needs, in the physical aspect. I was pleasantly surprised at the events that took place after the rough tone of the endings. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints for the DVD. It's a sound It is very soft. I turned the volume on to listen to the conversation and then changed the scene of the bar or outside crowd. The other subtitles can not be muted; They are on the screen. A large number of foreign DVD movies that have not been published by a major study are unfortunately poor.
