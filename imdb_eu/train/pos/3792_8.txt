I watched this movie earlier, and I was surprised at how exact the main dialogue of the characters was. He did not know as a movie - he felt like a documentary (I liked the part). The main female of this movie seemed to me as real as a 15-year-old girl, but I know her. <br /> <br /> Independent films are for those who offer independent films.
