I remember when I watched this movie on Radio City Music Hall. At that time I did not understand humor, but I can laugh at this movie aloud. <br /> <br /> With respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau deserved this Oscar. His screening is amazing - as young as 20 years before Willie Clark. His ways are first class. ("You know what songs he wrote? Sh * t!" And when the talk was spoken to the Spanish speaker at the front: "No! No! Enchilada !!") Absolutely hilarious! <br /> <br /> Richard Benjamin's friends, who played with Matthau rightly. <br /> <br /> I want to be a DVD, because it makes my VHS recordings aging. <br /> <br /> I had it. The remake of Woody Allen is not an interest because it can match the original.
