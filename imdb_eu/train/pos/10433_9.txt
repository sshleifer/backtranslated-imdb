The American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna to take the aircraft to the United States. On the train he met French Celine. Although they first met him, they talked like good friends. When the trains stopped in Vienna, Jesse asked Celina to visit Vienna. Then a romantic story was developed. <br /> <br /> At first they were cautious. The funniest scene was to listen to the CD music store. They looked after each other, even if they did not touch their eyes. After a profound conversation, the relationships closed. Then I saw the most romantic wife, who was called to their friend. The deep love for each other was utterly worded. <br /> <br /> Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, it will not come as you like. Love needs mutual understanding. No, love will not last long. Spiritually, harmony is the most important to love. <br /> <br /> The great screenplay and performance has been a great success for the film. <br /> <br /> One of the best Roman movies 9/10
