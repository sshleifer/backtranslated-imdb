This movie was an excellent movie about everything that affects them. I know I've been in these several times. Thank you Will Smith has reached the social problem of text messaging while driving. People do not do it. One hour and fifty-five minutes is not enough for this time. Personally, I wanted to throw my phone in after the movie. I was glad to see the message that I saw other people in the theater and the phone was throwing bags of empty popcorn. I decided to disable all emails on my smartphone, and I would encourage others to do the same. If you take care of your family, make the most important public service announcement when driving text messaging or killing seven people. Thank you for showing the way.
