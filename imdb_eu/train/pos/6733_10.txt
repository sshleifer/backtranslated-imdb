The latest surfing films have occurred and, apparently, I have not warned beforehand. In this digital cable I caught this treasure this week and what a pleasant surprise! Today's Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay and Mavericks Jaws, is the pioneer of wave surfing at Greg Noll's 60s. Hell, I could see the movie about Laird Hamilton - one of the great athlete of the generation - so the rest is just sauce. Good surfing mixes in conversations of past and current surf, with pleasant, relaxed and unremitting fashion. I've seen all the surfing movies as the best story of the great waves and I think it's my favorite. Enjoy!
