The words of her daughter are poetry: "I can not go to another year. I have arrived at a hotel room". "I lost my blue cloth on the leaves of the sea". "It's moving the marble faun ... it only gave the washing machine. That's the deal." "I spray this one". "... beasts and cats are bored some time." "... the nest of the little mouse, I would have a better hole in the mouse". And in the mother's words there is wisdom: "... well, pleasure is mine." "This little book will continue straight as a dye". "Everything must always be done". "Where are you from?" "... bring me a little radio to my professional music". "I am your mother. Remember me?" The relationship between her daughter's daughter draws on this brilliant movie. Mother's day movie.
