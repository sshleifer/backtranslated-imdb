The first shoot of the undying game brings some new elements of the genre. Patrick Galloway is an expert on the hidden and marvelous fighter, a rare friend of a friend named by his friend in Ireland. He is the descendant of World War I, so he can not find weapons or find firearms. All the weapons in play are considered ancient, but fun in the game are fun. Our hero is amber to use both hands at once: he draws his right arm on his right arms and uses his left pistols. So you can shoot and cast it at the same time, fun and amusing. This game is also the only one! The graphics are very good and they work well in medium power P.C .. Level design is also cool and atmospheric. Above all, in the game they are the property of the Covenant and the house, but there are many other places to come to find. Thanks to Clyve Barker's talents, he has an excellent game and a plot (very strange for the first person) and I said in front of the great and amazing atmosphere, a good interpretation of the voice, but not excellent. But the game has two main defects. First of all, it is quite linear, since in this room sitting in such a way, your home doors will be blocked from your room for your role. This can save time but confine the freedom of exploration. Secondly, all weapons may have ancient elements for most fps players who use high-tech weapons. In terms of difficulty, the game is very balanced. It is often a medium difficulty, but sometimes more difficult, but not difficult. In general, it's a sharp game. There is no doubt that there is one of the best fps.
