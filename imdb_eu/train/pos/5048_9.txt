The idea of ​​religious murder is a very dark and interesting horror based horror thriller. He is a tale about a shaky man who lives in Texas, and suddenly he is dying with two young children in the U.S., so God promised to save bad people. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton directs this movie as God's Killer Hand, Matthew McConaughey plays the latest performances as the oldest son of Fenton Meiks. The film decides that Fenton only has the burden of his minors and decides that he uses flashbacks because he tells the story of Wesley Doyle (the WSLEY Doyle agent that plays Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> I can not think of the great number of films that make up the audience from the beginning to the end of the audience, which is undoubtedly one of them. Even if you want to stop watching it, you will not be able to have the power of this movie. <br /> <br /> The directors have filmed this film very well and help them to plot them through the good landscapes. . It's great to play this movie, but if there are disadvantages, some parts are very powerful and can damage some people. <br /> <br /> The concept of this film is very dark, while children help to dramatize the idea through a great performance. It's really a backdrop movie, and it's guaranteed for you on the edge of the seat. I'd recommend for anyone who wants to watch something different or horror about this movie, horror, worrying and powerful.
