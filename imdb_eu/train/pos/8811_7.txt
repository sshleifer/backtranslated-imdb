In this world, several filmmakers from all over the world gather eleven film makers to present their opinions and ideas about the WTC attack. This is one of the best efforts you'll see in any movie. Such films are seldom performed and appreciated. This film tries to touch every WTC's base points. Here are some of the most important stories in this film. <br /> <br /> Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) has a tale in Iran where people make preparations for America. There a teacher is trying to educate his disciples, notifying the Inocenciado WTC dead in the WTC. Then comes a story by Youssef Chahine (Egypt). A movie maker will find a face-to-face interview with the Dead Soldier in WTC and WTC attack with Dead Hard Core Terrorist. Then we will see a story by Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso). Five children from Inocencio see Osama Bin Laden and plans to earn money in the United States. Then, we will see the story of Alexander Gozalez Inarritu (Mexico), a black screen by Alejandro Beltza, and you can see slowly the footage of WTC buildings. People stuck in the building jump to save their lives. Another important story is Mira Nair (India), where a mother is struggling to respect her son's death, whose name is trapped in the WTC massacre! After the attack on September 11, our heart beat automatically begins to pump out anywhere in the world. The first is the World Trade Center and the second is Osama! This film completely changes our perception and repeats something more forcefully. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to everyone who likes the home DVD collection. Certainly, you spend every penny worthwhile. But do not expect any other DVD movie. Filmography is a filmography, but it is not an additional feature.
