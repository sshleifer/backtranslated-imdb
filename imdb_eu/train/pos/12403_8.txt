You would be sorry that a Finnish director from Helsinki would not be able to direct the American horror film (especially in a US prison) - see yourself in the wrong way! All this was created in the 80's, and then DIY was made with more budget DIY with the company's modern TV commercial (I believe that nowadays all action films accustomed to nearly $ 100 million are strictly prevalent, industry intelligence!), Mr. Harlin's first high production and at least as a star star today. I still think that the greatest contribution from the North American industry has to do with the screen appearances of Stellan Stargarden (emphasizing the efforts of Mr Bergman's directors) - at least all female audiences - but this film proves that there is no talent in the United States and Hollywood films to watch a movie . Try to try to watch this movie, if you're not a horror puff, it's worth the IMO!
