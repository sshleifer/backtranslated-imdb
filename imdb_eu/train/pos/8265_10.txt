I just wanted to see everything I wanted for this movie, so I shot the movie AM. If you ever wanted to see what the first-class miners had to do, and for me a dramatic scene would be seen to oppress mine. This film clearly demonstrates that Germany and France can work together and collaborate with them after the First World War and how the Germans helped the French miners greatly for the disbelief of the French nations. All the actors were remarkable, mine had a strange scene with horses and a young boy who worked with me. An old, old, old mining machine runs down the stairs when the lift is broken down. If you are a true cinema fan, you will not lose the movie.
