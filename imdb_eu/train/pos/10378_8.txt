This movie is one hour of good entertainment and has some fun moments. I loved Matt's character, and Tiny too. It seemed the most exciting and fun characters, and certainly the most interesting ones. Matt is very good (as his cousin is not good), and the woman who gives police and women with a partner blond eye candy. I must say, Matt and the other Aussie actor, Eric Bana, I saw another striking resemblance. My favorite personal part was the desert scene, he loved it. Overall, I liked the movie and I get 8 scores. But the criminal was disappointed. It was a curly foot of the sides, just like the buckle is a blast. <br /> <br /> I am of course. :)
