This is one of those films that made so much abuse. If you watch TV, then you should not even watch the movie. Almost all of the fun scenes have been ruined by previews, except one that is fun for Jennifer Ann. Jim Carrey is humorous and very funny. Just watch the movie waiting for you to be amazed. After all, if you like Jim Carrey or comedy, it's worth seeing, otherwise you'll see the preview and be happy.
