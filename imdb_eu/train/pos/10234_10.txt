<br /> <br /> "Burning Paradise" is a neo-Shaw Brothers action and Ringo Lam's urban cynicism. When they look at the movie, they can think that the fight scenes are only half in nature, but that does not matter, the attitude and atmosphere they tell us. This great movie! Constantly trying to be different from his contemporaries, Lam leads us to traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and places them in the "Raiders of the Lost Ark". However, these are not lightweight cartoons that you can see in Jet Li. Instead, these guys fight for death with brutal results. The film is even better for anyone to die at any time, there is no retention. Bad, they do not do such films frequently.
