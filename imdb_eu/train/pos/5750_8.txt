But what we are, we love a good story of feeling and good emotion for the red tears ... rejoice! <br /> <br /> Tom Hulce is superb with Dominick, a slow-mouthed professional fighter and his brother Eugene, Ray Liotak, a doctors and long hours. <br /> <br /> Due to the calendar of Eugene's work, Dominick is in a great deal of time and calls for fake calls. He really wants to be a good boy, who works well and is proud of his brother. He stays in the church for a moment to pray and express emotions so open and good, that character tears even before damn movies. <br /> <br /> You do not want to give anything here, but the movie is very engaging and sad and the heart is awful. Those who are not afraid of things will have a daytime field with this beautiful story, their loving character and a wonderful song that I can not mention here, that's nothing to do with the movies, but it's very strange ... but you'll hear it in a bar. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hulce was nominated for this movie because, for "Amadeus", I thought I could really win the inside of the winner. There is no luck. Liotta is as good as her, but she has less emotional impact, but later she does it. I can tell about Jamie Lee Curtis that everything does not have a good deal here, but it was nice to give her a small Pittsburgh drama about the two brothers you will never forget.
