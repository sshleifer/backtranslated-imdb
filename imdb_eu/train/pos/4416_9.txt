Harvey Keital's best revelation of the new century. Very well-photographed, a beautiful Cuban picture of Cuba. The story consists of the nephew of local crime chiefs who develops a friendship with an American with a British connection. A person who really knows what a boy is awakening is thinking of a much bigger and more complex world that does not really understand small circles. It's a strong handwriting and humor, direction. It's crisp. In general, work is a professional work that matches the Latin American tradition. The only vulnerability is to make sound synchronization more than English than Spanish, probably to improve sales in the US. Unfortunately, this movie is not convincing. But if you see it beyond that, you will find a solid journey to another world. Recommended.
