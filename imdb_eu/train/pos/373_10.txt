This movie is a moving and amazing piece of work. When I first came to the theater, I was just 13 years old and I did not quite "get it" ... I saw it again at the age of 20 (of course, video and I own) and it was just outside. Steven Spielberg created a wonderful movie that kept you from end to end. I have also read the book, but there is something about the movies it's really livelier. casting, theater, music, costumes, landscapes, everything, it's wonderful. you laugh, weep, cheer you ... it shows all imaginative emotions. It's one of his best works and he must not miss it!
