I went into this movie thinking that it was a fascinating movie. I was surprised and very entertaining. Eva was good, but stole the show at Lake Bell. It was a great comedy. The jokes in this movie were surprisingly original and they were very entertaining between flat or two jokes. It was enough to link plots together. A woman (Eva) dies at the wedding day and returns that she is haunted by her father-in-law, the sounds are far away, but it really works well. well <br /> <br /> 7/10 - In general, it's a movie watch, if it does not get it on DVD.
