I enjoyed this movie and, after seeing it, I asked "How many Caitlin Rose" existed in the world. Many other girls have suffered from sexual abuse and their peers have been terrified by their mouths? Both adolescents and others can be threatened and cruel, as shown by this film, who is the right not the most important, their citizen and their fear, which manipulates the minds of young people, which affects immorality. . Tiffani Amber Thiessen is a brilliant rape victim, and Brian Austin Green convinces him that he loves and thinks he has the best friend as a boy. Great merit Excellent and excellent, it is very good for a TV movie.
