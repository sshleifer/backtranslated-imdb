Keaton's first feature film, and in fact, at different times (Stone Age, Roman Age, Modern Age) are three short films, eternal love triangles. The stories were intertwined in parallel with Griffith's INTOLERANCE, which was intended to satirize. Jokes and gag strengths are almost always based on anachronisms, leading today's businesses to old-fashioned settings. > <br /> Here are the classic moments: <br /> <br /> using a turtle (stone); A wrist watch with a solar ring (Roman era); Chariot with spare wheel (Roman era); Use the helmet as a locking tire (Middle Ages); Early Golf Clubs and Stones (Stone Age); Determine the willedness of the rock (Stone Age); Preview of the weather (Roman times); Snowmobile race - Buster collects skis and skeletons in a cart (Roman times). <br /> <br /> There are all the guns that vibrate before us. Even unforgettable moments: <br /> <br /> Shaving beams make the girl make-up; When a double Buster looks at his plate, a wonderful reception (in a second, the chair leaps from the chair and fell back into the server's arms, one of the funniest moments I've seen.) And that lion - manicure - is just shiny. <br /> <br /> There is also a bit of racism, when four African-Americans abandoned their women's garbage carriers for the most demanding romances. <br /> <br /> Kino Printing is a little bit of a bit with sequences of damage to the nitrate and film damage, probably in the windings. Metro is a piano and flute, and it has a great experience in Grieg. <br /> <br /> Very fun and full of laughs.
