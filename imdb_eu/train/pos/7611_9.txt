"I looked at this island and I saw how beautiful it was" ABC's "Lost" is one of the main characters of the television show's leading show. This series may be a summary of one of the groups of people affected by broken aircrafts on an unknown island, but it contempts the show. The "Lost" island, together and, in short, continues a large number of characters that have entered into a conflict that is struggling with their new life and their addiction. The situation becomes more difficult, it is clear that this is not an ordinary island, and it may not be only. <br /> <br /> The initial fear of this series, after listening to the concept of the new series, was not new. They could tell stories after certain periods, but this was not the basis. It flows in a natural narrative, the conversation is bright, the characters are memorable and the execution is excellent. The island is the only character and you should see this comment to see the series, only to show its originality and greatness. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing, this review only appears in the first two seasons, and is filled with powerful passages. My slight criticism seems that the second half is slowing down, but luckily it is back in the admirable form of the last sections. <br /> <br /> If I recommend a TV show, you should follow it correctly. Now, without a doubt, this would be. If you like excitement, adventure, guided nature stories, a strong group, beautiful locations, and an island that looks more natural than an island, "Lose" is for you. You are sure to get started early.
