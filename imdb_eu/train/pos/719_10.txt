Although this movie is the best txistu, it is perfectly thrown. Without a doubt, this movie must be considered a modern classic. There are two types of movies that I really like: movies in the depths (Chick Flicks, if you need - I guess my wife's for that) and I've been able to sit down and relax when I'm in a strange comedy. This movie is an excellent example. <br /> <br /> My friend posted this movie after it was released immediately. He seemed somewhat superficial, he said: "You have to watch the movie, it's your movie type." Before I began to hurry, I started watching. I know that Ramones have mentioned millions of times, but when you really see them, I said: "Hey, they are Ramones." My friend replied: "I do not know it was a real group." I had the moment of victory. <br /> <br /> This movie, although now somewhat dated, is a must for Ramones fans, or anyone else.
