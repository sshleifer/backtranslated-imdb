This film shows the worst part of the war, memories. For many soldiers, men and women, returning home can be a real issue. My father and his brothers reminded me of the return of World War II. My uncle never finished the war. The D-Day invasion survived, something similar to Ryan Ryan's first 20-minute saving. His memory had not been tortured for a long time. My cousins, their children, became alcoholic. Before 60 years of jumping and put soldiers in another war, in another country, the same result is. When I saw KC FilmFest, it reminded me of something that never changed the war. Young and idealist young people are not saved by the emotional hardship of Iraq, and especially if you are against war, you will be more compassionate that we should do everything we have to believe or say there. <br /> <br /> Vietnam Platoon movie label line says all this. "The first accident in the war is Innocence."
