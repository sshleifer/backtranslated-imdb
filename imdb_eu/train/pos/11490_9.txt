I've seen this movie for many years now and, since I've been looking for, I think they're very good educators in the future, I've enjoyed the movie and I feel like everyone who does not agree on this day. But the film must always be judged by themselves and I think it is very good that the clones and tubing tests that we want to judge are taking place during the baby, that is to say, what it is to become a dramatized event but you can go there. Today's terribly frightening we all laugh, but I'm thinking about it and my mother scares me, I'm feeling disappointed after watching this movie twice, but I love you not to watch the movie, tell the story and ask how far you would get for a child?
