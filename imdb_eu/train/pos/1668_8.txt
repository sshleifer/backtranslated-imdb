Artime last night began. Initially, I did not think I would like it, but I still did not feel asleep and elsewhere, I continued watching and I feel fascinated by the young, virgin, clean and passionate Artimisia. She met her former Tassi with love affairs. Even though the film is very romantic and does not rely on reality, I've loved much more than just the usual biographies or theater that I love. Excellent games, excellent cameras, great music and texts. I love it and I want more! :-)
