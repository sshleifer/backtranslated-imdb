An excellent movie, this is shameful for little attention outside the attention circles and for up to two hours until the students will be watching at Channel Four. <br /> <br /> A plot is simple but works very effectively, a blurring between a childlike fantasy and a hard nightmare is very blurred. The budget is quite small, but those who take part do not show too much. He also did not give too much. <br /> <br /> When I was a few years ago, I hung up for this TV and had fifteen views. It's one of those films that seems to everyone; As usual, those who have a more thought-about approach to cinema would get a lot. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Buerke puts good performance like Anna, as a dead snack, and she seems embarrassing. The performer came out of the scene. The cross is very good, leading the height of its character in the context of the image. <br /> <br /> At this moment there are worrisome moments (and I do not think it's light) at this time, both, second half-whistles and bigger strain. Check the lights off! <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> <br />
