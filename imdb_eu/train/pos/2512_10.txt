Being a fan of Japanese singer Gackt and Hyde was extremely excited about the movie and I was excited about seeing my role in life. I was not disappointed. In fact, this film overcomes my expectations. Gackt and Hyde singers, I'm ready to make some preparations they were aware of, but I'm not really happy, but I'm glad I was both caught up in the story and believing me. Moon Child has humorous, action, love, and violent and violent moments. I can not say that in a movie they have wept more and at that time they are going to play the role of the couple, I think they have proved to be the most amazing moment for the couple. Fighting scenes are very surprising and even though there are some moments of initial uncertainty, you quickly get into the movie and start with the characters. I recommend all of this movie, especially Gackt and Hyde fans.
