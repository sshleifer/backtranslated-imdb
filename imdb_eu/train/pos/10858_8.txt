enjoy film and efficient Confucian crime drama, the old order survives a threatened youthful young man under threat threateningly representing the modern society. I thought the last scene was curious and I could not understand why it was stolen due to being a giant D or when we thought it was a long-term plan. I loved the scene and once in a Chinese movie, violence was not a choreography martial arts festival. What's always fun with HK is that it's been the main influence of British people in the local language, "yes, sir," and "sorry", and it's so funny that, for a long time, they're still there.
