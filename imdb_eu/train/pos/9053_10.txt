1.) This movie was amazing! While I was there I saw the city while I was growing up! I went to the building where the story happened and went. I love this movie in general, the best of Jake Gyllenhaal! Likewise, my favorite part was the science fair, and all times were with my father. It seems so sad. Homer wanted to follow his dream and his father did not care in one way or another. The label line is true. "Sometimes a dream is bright to turn on the sky." 2.) The way the film was filmed was careful, so compelling it could be recorded in the 1950s. The dress was accurate and abused too. Really recommend this movie!
