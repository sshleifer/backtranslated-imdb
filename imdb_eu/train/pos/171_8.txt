I would not agree with this movie as "entertainment". In the first days of dancing, stupid, dancing, stupid, dancing, careful and rumbling, dancing is a serious story to watch out for the best of these hard times. This hilarious, film-mingled film is far from a moral story. <br /> <br /> In the mid-eighties, Hollywood was unlucky enough to entertain entertainers and entertain them without losing a movie frame. Dance, stupid, dance - Harry Beaumont One of the four films that he directed in 1931 - lasted only 8031 ​​minutes, but his characters are well-developed, his story never seems to be, and despite the plot's many lines, the viewer never left behind. > <br /> Lester Vail is the only exception of Bob Townsend's weakness in love, it's a uniform throwback, it's worth mentioning that William Bakewell Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (like Jiminy Cricket's voice known as Bert Scranton as a reporter, and Clark Gable as a gangster movie Jake Luva. <br /> <br /> But this is a movie by Joan Crawford, and it is very bright. When he was only 27 years old, this unfamiliar version of Crawford probably is not known later for those who know his work. However, here is where Mildred Pierce won the Oscars for a long time. Crawford was a star in the word in that sense, an excellent actress like a charisma to take a picture of herself. <br /> <br /> Score: EIGHT from TEN
