I must start to find out how this film was. 1990 was a winter time in Alaska. A friend from Australia stayed with me and my friend in an apartment shoe box in an apartment. It may be a bit wild and most people are inside the house, they drink a lot and watch TV. I found this film for a snowman, and it was a treasure at once. We kept the worst film and we were drinking it like fish in the next two weeks. We have seen so many times, sometimes, that we would be next to the TV or that we were going to be upside down for more filling effects. They will be laughed and the memories will come out forever. If you watch this movie rental store in a video store, steal it. You will not regret it!
