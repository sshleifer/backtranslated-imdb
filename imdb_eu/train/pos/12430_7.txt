Normally, I do not see action movies, which are usually quite similar. This film has a lot of stereotypical actions, but it has been easier to see the original and easiest film premise. David Duchovny bent over the normal approach, seeing it was good. Angelina Jolie, of course, was beautiful and performed very well. Great cast all together. It is necessary to see people bored with the old antiquated action movie.
