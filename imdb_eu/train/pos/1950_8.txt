Diane Keaton has played in many "heavy" pieces for many years on the big screen, but with Woody Allen, such as Annie Hall, she's mostly known. He is worthy of an Oscar for Best Actor in a drama of this effort, and it does not matter what the show was for the first time. Try not to find the scene that can not appear. He was a heavy drama, he was running out of pace and took all the action at full speed. Make-up was as young as possible and at age 30 he was joining with age, but even middle-aged, but he was half-full, and very fast. The movie was generally well done, well shot and well shot, but Keaton loaded.
