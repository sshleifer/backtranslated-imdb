Antonioni was looking for another masterpiece, on the other side of the Atlantic than "Blow Up." It was not a success even though it was similar to critics and youth. Why? Perhaps, it was a European vision, because then it did not work well and did not find an American view, and that's not a good thing. (At first the revolutionary student is shy.) <br /> <br /> Perhaps successful films were released for films and targeted for the youth market. If it had been released a year ago, maybe it seemed like fresh hypopoonemasons in the desert ... It's a very interesting movie, Antonioniun dramatically performed plays, love in the desert, stagnant. from the palace of the desert and at the end of the explosive ... the carrier did not help the two amateurs. They were beautiful, but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is a bit better than Daria Halprin. It would be much better for the good actors! Perhaps Michelle Phillips or Jessica Lange ... The conversation is really fun and poetic, so you do not know how to give lines ... <br /> <br /> Very deep document at the end of the sixties They deserved the look of the photography and the soundtrack.
