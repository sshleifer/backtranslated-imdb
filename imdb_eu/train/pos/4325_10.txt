This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of a classic novel. In the court of the Chancery Court, it is a "character". The performance is wonderful, the wicked Tulkinghorn, Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte and two young lovers. The whole thing is the aim of the spider network and it is an excellent cinematography. What has been wrong with the BBC about copyright, that this version has not been seen in the UK for videos or DVDs for many years? I wanted to know from them, but in front of a stone wall. In the end, I got a DVD copy from Canada.
