If you see Gabriel Byrne in serious habits, in important roles such as Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton, I suggest you look at this movie in the usual suspicions. Even if you're not a fan of Gabriel Byrne, all of the actors in this movie show great performances. If you have about eleven dollars (about nine fees), ask for it online or rent the movie you want to rent. Guaranteed to laugh internally, usually like gangster-like movies. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy is never one of those films you'll ever forget and watch it again and again. You will talk about how many people ask you to borrow.
