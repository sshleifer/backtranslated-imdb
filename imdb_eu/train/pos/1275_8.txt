This movie seemed charming. When I first developed the characters I thought I developed it. This is what happened in depression. A single mother, known as a popular source (which is right), puts an advertisement on her husband's role. Christopher Reeve becomes a town that works with an old relative. Seeing the ad and taking it out to see him. He hired I felt the soul really as soon as their relationship progressed, I found it easy to get into their shoes. Everything happened, indeed. He needs the job, so he does not want to be angry. And he needed his help, but he did not want to get in their hands. They dance around really need each other. Things begin ... until they begin to warm up. I do not like it, what happens. But the point of resolution is wonderful. The story seems very compelling for the time it's going on. I think that this is one of the best "relationships" stories. Maybe younger people will not "get it", but if you are 40, you'll like it. And you'll also like Christopher Reeve's "Somewhere in Time".
