I have been an admirer of the work of Edward Burtynsky for many years, and it has been a pleasure to see him working, thanks to the documentary by Jennifer Baichwal. The beautiful beauty of Bangladesh's fleet, Vermont stone quarries, a huge Chinese assembly plant, old neighborhoods that are destroying the ancient neighborhoods of Shanghai: these landscapes are so fascinated by photographers and filmmakers. Sometimes I thought of the old television documentaries abandoned coal mines and plastic molds in the factories; I grew up watching things like that. Burtynsky's job is to value how industrial activity changed in Asia, he did not stop. The strangest scene for me was somewhere in China in a computer hut - there was a threatening air about it, while the staff were very jovial.
