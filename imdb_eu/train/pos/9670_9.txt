One of the best films ever I've ever seen was Filadelfia's Irish movie Here I Come. I read the play I watched and I love two. He is a story about a young man who is preparing to go to Ireland in America, because he can not live in Ireland. It is told from the point of view of the young woman (it can be seen by the other characters of the film), as well as another young man who imagines his thoughts and feelings, but the other characters of the film can not see. It's a very sad movie, but it's very moving, and I would recommend anyone who wants to think about this movie. I like Irish film or almost any movie about Ireland, and I get my vote on any movie with the latest Irish actress Donal McCann. This man watched gum 2 hours on the screen and, unfortunately, I would see. he has lost so much shame.
