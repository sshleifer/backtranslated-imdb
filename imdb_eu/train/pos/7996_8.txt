Finding (and destroying) killer (and destruction) guarantors about protection is about a guardian body, especially intense, ugly and evil. This movie is almost anachronism in today's political environment. Scott's director does not apologize for the fact that he is behind the dramatic structure of the film. Scott is not aware or has been in social progress for 30 years. I really do not think soon we will see a more violent movie, so you can go better while watching this. Despite the disgusting, I think that the movie is the strongest example of cinema, its most malicious, exploitative and effective. Scott sells hard, but I think I'm the buyer. The extraordinary technical aspect of this movie is very effective for me. Scott's managerial options are just amazing and Denzel Washington's great performance. Sensitive souls have to be far away, but I recommend that you take a great shot at watching audiences.
