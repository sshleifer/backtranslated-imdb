I liked this thriller! I wanted to see it again soon enough. The play was excellent, the plot was suspensful and entertaining, and the movie was nice! I would name one of the best thriller ever! In it, the girls were very nice, especially Denise Richards. He was very well decorated in the whole film and he has given his character OOMPH!
