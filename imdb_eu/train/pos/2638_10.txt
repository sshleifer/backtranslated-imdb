One of the best films of all ages. You will never be able to look at LION KING again, without thinking of the story that adds the movie. I saw that I was 40 years old with my wife and two children to work tonight and I have not laughed and enjoyed so much time with the feature film. . When you're a kid, you'll remember the way that Disney was going.
