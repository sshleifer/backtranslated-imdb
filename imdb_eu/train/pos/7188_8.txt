With "King of the Rocket Men", it was repeated in the BBC TV in the eighties. When I was loading a capsule of that time, these two series would definitely go on. <br /> <br /> The first time someone thinks they are stupid to observe, but this is one of the best examples of "seriata". Don Del Oro will make you laugh (My little nickname was the head of Mr. Dustbin) and it was fun to say that he was shooting "Do not harm me your bullet", then he's less than happy to see it back. I like the way in which Sebastian sent the first part. <br /> <br /> I saw again so many years of good memories, good stunts and good music, it has ingredients. If you waited, for example, water, rocks, tipping carts ... As well as the first episode (together with Ralph Faulkner) I remembered the sword as hardly as good as it was, and the inevitable "flashback" too! 10 to 10 continues due to slow pace, padding and other trick. If you're interested in these movies I'd recommend William Witney's book, "Door, fight, door pulling, behind", although there is a small introduction to this series.
