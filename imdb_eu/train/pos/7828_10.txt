This film will be shown to the university students in the speech and the media, since their lessons are timeless: why talking is an issue against injustice and that it can lead to changes that the oppressed seeks. Why press freedom and freedom of expression are essential in democracy. Steven Biko and Donald Woods's journalism are a fascinating story of the world that brought attention to the world. Also, the lesson of the free speech is important: "You can turn the candle on, but you can not turn on the fire. When the cat starts, the wind will be high." (From Peter Gabriel to Biko from "Tree Shake").
