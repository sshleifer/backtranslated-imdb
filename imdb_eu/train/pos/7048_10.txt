The plot of this movie may not be amazing, but being really special is the protagonist (and, of course, the actors that play it!). I will not go into the movie details, but I would definitely say that? This movie is not for everyone! The movie is really emotional and you need to be as light as the satire. If you did not warn the second one, you probably need one of the finer points. The film is filled with seemingly trivial but spiritual things: advertisements on the back of Turaqistan, ads on containers (which are almost lost) and these are hilarious movies. <br /> </ p> <p> To go to the actors, John Cusack has played a part in its multi-faceted role (what was the writer and producer together) and he played his character? Hauser, heartfelt killer? refinement Cusack did a similar role before Grosse Pointe Blank, but the movie's comic elegance is superb. <br /> <br /> However, the actress who robs all the shows Hilary Duff! I have always had Mrs. Duff. But I was honest I was a bit disappointed when I heard the roles playing in the movie. But after watching the movie, the actor gave a great respect to his actor. Let's see! The baby is growing, but its talent! Hilary could not escape all the critics who fled it for a while. Hilary played a very complex character? hard outside, still sweet child inside? and he has done justice to himself. Does it make you laugh and weep? To cut a long story short (I always owe it to myself) BRILLIANT! Marisa Tomei and Joan Cusack also worked well. Especially, John's hysteria is wonderful! However, it was pretty bad for Ben Kingsley to divert me, and his behavior seemed a bit like it. <br /> <br /> Generally, War, Inc. keeps us on your toes with its humor, and ends with the amount that is right for the plot. I would highly recommend this movie to all (and even for fans of Hilary Duff) !!! PD - I'm really glad that the movie will be released shortly after its limited release and other places !!!
