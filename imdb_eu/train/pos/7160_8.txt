The Disney movie that dares to do something different would have to give a least effort. "Zuloak" does not make the same mistakes as the Disney movie about teenage troubadours that will be set up in a camp. For the first time, events are not explained in detail. The flashback scene has a purpose and presents some mature themes that can surprise the audience. I must admit at first I diverted the seriousness of the film. But I soon found out to see the beauty of the story we had to endure at that time. In addition to the story, this film also works well to question some of the methods used in the installation. (For example, Caveman is forbidden to read because he has to make zero reading holes to build the character, learning to read is not such a contribution). "Hole" is a stylish and beautiful movie. Need to see it!
