I've been saying this comment for years, I thought it was a commercial John Ford product, especially with Victor McLaglen. Ford has the same mood as the house that links his films. <br /> <br /> I learned for my surprise that George Stevens really guessed it. However, I do not believe that this movie was not offered to John Ford, but he probably started building Monument Valley in Stagecoach. <br /> <br /> Victor McLagen, along with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., play three. Indian Army sergeants with friend / friend / friends. But the old team is breaking out, according to Fairbanks, he commits himself to marry Joan Fontaine. Gunga Din, a companion who can help the beast regiment, help, help, and help Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> Rudyard Kipling's poem was an inspiration for the RKO film about the British Raj Quarter. . Move the comic game so good that it's a horrible racist message from the movie. It was not responsible that it was racist, but it was at that time that the British was acquitted; including our challenges, and Gunga Din shows this effectively. There, local authorities, as a result of a weak Mogul emperor, in the 19th century. It was disappeared in the middle of the 20th century. They determined very little from India, that would be impossible. The authority they have here is subject to the troop you see here. Note that the soldier can not rise above the body level and the status of Gunga Din is much lower than that. There are many tensions in this religion that are in the Christian sects and this devastating worship is quite real. I do not know because, although they are suffering, they may not be seen as liberators. But until the independence of India was organized until the Congress Party was formed, these people were the voice of India's freedom. <br /> <br /> But if you waste it, overwhelming people is not a pleasant thing. And the British also intended them. When I see Gunga Din, I think that Star Trek and the main directives were created. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant took her real kukute instead of the city of Cary that we are seeing here. . Fairbanks and McLaglen play very well with roles that match their personalities. <br /> <br /> The best actor in the film is Eduard Ciannelli, the head of the worshipers. Note that in the fire and passion operation, the rest are out of the screen. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din's favorite scene Ciannelli exhorts her troops in her mountain temple. Note that Stevens' backslash on Ciannelli obscures everything you see until you see eyes and teeth like a Halloween mask. Haunting, terrifying and very effective. <br /> <br /> After the action of this film, XIX. The beginning of the century began to question the underlying hypotheses that increasingly impeded the British public to Raj. But that is Gandhi's theme. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din is an excellent yet fun, funny movie. You should show it with the India and Gandhi passport, and how you can make the Indian independence movement evolve.
