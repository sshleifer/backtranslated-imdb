Sci-Fi is a very special animated film, and I really like the specialty, as it is better or worse. This French film is very interesting to watch, the technique is an innovative part, as I saw recently "Waking Life". <br /> <br /> I have had a long time to get acquainted with the Black-White style, but in the end I love it, the drafts are really fancy! The world of the contracted future is very much like the ultimate symbol of the human being. <br /> <br /> The whole land is suitable for a Sci-Fi, it's not so interesting but it's okay, just like some Hollywood products. The giant conspiracy on man's eternity, a little cliche and the wrong ending is less persuasive, some developments are very ordinary and crazy, and the whole movie is long. So I think that in love with the style of this film, others are not so good. <br /> <br /> With regard to life eternity, most people have unanimously come to us because we do not want eternity to disappear. The meaning of life, we raise our lives, which are limited and meaningful, if everyone can live forever, so that the world world will become catastrophe and chaos. You love someone who loves you and it is tough, but that is also a way of showing that our lives are genuine, and all emotions fulfill our lives and transform the world into a colorful and intense way.
