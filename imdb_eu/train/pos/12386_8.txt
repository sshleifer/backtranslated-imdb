'' The Sentinel '' is one of the best film horror films in the world! I think it's really terrifying that it's really shorts. Alison Parker is a model that is renowned. He's got a lawyer named Michael Lerman, and he's got a better friend, another model named Jennifer. Everything has been very good in his life, he decided to spend some time alone and rent a beautiful and old apartment. <br /> <br /> There are problems for neighbors, very rare. Suddenly, Alison begins to cause health problems and often begins; She remembers the painful events of her past and can have nightmares or illusions. But everything has a reason, and it is linked to the new home that lives ... <br /> <br /> I've personally found 'The Sentinel', very awesome films and '' Exorcist '' They are one of the most watched movies I've ever seen. . Alison's house only takes on the priest when he realizes that he has frozen my blood! It is terribly hard to see that the movie should become blind at the end of the day so that our monsters can be guarded away from our world.
