"Once in life" is a very good movie. However, it is not good for all, the widespread use of common language and the violence of some situations. The film depicts an anecdotal and compelling way in NYC neighborhoods, as drug problems are important. This image is also used as a decoration between powerful and suspensory dialogues for a drama that supports powerful conversations (but it was difficult to understand some of them because English is not my native language. The video is fine). Sometimes it's a bit too much, but I think that it is well-suited to the general guidance given by Fishburne, which is a reflection, as well as a good style exercise, especially in time / action management. The characters, though not easy, are easy to link and the actors work beautifully by depicting them. By the way, I enjoyed the music band (B. Marsalis). Undoubtedly, you can watch this movie twice and again. I rated the 9/10 movie.
