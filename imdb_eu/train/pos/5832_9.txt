Since I saw this film, more than 30 years ago, I never got tired of seeing it. From the opening of the horn factory, from the back seat of the car, and in response to the phone, and having stolen from the window with Stan, I think maybe the last movie was the best. After that, they went to 20th Century Fox and these movies were not great, the comic time of this movie was missing. Jimmy Finnlayson, his long-time role, when he looked up to the boys, appeared as a Super Doctor! quote: "I said goat's milk" Stan asks him how he's waking up a ghost! Charlie Hall and Ben Turpin have also appeared! Anyway, I would like to say one of the favorite comedies of L & H.
