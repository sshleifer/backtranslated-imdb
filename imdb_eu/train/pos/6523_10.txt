Of course, the history of this film was "holandised" - but there is only one part of the history written for these masses. Lafitt was united to the Americans, who believed he was French, and hated Britons; There was no patriotism in New Orleans recently because of the richness of a nation; He broke his agreement and returned to the smuggling, which traveled to Galveston; It was a little crime or cheeky * or horny than a hero. But who cares? This is a movie that is purely entertaining, rather than dealing with Jean, as a whole, rather than the governor's wise little daughter. Brynner is writing again to be fascinating.
