This series has never been the best Britcom ever, and that's a lot to say, considering the competitors (Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbors, two). <br /> <br /> What makes Butterflies so excellent, even the best, is the best example of superb, classic, classy and intelligent comedy, but also expanding borders, reflecting - flawless, smoothly and in every detail - Great social change in Britain. time <br /> <br /> I remember this show as a teenager and I was afraid of it. The drawn life was obviously outstanding. I saw the real people who used wireless phones. And the cabinet of all the characters was far away from the gloomy wardrobe that was seen in North America in the 70s. Then they were decorated, there were store-front and cars. These people, even their children, were philosophical approaches to philosophical life and epigramm humor. In the coming decade (1980s) there were examples of "European news" that could affect life and style throughout the world. <br /> <br /> Of course, the premise was strange and wonderful. The dream of the suburb was a revolutionary idea that was so distressing and unstoppable, especially for North Americans who happily defined money and things as always (probably in the American state of cinema and television, but not with the intensity of Butterflies or Montenegro film). And, if the premise was not surprising, the means they indicated were taken to the extreme. Does the potential affair with sex or even love? Many butterflies were fascinated, but some people were suddenly horrified by people, however, at that time. <br /> <br /> Butterflies were prophetic ... in many ways - prophetic. It is the result of the modern documentary of that time, a completely pervasive lifestyle, the notion of emotional disloyalty, and the disengagement of generations and male dissatisfaction (through the intimate relationships between father and son fully depicted). It is very bad that the series was not found, and everyone involved took on the creation of a significant picture of a specific time and place, and predicted the darkness and severity that was coming in the future.
