This movie is awesome, but that's why you need to watch it. I'm not here to discuss the whole movie, the biggest scene of harassment ever. When Eddie Tim wakes up, he goes down the corridor. Eddie breaks down the barrier with fun consequences (a trumpet player covers a dashboard, sees a slow and slow purchase of the DVD). The best obstacle is removed from the door mop that drops out of a toy, but it goes out the door on the floor. But the slide is quicker to challenge physics (especially friction); However, the one behind the door is the supreme one. The steepest in any school, this sport is CLEAR in the air. Actually, he would probably kill his neck. Not only does all the concepts of reality, but the funniest noise ever made in that situation. Go and buy this. Believe me this scene deserves $ 6.
