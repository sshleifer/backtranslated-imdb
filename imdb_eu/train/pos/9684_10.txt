This movie brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to reach the hearts of the audience, directing Paulie with this wonderful image that he sees through the mind and the heart. We know from time to time, accompanied by sensitive and talented directors like John, the little creatures like Paulie also have heart. I could not stop my tears, even if the movie was happy. It's a good thing, when I saw thousands of movies throughout my life, "Paulie" really felt me. That is, after the "Ugly Duckling", the second image was going upside down.
