This movie was recently seen in a theater in France. Unfortunately he came and went, but I liked the beauty of landscape photography and the footage of marvelous fauna. (The story is nice, but it's unexpected. If you really thought it would not happen what happened in real life). I saw it again tonight, here in the State, on the DVD. Again, I think the distribution is very limited. Blockbusters had only one copy and I never remember playing Cleveland's art centers. <br /> <br /> Looking at my TV, photography is not surprising, but still very beautiful. Animal footage is still wonderful. The story of a relationship between the 10-year-old son and fox is not convincing for the second time, you know where he is. <br /> <br /> Still, as I said, the story is unexpected. It's a beautiful movie to watch, and if you want to foam the footage, you need to be fascinated.
