This is a strange movie for me, after reviewing a nice movie by a new filmmaker (FAR OUT by Phil Mucci), Ryan Jafri writes and directed me to another and contacted THE CURE and reviewed me. . I usually do not review films, but what about hell - I love short films and I can not wait another one. <br /> <br /> It was interesting, I was CURE while I liked it. He was not happy and let Jafri know. He said he encouraged me to review, however, by honoring my opinion. <br /> <br /> The film has a great style and, in regards to Jafri's direction, it is extraordinary, especially for this inexperienced maker (its first movie). The combination of brilliant colors, steps and music, which suited the cinema, felt the atmosphere. You've really entered the movie, and that's it. However, I did not love to write a love. Although the basic idea was great, the end was pretty easy to predict. I'd really like to finish it, as if it had been one or more surprises as an unexpected tour. However, given that this movie is about to give its professional experience to someone who does not have a professional film, it is well in the future. Well done
