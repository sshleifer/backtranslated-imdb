Winchester '73 is a great story, and I like it. It's not your western one: it uses a rifle that passes through the hands of some characters as a tool to tell the story of those people. Rock Hudson plays an Indian head, Jimmy Stewart plays a great mastery of heart and strength, and Shelly Winters plays the opposite of her husband and western western reality. It is important to note that it is politically correct: they kill many Indians without remorse in this movie. According to current regulations, it is still quite violent. But the story is excellent and it's worth watching. Enjoy!
