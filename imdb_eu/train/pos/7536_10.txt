Pat Robertson's commentary on the malicious person and his bad-tempered program does not make sense and compare what's right. The definition of evil is the opposite of evil. According to the Bible, in recent days people will call good and bad! He does not even know that the Bible has fulfilled the prophecy! If you do not know God and now you refuse to know him, that's fine. He still loves you, but when you approach the knee to him, and if you want, it will be too late for you. God sends no one to hell, no one! You will go along with your decision and define it by your spewing! God will be mercy for you and experience the Way of Damascus. The Club with 700 Clubs and Pat Robertson is one of the reasons I'm still in. Alcoholism, adultery, and probably on the edge of death, God pulled out of the TV screen and used Pat Robertson, and thank God! You have the right to say what you have right, but you do not have the right to curse your words. God pity you.
