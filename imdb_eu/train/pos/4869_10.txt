There are no headless people or veins without bloodshed in the Balkans. If you do not have one of them, you can not understand it. And if you do not understand, you can not enjoy it. :) For example, if you think the name of a car created by Picasso Citroen, surely if you see Picasso's paintings, you will simply walk to decide which works of street painters are. :) So do not judge it, before trying to understand it :) I end up thinking that all people have open minds. Still N1 remains my Shawshank Redemption! Remember that all things can be placed in frames. Because there are some things in this world, any frame does not fit in.
