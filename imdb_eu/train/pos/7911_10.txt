As a child, I loved computer animation, although it was very limited and the tool almost did not exist. This film, I was afraid and almost hypnotic music, I wanted to create things that I wanted on the computer. Full packet, music and video, that is, a two-punch. If you know a child who wants to take part in computer animation, this must be. <br /> <br /> I still value almost 20 years later this movie as one of my 3 favorites. The originals, I think, exceeds what today's McMovies does not get out of Hollywood. I am currently able to rebuild myself. If the imitation is the most honest form of cartoon, it deserves a ton of imitation of the movie =)
