They do not have any movie that they do not need to think or think. The next hour or hour is a very enjoyable time. I was very surprised when the play by John Abraham played the character, with an emotional face, so that he played the whole opposite and successfully, he shone like a comic book like Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also impressed with the 3 girls at Akshaye, because they did not require much talent, but I was especially surprised about the Akshaye's imbalance about the imbalance (the other girl) and it was like they were managing the real person, that is, you can have a distinction between them . A good thing, most songs are good, colorful and fun, so it's boring on Sunday afternoon, it will alleviate your mood.
