Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10. The Creed family has joined the small Ludlow city. The family father, Louis, Rachel, Gage, brother and daughter of Ellen. Jud Crandall greetings with kindness. Jud is 89 years old and above all, he can tell about Ludlow's whole story. <br /> <br /> Behind the new believer's house, there is a path that leads to a petty cemetery (written template). When she wants to see Ellen, Judas travels voluntarily to the family. This is the beginning of the hell of the Creed family. <br /> <br /> When Rachel and the children disappear, Ellen's cat dies at the church. Judea believes that Ellen is not ready for death of her cat, so he suggests that he will continue with Louis, overcoming the cemetery. <br /> <br /> Judek told the burial monster of Luis. Indian micmac Louis is buried with the Church without help from the Church. A few days later, the church returns alive, but infernal. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the two horror movies, really, it scared me as "The Exorcist". The biggest achievement is Zelda, Rachel's sister Meningitis or Victor Pascow, a ghost who can make a mistake that can bring back the dead things. The film has a strange part. At the same time it is sad and mysterious. It goes along with the wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10
