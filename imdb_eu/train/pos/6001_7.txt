It's not a masterpiece, and far better than Errol Flynn, Istanbul is still a lot. The location and the cinematic cinematic film take us to a long time in the past. Errol Flynn shows his past reputation, and Jim Brennan, a past rider, is back when he returns. The photo is a restoration of "Singapore" in 1947, and the story is very noticeable and amazed by the current standards. Likewise, there is a lot of support in this photo as "through movement." Many people have compared one of the great CASABLANCA season. Watching the movie, I've seen a lot of resemblances, but Casablanca has inspired a lot of imitations, so it's worth it. In the end, if you're a Flynn fan or you're an old love story, you'll look like this movie. Otherwise, I'd recommend Casablanca, or Maltese Maltese, a good introduction to "Hollywood classics."
