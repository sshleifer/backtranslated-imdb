This animation is a good and simple plot, which is correct and correct and is an action. What separates from other animations means how human movements are encouraged. It was very beautiful to see the woman running away on the screen from the left to the right, and her movements made her so good. Why not use more rotoscopic techniques these days? It's pretty effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and ice, a prehistoric atmosphere and women are barely dressed, it was shown in different ways to show off beautiful little girls, with a faint body being pure eyes. Some people may hate it and believe that other men's fantasy fantasy sex; Others (including many women) love aesthetic quality. I'm sure I do not care! Bakshi likes to encourage younger and volunteering babies, as it can also be seen in Cool World, and I do not think it's necessary to apologize for much more adult animation. I also enjoyed this animation and I have never forgotten. <br /> <br /> These were special, the standard Disney or Anime fare was different, and that's why it's just worth the clock. it's probably Bakshi. For those who like animation for women, try Space Adventure Cobra. <br /> <br /> I give you fire and ice from 10 to 10.
