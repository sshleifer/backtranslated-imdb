The KELLSEN SECRET may be the best movie I've ever seen in the fourth quarter of BELLEV. Stylistically very different, KELLS shares it with TRIPLETS (Kaw FU PANDA's inaugural 2D sequence), art direction, production design, background / design and color wealth is a feast for one's senses. KELLS is a very handsome (almost Gothic design (which Klimt reminds)), which is generally faded, in general with its Celtic and Illuminated design, but the characters are so simple and attractive - AND everything works well. You fall in love with the characters since you meet them. It brings you all the details of the story and the stroke of the pen and sprout. Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paulek and Cartoon Saloon (and their complementary groups) have made this amazing quote (very small crew) amazing. The animation community is a huge refuge. This movie is amazing and it is advisable for our colleagues to recommend this film. Congratulations to KELLS for his numerous awards, named Annie and his current Oscar rankings. It's worth the fact ...
