The Unseen resembles the ancient Hollywood mysteries, rather than a horror show. The movie is slow, but it keeps a lot of curious images in a lively and visible movie. It's an old idea of ​​young girls who wear something in the basement, but the good performance and production is a movie worthy of the film. The film stands out for its affective impact and, without a doubt, it will not be an explicit action or special effect. I value 8 to 10.
