Personally I could not say 'This is not a song of love', it's an excellent movie and the story is a good line, I checked each time in my phone for two minutes, to see how much it was left. movies <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Spike and Heaton, to live next to those who live next to each other. At the same time, I would like to have more than one relationship. Heaton is in love with her, but Spike Ibsen is not in Heaton, or she does not know how to love. In both sections, the actions of betrayal have a great effect on both men. Both are destroyed, as the others fled and abandoned, at another time they really needed to survive.
