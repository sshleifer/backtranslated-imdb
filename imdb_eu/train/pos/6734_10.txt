Riding Giants is a great documentary that determines the great influences of great surfers of Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta made a brilliant job in the role of the director and was very happy because he has done a great job. Edits the excellent film structure and works perfectly with narration, interviews, animation and surf footage. The soundtrack of the music band adds overall satisfaction to the movie, so that Riding Giants looks great. Notable personalities are Greg Noll's comments, how honest they are, in Laird Hamilton's Teahupoo already with the movie and the end of the movie's exits. Actually, this whole movie is remarkable, although it is recommended, if you have the chance to see it. The pity is unknown, but it is a treasure that deserves attention. 10/10
