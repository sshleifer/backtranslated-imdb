My parents took me to this film when I was nine years old. I have never forgotten. I never saw Elizabeth Taylor as beautiful. (When he was twenty-two at Elephant Walk) Remember that I was nine years old, feelings are not sexual, so I did not see anything else on the screen. I wanted to sit like a puppy and look at him. He has started showing his age (almost sixty-four years old), but I think he's one of the most beautiful and beautiful women I've ever had. <br /> <br /> I've watched the movie several times since then, and it's a sappy melodrama. This certainly detects the beauty of Miss Taylo, the great scenery, the stunning sharp elephant and the best point of human arrogance towards nature. <br /> <br /> All well, the well - a couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video.
