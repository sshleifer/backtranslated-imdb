Biography as a film, "The Lady With Red Hair" (David Belasco, director / producer / dramatist notoriously divorced the story that Leslie Carter divorced as an international scene star) is not related to the Warner biopic. Similar vintage, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (what is it?), but "Lady" is a nice movie on its own - with the classic AND Cagney features. <br /> <br /> It's similar to "Yankee Doodle Dandy," with the old-fashioned show business "The Lady With Red Hair". (Among these, the two films feature delicious theater innings and inescapable backdrops and theater director's offices). Likewise, in the "Lady", as co-biopic, well-known collaborators are familiar. Loving lovers and beloved actors of that time, we work hard to remember. <br /> <br /> It is necessary to add it, again, as "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Lady with Red Hair" does not tell the truth about telling good stories? But she also likes "Dandy", "Lady", which is more than a great character, to showcase her heroic shows and business giants in the lives of older people. Everyone knows that Canyy wore the fashionable portrait of "Yankee Doodle Dandy" with love - but a few filmmakers realize that Claude Rains has done a similar service to David Belasco with "The Lady With Red Hair" - and he has done it Cagney's almost identical breads. <br /> <br /> Rains-as-Belasco captures completely the galvanic personality of the mythical mirror in all its glories. Rains is fun and enjoyable, Broadway once everybody's "The Wizard" is all very welcome. Watching Claude Rains (as if it were to bring all the shots in!)! "The Lady With Red Hair" is a live performance in the film by David Belasco. Master again. <br /> <br />
