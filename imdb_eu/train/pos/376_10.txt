Spielbergen's first dramatic movie is not allowed. It is a beautiful movie about a African American woman's life. It also shows that all films that have African-American ethnicity as a center of history are not directed by an African-American director. <br /> <br /> What I love about this movie is the ability to make Spielbergen. Although based on a book, it is very realistic. In addition, Mr. Danny Glover was superb and usually has only been his only for most of his films. However, it rattles completely and once it's someone else. However, the performance of the entire film is from Whoopi Goldberg. It's great as Celie. You will never forget these characters after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Now, I heard that its musical version will be a movie, and I can say everything: I hope this is just as good as this, because this is a movie that is to be missed.
