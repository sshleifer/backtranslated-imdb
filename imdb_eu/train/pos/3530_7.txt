I can not believe (as a geek movie) 'Phantom Lady' will never be in my black film for twenty years. It may not be top 50 top. But rather than deflecting the film as a non-classic movie of the black movie genre, it must be pointed out that 'Phantom Lady' looks to make it look solid and durable. Everything you need from the audience is the ability to overcome the startling monster. <br /> <br /> The movie does not get cooking until it's set to 'Kansas' (Ella Raines). The innocence of chief Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis) has been condemned. 'Kansas' is an Anderson secretary during the daytime and amateur at night. As a beginner, he works well at night in the streets of New York. Gradually, he will put pieces of a mysterious mysterious murder. Honestly, the movie is Raines and it's just because the movie works well. In some ways, he is able to breathe in a film about a man convicted. I do not know that the fragmented dynamics of a character's character is becoming a blame for the actor or the director, but clearly, this is something wrong with the movie. <br /> <br /> It's as interesting as Raines As a beginner's detective, things get worse in a gear that's really hidden, when a visit to late Kansas's "Night of Kansas" visits (Elisha Cook, Jr.) is condemned to help his conviction. He and his drummers paint a red black town while visiting "all night" in jazz clubs. If you try to describe this scene, an obvious injustice will appear or even worse, it can ruin the scene together. You will discover the scene after the end of the crash of the last zombie. If you have enough DVDs to put this movie into, you'll be able to return this scene over and over again. As good as Raines, this scene is remarkable. The reason for this scene is, above all, I represent the number 6 of 'Phantom Lady' 7. <br /> <br /> Mostly, this movie is soft and soft, with great scenes and a great scene. . This movie is the sex scene 'drum / sex'. <br /> <br /> And I say "Vanilla is never wrong" as the movie is saying. Also, add "Going for a vanilla" when it is a great opportunity to try the safest option to go back. <br /> <br /> 7/10. Clark Richards
