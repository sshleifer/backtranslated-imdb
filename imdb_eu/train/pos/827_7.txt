It's a good perspective. Since the publication of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" ("Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"), claims against Episode II and III have been launched from the original "Star Wars" movie. Instead of shooting older and new instead of being distributed in different trilogies. New movie makers allow fresh insights on old movies. This new preview reveals that the "Jedi Return" is often the weakest of the original trilogy. Often the most horny for its "very nice" bill, ROTJ makes sense as well as the original one and a bit less impressive than the "Empire's backsliding" almost perfect. Indeed, ROTJ's "nice" item, namely Ewoks, is still a weak link in the whole series. Did George Lucas only feature films for movies merchandise? It can only answer this question. <br /> <br /> Apart from this pretty party, the movie is a great circle and the saga's evolution. After the "Empire Strikes Back", Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the Rebel Alliance, continues to rescue Tatooine in his home plans to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford), a pirate space rebel hero. Jabba the Hutt to get overdue debts. <br /> <br /> Changed man Skywalker left Tatooine with Ben 'Obi Wan' Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to fight against the evil empire. Now everything is covered in black, Luke has been confused and torn by the discovery of its origin. Its psychological integrity is not as strong as the external appearance suggests. Although he wants to help his rebel friend, he intends to face the evil Darth Vader again, even if he wants to destroy him or move him away from Dark Side and Emperor Vader. br /> <br /> Tatooiner's initial scenes are spectacular, from Jabba's recess, his mobile mansion and "Sarlac Powerful" - an intense life. The improvements made by Lucas in the 1997 CGI film worsened Sarlac's overall impact, which seemed to be fake and excessive. <br /> <br /> Tatooin's fierce fight is one of the most memorable saga. Luke almost single Jabba and his guests are scared, proving that Jedi is almost complete. <br /> <br /> Return to Luke Degobah to visit Yoda again when he visits the patient again. Lack of Yoda's offer. Undoubtedly, the protagonist of "The Empire Strikes Back" deletes Yoda, just like Luke's fate progresses on the screen. <br /> <br /> ROTJ really is Luke's movie, maybe even more original. He takes a trip to Darth Vader and fights his destiny. The rest of the Rebel characters work in their shade. The love of Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo does not exist, unlike the "Empire". In fact, the Leika character is developing in ROTJ. Solo's character has become his first international first-ever film. The aspects of his personality are very popular. <br /> <br /> Their roles are being destroyed by the rebels. A new star of the recently completed Death. On this occasion, the Emperor himself looks after the construction phase. The Empire wants to crush the revolt definitively, but the emperor himself guesses to bring the powerful Skywalker today (or will it be replaced?) Darth Vader. The emperor is a different type of evil to this film, less wicked than the governor of Tarkin (Peter Cushing), "Star Wars", psychologically darker than any other. When he was fascinated by Ian McDiarmid, the Emperor is just one of those characters that you hate. <br /> <br /> All other actors are included in their roles. Hamille is surprised that Luke is a bit more wise, his character progressing from the noisy teenager, the impatient student's light to a warrior, which is one of the true values ​​of the series. Ford's role is thin, because all his charms and charisma have gone through the first two films - the final star of the movie was REAL. Fisher's Leia is more than just the end of the movie, where he learned about himself, never being sure ... Add to favorites, Alec Guinness, Kenobi, Yoda and Chewbacca, C-3PO and lovable. R2D2 and series are more like a family. <br /> <br /> Although the film combines with the furious forest battle with Ewoks and Empire, it is well finished and includes three path sequences: Endor, Space and Death Star, with special effects that are incredibly spectacular. Music, as always, is superb, and in every situation it takes a perfect mood. As "Blue Danube" worked with "2001: A Space Odyssey", John Williams's scores are part of "Star Wars" folk music, lightweight and vigorous. <br /> <br /> Lucas leaves the interpretation and ends with more episodes. In fact, science fiction fans have repeatedly created their own chapters VII, VIII and IX. ROTJ allows you to work, and due to the dark and fairy-like animals, the series is a good finish. <br /> <br /> To see all six episodes together, this saga can never be the best. Is it already? He changed the landscape of Episode I series. That's why "Jedi return" can now be seen in a different light, and almost 20 years afterwards, they will be almost completely appreciated.
