First of all, DO NOT call a '63 movie remake '. Although this version is more theater-like, it's very long. It was good casting with some exceptions. Chyna Phillips did not have a good casting opportunity. He was almost 30 years old when he made this movie, and it was difficult to believe that he was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but he gave me a little bit of a bit of time for me. Tyne Daly has his role with Mae Peterson. George Wendt was just as funny as Harry McAffee, and showed that he could have a melody. As a '63 movie, they dropped a stranger to play Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch had fun with Birdie's work and showed it. Even though I have a soundtrack and I like to hear the song. So what has this TV rank flop done? It was a long one. They put new songs and scenarios. Even though some new songs are good (like "Let Settle Down"), was it really necessary? Now I'm not mistaken, I liked it, but I'd rather see it in the '63 movie (see my review). Some actors overtoing roles were just one case, some changes, and again, long. Another thing I wanted to mention is Vanessa Williams. Good work with role and music. Give her a letter and sing. Here's a tip of somebody who made a couple of Bye Bye Birdie's productions: if you want to watch a fun play, see '63 movie. If you want to see a true version of the play, see '95 version. Please take moderation. Do not be a hero and try to see everything seated.
