Family Ties Skippy makes this film quite pliable with clean films and metal-related films. The films seem to have responded to all those who feel that the music of the children of the metal turned their children into evil or that caused themselves to die. Thanks to Skippy, he is trying to return a star of a satanic dead metal to the grave. And though the plot is crisp and crisp, it's crisp (for example, the bad green fog that comes with the girl's clothes) and the soundtrack is so funny (and great). And, of course, nothing is playing like a preacher Ozzy Osbourne, asking what happened to the singer of love :). Without a doubt, a movie to make a laugh at more than one friend. And in the same way, do Slumber Party Massacre 2 with double function, that is, "bad rocker" (as in the video box) with a black and white killer. It's impressive for movie lovers.
