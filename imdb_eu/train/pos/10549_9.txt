I saw it at the Toronto Film Festival and I hope I will get it released again! It's a character directed by a movie, and more than Andrew and David are the role. Plots discussions could be spoilers, so I say the line is fast, the play is excellent and the effects are amazing. Well shot and well-focused. The best films I've ever seen, and it's very refreshing <br /> <br /> dark movies. The audience laughed all the time. If you can see it. ("Candy bar! Candy bar!" I liked the scene especially).
