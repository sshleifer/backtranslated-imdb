I have not watched the movie, but I need it. After reading three books by Thor Heyerdahl (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku), I'm actively looking for a copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> The thesis that migrated from Peruvian Polynesia is alive. This crew did not have a GPS, and with a 6-watt output, it only had an old valve (tube) radio, the trip was at least heroic. <br /> <br /> Please, reply to this message, tell me the location of a copy of this video. <br /> <br /> I'd like to buy it.
