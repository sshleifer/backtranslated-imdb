It was a good cast and Christopher Lloyd thought it was a good performance for old movies. It was a great movie film movie, for young people, there was nothing better than good news, lots of laughs, noisy and enjoyable. If you want the children to have no tears bored, the bill adapts. A pleasant child, and it's not hard for parents to see it either.
