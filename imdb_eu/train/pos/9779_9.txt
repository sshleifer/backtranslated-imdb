Three horror stories come back home, but somehow have changed based on members of an Hindu worship cult. In the first story, the former member of the worship is now in a source of asylum, and visits a wise person who wonders what happened to him. The story is as slow as the flashbacks, both sitting in chairs and in front of each other. Due to the death of the participants, especially the reporter. It seemed amazing to him that was boring. It was suddenly exciting with the amazing tour of the story. Things are pretty bloody. <br /> <br /> The second story a violent young punishment visits the psychiatrist for compulsory therapy. It seems the patient has some kind of agenda, but the role of psychiatrist. Once again, things get a bit slow and curious. Then there's a curious twist on the story written and surprisingly. <br /> <br /> The last story about the spiritual doctor that removes your hands from illness. One of the patrons is a former worshiper, so successful healing is harder. Once again, we are surprised. It has a boring scene in it. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful nudity towards women, and a complete nuance to men, for some reason. The stories have been very well written and the director has managed to get every single story with his stunning laughter and the incredible horror. <br /> <br /> Note: German DVD review.
