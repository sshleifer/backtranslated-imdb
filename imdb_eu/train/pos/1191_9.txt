Robert Taylor Charlie Gilson is the star of this film as a crazy hunter. At first, I thought Charlie would end, as John Wayne would recover, The Wayers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur. But the movie goes hand in hand with Gilson, until he waits until he believes he continues to be more Christian. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting, he will soon see that the buffaloes will soon disappear and the action of killing is inadequate. Gilson is a natural murderer who is not distinguishable between animals or humans. Debra Paget, an Indian girl, is an amazing character, self-conscious in that era sensibly. He is disappointed with Gilson, though he is totally disappointed, he hates him. The latest Gilson freezing scene is unforgettable.
