I love the story. Somewhere, a poster has said that there are no families depicted in this movie. Maybe maybe. Everyone seemed really human and disbelief. Good time Which music is great in the soundtrack. What's nice, and what's nice, but above all, I will say two words to recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He was really promised that a good father tried as soon as he offered him a widow to refuse his needs. <br /> <br /> Does he like to make a headache? Why did he do that? <br /> <br /> And you see, that's perfect about this movie. He interpreted this character as the actor felt something he believed to be, and he only did not feel something like ACTIVITIES, and he totally talked to me about what he felt and what he felt was denied. <br /> <br /> Deny happiness. <br /> <br /> Reject fulfillment. <br /> <br /> Love denied. <br /> <br /> Losing your love is compelling, and many who do this are painful. never feel like that again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful film. <br /> <br /> I gave him eight out of eight.
