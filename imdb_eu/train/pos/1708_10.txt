When you look at some negative messages, you really need to ask what some people are doing to have fun ... <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to watch the movie theater in a very short race. The audience laughed. I'm watching a tape I'm writing and it's still fun! <br /> <br /> It also has a delicious sweetness, with unexpected turns of real pathos. The Great Dane is as effective as Wrenchmuller, a particularly effective, wild farmer. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson are excellent. And actors in Martian clothing, although limited by mime, do a lot of work <br /> <br /> On the other hand, look for background details. The film features homage, kukuxumena and other SF and fantasy films. Check out the next March clothing. One of them is Marty McFly costume, another is Ghostbuster. The third is House Atreides uniform and the fourth is wearing a Starfighter flight.
