This is a great movie. It's about a lot of things: looking for a serial killer, the reaction of Soviet Russia, a man's leadership, and the relationship between man (head detective) and his superior. <br /> <br /> The thing is that it is a relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (the excuse is incorrectly written!). For some reason, the movement is respectful and director of the hostility and crime, and to work together. The film's line summarizes me: "It would say something wonderful, but it overcomes emotion". <br /> <br /> All the actors played brilliantly, even though the smallest parts made credibility. . <br /> <br /> This is not a fast action thriller; In fact, sometimes it's like slow drama, but it's worth it. Very pleasant and not exploited in all crimes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
