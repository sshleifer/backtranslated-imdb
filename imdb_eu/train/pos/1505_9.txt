"The house that flows the blood" is one of the best anthology films. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A missing film star, Inspector Holloway, (John Bennett) He finds that the last report was seen in a large rural house. Through the house, about four stories are told about the residents of the past. <br /> <br /> Good story (s): The murder method - To move to a mysterious mystery of peace. and the guy, while Charles draws on his latest masterpiece, is a story full of story by the novelist Charles Hillyer Horror (Denholm Elliott) and his wife Alice (Joanna Dunham), about the series called Dominic. After some strange accidents and experiences in the home, Charles begins to believe that my life has come to life and is affecting your wife. Probably one of the best entries of the movie, the easiest one is huge. Here is the atmosphere that separates the atmosphere. The scenes with fictional characters are really awesome, the mystery around him is very effective and there is always a classic moment. The classical moment is to kill the psychiatrist at the office, despite the fact that it is a great time. He approaches it, sounds crisp, the bright flashes of a mysterious creature and the background thunder and thunderbolt work well. <br /> <br /> John Reid, a new widow's house (Christopher Lee), hires former teacher Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) for Jane's young daughter (Chloe Franks) outside of the business. Ann begins to gradually begin a dark secret about Jane's past, John denies her passionately. When he learns the true nature of what has happened, it is much more exciting to think what it is possible. With the most scenic underground plot and the biggest tour of the fairy tales, the entrance is quite pleasant. The mystery of the family is very well done, here and there are some stacks in it, and the latest revelation is unfortunate. This part is the only reason that works, and Lee does not do any harm. <br /> <br /> Waxwork-Tortured, his lost love, Phillip Grayson, ((Peter Cushing) and his friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) have become two women Wax Museum women The statue of a statue, as the statue takes its lives, finds a terrible secret about the conflicting museum. There is a clear premise here, and it gives excuses for spending a wax in a museum. This is no exception, and it is a mysterious look, accompanied by visible fluorescent lights. The dream sequence offers a great moment for suspense, but the pace that dies at the end is slow. It is a long time that the incident is spreading, and most of it takes place in exhibitions. It is created as a spectacular outpost to the outside. These really diminish a bit. If the conversion had changed, the score would be higher, the rest would be acceptable. <br /> <br /> Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), the actress of the horror movie, Jon Pertwee, questioned the lack of realism in his new movie and buys a new vampire outfit at the specialty store. She quickly becomes a vampire, with her notebook Carla (Ingrid Pitt) and other vampire songs with her home. Mantua is not convinced that he is the cause, he can do everything he can to prove himself in his imagination. This has a pretty decent premise, and there are many options to make decent scares, but the sinks are a number of factors. First of all, they are just too much for their own sake. The final drawing is an excellent example, which is so exaggerated, and that's just daunting. They've tried so much horror attempts or attempts to make it boring. It's the weakest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Last Judgment: all the films are very decent, and there are some small problems, scattered through each story, which is a perfect but still visible feature. It's highly recommended for those who like movies in that era or those who enjoy British horror movies. <br /> <br /> Today's classification-PG-13: violence
