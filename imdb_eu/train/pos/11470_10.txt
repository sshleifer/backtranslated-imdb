Everyone knows about 'Zero Day' about this event. This film was not considered by Elephant, that is, how they saw it. They showed a life of about a year. We like the whole movie, to laugh at them, although I know what they will do. And that feels great to me. Why did I feel guilty that they encouraged their comments, and I thought Cal was a guy. Even if you know what would happen to you? At the end of the movie, I decided to decide if they were to commit suicide and decided to make it 3 or 4. That was fun, but I was terrified of them. Of course. I liked it They thought they were evil, but they told me they were really normal, they did not really realize. But I know they were. <br /> <br /> That's the IMO, the main driving force of this film. We realize that our friends, or relatives, or anyone, can do something to err, and we do not even realize it. This movie was just as good as it felt like a bad one. And that's why I can not sleep now. There is still a small feeling of this stomach. Butterflies
