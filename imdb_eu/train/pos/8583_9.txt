The Korean war has been forgotten for war in America. Many unanswered questions were killed along with 50,000 men killed there. Sometimes, it treats us on a movie theater or film that looks great on this cemetery. Here is perhaps one of the best. It's called "Ryker Sergeant". Sgt. It's a story about an American soldier named. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin) is selected for his top secret missions. Its mission is to infect the North Americans and provide their services against the United Nations. So success is his cover, proving a provocative enemy and Major level. However, the Americans have caught it, it treats it as a traitor and a spy. When he said that he had promised to make a mistake, he slowly killed his principal and did not prove any evidence. Penalty is imposed and punished. However, all his conviction is questioned by the Captain Young (Bradford Dillman), his prosecutor. General Amos Baily (Lloyd Nolan) denounces his doubts, will be given a new trial and if he finds himself guilty, it will be executed. The court is a theater by Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell Sgt. Max Winkler. Korea was a far-off place, but the possibility of condemning a communist and hanging it was very near the 1950's. Due to the excellent script and powerful message, this drama has become a brave classic. Excellent view and recommended for all. ****
