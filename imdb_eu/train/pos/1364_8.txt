I remember Parker Posey before becoming a queen of "Independent" as "The World Turns". In this movie, Posey shows his power as a senior actor. In this film, Omar Townsend Moustafa, a freelance salesman from Lebanon who works on the street, is the one who wants to become a teacher. The support team has a wonderful actress, her godmother and Judy, like the old, dedicated and menopausal bookmaker. Mary learns that Posey must grow and mature. Due to the loss of the civil servant of his librarian, he realizes how much he fails as a place of his life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side of New York, delighted with yuppies. This movie is quite independent for an independent and Parker Posey Mary, as well as other characters from other films.
