I lost my father as a young man in time. So young, indeed, I do not remember him. Over the years I have learned a lot about it. One of those things said he loved the west, and Bonanza's observation told me it was a definitive ritual on Sunday afternoon. I recall the race at the end of the series, at 8 years old when the show ended in 1973. Over the years, I have come to see this show, a long-lost father. The exhibition has all the necessary elements to successfully complete: laughter, tears, the edges of the seat, and sometimes even annoyed you. the original memory of the show, our beloved "Hoss" Cartwright, a blockbuster episode of Dan Blocker. After a certain episode of love, and closing the credits, I blinked with a blocker, and blurred, and I can not even remember my oldest sister. I can remember yesterday as if it were yesterday. In the name of my late father, because this is not here, we love Bonanza. .
