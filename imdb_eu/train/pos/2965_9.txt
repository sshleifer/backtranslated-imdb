Probably one of the funniest movies in the world. Oscar material. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are hilarious and before seeing them, you will see one of South Park's most emblematic cartoons. Buy, you will see each time you laugh. Genius stroke If you do not think of fun, you do not have any soul or humor. 10 to 10
