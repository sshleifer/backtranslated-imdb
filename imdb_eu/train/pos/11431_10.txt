My 3-year-old French classes have always been this film. In a multicultural, inner-city school, the film offered a lot of controversy (in class in French, but I know I followed a lot of discussions in English after class). The most important is the relationship between Protée and Aimee compared to Protée and France. <br /> <br /> I always mentioned that this movie was a "sexy" scene I ever saw in a movie. . One year, 17-year-old African-American cried: "Yes!" When he imagined the scene: Protée aims at what the helper helps the evening dress, while both are mirroring the other in the mirror. Directors use "mirroring techniques" when they want to pay attention to one or more of the characters in one of the scenes in the scene: this technique is a perfect example and "sexy". <br /> <br> /> Most students knew the end of the movie. The subject of several films said "Afrikanism" and that Africans or Africans did not love much, they can not "become" African (as the driver tries): it must be African.
