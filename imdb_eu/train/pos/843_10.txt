Simply, Pierce Brosnon's best performance should be mentioned. Of course, Greg Kinnear is always great. Really, when was it really bad? I think this movie is very little! In this film, the use of colors is very different in today's world of cinema, with all Payback blue filters in all the films. I also like to use the Asian song. He proved that it was really well prepared to think of something like cheese. <br /> <br /> This was my first feature film. My movie was a hit-man movie, I had to publish anything in the genre we released. After seeing it, I'm sure it had a great impact during the process. It was very nice to get my movie on IMDb because I would recommend this film if I liked it. I realize how they connect with others, and I have no idea, making a more interesting chance. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
