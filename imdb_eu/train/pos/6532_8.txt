I think that part of the reason for this movie ... and Nancy Drew is aimed at players who play computer games. Lately there have been a lot of video games based on one of them. <br /> <br /> So, the movie does not follow any books. But the game section continues. I bought Nancy Drew in every game as soon as I got out. And the games are by HerInteractive and "for girls who are not afraid of the mouse!" They are And some of these games won the Parent's Choice Gold Awards. They are not only fun, but you can learn one or two things while you are playing. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see you and my children with my step-by-step, and they loved it! 10 years old. When I thought of taking the movie to my first Nancy Drew movie when I first played, I thought I was playing so much fun in the game. I was right ... not only loved this movie but could not get home to finish his first game and wait for another. <br /> <br /> My other daughter is only 7 years old and loves her, but she still plays a small youngster, but she enjoys watching her sisters playing. <br /> <br /> Games are based on children ages 10 and over. . In all games, pretty original reviews are made and classified as adventure games. For more information about games look for HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So I personally thought that the movie was pretty good and I bought it on the DVD.
