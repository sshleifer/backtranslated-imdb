The night listener is better than what people are saying. It has difficulties, and it seems that there is a genre identity crisis, but I think that is why such intriguing environments and intriguing performances are included. The whole thing seems like a fireplace "ghost stories" to a friend of my friend. It's a great deal of complaint about this movie, but it is slow and sometimes difficult to deliberate. Does everything happen in the film in the field of opportunities, and is it just a real life? So there is no dark ending or no revelation on the ground revelation of the showdown scene. Thank you for Heaven. You must enter the film when you enter, forget about your reservations and your expectations (usually), which makes a good movie. Williams is not horrible, but he finds the needs of the story easily, and he thinks he is generic in his overall character ("Nobody") is Everyman as an avatar that introduces ourselves to ourselves. Toni Collette's performance should be nominated for an Oscar (although it should not be won). Give a shot With regard to quality and content, The Night Listener is probably twenty times the number of movies that come out these days.
