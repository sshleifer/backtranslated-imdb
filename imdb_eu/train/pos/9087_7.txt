A good score (emphasized in "Hooray for Hollywood") and Busby Berkeley shows his visual images in a fun music sequence of hard drive (Edgar Kennedy is a slow patented solution). Similarly, Glenda Farrell's Monas sister has some bizarre quotes like Jonesie. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie is not so good. The rest of the wild bowls and most of the moods are not fun.
