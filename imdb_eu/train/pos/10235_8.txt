Ringo Lam's unusual and very little film. Fantastic kung-fu disorder is a realistic representation of the swords and leafs that drive the bodies, especially in the first ten minutes. A cavalry knight cuts twice and continues to ride his hips and legs. Several horses have been cut. It's very unexpected. <br /> <br /> The story is very easy, Fong and his Shaolin brothers capture a generous bully of persecution and have been imprisoned in the Red Temple, which is a torture chamber in the temple. The general Kurtz has a resemblance to Apocalypse Now. While he makes a different philosophy, he paints with horrors of human blood. <br /> <br /> The production is very impressive and the setting is terrifying. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well done and is often consistent in many HK scene scenes. Sometimes, the film takes on nonsense or the effects are cursed, but it is never enough to ruin the bad film. <br /> <br /> Find this one, at the beginning of the 90's HK is one of the best kung fu movies. Remember the child's friend.
