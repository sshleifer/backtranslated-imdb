As winter approaches, our state company, ABC, has decided for a few reasons for Jane Austen Partial Festival on Sundays. Last Sunday began with a 12-year-long feature film; The latest versions of the three novels will come from "Persuasion", "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park". The strange thing in this productive production of A & E Television Networks, with the ever-screenwriter Andrew Davies, is credited almost simultaneously with the budgets film quotes, featuring Gwyneth Paltrow, and "Clueless", a "modernized" version, featuring Alicia Silverstone and the plot Beverly He was transported to Hills. As a result, even though Kate Beckinsale was the leader, this production was not ruined. <br /> <br /> In general, a lot is lost to adapt the novels to the length of the feature film. The usual adaptations to remember and remember are those that are suitable for the development of the story and the characters. An outstanding example is "Brideshead Revisited", that is, in 1982, he had 13 episodes of 50 minutes. In 2005, the usual version of Pride and Prejudice has to be compared. . The novel should not be filmed on each page, and the novels (often not very good ones) should be shot ("Exonement" is the last example), but Jane Austen's novels need time and space. their full charm. <br /> <br /> Due to the shortcomings of this kind of adaptation, this production is well. Kate Beckinsale gives Emma a blend of confidence and weakness. Knight Strong Knightly (reminded me that he reminded me that he had a tendency to recycle his characters), a more articulated version of Mr Darcy's P & P, and Samantha Morton Harriet was pretty slow, but Mrs. Prunella Scales was perfectly successful at Sybil Fawlty. Bernard Hepton Emma's father was also a weak father, we saw wet land, mud, poverty and inner posh, who believed that this age was completely idyllic. <br /> <br /> Although adaptation It was condensed. In some places, some conversations were quite demanding, because they were in the process of that era. I would have to look again at the movie, but maybe it might be due to the use of reactions. <br /> <br /> If you're making movies of that era , this is a pretty example, and it compares well with the Paltrow version, but it's more!
