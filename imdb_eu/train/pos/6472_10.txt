One of the best television drama in the last decade. During five hours, perceptions and sympathy are constantly being questioned, because it examines many aspects of today's British society. David Morrisey, as usual, is brilliant. First of all, it turns the copper into the conflict with the hero into heavy weight, but then proves it is intelligent and supportive, to show the truth that it works with. I have never seen Surrane Jones. It comes from TV world of soaps. His performance has been excellent, keeping his humor and tranquility, trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of his mother's care. I talked about all the cast members that help this great drama, but their efforts would be hard to challenge the assumptions about one of these characters. Programs like this retrieve the TV drama of faith, and at the same time, it is impossible for most airborne waves to be filled.
