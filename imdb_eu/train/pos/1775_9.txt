I often wonder why this series hit so much. I thought it was brilliant, and it was very written and done. As for the future, I will see it in the light of despair, that is, if they ever emit it. Many young actors of the comedy appeared in the future and things got bigger. Perhaps not only that he knows what this fact is for the public, but also for sending it. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz, and even less, Julian Rhind-Tutt, a great success at Green Wing. Writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are one of the best comedy writers of modern times. Anyone capable of producing comedy like Father Ted can not write something worthy of publishing. If it is edited, I will definitely buy it.
