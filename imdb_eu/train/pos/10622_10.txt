The "hate-minute" movie is hauntingly beautiful. The life of the killer in the series Eric Seaver is a psychological thriller that will help you travel through the nightmare. Stunning performances and excellent cinematography make this film "must see" as a movie student or a fan of horror. The reality of the story and Eric's human difference is separated from this movie from another psychopassist. Some cries for producer Bruce Campbell, "The Evil Dead", adds humor to anyone who knows the genre.
