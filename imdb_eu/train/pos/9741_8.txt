When they were surprised, they were surprised how they lost my friends and aliens, as a comic comic, we did not approach. I was soon immersed in the development of the narration and I was very annoyed. I thought the rhythm of humorous visual content was down. (I mean, I watched Peggen controlling lost real-time attempts to recover much, in some way.) At other times, the protagonist (ie, Pegg and Dunst) was the time to share the main reflection. how happened to events and how to find them. All the characters were well-distributed, in some ways, interesting and generally quite enjoyable. (Any apparent apparent ambiguity of ambiguity remains a good resistance.) An entertaining, intelligent, well-written and well-interpreted movie.
