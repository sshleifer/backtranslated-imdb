As a person who has been looking for a "professional" person who has earned a degree in Business and Management in Business Administration, my mind has always been a modest way to keep up with indulgences in more artistic things. Post-graduate studies have always been emotionally and spiritually photography, stained glass, ceramics, metal forging / welding and art drawing, including silk projections. <br /> <br /> I keep it healthy. jogging, walking and lasting, hiking distance to California and neighboring states, such as Arizona, and Nevada. We approach jogging, walking and hiking to the ground to stop, view and hear, and also to record or record sounds. <br /> <br /> On that background, I was obsessed with rivers and tides. I was also impressed with the content documentary of Andy Goldsworthy, the skill and softness of the director and photo editor Thomas Riedelsheimer. Actually, I could not distinguish the Goldsworthy art from the Riedelsheimer camera. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.
