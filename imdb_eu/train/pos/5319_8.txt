Forget that it's a "B" movie. Forget about obsolete ways. Instead, the Ida Lupino writer and director had much to merit at that time (1950) due to the Hollywood taboo. In my opinion, the subject of violence and the crime was the first film to direct the emotional and mental effects of the victim. <br /> <br /> Although the cast would have the highest interpretations for pedestrians, at least Mala Powers. When he was eighteen or nineteen at the time, Ann, a traumatized young woman who tries to escape his "embarrassment", gives her an excellent performance. According to the work he has made in this film, I was surprised that he did not have much success. Tod Andrews also has good times as some Minister of Support. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Lupino, who works in a limited budget, still created memorable scenarios such as search. rape on streets and streets, and following the police. And eventually, Ann was a sour crunch that finally asked me to be a normal life.
