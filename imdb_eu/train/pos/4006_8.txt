[NOTE: I HAVE USED SPOILER] <br /> <br /> I have this adult friend and her parents are very concerned about sex with sex. He thought to the viewers when I thought about the reaction of "Mother." <br /> <br /> People annoyed her in May (Anne Reid) with her lovable lovers, when Darren (Daniel Craig) fell in love with her, or later she saw some sexually explicit cartoons in May. I doubt that the viewer was tired of the nudity and the content of the drawing, as stupid as seeing a woman enjoying sexually enjoying the 60's. <br /> <br /> Hanif Kureishi, the screenwriter ("My Smooth Laundry" "My Son the Fanatic") again proves why it is among the most telling stories on both sides of the Atlantic. His story is not easy. This passionate, dramatic family does not allow us to watch the movie because we are watching overly complex, complex and often uncomfortable. However, things are powerful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kureishi and Roger Michell (all of them "Notting Hill") have created an incredible portrait of an older woman, a portrait of an elderly woman who finally realizes. In these years, he can and still has to enjoy all the pleasures of life. In a surprisingly epiphanous moment, his son, Bobby, asked him not to make it difficult, May return "Why not?" <br /> <br /> Why not, indeed. Reid deserves a nomination for the Oscar in May. It is subtle, boundary, strong and dull, often all at once. Check out Reid in May, Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) seemingly like a pub's clutch. Or, when Paula opened the front door he asked for the disaster date. Reiden's eyes and faces reveal all the anguish and despair of May. In the most surprising moment of the film, she falls down with May in front of Darren, just asking for nothing for her, only asking. The performance of a famous actor is horrible. <br /> <br /> I liked Michell's natural sound, especially when May and Toots reach Bobby's place. May and Tyson's cacophony illustrated very well, one of the best ways of their family. <br /> <br /> This film sometimes reminded me of the honesty and hardness of Mike Leigh's work. Mother "to continue to float a little sensitivity of optimism to float. <br /> <br /> My fault: Michell's decision to give the first love scene of May and Darren to a slight sensitivity. Believers do not focus, in the foreground, floating the white curtain in the wind. And only the sound of May is a huge passion. <br /> <br /> Michell's approach is a problem, both Reid and Craig, who surround Darren's roles, make such roles unattractive. It's not unfair to hear the audience hiding almost primary primitive energy. Mostly, Michelle is not responsible for burning later sex scenes. <br /> <br /> This film does not love the characters. We bet on May, but also affects her daughter's suffering. But I'm curious about Kureishi's way of telling the people about his folk. Emotionally, cataclysmic was thinking of masking a family cracking on something happening I did It's authenticity and is finally unforgettable.
