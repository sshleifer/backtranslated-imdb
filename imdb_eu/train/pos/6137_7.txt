What is this great jewelry? It's a funny story to watch. Yes, it's a song, but the story is well-crafted and it's very melodic to hear. It was so nice to see; I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end! <br /> <br /> The film is in England during the Second World War. It is looking for a piece of spell that a student witch needs. He uses his rough "magic" to take care of himself and his three children to take care of different destinations. Along with his correspondence teacher, he is surprised that the lessons in the school really work! <br /> <br /> Although at first they seem to be special effects, they will become the charm of this film. In fact, the movie won an Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> The movie is innocent and fun - and it's hard to like the likes of non-popular songs. Watching the character is interesting. Anyone who could have anyone would like to find something about this movie.
