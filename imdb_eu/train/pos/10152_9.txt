I looked forward to what I saw since I listed it in his work. They were finally found on 02/02/02 Lifetime Movie Channel. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson died of commentary about being a "funny entertaining story" for 2 people. Writers probably would not get a bonus, because everyone else made a SRO movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates a romantic movie would see it. <br /> <br /> The presence of the Natash screen is so hot and its so electric smile, which is to say nothing about its beauty, is included in my favorite list. I've watched it on TV and as a printout as refreshing and worth looking. <br /> <br /> God blesses her, her family and future efforts. <br /> <br /> This movie does not seem to be still available on DVD or video, but I would buy it first and I think others too.
