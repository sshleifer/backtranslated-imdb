I did not expect Val Kilmer to convince John Holmes, but I forgot that it was not the pornographic legacy. In fact, the entire cast turned out amazing performances when this movie was rated very little. <br /> <br /> As some people mentioned above, look up the two sets of discs and see the documentary "Wadd" first; It will give you lots of background on the story, which will help you to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> People seem unfortunate DVD because of LAPD crime scene because of the video. There will be several reasons, one of which is the first footage against the murderers in the United States of America, which has been the accusation footage. If you do not want to see it, it's easy to avoid; It's clear that "LAPD Crime Scene Footage" is identified!
