VIVAH is my best book of 2006 in my book! PERIOA !! In my book, Bollywood's EVER MADE IN 100 is the best movie. It's sad that this film does not have a lot of reviews and does not have so much popularity. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is a true accomplishment of the director who is doing it again. After HAHK and Maine Pyar, Kiya Sooraj has thrown out an excellent VIVAH. <br /> <br /> This year's movie is simple and pretty. After CRAP and later Dhoom 2, when I saw Don 2 and when they confronted this matter, I finally found a movie that is so close to my heart and my culture. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Hollywood films like Bollywood Dhoom 2 and Don make films like Hollywood remake. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and the Indian wedding system that I liked very much liked. The system that teaches us to obey the elders, to follow them and, of course, to fill their thoughts, this film is very illustrative. Of course, there is no point in choosing the partner of your life, and there should be a brief meeting between the couple, which is clearly reflected in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie is back ... VIVAH is a story between Journey in Engagement and the beautiful times of marriage. The guy who knows the phase that knows! ... They both understand each other. Two trials will try to love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and many of the marriages that occur. <br /> Amrita Rao is brilliant in the movie ... Shahid is well ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are awesome !! The songs are BRILLIANT. ! I particularly like HAMARI SHAADI HAFTE REH GYE CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Go see this movie ...... I just said a word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS !.
