This film shows me repeatedly. They are joking jokes and stereotypical and stereotypical ones about Eastern Europe have also had a lot of points in most movies. The plot is clear and it's 100% original and you'll discover the whole movie. The only person I was amazed at in this movie was Hilary Duff. It is common and simple that the leapfire of faith has fallen behind the genus "rocket" genre. His accent is magnificent and his performance is amazing and well executed. Hilary's best behavior I've seen and I've watched most of her films. Yonica Babyyeah describes her character as "Eastern European Britney Spears", which is sometimes seen in her manners and songs, "I want to blow up ... ... up." You also feel your feeling, as you really suffer from its performance, the character Yonica is very complex and confusing. The whole movie Joan Cusack laughed at me sometimes with humor slapstick, but also his facial expressions, and so on. The great conversation by John Cusack will surely make you laugh. I recommend this movie.
