This is, of course, aimed at the same markets as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but it is different when there is less colorless spin (these lead characters are necessarily cartoon characters). The story is not a story that has a massive moral face in the end (the shirt sleeve covers), but it tells you to tell the story about "animals". You know the result, but you can not help drawing. <br /> <br /> Characters are much more than their voices (the advantage of one of the most popular voices), unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and absolutely compelling, surprisingly. The group's dynamics are very well presented, and the revelation and curiosity of the characters are subtle and agreeable. You'll leave before you think so much. <br /> <br /> The animation is superb, as you'd expect, and we'll ask you to go on an ice slide. movie You fall in love with the characters, especially the comical relief of prehistoric squirrels and the efforts to bury their nuts. The necessary goods came out, especially when I was eating the toys, especially when I was disappointed the next day, I could not find anything missing. <br /> <br /> It makes the movie more curious. <br /> <br /> Better than Monsters Inc. or Shrek.
