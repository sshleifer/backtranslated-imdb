OK, the movie is stupid. I mean, however, in a good way. He was very stupid and I was one of the best "stupid" films I've seen. Jokes and gags are deliberate, but all the right notes were delivered to me. The characters to help were quite skinny and mediocre. The plot is pretty weak, but it works fine. <br /> <br /> The nature of the Elvira is here.It is rewarding and adorable. Cassandra Petersen has a world of active talent that illuminates this movie. At the top of this acting talent, he had physical attributes, really, surprising. A few men did not agree. The portraits of his image were also the funniest scenes of the movie. <br /> <br /> As soon as the first scene arrived, I reached my ears. <br /> <br /> Very good for comedians and lovers of beautiful women. I wanted a dozen more Elvia movies.
