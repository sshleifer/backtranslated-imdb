What can be said, really ... "Tenant" is a first-class thriller, made with the same amount of suspense and paranoia. It's a short film - all the details seem to be a reason - although it's seldom rational in the plot, and it's never been objectively directed anymore. That is why Trelkovsky (Polanski) is becoming increasingly unstable, with a thin Polish man who has had an apartment for the suicide of the previous tenants. It will guide us in a world of fear and uncertainty. After a group of warm-up apartments thrown by a group of coworkers, Trelkovsky is more than just another classmate in the building; The rest of the film chronicles the deterioration of himself and gives us a deep insight into David Lynch's subsequent efforts. "The tenants", however, are more and more cunning, unexpectedly strange reliefs, beautiful plays and truly awful scores. It's a movie that lives better than described, so get out.
