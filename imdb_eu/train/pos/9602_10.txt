Darius Goes West is an American film that shows everything that is possible as long as possible. This fascinating, fascinating and sometimes fascinating feature shows a young man who never expected, but he wanted to see what was happening in his beautiful GA city of Athens. Dario wanted to see the sea. With friends like Logan, Ben and many other good friends, Darius decided to become a truth. Little ones have begun - Ben and Logan's mother darioten's dystrophy and Dianei Darius to launch an electronic campaign to raise money in the Darius state, to see this great United States. The young member of the university could say that hope and sensitivity has come to the horrific illness. They realized Darius's dream and then some. She has kept her life loving, caring and fun while helping Darius Darius, while at the same time showing the same characteristics as other DMD sufferers. He was a volunteer for the Red Cross Darius - to raise money on his chair (with his friends) in a local grocery store. His wonderful smile tells the world of dreams to be true. All you need is a hope and a group of college friends for you and help you look after you. Give Dariano and all the boys an Oscar, no one else is worth it. Martha Sweeney.
