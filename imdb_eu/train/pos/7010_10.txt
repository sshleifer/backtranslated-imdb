Before I watch this movie, I see a lot of comments, I have a very good or bad movie with everyone ... <br /> <br /> What I want to know is to play Woody Harrelson. On behalf of it, it might not have been in many parts of the movie, but when it appeared or entered, I was surprised to see Will Smith and Woody Harrelson create the "message" and perhaps understand the whole plot until it's slipped. what happens <br /> <br /> I am not a very sensitive person, I think that a good act would not have to go back to remorse or mercy. An event to depreciate shows, there are not many movies that can show from my point of view. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> I agree with someone who commented on "suicide" events. However, I do not believe the movie is "a message". It is trying to send it, but it's "sacrifice". An extreme bit, but that's the message of my opinion. <br /> <br /> This film has a potential. The performance is worth every penny, the script is incredible. From a person who does not like to watch drama movies ... If you like drama, you have to watch it.
