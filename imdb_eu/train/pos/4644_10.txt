Make a fun look like a movie look of art house created anymore. <br /> <br /> This Flick will find all the topicals, then some! The bad actor (Downs-Syndrome!). A terribly heavy interview. The scenes that are shocked are flat. Live edition. Dots without drawing. All wrapped up in a short octopus that does not respect spectators and psychomotricity. <br /> <br /> He gets exactly what he has designed. A hilarious satira of boring films made by founding founders of infants to show their parents what they do during their last two years. Then, "What is it?" He received the Cannes prize, claiming that the presenter Werner Herzog was a rumor, the film made his own films. He supposed the information. Today he refuses to discuss the incident. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch and laughter, that is, the humor that will come for many years.
