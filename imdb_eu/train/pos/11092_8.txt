52-Pick Up should never be respected. It works on several levels, with a plot that is complicated but continuous. Participating players provide some of the best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider and John Glover are brilliantly portrayed and feature deep portraits of character. Also worthy of note is Vanity, that is to say, this should be forbidden in a serious career to act, because of unexpected abilities, and Kelly Preston, who is the character, a few days passes. Anyone who likes to entertain a fun and intricate story.
