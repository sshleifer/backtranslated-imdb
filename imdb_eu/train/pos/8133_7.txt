Well, I do not like rape, but I still find it ridiculous with Black Hat for Black Hat. I'm sure I do not get jokes, but I know some, and laughing was pretty fun when I stopped laughing. I'm a big fan of the Espinal Tap, so I have to check it out naturally. This Is Spinal Tap was a derivative, although sometimes hateful, but this film is still unique, as an original, intelligent and entertaining satire. My favorite: "In the time of the slaves, they did not protect their hat from the sun, so they eventually became tired until we were tired. Now we have caps."
