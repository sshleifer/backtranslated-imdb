I remember the movie when I came out in 1982 and then I loved it. 4 years later, Luciano Pavarotti visited the Metropolitan Opera House in New York (Tosca), so the end of this movie reminded me of a great part of this great night. What do you like about this movie? It's a great music and Pavarotti (Fini) was the best and still looks great. The story is very funny in parts and one of the 'food fight' scenes I ever see. The hot air above the Napa Valley was a beautiful flight and sang the song "When we got up and fell" (when some of Pavarotti sang in English). And listen to the beautiful Santa Lucia couple. Get real people, what would Pavarotti talk about an opera singer named Georgio Fini. Kathryn Harrold and Eddie Albert have been outstanding in their main roles. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I still liked the almost worn VHS of this movie, but I'd like it on this DVD, especially now it's going to be published. Pavarotti is no longer with us, I think the film still includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma in the movie!
