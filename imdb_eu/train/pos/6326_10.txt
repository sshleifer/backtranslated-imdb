I saw the first movie in 14th, I remember when I heard the word govno (sh * t), then still appeared on Soviet television. Anyone wants to add in the trivia section :)) What courage and open freedom, I thought! Over the years, I was increasingly surprised by the incredible movie and performance; but my feelings had the chance to confuse me with the real piece of cinematographic art and the concept of my 14-y.o face-to-face. impression: helpless There is an air that avoids the inevitable ruin of the entire film, immersed in the tide of origin by Sharikov (the best reflections on human progress in humanity in his fields). It is a great metaphor of the Russian revolution, in general, shameful intellectuals. His higher level and lower classes are expected to "renew", only to liberate mediocrity power and to swallow it ... A very fine and talented piece, in a magnificent and satirical way that gathers the sad idea. Symbolically, did the movie itself mark the era of Soviet theater traditions before the Hollywood tsunami? Well, it seems, judging by today's Russian films (most of them are "blockbusters", pre-written! Tracks and posters :). <br /> <br /> Funnily, this govno does not contradict. Efenstor's comment on the crude language of the current generation ... As I have already said, this movie seems to be, but it was not. According to the current standards, a little word, then it was very rude, and a mere rude enough to show the true character of Sharikovs ... BETW, crying at Ephenstorus, is so passionate that he is an intellectual and a fiery lecher. For Russian speakers, where single cussword can mean meaning in translation! But I am sorry to express all the expressions in today's teenage adverts through cusswords. I think it is a problem that is more effective than choosing a support for the task. Well, this movie and the book are a great thought for anyone who could change the food or see it.
