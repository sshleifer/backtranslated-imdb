Who would think a dark movie could be so penetrating and moving? I'm really surprised. It's harder for most people not to see it. I liked Hans Zimmer's score, as always. And the premiere of Bernard Rose! However, I will call it a horror movie. It might argue that it is a fantasy or drama. Well, whatever, I love the potential interpretation. Anna's dream (everything that Charlotte Burke plays) represents real conflicts in his life ... the house itself, the tree, Mark, the lighthouse, etc. These are some of the details that make the movie so good. for repeated visions. I hope that I will find a new movie full of emotion and psychological significance.
