This is a pretty dull movie. Actually filmed realistic performances, especially as a very good Depardieu cad and bad boy with all the realistic locations like mood and art connotations of the house of the house, because the director fails to position the position, stand or criticizes the topic he sets about. She worked with Depardieu in France as a respected and regular regular partner. I think they did 7 together - Pialat does not answer. A treaty seems to be why young women fall into a young boy who is a bad boy when he is a husband and a girlfriend. Isabelle Hupert, who plays with a distinction of distinction, offers an answer like "I do not know"; "I like her arms"; "I love how he likes me," he likes the husband who tries to try to throw him home, but because he revises and reconstructs ... I think he loves it. So what do you accept and expect? One day he will wake up and the senses will come. Things like this have not been answered in Pialate's style of documentary drama, long speeches and even longer scenes. I know they do not add answers, but please take a stand. Jules and Jim, this is not. The last shot, as cold as the one watched, is heart-hearted and headaches for most forgiveness.
