As a responsibility, I have seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I've only seen music this week. This made me decide to play music, without infecting what had happened in music (however, when I saw music, it infected me :)) <br /> <br /> I think Michael Douglas worked well. In that role, with Kasey. I think "Let me dance the scene" is one of the best pieces of the movie, compared to music. Dancers and movie songs are much better in front of music, and at least 10 times larger (this is, of course, the easiest movie). Decorations, lights, dances and songs are also much better in the film, as expected, and indeed delivered. <br /> <br /> The songs that come with music work better in the movie, the news is pretty good, and the whole movie seems to give me much more than music, especially in the case of music with little ornamentation. A bad point in the movie is the cut between the actors and the singing of some of the songs of the characters are duplicated, but the dance is careful and the final product has been more enjoyable than music.
