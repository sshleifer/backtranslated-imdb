I did not know Steve McQueen in 1958. I was afraid that he was very scared to see this movie. (I dismantled the movie "Trantula" at the age of seven ... but I was ten years old). The first scene that came out of the farmer's blob stick, and I wanted to let go of the theater that was enough to swallow your hand. But I stopped and I suffered in each of our monster attacks. I felt a horror feeling when Steve and his girls came out of the medical office (poor doc), and even went into The Blob in a movie theater and swallowed up a lot of the audience. . . So much so that the IT oooooozzzzzzzzzzzzizzzzzzzzzze doors, now it's just a huge one to access through a single. The potential growth seemed indestructible and unlimited, and when Steve poor was caught in a sleek dinner, it seemed to him that dinner was certain. <br /> <br /> Blob was a cold saying, it would be a current description, but in the end it's a better cooler and mentally breaking baby than a child. <br /> <br /> I recall walking home with my uncle Nick in the afternoon, trying to play boldly. I knew they were in trouble, and when I got into bed that night I did not feel Blob in the room, but when I called for the look of the ground, there hungry, heart-hungry. I sat down, started up and waited for the bathroom. Months have been needed to recover. <br /> <br /> I am 57 years old now. . . I did it <br /> <br /> Of course, the drop was not destroyed.
