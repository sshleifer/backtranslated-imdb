Okay, I'll accept - I'm a goof-ball and occasionally I love a stupid comedy. I have a light room for comedies that is not yet sophisticated, but it is fun to watch movies like Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut. Immediately some of the films that come back to mind are MONTY PYTHON AND GREY HOLY, UHF, MY NUMBERS, STRANGE NEW, and Bill and Ted. There is no secret appeal, but only a professional zombie or film critic would like them. <br /> <br /> BILL & TED's BOGUS JOURNEY does not look just like Bill and Ted's original movie, but it's still fun. Moreover, unlike the original, it seems that it really improves its improvement. I remind you that I did not love the movie for the first time, because it might have been a great standard for laughing at other movies. But every time I see it, I am amazed at the amazing moment - especially with Grim Reaper. And, so to speak, this earring is different in Bergman's seventh stamp, you can get it! In addition to being lazy, this film has a great music; It's better than the first movies. In the end the Kiss Hymn is very good, but they are still the rest of the hard rock - if you are not an old death like De Nomolos. An excellent concept for children and adults.
