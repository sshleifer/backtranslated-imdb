The wealthy psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and she feels she's working out to help her patients. A junkie client game helps a young person to pay their debts if he wants to help them improve. Here, he collaborates with Joe Mantegna. Being more featured on the plot would destroy a fun movie and the best movie I could watch "Games of House". David Mamet wrote and directed this fun-filled conversation with excellent lines and keep you at the end of just enough twists. Crouse is a perfect psychiatrist who needs a change, and Mantegna is an evil and passionate man who overcomes himself. And with the exception of coincidence in the last quarter of the film, the film is completely controlled by audiences; and we are infected with love. <br /> <br /> *** outside ****
