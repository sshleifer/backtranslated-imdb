And somebody me. And not just for me, as I go out on the IMDb or the theater. Why did they love people? It's obvious: everyone knows zombies now (at least, Horror fans by heart and others through the "Death Dawn" or Resident Evil movies ...) <br /> <br /> Or at least they know that they knew about all the zombies ... until you reach this movie. And you'll see it in a new light zombie (maybe). This is not a horror movie, even though it has some violent scenes, but a comedy. Exactly a satire. And never end up! That's why I rated it so great. It's a good thing to believe, the play is superb and the script does not make any mistakes (obvious) mistakes ... conversely: it's a treasure and you should only watch zombies interested! If you do not see them, see! It's a great comedy!
