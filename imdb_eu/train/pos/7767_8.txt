Stack received an Oscar for this performance. There was no crime. Surprisingly, it enriches the value of invalid characters. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malon earned a well-deserved Oscar for performance. Indeed, the great plays of this film are excellent. <br /> <br /> Plots begin with a taxi ride, followed by an airplane ride, then your journey continues with a very interesting emotional route. You will be entertained! <br /> <br /> However, this is a great soap opera. Single-sided 100% soaper. You can call us the ultimate soaper, because the performance on the material is so successful. Excellent play, well-aimed, but strictly within its soap genre. I would not call melodrama (such as "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). Although it does not deny the great entertainment of this movie, this talented director and director may also be able to deny what a more important topic might be.
