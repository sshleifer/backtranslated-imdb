We often see films that are not in politics, but I still recommend "City Hall". In a role played, Al Pacino is the mayor of New York, who needs to shoot a boy. But it seems that doing so will not be affected. In this movie, the characters are just as expected from anyone who plays the scandal in politics. Unless you trust in some politicians, you may be unsure if you have seen this movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can not name a specific example of something similar to this movie. It's not the point. If we have idealistic images at the top, this movie violates these ideas. Certainly, I encourage you one. John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer are also the protagonists.
