The film was much better than other reviewers. It's a beautiful family movie. It's a fun part of some time travel fantasy. The story finds a 14-year-old girl finds a way to travel back in her old home elevator. Of course, nobody believes in trying to explain their disappearances. She finds a girl with her age and helps a lot of friends for the girl's family. It also has a long-term support for his relationship with his father. Hallmark reminds me of the movie, so give us a chance and decide for yourself. It seems that it was aimed at children aged 6-12 (perhaps older) and PG or G is much more. I'm an adult who appreciates the "Family" movie - I think it's not another reviewer.
