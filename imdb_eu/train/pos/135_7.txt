This was a great piece of puppet series, which featured all the series from one to the other. And that was about a woman trying to stop the new puppet woman, I would never guess that puppets would be hurt. Also, I did not see any of the puppet sections I saw, and what I had to see was the second part. He showed the blow to things and humans, that is, to become cool, and he showed the return of the master puppet in the first half. They also showed themselves to foreigners who liked foreigners in section 4. That's why they showed them how good it was and, nevertheless, this puppeteer will be a great success.
