This movie is fun to watch. If you like Kevin Klein with "Dave", you'll get a shot. He thinks "Dave" went to South American Dreyfus playing Jack Noah's play, acting actor, being the head of the nation's secretary of the secret police of Parador, instead of substituting Alfonsin Simms's drunk dictator. They died and died. Noah is rumored to be accompanied by the role of his beloved dictator, trying to avoid plans by Raul Julia. Jonathan Winters also appears as an American agent. He also stars Polly Holiday and Fernando Rey. <br /> <br /> There are several absurd moments, such as the body of the old Dictator froze one year and the last scene, Sonia Braga, who had crossed the bloody crazy blood of Dreyfus. It is seen later at any moment, as it is bright white, with its mere condemnation. However, it is absolutely wonderful.
