I've been waiting for this movie for a long time since I saw the trailer, looking like a political drama, with three of my favorite actors; Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. And it was directed by Harold Becker, though he did a different job, he and Pacino combined in SEA OF LOVE, they are one of their best works. But interference at some levels (for beginners, different scenes of the original trailer are not featured in the film) and they can make changes to the tone (they see it as a thriller), although they may not be visible at all. <br /> <br /> What a bad thing, because I wanted to like this movie. It has been useful to have a movie that is still worthy of being a corruption that the government deserves, and to make complex statements about this corruption, not good or bad. And it's OK here. Pacino and Cusack are very good and Danny Aiello is one of the best performances of his career. Fonda is losing her role, without having to do anything, and although she deserves a central story, she becomes a thriller, loses the movie, and the final scene between Cusack and Pacino will be briefly recaptured and then dropped. down completely down. I'd rather like it, but not.
