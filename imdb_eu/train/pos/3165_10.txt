It was one of the most fun sitcoms in national television. It is unfortunate that the show is not among the commercial sites that are really located. The actors performed brilliantly and the show lasted six years. During the seventh season, the sixth time was not great, it was still fun. Season 8 was a real problem. Topher without grace or Ashton Kutcher has failed. Not surprisingly, the other actors were not outstanding if they were among the 2 main characters, such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and Tommy Chong). Show that the effect will be the same. And the introduction of Randy (Josh Meyers) did not help, because the fans of the shows were not well received. I have convinced that the show lasts one year ago and has certainly dropped in history among the comments. The 8th season was a little sad, but it was a great end. I will miss the show. One day I will be amazed to see that the show has returned with the same show of the 80s, because they cast the same cast.
