To make this movie 10/10. <br /> <br /> Today I am a British Indian physician in India. As Beckham has told me, I am a Liverpool Liverpool fan, and I think Owen is really nice. Because Liverpool and Man Utd are competitors, I was sure I would watch the movie. <br /> <br /> But then I was in Delhi to meet some friends and had an early flight, so I thought, "what a hell, let's see the video on seeing this movie", "it was a night-time show. <br /> <br /> What was it for me? I thought I should watch it on the day it was released. I think it was drawing audience attraction using Beckham's name (!!! in my case !!!), but I can not really get a movie title Better to think. <br /> <br /> And Nagra, Knightley (drop a beautiful month), and Rhys-Myers did a great job. <br /> <br /> If you hate footballer, do not miss Manchester United (or England) no matter), then CINEMA is for you, because I'm only 29 years old, with a psychiatrist, but with great care. This movie has been left out of "Star Wars" n-1. <br /> <br /> No wonder It's a lot of commentary about the theater brawls like this. Why? <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie.
