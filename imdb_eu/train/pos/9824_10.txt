This Flick is a close example of the Erotic B-movie: bad pornographic sex without hardcore sex. The earth is not so bad as this; A woman lawyer is trying to prove that she is a innocent murdered woman. However, the rest of the film leaves something he wants. Bad operation, bad direction, bad woman, bad set, bad filmmaking, bad sound and bad sex. Filmmakers should learn the difference between completely and erotic. They do not make sense to have the room of Gabriella naked or have a scene of love. <br /> <br /> What's that?
