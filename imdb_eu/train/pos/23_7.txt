OK, therefore, the music works were poorly written and generally wrongly sung (although Walken and Marner, especially Walken, seemed pretty good). So, in the end, they broke down the fourth wall, and their nobles sang "fight" with the ogre, and when Puss in Boots's effort was raised, the rights did not know it. /> <br /> Who cares? Christopher Freakin 'Walken, a movie based on a fairy tale, sings and danced. His plays fit the role with Puss, it seems that his master leads to deeper and deeper problems, but actually has a plan that he thought before seven or eight moves. And if you've ever seen Walken in one of his wicked duties, you know * that ogre breaks the dust at the end when Walken enters his trap. <br /> <br /> An entertaining movie and anyone who enjoys a unique style with Christopher Walken.
