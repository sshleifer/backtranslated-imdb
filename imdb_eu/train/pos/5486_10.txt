Yes, the cameras were at the right time at the right place. It's so interesting to see how leaders in the US sponsor their country's poor (such as Chavez). His worst "sin" is, in my opinion, taking care of the bottom of the gun. What can be so bad about it? I always react with the United States Governors and with Fidel Castro. Initially, Castro was good (around 1959) when he replaced Batista. Soon, however, Castro began to direct the corporations to the needs of the Cuban poor, instead of killing cats. We are a decent country, but why are our media and government sharing a problem with the poor? If these guys are "dictators", we can use more "dictatorship", especially poor people living in the world.
