At the end of the first hour, my jaw was comfortable with my feet. The movie is never, and I never mean, it leaves the action. Action can be smooth but action. Once again, all members meet. The explosions were realistic, and the return was viable, and the battle was incredible. Matt Damon will be forever Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> I really must say that Bourne's films are all better and this is no exception. Action, participation, plot. I do not know how to do it. I applaud the man who writes this film. If he did not do much work with the first movie, we would not have heard about it. <br /> <br /> So do not watch in theaters, go experimenting in the places where you live in theaters, but if not on December 11, Bourne returns to your home!
