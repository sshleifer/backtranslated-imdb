I remember when I first saw it when I was 9 years old. I wanted to be a "Barbarie brothers". This movie is still great. It was an original aspect that the fighting scenes were very short. It means "barbarie brothers" where it's so good to end those enemies quickly! Also, behind you, you have a cage, a dragon, and a bar brawl! <br /> <br /> Yes, the performance is bad and that's why it's not ten. In addition, the story has received a lot of criticism. I think it's pretty original. Many movies of the genre do not have the same story lines or the same colorful conversations. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this film.
