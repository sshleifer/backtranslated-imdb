This is all the movie, the dashing hero, the beautiful madress of distress, the noble image of the tragic mistake and the wonderful robot. Forbidden Planet maintains a unique magic during these years and does not lose sight of its repertoire (although Anne Francis's sex appeal to youngsters significantly helps with that score). <br /> <br /> Film lovers discover that young Leslie Nielsen makes a portrait of beautiful and heroine commander Adams, but those who are in love with comedy roles may take a bit of their role. Walter Pidgeon is a brilliant and nobleman with a secret (Id) who is also a scientist. They are worthy of another support, especially Warren Stevens "Doc", and, of course, the charm of Miss Francis, as we have just said. <br /> <br /> This film was a pioneer for the first time. Electronic music in the 1950s, no less. Credits call them "tonalities", but those who tried to regenerate the first versions of the "Theremin" device will discover mysterious and horrible screams and screams that are used on some soundtracks. However, Krelle gives the exotic and strange landscape of the mysterious and prohibitive world <br /> <br /> <br /> Special effects are also quite dangerous. I rememorate my fear as a young man waiting for the next expression of the "monster" of the invisible monster, and eventually shook my eyes at a battle scene, which, literally, threatened me with stunts and horrors. Matte's magic is fully exploited in the wonderful illustrations of Krell's scientific complex, which characterizes labyrinths and passageways, guided by the enigmatic Morbius doctor. <br /> <br /> Some remember that jealous measure, Dr. Morbius would have such a toy Robby Robot. Robby's character is very friendly and in some ways it seems more human than other characters. The viewers of Twilight Zone and Lost In Space recognize Robby's recycled section in some of these sections, but I remember that Robby had never had his original "personality". <br /> <br /> I have to admit that you do not fully understand the complexity of the plot enough to understand the extent of Freudian psychology references and hide the danger that we usually hide and weigh, but we have trained ourselves, by means of will, to immerse ourselves and control it to retain social codes . Although the key to the story has been revealed, the Morbius doctorate, led by Dr. Morbius, forces Morbius to deal with himself, Morbius remains unclear. Even when the Battle of the Ancient Age is still given me, the commander Adams, Dr. Morbius, has downgraded Krell's machine, superior to his intelligence, which opened the door of his unconscious under the power of Krell machine. Artificially expanded Consciously he still lacked the power to operate the Great Machine. But your unconscious has been strong enough. "Zowee! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
