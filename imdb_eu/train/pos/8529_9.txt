I crossed this movie on TV and I could not turn it off. Peter Sellers Goldie Hawn (who would not do it?) Is very friendly and welcoming. From the very beginning of the film to the end, Goldie's own nature remains unchanged. This movie was a different relationship with my relationship with the human being, and it seemed very funny to me. The role of Peter Sellers was difficult, but I think it's a great success.
