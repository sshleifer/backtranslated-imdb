As the movie opens, two thugs kill another thug. When the body is found and it is automatically found, the doctor realizes that although the man was shot dead, the plague was also affected by pneumatic - a very rude and noisy version of Bubonia pests! Therefore, the race against time is the one who is in contact with the deceased and is treated immediately to find an anti-race. Otherwise, disasters could explode. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, I know a lot about pneumatic pests. When I taught some lessons in my history lessons. The film did not really work on the right to have an illness about the illness, as it seemed to people in the movie. The main problem is that this disease is very grotesque, since it was not allowed to show in 1950. There are fever and cough (they have achieved this right) but there are also many bleeding black bleeding blood and explosives, such as the lymph node linked to the bubonic pests. I definitely understand why they did not go far. I am also sure that the federal government would have a much greater impact on the control and treatment of the disease - here the film was handled locally and everyone seemed poorly prepared and bad. Nobody wanted to believe the doctors! Concerning play, the movie was great actors here. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas, respectively, are public health doctors and police officers. Good actors but well-known actors in the 1950s. However, in his first film Jack Palance is very threatening (still his original monik, Walter Jack Palance) and Zero Mostel (at that time) is unknown. It was a great palance - very scary and very physically elegant in its own stunts. Mostel made his first hard work, an oily and cowardly wicked man. <br /> <br /> In general, although the details are really adapted, everything that decorates everything is very tense. and has a great performance and it's worth seeing.
