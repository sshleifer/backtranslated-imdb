Bette Midler shows her talent and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas". I am happy to record it and I have been able to see it whenever I want. The public needs to keep captives. His voice is as beautiful as ever and will really impress you. The show featured "Stay With Me" in 1979 in "The Rose". You will feel the emotion in the song and go goose. Shows entertainment, lets you rent a Bette Midler movie or go to your nearest music store and purchase one of Bette Midler's albums.
