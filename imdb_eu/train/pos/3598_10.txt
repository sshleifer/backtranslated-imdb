People who usually do not enjoy playing in boxing, focusing only on boxing, and not what the characters feel, this movie really took me. I could see the main character, Diana (Michelle Rodriguez), as soon as the passage of so many things was so short, it was amazing to me. Michelle (Rodr√≠guez) performed a wonderful job playing Diana, especially when this was her first theater experience, she showed real emotions and portrayed Diana surprisingly. All actors had chemistry on the screen and this movie became even more amazing. This movie is highly recommended for those who do not usually watch boxing movies. 10/10
