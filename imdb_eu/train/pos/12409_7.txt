The prison is not often developed in conversations about the best nineties film genres, which is a good reason, it is not one of the best ... but if it is immersed in the face of the classic films that offer this decade, this is definitely. among the smallest known movie. The film has a link with the blockbuster; To begin with, Renny Harlin is an initial endeavor; including movies of many activists, Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; and, on the other hand, is the star of Mr. Viggo Mortens' rings. The movie is not original, but the line is interesting. After a few years we have re-opened the prison. A man named Charles Forsyth, after presenting the prison governor, sent a man named Charles Forsyth to prison. Of course, the spirit of the deceased does not rest in peace; and when the old rush is opened again, the spirit of the dead will escape to revenge. <br /> <br /> The movie is not exactly Shawshank Redemption, but it builds and cares for its different nature. The main point of the film is always horrible, it creates an interesting base in the prison drama behind. This is a good work because it is no more than a basic premise, the film does not really have a "plot" and we only rely on the interaction of characters to be of interest. The horror of the film is grotesque, but it is never a high level, which is rarely a reason why this film is published, over the decade. The murders themselves are quite good and imaginative, but they stand out. As the film progresses, the legend begins to deepen into the backdrop of vengeance and, although quite interesting, some things are not sensible and a bit of a movie goes down. However, everything will affect everything, and in general, it's a movie that deserves a Prison movie.
