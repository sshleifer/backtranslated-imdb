The British horror film dropped to the beginning of the 70s, but our most popular films that came out of darkness were three films. Wickerman, Blood on Satan's Claw and blood that Dripped Blood have made their future seem rosy, even though a lot of people know that this point was not there. THTDB has the cast that would be enough if it was not really mounted, it could be expected that you wake up in the interior of 2008. Waxworks is one of the four most-neglected stories and, of course, my favorite, Cushing's life and art are so closely linked, you do not know the end of performance and the pain that begins. We can guess how this role affects a gentle and sensitive man. Death and the girl. RIP Peter.
