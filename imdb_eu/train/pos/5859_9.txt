This entertaining Superhero Marvel game honors a true tribute to all comics. Marvel superhero games so lame graphics and poor gameplay that have been enhanced by Spiderman in both departments. Spiderman's creator of comics is Stan Lee's voice. <br /> <br /> I hope Spiderman does what he can do to make a spider. It makes more than websites. In fact, it uses weapons and shields. When the fight does not use the web, it punch and shoot it. Spidey has filled hands to fight with Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion and Octopus. Find an American captain in a cameo. <br /> <br /> Most levels have been challenged, but some of them are in need of patience. The only complaint about this game is so short and it can take less than three hours. If you are a real superhero Marvel Superhero, this game is for you, but do not expect a long game. Better luck "Spiderman 2". My rating: 10 to 10.
