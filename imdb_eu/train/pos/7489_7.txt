This film has strong points. Lucky-Karloff-Chaney is one of the best out-of-the-scenes shows of the circus: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, plus Melvyn Douglas. It has good ingredients: bats, a castle with many stone stairs, a crazy scientist, a citizen who shakes twigs and hunts vampires, a character of "Igor", a beautiful girl, as well as a Burgomeister in a hairstyle. Soft-focus camera work is Moody and imaginative. There is a good relief comic that is well distributed throughout the script. <br /> <br /> But it's not really a monster movie because "Kleinschloss" ("small castle") is not supernatural. Land on the general crazy scientist (which plays Atwille very well) values ​​his work more than human lives. <br /> <br /> Not a bad and shameful conversation between Dwight Frye due to a plot resolution and resolution. But it's worth a look, though it's horror graphics.
