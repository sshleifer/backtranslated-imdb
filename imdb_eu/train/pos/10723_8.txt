I'm reading through other users' comments and I've decided to put one. Some users are stuck in a realistic mentality. This movie was a fantastic movie ... what a fun movie. He never wanted to be real or serious. It was a good time for all of those who knew what was going on - although it reflected the tragedy of the Challenger explosion ... I was 30 at the time, and this one really liked - I loved my young son too! Later, I shared with my daughter and she also loved her. The fun part of the SpaceCamp family is that it's just fun - fun. Everyone in the world should avoid documentary or documentaries and avoid all other types of films. So, for the first time, the youngsters who watched the movie, and then they were able to go to a real SpaceCamp (Alabama, and Vandenberg AFB in California), they found the same type of picture they had expected. the movie and then letdown ... I think that their parents do not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Okay If you love funny fantasy movies and if you do not see this, it's highly recommended! Enjoy!
