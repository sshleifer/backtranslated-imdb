A group of quality San Francisco Franciscans who have been friends from a basic school suddenly threaten and attack their Valentine's Day cards. Who is the killer and why does the killer die? <br /> <br /> My assessment will change in the following perspectives of a movie - sometimes a little bit up, sometimes a little down. However, I can not remember another film that changed the rating of Valentine's case. When I first saw the play I thought it was quite horrible - I gave it 10 to 10, equivalent to the letter "F". When I see her second night, I do not remember what she liked. I can only assume that I was a bad mood or maybe I did not get it. In any case, I love this time, giving 10 to 10 or "A". <br /> <br /> It seemed ridiculous to say that I did not say that movie, but there's nothing to be done. Valentine is almost comedy / fear. The director of Jamie Blanks, who was responsible for Urban Legend in 1998, is a stereotypical teenager horror formula that became so popular at the end of the 1990's, and Scream (1996) listens most of Valentine's songs with heavy cheeks. Almost absurdism is based around nonsense (styling is a positive term). He also gives us a movie full of humorous comments about romantic relationships. Somebody is unusual, like horror-like young people. Most of the movie situations and modus operandi, humorous or not, are related to San Valentin's day. <br /> <br /> Many audiences will probably remove the points that will depress the movie. grounded, but not apparent scenarios and plot developments. However, according to the previous one, the film is a delightful topic, it is not unthinkable and playful. Blanks (and especially successful) tries to overcome the typical slasher slot, while the genre's mocking / spoofing convention also buys the slaughter. That's a horror movie based on Valentine's Day, irony. It is a badly woven fabric in the whole film, which is the heart of the slasher genre, and Valentia gives the first ingredient to the brilliant head. Scream had a similar purpose with horror material, but it was rumored that the movie was "self-conscious". Valentine's Day is not intentionally self-conscious; It must be based on the context of the spectator satire. I do not think the movie "I think they're too much reading," Blanks is worthy of saying in conversations that "he did not want another slasher movie after Urban Legend," and producer Dylan Sellers said. something "older". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The characters, settings and plots of the novel are very different with the movies. Sellers said "although it was a good book, I did not think the story of a movie was just right". So this novel, a much shorter and tone, began to create variations of horror and thriller stories on Valentine's Day. If these facts do not help the purists like the book as a movie, it helps to understand why the film has a different plot and attitude. It might be better to study as a similar topic in the movie. <br /> <br /> The correct white is visually impeccable. On Valentine's Day, it has a slow look, with complex, deep colors, interesting sets and good staging. Blanks is admirable to attack scenes that are not evil and dark, with clear action. He also directs himself under the direction of his actors, often catalizing dramatic shows. David Boreanaz, with Adam Carr, is part of the funniest moments. <br /> <br /> While Valentine's day does not have masterpieces, horror / thriller is very good, it seems to be the wrong idea. If you see more than a thousand cheeks waiting, you will appreciate it much more.
