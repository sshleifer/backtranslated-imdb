We've reached this latest version. I think I saw it as a third and final episode, since there has not been a social comment on American television since "All in the family". <br /> <br /> It was very impressed that CBS would also run it first. <br /> <br /> What CBS means if you mean the 'set' last time - if I came back - I came back to the "All Family" day. Today's controversial decision to deal with Katie Couric's make-up will make her a make-up. <br /> <br /> If you want people to really crazy, really get to know the truth about them. And if you want to pull strings, make calls and remove an artwork - let them know what they know about the word they speak in their mouths. <br /> <br /> Aardman always had a WAY curve before. And this show is no different. To some extent, the CBS's "corporate / social / political / radar of censors radar" was placed on the schedule (maybe "big brass" had never been seen until the end of the air), but once they heard and heard a good "middle" They were right - well, they would not have a long-term message of farming or messenger. <br /> <br /> Now, if 'missing episodes' only came to usenet or bit ... torrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thank you BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
