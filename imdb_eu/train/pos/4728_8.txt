When I saw it at the presentation of 'Break a Leg' in Vancouver, I thought it was a great movie. <br /> <br /> I was laughed at different belly and some cameos (especially Eric Roberts). shout. I still have not talked about the day of the version although I've heard that it's close. <br /> <br /> It's an easy story, but it's especially a character and a state-of-the-art vehicle. The script is smooth and intact, the plot is developed effortlessly and the performance is comfortable and fresh. This film has received at least one prize at the film festivals, which is about 10-15. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended to 'break a leg'.
