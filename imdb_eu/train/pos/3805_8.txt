After watching the trailer, I was surprised that this movie was not included in theaters, so I ordered BluRay. I have been very well and I want to say that this movie is better than some of the major animated films. Of course, it has mistakes but I still recommend. The animation is well-made, very entertaining and unique, and the story continues to look at the end. Some backgrounds are beautifully dead and behind you you can see French talent. I thought Forest Whitaker would not infect it, but this is how Lian-Chu is represented in this movie. So overall, I liked the thumbnails and I hope that all the participating studios will continue to make such excellent films. I would recommend giving a chance and how amazing a movie budget might be. Only Hektor deserves to watch the movie, because his moments are stitch-like hilarious.
