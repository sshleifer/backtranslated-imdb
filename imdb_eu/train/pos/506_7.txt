A strong pilot, this two-hour episode makes the "Enterprise" a great job of setting the characters and backgrounds of the original "Star Trek" series. The "Trek" convention and clown sometimes encounters: strippers in sweetspace have never come out of style, and I already foresee references to T'pol "Vulcan seven" - but the set looks powerful, the characters are well-drawn and you can already see some tips that this crew should have more resources in different ways than the previous series (later?). Scott Bakula Kirby chooses the right note with the daring and courageous captain, but he does not mind himself or herself, and I am waiting for the series to show the engineer, the army master and the official communications (he has no longer a glorified phone operator). !) as an assistant. Writers have picked up a great mistake of "Star Trek: Next Generation", "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager": Instead of starting a large group and having a few characters, it starts with a smaller chunk of characters, and later a bit of a variety When they can be added - I hope that happens, after half a dozen episodes, it needs more variety.
