I love this show! <br /> <br /> I repeat this line every time I see a passage and remember what the show is good. I am a great fan of science fiction, and this show must be the most important science / fiction show in film / television history. There is so much theory in this study about the universe that can make an erudition. It is more spectacular, after the season, the show improves. <br /> <br /> I was a fan of MacGyver at age 5 (now 19 years old) and it seems very ironic for my 2 favorite TV shows. Richard Dean Anderson star. It is very interesting that each character is the opposite of the other. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the movie Stargate, I liked it right away and I thought it was one of the best science fiction films, I heard I was annoyed by the TV show, but I did not get excited until the end of the five seasons. <br /> <br /> Even though I am disappointed to hear them listening to Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin. The trilogy of the films but instead of the studio series. <br /> <br /> Say that it was good. Maybe even better. <br /> <br /> This show is amazing and I hope I will never die. Atlantis is here!
