This movie is good and inadequate; I did not see it twice, however: Peter Cushing is full and that's why I saw it. The best asset of this movie is BREVITY and EFICO. Compared to other similar films, NOT drags its feet permanently, since each of four (plus) segments has a duration of less than 30 minutes and the last one under 10. Good exciting In the first segment, the horror writer who suffers from the "block of writers" seeks to inspire him in an isolated old house. He finds too much when he starts displaying his fictional madness. TERRITORIAL PREMATURE similarity. Good use of the round view: the writer has mental illnesses ... or (as it stands at the end) his trophy wants his wife to play along with her husband's phobias, to keep his attacks crazy and secure ... Does the schematic bimbo survive to enjoy the most fruitful plan? <br /> <br /> In the second segment, two friends have lost a long time in a lonely old house, but it does not seem to help them visit their horror jewelry. The museum once again separated the statue of love that lost its youth forever. According to the gothic museum, the portrait woman is the killer of the murderer ... or was it? <br /> <br /> The third segment was more interesting to me. <br /> <br /> <br /> Fourthly, he shows the actress of the horror movie, which is thought to be the best in the low-budget film C. To find a costume for his vampire fiction credibility, he achieves a real deal. This segment does not even have the strongest first. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Good movie, take it with a grain of salt. It's not the best Cushing, nor Lee ... but it's worth watching.
