It seems we're ready for some movies before. When I saw this movie, in 1988, in 1999, O.J. Simpson debacle (although I have a different opinion about the innocence of people with a very different situation). <br /> <br /> Australian news, if they need to believe in the movie, swallowed infanticide and the case of a possible truth. he stayed behind. The hordes of the mass media were terribly frightening, invading, giant and half truths and lying and discussing the alleged merits of all cases of all levels of society. <br /> <br /> It is equally enormous for the media to explain indifferent and incomprehensible technical information in the case. In this case, I want to make more of the greatest problem of religion (accused seven-day Adventists). <br /> <br /> Today, these circus have become commonplace, but the lesson is more important. /> <br /> As usual, Streep is superb, and this is the best I've ever seen Sam Neill. Aussie accents are sometimes too thick, but they do not understand.
