This movie is forbidden in all foreign countries that I think. The Japanese who played these (?) They were really desperate to work, or we're just friends. Here is the ball: <br /> <br /> They torture three laughter for a helpless woman, they use all kinds of things, eventually kill them, they smoke, they throw and rotate on a chair (over 200). times!), they use sound tortures (forcing them to hear a static sound of more than 20 hours, it's not bad, but you can nurture it). They throw a body (probably from an animal) while it exits from shes and wakes up when it wakes up. And who can forget the great end EYEBALL TORTURE I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> If you do not listen to these movies and watch a simulated simulate it is a movie, without knowing it, you will find it there! (ask Charlie Sheen) This is wrong and people are getting sick! Just like the groundwater. Check out underground fear or a foreign gore enthusiast. If you do not, we suggest you read before the series! It gets 10 points from Gore, blow and creativity, but the story and everything like this 1. A classic underground ... <br /> <br /> <br /> My final grade 8/10 </ br> <br />
