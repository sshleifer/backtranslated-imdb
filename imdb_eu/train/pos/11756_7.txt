The movie did not go well at the box office. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a preview. <br /> <br /> I always liked the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I live in one of the cities mentioned in the film that I mentioned before. <br /> <br /> It's not the best, but nice film on the screen. <br /> <br /> Robin has done the right thing. <br /> <br /> In the first line of the movie, Robin's character Jack's beginning, "SOB!" To be cleansed here to not be offered to anyone. <br /> <br /> I was glad that the DVD came back a few years ago in the widescreen / font formatting. <br /> <br /> I'm not in football. fan or fan of sports. But you have not had to like this movie.
