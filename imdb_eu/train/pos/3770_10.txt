When will people learn that some films are fun and that they are not changing the world? If you realize this, you should be pleased to see "Bill and Teden's faulty journey." Keanu and Alex are a movie that directs a fun movie. "Bill and Teden adventure" repeats the characters in the full screen. It's not about taking care of the rocket, but it's good to laugh, to make fun of the characters and to be so radical stories. Do not expect 'deep and senseless', just hope for a mere fun!
