When Grinch came out, I was excited, but I thought it would be a wonderful movie. It's a nightmare before Christmas is touched. You're dark and terrifying. I loved this movie because people filled Christmas with the spirit. So, above all, Grinch kept Christmas. Then, what happened at Whoville, that day, Grinch's little heart grew threefold. MERRY GRINCHMAS!
