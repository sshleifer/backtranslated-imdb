This film creates the novel by James Cain, THE NEW POSTMAN ALL. It seems that the director and the producer were not responsible for paying the right to pay for the same story, perhaps because of the fact that we were in the midst of fighting against World War II during the Italian era! However, the film is not only the Italian version of the Hollywood movie. In a way, it's a lot better and in other ways, it's definitely not. <br /> <br /> The three main characters in this movie are ugly ugly people. In fact, male and female lovers look a bit like it. The male lead is quite common except for the body's deepest hair (especially in the back and shoulders) and the love of his wife, in truth, is not attractive. In the Hollywood version, Lana Turner and John Garfield are very far away. And the unhappy husband is really obese and loves to go without a shirt and is certainly like the American film Cecil Kellaway, definitely better looking (and surely better than the other two Italian challenges). And this is not a cause for me, in general, of the Italian movie; Anything like Job Turner in the middle of the middle of the party, with Kellaway, I did not imagine that I was hundreds of times. better offers! In the meantime, the Italian wife could not do much better, so the marriage could be incredible. <br /> <br /> Some part of the Italian film's credibility is the result of sex. If you're planning to kill Kellaway, Turner and Garfield, America's health film, they never get to sex! They are pretty stupid and realistic. In addition to the temporary sexuality of the film, it is also quite quick to show that the side of life is seamy, with a sweat, a band hung on the kitchen table and everyone seems to need a bath. <br /> </ p> </ p> <p> The movie is pretty fast pace, compared to the American movie too big. What you get for shortness is not good. The film is lacking in the style and wrinkles of the American film - it has a higher footage, orchestras and quite bad sets. Surely not a nice movie, but a neo-realistic style seems like movies are realistic. But he can not sum up on the plot. Later, many elements of the American version plot are completely missing or shining. And it seems that the end is much less interesting than American movies - and the whole dilemma of human nature fails when Turner and Garfield put each other as mice (the best part of the American film). <br /> <br /> So what's the best film? Well, probably a lot depends on you. As far as I'm concerned, Warner Brothers had just been polished and realistic (though not many of these styles and movies with subtitles could not be seen), but it's got an end to it. The Italian film was much more realistic - it seemed to be exaggerated until the unfortunate end. So, the movie is not very big, but I would like to have a bit more Italian gesture. It's bad, they could not combine the best two films in an extraordinary movie.
