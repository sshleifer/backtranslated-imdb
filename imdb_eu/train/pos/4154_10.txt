It was one of the best times. Sean Cooper killed his patrol car in the 68th year. A prisoner of state prison authorities reveals that the heroine of the car stole the block after the shot. If he thinks he's been corrupted by his case, it opens again. <br /> <br /> He continued to study as a policeman and a human being, showing a veteran war that is involved in forbidden love. This type of love was insolent and was at least hidden at the time. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was not a type of love, yet he had to be a policeman and a man. They will not kill you. It was a great soundtrack (it still looks at the DVR), and especially the use of white and black colors, highlighting an object with color or giving it a dramatic appeal to a scene. I see this again and again!
