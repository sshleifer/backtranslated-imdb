When you add all the aspects of the film - Vanessa Williams is the best dance, song, theater - cast ... her dedication, energy and timeless beauty to Rosie for her. I have never seen a portrait with someone who's so shocking! Vanesa's singing talents clearly show up with all the songs that Rose makes and her acting skills ever surprise me! His dances are so incredible, although some claim that choreography was bad --- his dance skills were better than ever! I would recommend this version in 'Over 63s, although Vanessa's play is excellent, I found - although Jason Alexander and the rest of the pieces are also very impressive (with it). Exception of Chynna Philips ... what did they think of when they were thrown out?) <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this version is great and I recommend all of this version!
