This is a direct action project by My Bush, South Park creator Trey Parker and Matt Stone. They were suspended after a period of time, not due to bad reviews (they got good reviews), but it was very expensive. That's my bush. The average television network is a fun sitcom scam. It is also a political satire. Now, South Park is not so good, but the scam of a sitcom is very fun and it's also a good political satire. He looks like he looks like my bush! If you find the show, check it out. You should have lots of laughter! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10
