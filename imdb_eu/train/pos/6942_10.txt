In the fifties, the reductions in Brazilian film age were unlimited, 10, 14, and 18 years old. Usually they were allowed to be in the West for ten years, when they had a bit more violence, they went to 14, but it was rare to see the western limit of less than 18 years. Winchester was one of those 73, which I think is explaining that. This film was very good in terms of the average. The heroine of James Stewart fought against his brother, who killed his father. He was looking for revenge and seemed to be traumatized, rather than well average. Anthony Mann attempted to make changes to the next episodes of Stewart. Shelley Winters, the main lady was not virtuous, but she continued to the man who remained with the gun. Waco as Johnnie Dean Dan Duryea will always remember one of those wicked. The story of the film, according to the man who follows the rifle, is one of the most suitable for the West. Fritz Lang became a film, but it was not achieved. When he was offered to Mann, he came back to zero and did not take anything from Lang. With Winchester, Mann created another vision of the West, but still retains all its traditions. Winchester is a great movie that he wants to see yet again, but there is nothing like that he has seen when he first published it.
