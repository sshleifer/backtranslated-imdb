What's a GREAT movie! This is a wonderful reminder of the classic Disney movie of the 60s and 70s. It was amazing, after the last 20 years, Disney's crew of direct production have been disturbed. <br /> <br /> This movie is encouraging. They were just the stars of the child; quality professional actors. I am surprised by the quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sigourney Weaver was completely sycophantic * * insert hyperbole * that was running towards a prison camp towards the boys. Siobhan Fallon was a wonderful star. <br /> <br /> I do not repeat the story here, because there is not enough stuff again, but the story is wonderful, with a sensational and good quality. It was great! This work reminds you that it is like being a child, unless it is too hassle-free or too dirty. Top scenes deleted in DVD version have been dropped. It was harder for this film and they took so much. The results were dealt with after the end of the product, but it was not explained in detail. It was the best way. <br /> <br /> We'd like to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It gets a 9/10 ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
