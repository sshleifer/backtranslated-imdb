Karen enters a Japanese house as a substitute nurse in Emma, ​​sleeping and waking up at night. Karen rises after listening to the noise, when he finds a horrible ghost. Learn the secrets of the house. <br /> <br /> It's very scary! Scenes are amazing and awful! The characters are good. Settings are awful. I love the whole land! End! I stopped for a boy who so mouthed a sister that found her sister on the top floor and I was surprised. The movie I have seen is strange. I did not see the Japanese version. I recommend this for horror lovers. 10/10 and 5 stars!
