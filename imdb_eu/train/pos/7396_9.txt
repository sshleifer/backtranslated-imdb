Another foreign film that completely blossoms out of Hollywood's birthdays. It's a story of life and life. No doubt, all the Hollywood movies are not the perfect small life that is not artificially depicted, but real life characters have real characters, with strengths and weaknesses, just like ours and our lives. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Sit down, relax and take your life simple and beautiful. It's real knowledge if only to be learned in this film. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
