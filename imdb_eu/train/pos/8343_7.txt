Fred Schepisi (A Cry in the Dark) directs this comedy that feels fun, relaxing and springing in the spring. You laugh as you watch this movie. Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) Ed Walters is a mechanical car with the great IQ, that is, Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old Men) and Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell their preppy shoes. Meg Ryan (Sleeplessteen in Seattle, You Mail Got), Catherine Boyd, nephew of Einstein, a skilled mathematician but not so confident. Maybe that's because this genius is surrounded. I.Q. He thinks he's marrying someone with a high level. his children I.Q. Also, but he does not know what he wants. Tim Robbins is a cool smile and a cool cuteness film by Meg. I love sweet stories. People of all ages must enjoy this movie. Catherine reluctantly takes care of James Moreland, who works with animal behavior, but is very frustrating. This love is the first sight, a type of situation, between the mechanic and the mathematician. Spiritual lines and subliminal lines! Cinematography is nice. Princeton, New Jersey is a beautiful spring. With the help of these handsome men, Catherine falls in love with Ed, knowing that he is an automobile mechanic. <br /> <br /> Favorite Scenarios: Ed Multiple Choice Test for Einstein, Nathan, Kurt and Boris. Ed and Einstein on the motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt and Boris all free animal research! <br /> <br /> Favorite quotes: Albert Einstein: "Do not let your brain interfere in your heart." Ed Walters: "When was the last time he said" Wahoo ""? Catherine Boyd: "Well, I do not know." It's a refreshing film, I recommend. I have a ribbon and I see it again and again.
