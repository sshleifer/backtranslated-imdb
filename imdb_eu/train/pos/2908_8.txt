An encounter trip, this film follows the life of a family living in a British Columbia town. Lifelong and wicked, the inhabitants are happy to keep up the lifestyle, a young fresh face teacher, who has new ideas and brings life to the mainland. Little by little, his stalemate is awakening, his father (and the local principal school) seeks excitement, because of the stability of the mother, the elder daughter for love and the youngest to seek power. Even though the film is not an incredible or wonderful part, the film is quietly pleasing and the night is tired when the wind strikes. Unfortunately, it seems to me that anyone outside of Canada can easily find it.
