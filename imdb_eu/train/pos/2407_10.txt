I watched this movie for the first time, I love it. It was different <br /> <br /> I am a Christian (I believe in the Bible). I'm not joining the right-believers. I fell out of that atmosphere. <br /> <br /> With the effort to overcome my government with me, Judas is doing what he wanted to do. I call Judas Syndrome. <br /> <br /> Judas did not get it, even though Jesus said that his kingdom was not from this world. <br /> <br /> This movie has definitely shown some of them. <br /> <br /> I liked Jesus enjoying the pleasure of enjoying games and joys with his students. <br /> <br /> Jesus was also very beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Watch-over and over is a movie. <br /> <br /> Very nice.
