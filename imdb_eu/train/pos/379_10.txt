1985 was very good for the movie - perhaps even great - but a gong was missing. This was a long way to convince fans that Oscar had more than one ornamental cap for the best members. <br /> <br /> 11 nominations and not just one title: it was the unhappiness of one of the greatest leadership of the Academy; and before they had given them before 8 years of waiting for the precautions they had to wait for 8 years later, they gave me seven Schindlers' lists, which is undoubtedly not a good one (and a half-Polish). <br /> Do not get bad, Schindler was classy. And I'm not 'out of Africa' (who won that year); but in my mind, behind this, it was a class: tears brought me the suffering and hope, and I am not a cry. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was music (excellent), or cinematic (magnificent), but it's just the performance: Whoopi, all of us proved to be much more than a comedy; Danny Glover, I've never heard before; and, of course, Oprah. <br /> <br /> It's the rest of history; But at that time: who knew?
