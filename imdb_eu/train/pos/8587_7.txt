My Take: It uses its well-known plot with beautiful shows and moments of excitement. <br /> <br /> He knows the land. A innocent man, a US president, is planning a plot to kill the first treacherous secret service in the United States. The secret service agent tries to prove his innocence as he continues. Of course, we know his innocent and the real culprit is by the corner, but SENTINEL was still amused. At that time, the thrill will be reduced to more playful and more sequential actions. THE SENTINEL is a good thriller of ancient political fashion. The famous drawing raises an exciting sequence and wonderful spectacles. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas, the perfect man in the job, is a longtime Pete Garrison Secret Service agent, who is involved in a plot. to kill the president. The former secret services (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) are continuing to find out who is behind the Assassination Service and the traitor. This is a lot of foreign and surprisingly (and fortunately) they are never credible. The script also features a subtype of Garrison with First Lady (illustrated by Kim Basinger). Fortunately, there were not the most unnecessary slots for these films. <br /> <br /> Film director Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.) is a director who gets a good look at the movie. Many have criticized "as a TV movie should be," but I do not agree. Okay, this is not a perfect movie, and many of them have been inspired by other action political thriller and intrigue IN THE LINE OF FIRE or a 24 episode of the TV series (which this movie looks like in style and star Sutherland closely). ), but, nevertheless, this film captures its terrain with severe heights and leaves no details. The performances are superb (with top performers, though it's a script for the numbers. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, I give 1/2 it's not perfect, but not far away. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 outside.
