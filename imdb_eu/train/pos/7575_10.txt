Resident Evil: Veronica code is a well-made video game, with excellent graphics, very comfortable controls, a story and high factors. Claire Redfield will take him to an island to get an Umbrella landing island. While you're looking for a brother for the destruction of the main laboratory. The veronica code's graphics are very good, fire and rain effects look great. The controls are very convenient, but the button pattern is not suited to Dreamcast control, making it harder for you. To.Its still fun around some disturbing places, shoot guns to shoot out. Code: Veronica also has some "Romance" among the two main characters. You also get to play as Chris Redfield, from Resident Evil 1. . The sound of this game is better than ever, for example, although I hate the new feature, when they crawl the giant spiders, they make their feet sound so disturbing and they hear much more realistic guns. story, comfortable and authentic controls Stic sound Resident Evil Code: Veronica love definitely. I gave 10 to 10
