Wonderful surprise of Spanish cinema. I never think that Jordi Molla could be such a great director; in the end I do not like his film's choice. However, the movie was absolutely wonderful and there was no presupposition ... I always like something! The good news is not a lot and I do not believe it will ever be released in the US market. We should have a DVD or VHS, even if that was ... I do not mean much to say, I do not want to break it down, but basically, the movie is about a homeless drink. It's only to make a kick to make the new Messiah and get money (like sooooooooooooo many), it has plunged into a life that has not been immersed before knowing it.
