Fortunately the score has now changed because of my excellent and wonderful reviews, so you think everyone would watch movies, creating an actual "8" score for the movie. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is king before! Before I watched this movie, I did not start talking about it, but now I was pushing the doors of Chris Rock's website asking for it to be taken as a refuge. This movie is very fun, if you do not need this therapeutic instrument, you will find yourself in a humorous way in every area of ​​society, such as racing (prediction), class distribution, love, wealth, employment, dreams, comedy. list continues <br /> <br /> However, for me, he was a bit disappointed. When I entered this movie, I did not really notice a new remake of "Heaven Can Wait", a good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. That's why I was surprised when I watched the movie and, suddenly, I saw the plot on TV when I started to publish it on a plot that was similar to an old movie ... However, in my opinion, I think it's a better version for just two of those areas it covers and Chris Rock Warren Beatty is more fun than any day of any year ... you get the picture. <br /> <br /> The actual movie graphic. <br /> <br /> Do not experience yourself! Do not read the plot! Go and watch a movie As a review of two reviews in the past, so watch it, because it's the fun thing you've seen for a long time, watching it and watch it as a movie experience. This does not allow grumbling costs for bustling cinema revenue. Go see, because it's a good movie!
