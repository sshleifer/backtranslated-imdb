In the afternoon I caught the movie with a female friend. In the afternoon, for example, it is not an apology, but I can say that estrogen is not so bloody. Except for the single episode of the movie, I saw it with great interest and I did not fall outside or melody in my eyes to be self-pleasing. Women, however, will love this movie completely. <br /> <br /> Ann Lord is old, he is in bed and in the last few days he spends on the floor as comfortable as possible with his two daughters together at home. Immersed in memories of the past, Ann suddenly calls the name of a man before he ever heard his daughters: Harris. Both daughters are silent, remembering and reflecting their mother's mind to remember the evil affect with this mysterious man and at all times, Ann caresses herself in the unhappy day she met in Harris ... and in fact. So, all of us inevitably split the young optimism of the future lost. <br /> <br /> Two Ann and two their daughters: married to their children, is a "commisophobe" series. If true love really exists, perhaps even more important, true love can endure the proof of time. Do we ever think that love does not last forever? Do we all realize that getting through the imperfect is the only realistic result? The old man who responds to the boy's response to the boy's death is not lost in his two daughters. <br /> <br /> Evening's cinematography is interesting - most of the films go through Ann. As it is evoked by the past, I think that they were shot in a movie that was deliberately too much covered, a sterile brilliancy given by everyone (and therefore clearly that this is not real, but the past has happened). Claire Danes is beautiful (although it's really tall, it's just 5 '5), and she's brilliantly captivating her singing talents in a climate scene that tries to end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < they meet the most important and the least. <br /> I can not say anything negative about that film, although Hugh Dancy is struggling to be a one-dimensional nature, but in the end it will be a total loss. In the face of the evil rich man who puts an angry face on his face, but in spite of the fear of nothing being afraid, there is probably not much commandment in the character exploration and stuck to them. <br /> <br /> In the end, sir, your wife will definitely cry and probably you will not feel almost affected, the evening will definitely not be a waste spent watching time. Pick up at theaters or take it as a rent when you want to help Die Hard 4 or the next Rambo movie show. It will be your little secret that this conception did not cost much.
