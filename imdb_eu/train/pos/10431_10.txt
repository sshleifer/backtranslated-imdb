I do not know what to say about this movie too. It's just a few films that I love romantically. Talking about technical details or details about this movie would be in the words of "frank zappa" as "dance about architecture." It strikes the whole nail on the head, as it captures the fleeting moments that move us during these moments of life, and then we will not get away from us. This seems to be the Adapted Adaptation version of Charlie Kaufman's version of the movie. The end is open and ambiguous, here is not a happy ending, just a mystery. No deep life lessons, children have just a couple of hilarious and intelligent emotions that make them feel more irrational and realistic feelings ... romantic love. special lady and recommend to a stranger ................
