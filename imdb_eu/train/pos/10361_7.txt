When you lifted it from the ground, somehow, ... after understanding this thing so quickly and understanding that it was published in the end of the case, you're not half bad. . The land is fun and interesting, and it's a quick step, that is, covering many situations, so it's often quick to leap next after a line or two. This really stands out because of acting. The performances are excellent. Neille and Streep are both wonderful. The Australian listening to so much a Hollywood movie is also enjoyable, and even those who do not come naturally make an accent at least. Cinematography and editing are nice, but they do not really go beyond norms. The story of this movie is compelling and the truth is that it makes it much colder. Although I do not read the novel or hear what happened outside of this image, I understand that the truth is very close. The language is heavy and strong and there is also worrying content. Sometimes the jury's drama is wonderful. I recommend it to you. 7/10
