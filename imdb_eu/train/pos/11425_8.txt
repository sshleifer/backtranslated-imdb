The story is about a growing girl in the colonial Africa, but much more than that. <br /> <br /> Those who grow up in the South would be the same. Another that can not disappear from another race. A look is also prohibited. No word needed. Their facial expressions say everything. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a black servant Protée (Isaach De Bankolé), and Aimée (Giulia Boschi), a white woman. The commitment to each other is so strong that they torture each other because they can not interact. <br /> <br /> The little girl, France (Cécile Ducasse) is lonely and passes through Protée all the time. This dance can not really be seen. <br /> <br /> One of the most awesome aspects of the film is laziness of colonialism. They can not get in bed. The world will end; They do not know yet. Their racist attitudes will be erased by their presence. <br /> <br /> I would like to visit this Africa. It seems quiet; Especially at night, you only listen to animals.
