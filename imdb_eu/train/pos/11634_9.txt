On the other hand, I started off from an advanced Redeye projection and I said it was not so fun in a movie for a long time. WES CRAVEN is his best. The summer brings an amazing thriller to the end, I was reluctant to wait. It's definitely the thrille of the year. <br /> <br /> All the actors are amazing and they are realistic and entertaining. F / X were excellent. He began to revitalize constantly. The biggest part of the film was on the edge of my seat. The audience listened and applauded and I heard the enthusiasm in the theater. <br /> <br /> If you seek emotions, action and a summer plot, REDEYE will offer it. Go see
