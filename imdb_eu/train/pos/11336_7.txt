Answer: Although this movie has been written and directed by a woman, any zombie that ravaged your land was terribly, sharper and irrational. It's pretty good than just a great script. The actor takes quite well to give a line of overwritten and topical and think it's incredibly disconcerting. Young Anthony de Marco, like Jake, performs very well. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this movie's argument is much better than the dialog. Try, especially if you are not a monster fan. This is not a horror movie. Even if all adult women were terribly monsters, and if all grown-ups ate themselves in the first film in the area, "Jake's Closet" is suitable for adults. <br /> <br /> The whole, this time, is much better than the sum of its sections.
