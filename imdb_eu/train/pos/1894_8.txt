I'm reminded that trying for a few minutes of this movie, with Steve Gordon, I was surprised at what I saw in one single movie directed before making mistakes. Essentially, Arthur Bach (Golden Globe winner and Oscar nominee Dudley Moore) is a millionaire millionaire, with all he wants, a mansion, butson Hobson (Oscar and the Golden Globe winner and BAFTA named Sir John Gielgud) and a lot of ice cream. . If Burt Johnson (Stephen Elliott) married a wealthy fellow daughter, he will inherit $ 750,000,000, a woman who has chosen Susan (Jill Eikenberry) to choose a woman and her family. But, instead, Arthur's Linda Marolla (Golden Globe named Liza Minnelli) falls to the server of Queens, which, of course, threatens her inheritance and her family's fortune 3/4 father Stanford (Thomas Barbour) and Aunt Martha (Geraldine Fitzgerald). . After Hobson's death, Arthur, on the day of marriage, denies his family's wishes, but Aunt Martha still inherits Arthur's inheritance from being happy. Also, Ted Ross Bitterman, Barney Martin Ralph Marolla, Anne De Salvo Gloria - Hooker, Maurice Copeland Dude Peter Bach, Justine Johnston Aunt Pearl Bach and Florence Tarlow Nesbitt, Marcella Lowery Harriet. John Bentley Perry and Peter Evans Preston Langley - Party Guest. Moor is very funny and fun always as always drunk, as Minnelli loves so much that she loves and Gielgud won the impression of Oscar, Moore's most humorous sarcastic wizard, a wonderful comedy. He won the Oscar for the song "Arthur's Theme" (he also won the Golden Globe) (100 years in 100 years, 100 songs), and was nominated for Best Writing. For the screen, Burt Bacharach was nominated for BAFTA Anthony Asquith, Burt Bacharach, and won the Golden Globe for Best Film - Comedy / Music. Sir John Gielgud was The 50 Greatest British Actor 35 and the film was 53 in 100 years, 100 laughter. Very well!
