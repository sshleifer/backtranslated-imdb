This movie has changed for me ... I've heard of breakdance and hiphop, but I've never seen it professionally (hey I was an 11 year old boy in Holland!) When I saw this movie, it all changed. In my city I actively participated in hiphop movement, I began to write breakdance and lyrics. <br /> <br /> I think it's a favorite movie today. Surely filming and "cinematic" importance would not be significant. But who cares if you watch a large shot of one person or someone who hangs over someone? This is what you personally do ...
