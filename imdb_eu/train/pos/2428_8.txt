As a former housewife, I am still grateful that Laurence Fishburne is one of our best actors. Anyone who appreciates work like Deep Cover would like an amazing bunch of actors. I think this is his first record and it can be even more interesting. Every play is pretty good. If you can not bring down the lower worlds of Manhattan or the reality of crime (glorified non-action shoot-ups) then this is not this film. Mr. Fishburne's usual contribution is a very subtle relationship. Larry and Anthony Hopkins would like to meet one day in a movie.
