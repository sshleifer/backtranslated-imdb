The Good Thing: The concept is interesting and there are some fun scenes. In addition, you can think of other things in life, because somebody knows life without knowing it. It's a small world that shows us this little movie. <br /> <br /> The bad thing: there are too many characters and it's hard to say that it is the main character but still a great movie. <br /> </ p> </ p> <p> It is a great movie and many people compare it with Magnolia. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> It was not rated --- I'd rate PG-13 short violence, some language and sexual situations.
