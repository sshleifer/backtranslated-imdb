Territory: A criminal offense involves 3 mafia to buy an island in a company, which will serve as an installation to clean money for organized crime. To prevent this, the FBI wants to roll one of the mafia lords. The wrong thing is, and some plots and turns are lost, another one "police do not get each other" a policeman with a friend ... one of the FBI is a female agent, and another is a DEA male agent. . <br /> <br /> So far, stupid. The strength of this movie, however, is not in his story: a joke, in the least. It's fun (It's at least a German synchronized version). Action is also good, with a gun shot with a memorable scene and a rocket launcher. However, it is a vision of humor. It's not a smart satire, it's not quite a slapstick, but, somewhere, you get a lot of funny jokes. <br /> <br /> However, this film is contrary to political correctness. Unlawful anti-drug abuses are noticeable, without criticism, and even more. That's why I was very angry at the movie, and I think it's not right for kids. <br /> <br /> In the end, an acceptable behavior towards a beautiful afternoon with some funny jokes will make this film an ideal one. Remember: in this genre it is common to leave your brain at the door when entering the cinema / television room. Then you will have a good time. 8/10
