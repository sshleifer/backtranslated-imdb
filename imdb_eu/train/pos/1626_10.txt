This movie is really wonderful! If you want to rest your brain for an hour, see and watch. Blond and blonde are called, so do not expect deep and meaningful jokes. We have this film and two blondes with all stereotypes. It's a short movie to watch a date or a group of friends (especially if you're not too lol.) Pamela and Denise are still bad. It's a mistake to judge this movie as an artwork. Well, this movie is about BLONDES! It's clear that it's fun and superficial. Another thing, I do not think girls would like them and I'd like the movie.
