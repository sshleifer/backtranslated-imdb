The movie was a sub-score, but this Television Triad has made it an excellent entry for the Sci-Fi fans to become an ideal program. The actors are delivered and special effects (TV series) are spectacular. Having an intelligent, interesting script is not a problem. <br /> <br /> Today's Stargate SG1 is one of my favorite programs.
