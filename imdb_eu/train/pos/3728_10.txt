I never heard the movie, I saw it on the DVD. A great movie, an excellent example of a film for each cast member to operate. It's never overhyped the typical Hollywood movie with the same old overhyped agents. They dismissed the performance of the film as a whole. They recalled memories of war post-war experiences. He concentrated on those who sent the fight. People with fears and emotions were portrayed as service volunteers. They were also ordinary people; Some did not cut their military lives, I remember some of my experiences: I did not say that I can not adjust military life, but I will never forget them - I should be left in touch. I highly recommend and think about current Afghanistan's services today. A basic training trip is that drill sergeants do not have people in the morning and maybe they need "sensitivity training"! HA! HA!
