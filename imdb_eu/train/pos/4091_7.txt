I watched this movie in a London movie in 1975 and I did not see it. I found it hilarious. I love the originality. It's very strange that someone makes such a movie - and it's also very sad. <br /> <br /> What I want to say is that I read a book called "The Black Hotel", and always as a film buff, "picture" as a film. Could you "adjust" them, you know? But when I was reading, I thought, well, as it would make a wonderful movie - but, of course, "it would have to be adjusted" until the point that would have little contact with the book. <br /> <br /> But then I thought, WHY? Without a doubt, it can never be shown on TV on Sunday afternoon, but at the given movie theaters ADULTS, who knows where is HARM? Fairytale, my civil liberties were crushed here. A director should make a literal adaptation of "The Black Hotel". <br /> <br /> In an ideal world, the censorship of adult films would not be EXIST. But, unfortunately, I agree with INTELLIGENT, while this freedom can be harmful, it would always be the rationality of the distinction between fantasy and reality and people who would be likely to make mistakes. <br /> </ p> However, it is difficult to see how "La Bete" goes into this category. <br /> <br /> When he appeared in England, the British censors left him out. The relaxation given to the theoretical competence of the theorist, once again, "If it was a relaxation given in the year 69, he looked for a new job on Monday. <br /> <br /> But ... there was an alternative in those days. He was able to give a film for justification for London, a local council that was "sophisticated" than those who lived in the sticks. <br /> <br /> The film was properly presented and passed. However, later on, the "board" of four people It was made up of three voters and a "president." On the day the voters became ill, so the other two voters and the president sat to see "La Bete". <br /> <br /> The voters thought one, like me, No matter what the movie was, it was hard to imagine, and he thought it was spicy. And the president did not understand why he decided to make a mistake with LIBERTAS. <br /> <br /> Finally, the voter it was missing He even thought he liked it when he watched the movie, but it was TOA LATE! The movie received the "X-London" certificate and the mixed reaction was open. G.L.C. the film censorship committee was soon dissolved. Thus, "La Bete" was only opened in London as was called FLUKE. But I'm happy. It's awful! If you have not seen it, do it like that. It's a fanciful thing, so it's a lot less worrying than you see in today's news ...
