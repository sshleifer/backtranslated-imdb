What a wonderful movie Barbara Stanwyck saw the other night. "Jeopardy" was wonderful. It was made in 1953 and probably was double bill but it kept me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays with Helen, Doug (Barry Sullivan) and her husband Lee Aaker. An isolated fishing spot on holiday in Mexico. Her husband falls from the sea and the only way to save Barbara when he drives a rope to the garage <br /> <br /> meets a psychotic murderer (Ralph Meeker's favorite) with a cat and a mouse game She is doing everything she can to get her husband to return with Meeker. <br /> <br /> The movie was so suspicious and surprising. - I was not expecting a wonderful movie. But I would not realize, is Barbara Stanwyck anything wonderful?
