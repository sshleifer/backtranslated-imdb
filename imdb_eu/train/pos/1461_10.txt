The film shows, in general, the exploitation of Chinese workers by women. He shows the footage of the Chinese business owner who joins a dull and shameless thought, as well as Americans who are shameless and deceptive, oppressed workers who give a voice and of course. the drunk Americans who celebrate the costume necklaces in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> When the Americans of hope are really angry, people who wear beaded collar pay $ 0.10 per hour. Likewise, do you think that workers may be able to escape from a bead factory, but they are likely to be treated with and / or depleted with the factory owner. Hard work 20 hours a day. <br /> <br /> I asked the collar from where it came from, where it was hard and laborious to do their job. I really appreciate the portrayal of this movie as it portrays American indulgence in our society on the other sides of the world we think pretty naive over the people rather than portraying something. Honorable mention goes to Wal-Mart. It's just amazing. And, of course, the iceberg tip!
