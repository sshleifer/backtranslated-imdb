I'm glad that this DVD is available. This film is an excellent example of the style and content of the triumph, the blank head flashed out over the lights and the noise continuously. You must have a short and lasting resonance. You will not like the narrative that you like in this movie. The reasons for this are very simple, but unfortunately they are rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs has done a fantastic job in transforming Catherine Stor's scripture of the "Marianne Dreams" novel. Anyone who has seen a disturbing task in a book movie is undeniably aware of it. <br /> <br /> Excellent casting is excellent, as director Bernard Rose rarely sees actors in a way; they act generously! I know, I know, instead of engaging in acting and camera entry in the camera court, a kaleidoscope of car claws, explosions and fire fires are really strange, but this really is the case. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the ultimate reason, that is, the thinker is an imaginary movie and does not eat a spoon Tabloid reader. Good script, direction and acting, and based on the atmosphere. suspense and terrible fears. If it is classified as a fear, the presentation of "Paper House" is much more than Sofokles's Tobe Hooper. <br /> <br /> As a result, if you like noise, explosion, constant noise. cuts, and bright bright colors you will have the better 'Transformers' watching, but a suspentsful story using a clever and suggestive narrative, insulting your mind by forcing cacophonous nonsense without feeding you, if you like this, maybe that might be your thing.
