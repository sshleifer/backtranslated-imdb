It's been the best fit I've seen my favorite and I think it's close to the book. What is really happening is that it is the casting of two major actors. Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester I is the best. It's been a terrific and tragic display, while Zelah Clarke is as powerful as Jane, courage, shame and bitterness. This story (surely as most people know) is: young and ordinary Jane Eyre is a teacher at the Charity School of the 1800s and announces her services as a teacher in the newspaper. Thornfield Hall's senior governor Adele owns the owner who cares for the mysterious and respected Rochester younger Ward. As she progresses over the months, she falls in love with Janer and puts it in some situations to find out how Jane Jane is trying to get in love with her. However, there is still a secret to be found in Thornfield Hall. and then the effects are destructive. It is a beautiful and well-behaved drama, with beautiful locations and beautiful outfits, especially from Zelah and Timothy.
