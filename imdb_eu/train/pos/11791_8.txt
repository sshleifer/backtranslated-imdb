David Lynch's short film, and David Lynch say, is probably enough for many people. This is your usual Lynch short. Blonde and brunette are in a dark room. Blonde is crying, Brunette talks to her blonde, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> It has a lot of quiet moments but Angelo Badalamenti has a great music. a strange way of suspense. This short "Mulholland Dr." It's like the movie I loved, and that's why I liked it. Maybe it's mostly for lovers of Lynch, but you like this.
