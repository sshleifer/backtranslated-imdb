First of all, this should not be an excellent thought and a movie that is thought to be like many other reviewers. The first review says something like any other person who likes it, he knows nothing about horror film, apparently vice versa. Looking back at the movie, he was not really persuaded, the ipecac was a small budget. But what we really want is because they want to frustrate the viewer with a violent blow (and all its visual errors are much less noticeable in the original VHS versions). <br /> <br /> I have given a high score because it has achieved its goal, although it was not terribly terribly (in a sense of illness) it made me sick and totally paralytic / pessimistic (I did not) I did not trust anyone for a week I have not wanted to wake me up and torture me around)
