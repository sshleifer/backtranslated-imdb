I gave 10 out of 10 points. I love so much. I'm a boy in the 80s and I've been in heavy metal for many years. That's why I like the movie. It's so cool to see this poster in the room of that boy (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted sister ...) and his vinyl collection (they presented the evil of Exciter, the birth of the mutants, the master of shock metal Wholesaler and murder. My business with Megadeth da). Similarly, the FASTWAY soundtrack is incredibly incredible and well suited to the plot. If you enter the metal, TRICK OR TREAT is your friend. Do not buy or watch the movie because OZZY or GENE is in the second movie of SIMMONS, see the soundtrack and the story that will return to the 80's. You will not be the same person.
