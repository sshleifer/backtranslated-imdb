Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been wrong in recent years, playing many times in Paul Verhoeven's 1997 movie series. But none of them, in any way, has really captured the spirit of his novel. Games usually have nothing to do, TV shows were a spin-off, and less talked about the film Verhoeven, the better. We do not know most, however, in Japan, an already adapted adaptation, he released the year of Heinlein's death. And, believe it or not, despite the differences, this 6-part animated series, senseless argument, is a faithful adaptation of the classic Heinlein. <br /> <br /> This series is obvious from their presence. We lost something in the Verhoeven film when we were losing something. Like the book, the series deals with characters and their relationships in action and space travel, although they see the appropriate amount. While events happen in the book differently, the book's plot is present. Ricos and Carmen have a romantic knot, but much more than in the book. Some believe that interviewing and interacting with the character may be somewhat below the book (it gets a bit of anime treatment, but what did you expect?), But it's much better than the movie. Only Heinlein's political opinions are removed, in front of the film, where they are translated. The earnings of the series, however, is a climatic fight against Klendathus, which is one of the kind of action against armor attire that we would like to see in a version of the film. > <br /> In general, I liked the series because I wanted to see a closer view of Heinlein. And I think they did quite well. If you find this series, take a look.
