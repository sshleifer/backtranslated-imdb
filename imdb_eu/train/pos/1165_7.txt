As another IMDB reviewer has warned, the slow movie begins, but it gets much better. Yes, it's posted by Roger Corman and, above all, it goes beyond the same theme base, such as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. However, the wife's career is embodied as a male blues singer against the almost freudish husband's solitude and his "empty" emotional and physical need, while minimizing the use of minimal effects and settings. well done. Using a small number of locations and characters and using almost all the scenes in water, as well as metaphorical symbols and cleaning, despite the fact that this movie suffers from a minimal quote, it reminds me that it has been fully realized and in many ways the last scene, namely, the French "POOL" at least seems to be able to borrow against "UP AMABAZOA". With a small set of instruments, AM CONTATA AMANDA keeps suspicion with occasional tempting temptations with a romantic and fatalistic view of listening, but this is also the case with other films in this genre: the exaggeration of the past Amanda's scholar The difference (again very freudian) is very unique in this genre and interesting. I agree with the other innocent thinkers of this innocuous and innocuous belief in Amanda's unexpected, which I think is an excellent image. <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br />
