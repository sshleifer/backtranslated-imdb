"Stardust" is a wonderful and fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> I can easily finish this sentence and I can say that it is very hard to see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Empowering Hollywood remakes and sequels our body seems to be forced into a moment, "Stardust" reminds us why movies go first - to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives. in others or other planets. Ironically, "Stardust" takes us to three places and the effort we all want the baby. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is full of many people who remember our children: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and shameless people. She has a priestly girl, a hero, hats, obstacles, witchcraft, antidotes, charm and speed that is a touch of light to make it almost modern. <br /> <br /> It's about a "Stardust". Wall city man, located next to the wall that separates the town from a magical kingdom. The only way to get past the wall is by means of a race sponsored by David Kelly, an adorable little loser. One day, a young man, Barnes, guards the old man, Ben Barnes, maneuvering and escaping. It happens in a charming kingdom called Stormhold, where La karnero (and very sexy) catches it. A witch catches her, and a strong chain binds her. While the witch is away, Una Ben will seduce her and send it on the way. Ben Wall returns without incident and continues his life. However, nine months later, the old guard can work on the wall, the baby. Cox) who is hit by a girlfriend in her league and is also married to another. However, this young man (called Victoria and Sienna Miller has played) once comes out with Tristain and admits his love. After falling to the star, he will tell if he remembers the star and brings it back. He agreed and started to look for him, because he would take him to the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, in the Stormhold kingdom, the ancient king (played by Peter O'Toole) is dying. . He calls his other children to say to those who follow him on the throne. His son's names are Primus, Secondus, Sextmus and Septimus. Other children killed other brothers to watch the throne in a humorous competition. <br /> <br /> In any case, he rubs his ruby ​​charm with the sky and Voila, so he can take the stars to the ground. . <br /> <br /> Izarra Yvaine (Clare Danes), a beautiful woman, is dressed in stars and charms, of course. But I do not know that Tristain, Princes, and even an old witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer), who wants to cut the star's heart to retrieve his youth. <br /> <br /> Complicated? Yes But everything comes together as the adventure develops. <br /> <br /> Tristain is the first to find Yvaine, but her devotion to Victoria is so blind and she does not know about the growing connection between Yvaine. His initial interest lies in the return of Yvaine Victoria's proof of love. He must first go over the princes and Lami. The princes do not have a big problem, they are constantly trying to kill each other and, like "The Pirates of the Caribbean", death is never so much fun. <br /> <br /> But Tristain also knows his mother slaves (although he does not know his mother) and a flying pirate by Robert DeNiro. <br /> <br /> He is the most important character in the film and DeNiro plays a camera. He steals the film with hardness and we will soon see a secret secret to let the audience laugh at the ground. Although his role is small, DeNiro is sensational! <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is a wonderful Lamia - sexy nasty witch. Claire Danes Yvaine is well suited and confused. She's the perfect little girl. Jason Flemyng, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett and Mark Strong add a perfect dose of love to the fighting princes that fight, and they return when Blithe Spirit and High Spirits die. <br /> <br /> Additionally, the director of Matthew Vaughn, the only experience of "The Layer Cake", creates a fascinating tale that everyone can enjoy. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" can be complicated for young children, but with more than 13 years, this movie must be seen several times. It's good. "Stardust" is an alleged way. Fully written, perfectly targeted, and perfectly addressed. In other words ... perfect.
