I have just heard the comments of the director of this film, and I think that the most important thing that I get is that, as with Mann's Insider, it is completely subjective. It's from Howard's POV. So, to see comments on this, any review or essay by Ebert is really Nolen's character. If the movie "does not work", then Howard thinks it does not work. It is true, it can be correct. Howard's rationale and personality would not really deal with mental treatments and analyzes. <br /> <br /> But, yes, this is the nature of the people. <br /> <br /> Andrew.
