This movie is one of the best films of the United States in the 90s. If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a lot of actions, a lot of laughter and a tongue in the cheek against the gangster anti-police cheats, this is worth seeing. Everyone cheats a little bit the landscape, but it's really all that movie, and everyone is pretty fun. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have a great chemistry and have to do another movie together.
