Think of what anime lovers think of giant narratives. It's completely different from Japanese animation. Yakitate! Japan is one of those shows. It is a story of a young boy with a gift of sweet bread. The universe is the creation of a Japanese loaf that matches European famous loafs. The show will come, and I'm sure the Japanese audience is not losing a lot of jokes. But it's still very nice to watch the innocent of the show completely. <br /> <br /> Yakitate munduan! It's not uncommon for people to give up a look after eating bread. Bread is hallucinated and allows the consumer to offer super powers, as time goes by and swim as fish. She transforms this strange party into one of the most fun and entertaining shows I've ever seen.
