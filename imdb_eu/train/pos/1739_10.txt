I am from NASCAR Maniac's perspective, the movie is interesting. You can see a lot of race cars since 1983. Although hard, racing scenes are less realistic. But I must admit that I did not see races before 1995, since there were not previously shown NASCAR races in Germany) <br /> <br /> Image of a Burt Reynolds fan I am, when we see films in the 80's Reynolds It's basically a wheel of a fast car behind Burt, like in his bandit movies. <br /> <br /> If you love NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie is essential. If you love two of these things, I can see them. If you like NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, you should still give it a chance, but remember, this film won the Oscar Oscar. <br /> <br /> It's a 80's humor. If you like movies like Cannonball Films and Police Academy, you'll also like it.
