I grew up in Brazil and visited the beautiful coastline that filmed the movie and I admired it. The area is called "Parati" and is part of the "Green Coast" of Rio de Janeiro. Located 150 kilometers from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This movie is from the XVI. It revitalizes the world of Brazilian suburbs, where the European coast, still a pristine state, was not exploring. Many tribes were born alive little. The French and the Portuguese fought for trade in the territory and Brazil while they traded their natives, although they struggled in each other, for whatever reason. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A French imbalance called "Mercenary" must kill his countrymen, but he escapes and keeps a prisoner from a native born tribe. While he is the "slave" of the chief, according to the customs of the tribe, he is allowed to live in relative comfort for a month until he is killed and retaliated in a ritual of revenge. > <br /> According to what I like about this film, they recover the loving details of their peoples and their way of life (naked and cannibals) and asked us to recognize and accept their lives at that time. It was: in a beautiful garden of Eden, life was dirty, violent, pathetic superstition and unusual customs. Europeans arrive and bring their troubles, including greater violence, including weapons and greed. There are no "savages" or "heroic explorers", not just people who are trying hard to survive. <br /> <br /> The film does not admit that it is not abusive. Depending on what I am familiar with, the representation is quite specific, which gives the project a unique feature: how many films did you see in Brazil's native people and their first issues with Europe?
