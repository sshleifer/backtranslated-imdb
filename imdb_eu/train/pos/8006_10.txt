The game is wonderful! Well, maybe he did not want to have some features, but Anvil Digital still came up with a good game. With some elite similarities (you can destroy commerce, weapons and loads from destroyed ships, to go to missions). However, this game plays a great role. It's a great mission. The control system is different and it uses the mouse! You basically fly a space around a system and climb up! The game also has some pretty graphics in 2003. It should work properly in a detailed PC. Stories John Rhys Davies, George Takei and Jennifer Hale offer some great voices (appearing in every computer game). Keeping the story improving and improving. There is also a race section where your opponents and your opponents can walk around a course (involving rings). This section took me a bit. Adds a variety of games. The sections are a bit hard here and there, but you can beat this game in general. The game has an active mod scene on the web. Receive mods to extend the game. I have not yet acted in any way. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this continuation has been abandoned, shame!
