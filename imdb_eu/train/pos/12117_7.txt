Although movie Davis puts it on the map, Mildred Rogers, a brilliant work as an illiterate prostitute server, is a strangely surrogate Mildred Rogers. The performance is very respectful in all respects. I can not understand what is in my life or why Phillip, a sensitive and strong young man, would continually abuse his unjust behavior: my innocent tolerance seems to me quite hilarious. Yes, I know that it is facing a sensitive intellectual club. Davis, however, is a wise man, nobody worships his attitude or actions that he would tolerate and incredible. Davis is amazing in his role: yes, maybe it's time to go to the seaside in its historical moments, from time to time, but a very creative portrait is what you look at. Bad was not playing a gangster moll. Its character would be absolutely compelling for cyclists to ride!
