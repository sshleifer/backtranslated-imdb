As long as Barbra is a fan of life, such messages will be reversed. On the one hand, this classical film is classified. It contains bugs (underlined in other posts), but a time (at the end of the 70s) will be visible again, and it's amazing to see it popping up on the screen. <br /> <br /> Streisand has fought hard to make this film on his own. I do not think he was happy. But their fans give a new Barbra (at the time) a LIVE song, a fresh look, and some great performances. <br /> <br /> The story is rough, but exciting, and it's your interest. whole A long "Finale" frame is difficult for non-Barbary lovers, but says they count large numbers of those who admire their talent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
