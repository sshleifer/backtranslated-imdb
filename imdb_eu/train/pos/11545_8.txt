The original Odd Couple movie has single-comic lines. Worldwide, it seems Felix Ungar's neurotic-terribly neurotic story and funny, Oscar Madison slob is disgraceful. Thanks to its collaboration with Kolokan, it is one of the most successful TV series of all time, as well as numerous and beautiful imitations. <br /> <br /> Odd Couple has an Oscar's apartment and wonderful jokes around him. bad habits. He said: "Who wants to eat?" One of his poker players asks: "What do you have?" As Oscar says, "I have brown sandwiches and green sandwiches." "What is brown?" Very new cheese or meat is very old! "I also like the line of the Oscar's refrigerator," I did not see milk in two weeks, I did not see milk in a bottle. "There's no question. Watching Walter Mattha's Oscar Madison on the cheerful screen, Jack Klugman's TV series is almost as good <br /> <br /> The problem of the film is Jack Lemmon, Felix Ungar. The role is very sincere, and the problem is that Felix is ​​so confusing that he is worried that he has become more and more hard-fought by the likes of Tony Randall's series, For Felix, Lemmon's portraits are missing and, of course, Tony's Felix Unger might be a bit annoying, but Jack Félix Felix Ungar (see spelling) linked Jack Phillips to the story with a great deal of care. never being happy, funny, or not. Felix Ungar is always a roommate who drives up the wall. <br /> <br /> He has a long time to experience proof of time ulak Meatloaf is one of the biggest "famous" wars. never scenes! An excellent example of Oscar's "Felix" pillars will be remembered forever. However, there is a darker side that Oscar puts forward, after the end of his "crying" after calling Felix, and a scene with Felix's Linguine dinner (although it is brightly lit) seems to be comical. <br /> Maybe there was not enough time to see the lighter side of these characters, so they made the movie a memorable one. At first 20 minutes it's very boring. The same is true of Felix's interview with Pidgeon Sisters. The end of the film is predictable and it's not too much. Each one has little or no mercy for each of them. The result is that the darker part of the film creates a lot of depression and anger, more than comedy, if you do not see the exquisite scenes mentioned above. It seems that Jack Lemmon's Felix monotonous movie downs it, enhances or embraces comics. <br /> <br /> The series of the 70s really took The Odd Couple the best he could. stay there The original movie is still very good. However, the TV shows are much better.
