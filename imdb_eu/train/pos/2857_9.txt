As part of the 1950's final vocabulary, we met Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, etc. This great show, "Bonanza", came on Saturday night and was stuck to all television. It was a real show that represented the family values. It may be a weekend crisis, but when all of the family's powerful atmosphere were thrown together. <br /> <br /> Lorne Greene was dependent on the patriarch's family. The words represented wisdom. We were often surprised that Ben Cartwright, a widow, had to be killed by the best husband of his poor wife. He created wonderful children. <br /> <br /> Of course, we wonder why he left Pernell Roberts. The show was mine gold and Roberts spent a lot of money when he went. His career was never linked to Cartwright as his son. He wanted to join the series. He definitely lost his loss.
