Simply the best ever ever! The adaptation of the fictional novel by Richard Brooksen, Truman Capoten, is a very artistic achievement. An amazing black and white cinema (it should win an Oscar), the incredible score of Quincy Jones and a great performance by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. This film ranks fourth in the Oscar for the 10th and was not nominated for the best movie while Dr. Doolittle was. Go to the image! <br /> <br /> Although you do not know the Clutter family in the book, it was a good decision to take care of Perry and Dick and to continue the guilty process. Down. John Forsythe is as amazing as Alvin Dewey. There's just no mistake. 10 to 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson's close-up of R. Blake. Highly Recommended!
