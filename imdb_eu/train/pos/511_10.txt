I saw the first movie 21 years ago when it was an ITV (before the days of the cables and satellites) Matin√©e. With the school I went off and I was completely in the movie. For 10 years I have bought the video I bought and copied a copy of the DVD. David Niven is my favorite time and I think they loved the excitement of the Oscars. She could swear the queen even more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins could have sworn to the film industry. Black and white films change their color and they're done again and the film looks like Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and Richard Attenborough.
