I recently bought a wonderful collection of these series, and even though I only saw three episodes, I still still think of slow animation and stylish story telling. I'm still a fan ... with some lowercase ones. <br /> <br /> This Gundam saga is very beautiful, but it can contain the previous series, a satially elegant way of making erroneous ones. To discard war and everything or to exclude the need for power (do you know the sound?), I must say that this is a bit too dramatic and explain the need for a lifelong character. All the things that have happened and have been created by the head to make the OZ team succeed in its plan (especially the character called Wufei ... it will always be that he seduce more than one American character). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The drama over-dramatic (which also comes from the dubbing of English-speaking actors) is still very exciting and will once again seduce me again. . I mean it's always worse. It could be a bit fragment, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talking mood-dramatics .... I'll talk later.
