Well, so the plot is on the ground. Yes, well, so there are randomly inserted songs and / or dances sequences (for example Adam's concert and Henri's scenario). And Leslie Caron can not really know ... to act. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < according to Caron and truck lorries that are importing in each scene. (It seems ... because it has a problem with emotion. <br /> <br /> This 16-minute ballet is one of the best and most spectacular techniques of this musician of this music. movie It's very surprising, and Kelly and Caron dance. But my favorite number should be Kelly's character, "I Got Rhythm" with a French school, and then expanding the range of American dance. When you get real talent * you just prove that you do not need special effects. <br /> <br /> It's not at 'classical' level, 'Singin' In the Rain ', but it's a pretty high level, though. It's worth watching!
