Fantastic movie! When you stop coming to death with the story. A successful dentist Alan Johnson (dentist) violates a life crisis to balance his career with his family. Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) wants to touch the base he learned from former colleague. When Charlie, his wife and family lost an attack on America 9-11, he no longer talks about reality ... he recalls his favorite past music and video games. The first classmates reinforce friendship and strengthen the former relationship. Johnson has a psychiatrist with her friend Angela Oakhurts (Liv Tyler) who has helped Charlie bring her and leave her friend deeply soft. Pinkett Smith already plays Johnson's wife. Mike Binder, the writer and director, has the role of Charlie's lawyers and guardians. Also cast: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Modell and Robert Klein. Soundtrack featuring Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I have never been a fan of Sandler; But it was obvious why. In some scenes, I thought aloud ... why never approach Bob Dylan for singer and songwriter.
