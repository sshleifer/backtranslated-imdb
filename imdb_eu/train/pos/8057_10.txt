In the mid-1930s, Hollywood regained its trust in the difficulties of the debate. Although all the technical problems of sound have been resolved very quickly, more time has to be taken to resolve how to speak, how to structure and how to behave. The informant is an essential image that shows how the story transmits moments without words, confirms the power images and does not take into account the sound and conversation needs. <br /> <br /> It's not really an informant. Return to the golden days of silence. On the one hand, many silent images were not visually empty in their narrative, and they were overloaded with title titles. The informant, on the other hand, is opening the moments of the interviews, leaving the reaction to more than one speech and leaving the shots in the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford for all his power. The film director seems to have endeavored, depending on the material's interest. He thought it was a stupid story, he breathed a little. Fortunately, the informant was everything that Ford loved, Informador, his community, honor, working class and, above all, an Irish image. In it, Ford only uses some shots. Are the first places? The streets of Dublin that cover the clouds and the darkness can not be seen in their deepest depths; Inner walls and walls where the ceiling gives us. The second is faces, planes that come up against ordinary people, usually without dialogue, by directing internal conflicts of these people. <br /> <br /> The director of Victor McLaglen goes through this character and filming. him McLaglen's performance is not much flawless, but only about 90% of drinking. Another 10%, on the other hand, is a sensitive emotion, as here and there, when their Gypo Nolan gives light to the alcohols. With these performances, the Oscars have been won. McLaglen has provided support, among which there is no weaker link. In fact, it's nice to have Donald Meek and Una O'Connor, usually only in the role of comic relief, who play live dramatic pieces (one or two jokes with Meek's appearance, the tone of that scene and much dress). it's serious). Not only are two reputable performances, but most of them are known as comedic players, which also give them a great deal of tragedy. <br /> <br /> The RKO was produced by the informant, perhaps the most. Adventurous and major risks of major studies. This is why we are able to see a shameless story with the wonderful old hero, which could easily be mistaken. Instead, it is full of permanent and deep-seated environments. It takes us into his world.
