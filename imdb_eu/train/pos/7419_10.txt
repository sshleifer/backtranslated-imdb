I watched the budget, I went to "Shower" waiting for a sweet little comedy; I have found the deep drama of the family's life, in some of the privileges that I have ever seen. Also, I later estimated the past scenes of reflection (in the dry land of the North of China and in the highlands of Tibet): is not how memory works? I am in a moment here, next time I am in a landscape of the past, so ... <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie completely, I would put it between two. or the best three of my 60 years. <br /> <br /> Sometimes two years ago, "Asian dance?" Another "comedy" was released in the United States. (Japanese). Like "Shower," the preview did not give a specific depth to that film, because it was a subtle psychological investigation (despite the fun moments). Are the distributors afraid that movies that are "very important" or "deep" seem to call US audiences?
