If you enter into the film with hope, throw it away now, because it does not direct this film. <br /> <br /> This movie would be unclassifiable in one genre. Spy is a thriller, it has black elements, strange actions, science fiction, and all cyberpunk, fascinating narrative, bold thoughts and a beautiful cinematic. <br /> <br /> Many of the comments made here have focused on other films. As you say, every story that goes through the stories of Shakespeare, so you can go on a bad walk. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to pause credibility and the set is never going to be unbelievable, there are parts (read: lift) that are low and slightly cursive. Do not mislead it as much as the science fiction movie movies, but much higher. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an action, you should turn it away. This is pure psychology. But if you want to sit down and swear enough about 90 minutes of your life, DO YOU! See before watching the movie!
