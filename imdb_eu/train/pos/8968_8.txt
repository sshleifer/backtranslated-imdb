This movie was just as nice as Jimmy Stewart's movie, charming and very pleasing. Kim Novak in Gillian, is a beautiful witch who is a human being, a subtle expression of her facial expression, which creates all her movements and gestures as Gillian. He has been hanging on all his words as an immense character. I did not fail to mention Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester's wonderful remarks, just like the one in the world of magic (Kovacs) and the aunt's lovable aunt. The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are beautiful and a great chemistry between them, but again when Jimmy Stewart and chemistry are chemistry between chemistry.
