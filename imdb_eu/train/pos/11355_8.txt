I was amazed at how wonderful this movie was. The performances were very good, especially for Rea as a nonsense pity. <br /> <br /> Despite a small budget, there is not much FX or camera work, Citizen X somehow surpasses most of Hollywood's Hollywood movies. Nothing else. Telling. The. Story <br /> <br /> True stories prefer a weakness than with a bang, and this is the case here, but it is also highly recommended for detectors.
