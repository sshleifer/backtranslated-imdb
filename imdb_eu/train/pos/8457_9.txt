Gundam Wing me anime anime da. A bit slow movement (especially in the middle of the series), but very pleasant. Now that I call my case before the jump and the "wing", I will admit that I have seen the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, 08. MS Team and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I confess that there have been some problems in telling stories and some people seem to be "rot" (this is the original Zechs Marquise Gundam Char), but this is another show of the universe based on the original series. Like SEED <br /> <br /> If you want to see this series, make sure that you see the first Gundam original and then you are viewing an UA series.
