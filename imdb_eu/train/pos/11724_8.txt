Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is an inexperienced show of horror. When knowing that the dead aunt has left a few things, elvira goes to England to earn money. But for her fear, all her aunt Elvira left the house, the dog and the kitchen. He decides to settle for Elvira at home, however, but with her horrible dark looks and amazing features she will not be able to live peacefully. All neighbors are opposing the people against him now, and with Elvir's attitude and an immense glance, everyone will look after him, because Elvira is on fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's so fun to watch every one of these Elvira adventures, it's great. The whole movie will enter a Halloween mood, sure, it's a fool and jokes are cheap, but it's nice to watch. Elvira, Dark Of The Dark 8/10 would give me
