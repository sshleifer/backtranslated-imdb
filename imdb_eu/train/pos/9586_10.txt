The film really challenges the notions of personality and life society. It is well done and very powerful. The people of the film are honest and reveal about the world beyond the ideological perspective. I believe that the viewer has a broad vision of subculture that emphasizes the same idea about society. Sometimes it's amazing and that's why it's stronger. It was difficult to see some parts, like most of the realities, but it was not over. It's the first time you see it, but it's better for a second or third time; because you have wanted to think about the issues that are debatable and challenging.
