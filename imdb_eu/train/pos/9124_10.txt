Forget some fictional plays (the musicians at the end of the day), this is Quentin Tarrinn's "best rock ever made ... period" <br /> <br /> Think 8 miles but without rapping - a young musician from the local community trying to prove it, while struggling to face a broken team of opponents. Interest in sex and really extraordinary performances, this is a true 8 miles. <br /> <br /> Prince gives a good performance, like Morris Day and Jerome Benton. A decent script, good management, great plot and spectacular performances. Never forget some of the best rock / pop / funk music.
