This movie was created only in the 1970s! He is a curious action movie that is located in a small working class in California. Some types of mills or plants are shutting off, and suddenly it is happening in the wrong streets! Citizens are fed! So Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent) goes to another town to reunite his brother, Aaron, with Kris Kristofferson. Aaron Vietnam is a veteran and looks and imbalances. It hangs with a bunch of many Vietnamese veterinarians. They get into the city to clean themselves (they become replaced), but under their good deeds, gaming houses are running, asking for money protection, etc. !!! It takes some time to catch people, and in the discovery of Cain and Abel biblical, Vincent needs to take his older brother. In this movie there is an interesting blue necklace, which is interesting (consider the cock-fighting scene!). Vincent is almost too angular in that role? He thinks his brother so well, he can not think of doing evil deeds. Does it ultimately deliver the senses? Victoria Principal, her girlfriend, retreated and beaten in her house. Kris Kristofferson is as effective as Aaron. He denies any evil that he does wrong, and gingerly talks to Vincent and his young daughter ("as uncle Aaron says") while threatening father's life, smiling! Vincent and Kristofferson have a good contrast in chemistry. Bernadette Peters looks like a 'sedan' girl who attracts Aaron's attention. A good 70s movie action, if you can find it! Is not it still available on DVD?
