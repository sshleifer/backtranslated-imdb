Peter Falk is a diverse and vibrant actor. The movie is well written and the play is like a real life. For Columbo lovers, this is a great job. It shows how talented it is Peter Falk. There is no detector that plays a retired rug seller. When credits start with the role, you want to see it again. An interesting part of the movie is that it will be applied to all people who see the message; It will be the only thing that will change the depth of its importance. It's just a shame that Hollywood liberals will only promote leather and leather, because this is a type of movie that must be proud of the business people. It would be a great movie on the live stage.
