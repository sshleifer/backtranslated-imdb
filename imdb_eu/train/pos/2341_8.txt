This is indeed a fun show, it's a creepy way, much like a Tim Burton movie. It is worth a look, as it is much more creative than most of the season's shows. The best thing is not the "reality" show. I wonder why public viewers like those shows (that is, those who do not have creativity) and who are willing to exclude such wonderful shows. <br /> <br /> <br /> While I'm going through some premises, I think it's very common. Much more enjoyable than "Ghost Whisperer" and "Medium". I think it's a fun thing in the pipe, because "My name is Earl." <br /> <br /> Oh, and narration and wonderful music. If you enjoy far-away shows from the video, I would recommend it. It's not as rare as Twin Peaks, but it's serious.
