This movie is great. As we have often heard, it is very realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike others, I am not clear about Austrian defense, negativism or dissolution as a proto-fascist society. On the contrary: even though HUNDSTAGE is very heavy on stage, some characters are called bad people, at the same time you will see love, beauty and humor in Ulrich Seidls. That's what HUNDSTAGE describes for me as "ordinary people", other films that show life and realism. Their love, their desires, the dark side: Seidl never tries to prove it, it is a rude life of the workers' workers! In my opinion, it is fearful that fans who come to this conclusion are afraid that they are afraid, as almost everyone does not believe in others as "clean" and "normal". Everyone lives the dark and often depressing parties. The most beautiful scene: The old Viennese man, as he calls what his old girl dancing "dancing east". Anyone who is ugly with this scene thinks it's a sense of beauty and what they should be asking, proto-fascist: HUNDSTAGE or the characters of the audience, turning off the body of a 70-year-old woman, dancing her charm to her lover.
