I can not agree with the driver because it is a fantastic movie and must see a broad spectator. Imagination, the visual interpretation of the script, humor is always amazing. Both directors are excellent and they really take the movie. My advice would not be to see a trailer, rent a movie and have no hope. I have rented from the superproducts, so that it is readily available in Brisbane, nobody will enjoy it, but most people will have an opinion and that's always good, except "stupid." I loved this movie, every day you do not see such gems. Worship would be a favorite. Try it, I feel the same way.
