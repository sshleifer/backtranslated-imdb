The word that comes up with the pie-lette I saw last night is "original." Television is a word that is not much used, because it tends to cope with all the other networks, and end up with seven-night crime shows, inappropriate comedy and rough reality. <br /> <br /> The first thing that caused me to brick was Jim Dale's presence. "Carry On ..." who do not know the British or those who have not heard a Harry Potter book are not Dale. I am not sure the narrator adds or deviates his presence. I'll have to tune it further, but the show looks like a "Harry Potter" atmosphere. Maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace (a wicked, white countess) has a gift. He never explains where he got it, but he can take someone in between for a minute. With Chi McBride (the Boston Public, Roll Bounce) breaks down this teammate. Everything is fine and fun until childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal: Dream begins, timeline) and things are really hard. He can not go back and never touch. Boy, is that relationship difficult? <br /> <br /> I'll be in the cinema to see this series in the hope of entertaining.
