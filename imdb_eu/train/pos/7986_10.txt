This is an excellent movie and heart. The best thing I've seen is what shows today's Latin American reality ... kidnappings, corruption, police authorities and brave and innocent love for innocent victims. Denzel Washinton seems to give me the greatest performance in his career. Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is very well written and portrayed, every time I think it. Excellent cast, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke is always great. Walken illuminates the screen for me as another actor. Both would like to see more. The real places stand out. Camera work is interesting and different. There are several Latin-American actors in Cast, which makes it more interesting for those who know Latin American cinema. This movie is highly recommended.
