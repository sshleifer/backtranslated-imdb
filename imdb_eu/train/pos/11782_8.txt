I do not know if this is a catastrophe or not, but I did not risk being black in the list until 3462. <br /> <br /> I am not completely described with the comments described * Guns, Germs and Steel * as "politically correct" and "neo-Marxist". I can not see the same series I * did. The * I * series saw the history of American colonization, in America and in the South of Africa, which are not exact. I did not see anything in this series. It was European luck that it seemed to the Europeans as bad people, although many Europeans were lucky * and it was not lucky. Similarly, I do not see the people born being depicted as bad things. Even if it was inca, it was a proud one, it would be possible if the line were to face foreigners, if their country had no living remembrance of any other world power. <br /> <br /> No doubt, I have been able to understand anything as a Marxist or Neo-Marxist, except for very elastic imagination. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, many African countries * do * the European malaria and the immunity of other European tropical diseases. At the time of success, the Aztecs, Maya and Inka civilizations * were as advanced and rich as any other world; sometimes more. American and Khoi-san aboriginal populations * other Euro-pean diseases have included tenths; European colonists have had tenths of tropical illness like malaria. (NOTE: Khoi-San is completely different from all Sub-Saharan African countries.) <br /> <br /> So I do not see what other scammers complain of. * The only thing that I complained is that when the series finished with the seventh grade I do not know anything about it. There is nothing new in the history of this movie. However, events, for example, conquer the Incas, present beautiful performances. production values ​​are very high; Gruber meets some holes that are not covered in the Sixth Class Social Class of the School of Milan. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy this, assuming that you have primary or secondary education, you will not learn anything, but you will be pleasant and entertaining when reviewing what you have learned (or what you should learn) at school.
