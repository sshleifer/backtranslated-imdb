A stunning movie! He has a very good joke for the whole movie. The only thing that is negative is that some scenes go to the extreme, to see two stupid main characters. We get it, stupid blondes, follow! <br /> <br /> The earthquake is almost never called "a lie". And boobies are always a plus for some strange reasons, the movie does not play with that card, even as part of the two blondes that act as a black hairdresser who presents the plot line. <br /> <br /> So, anyway, to see a good movie. I gave him almost 8/10, but let us not be mad.
