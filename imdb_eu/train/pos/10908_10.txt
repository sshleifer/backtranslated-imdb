I did not cry when I saw this beautiful documentary tear. Everything was heartbreaking, worrying and inspiring. I recommend this documentary to anyone who seeks something to think about themselves. Or just something that you can think of. You see that he lives in the last months of his life. You see it already has a positive attitude. At one point, you start to see that it is a really amazing individual. We understand that all of us should teach something. His life and fights cry, laugh and life will be much easier if you take a day of living.
