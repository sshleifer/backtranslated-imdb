Shohei Sugiyama, an accountant (Kôji Yakusho), is bored with his usual life, hard work, and his house with his wife Masako Sugiyama (Hidean Hara) and her teenage daughter. One night, if he was traveling by train, Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari) looks at his face on the balcony of the dance school and he decides to visit the school two days later and will take part in the dance lessons every Wednesday night. overnight However, he is ashamed to say his secret to his family. Meanwhile, Masa feels that her husband changes the behavior of happy, and hires a private eye to investigate Shohei's affair. <br /> <br /> I finished "Dansu we?" and I really love it. What a beautiful and enjoyable film! The story is amazing with drama, comedy and love. They are excellent and I was especially surprised by the beauty of the director Masaiuki Suo and the cold beauty of Tamiyo Kusaka with the professional dancer. On September 06th, "Shall We Dansu?" I saw the American version. For the first time, I've found wonderful entertainment. But now I can say that it is a waste of some unnecessary restoration and I recommend this original movie. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dança Comigo?" ("Dancing with me?")
