It was boring to get bored with fixed Halloween baseballs that I've seen repeatedly, and I took a chance at "Sentinel" to re-influence the horror juices again. Please note, I came back to see the Dark Castle remake of "The Haunted Hill" on the House. Hopefully, "The Sentinel" BLEW ME AWAY! When he tells a story about a Brooklyn Hights mall, a movie that featured a good movie, he offered everything - (1) Campy and fantasy characters, interviews and interviews, including the most horny rounds of Christopher Walken. , Jeff Goldblum and, above all, Martin Balsam, an absent minded teacher - (2) terrifying Terror! I do not want to leave a picture, but there are scenes in the film we've crystallized into my pancreas - (3) Michael Winner's superb direction, make-up and fairness (though not quite). to treat it. If you love "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising", this will be your favorite queen. To emphasize the love of this movie, when I first saw it, when I fell down, I saw it tightened again and again. Today is one of the favorites of all time. Make yourself one side and look!
