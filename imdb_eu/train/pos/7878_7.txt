My family's story goes on, my father, Milton Raskin, played in the Dorsey piano group. When he entered the group of Sinatra, my father worked with him for hours. Then, in a moment, my father said to Sinatra that it was good that he was really tied up with a small group and that he had to push himself on his own. Sinatra then had enough credit for "under the belt" for that! Dorsey has not forgiven my father, and the rest, as they say, is history. <br /> <br /> I have some photographs and records, and the Berkley University in California. <br /> <br /> I have seen more than tell Sinatra about all the movies, and his films never get older. . . Thank you Frank
