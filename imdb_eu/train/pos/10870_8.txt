Personally, the movie seems to be a very good watch. Find out about the situation in Hong Kong in Trieste and how it is distributed to the audience. <br /> <br /> Not only does Hong Kong police control the status of the trio. The police do not just go out and stalk the sting. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is violent as a result of murder and torture by gangland methods. However, the film retains the real world, so screen violence is just the reflection of what happens. <br /> <br /> This movie would recommend any fan of the Triad / Mafia film festival. Another good watch would be Dragon Squad. This movie has more than this gun, there are more than just guns in the movie, which I do not remember, I saw a single gun.
