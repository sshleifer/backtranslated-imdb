Norman, is that it? It was (that is, the third hand, so take a grain of salt) adapted to an African American family, made a Jew, transition phase and on screen. Also, it was one of those films filmed by video games, so theater could not be great. However, the performances of Redd Foxx and others were quite good. <br /> <br /> Everyone who told me the movie PERIOZ PIEZA is the mid-70's or early decade that reflects the fact that your child is familiar with your family. That's why it is quite interesting if Hollywood is not "a bit". Do you not believe me? Check the curtains, etc. Stereotyped. Not too deep <br /> <br /> But ... it really shines some movie areas. There is a secondary scene when Redd Foxx is trying to find a wife, with her brother (!) Escaped to Ensenada in Pinto. The cross border phone is very memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scenes in the movie Wayland Flowers and Madam made gay habits in gay bars and nightclubs. In my opinion, the routine is the only time it was shot. And a shorter version is much shorter. However, Madame is vintage and should not be missed. People continue in Wayland; the man was really stylish. Enjoy the movie!
