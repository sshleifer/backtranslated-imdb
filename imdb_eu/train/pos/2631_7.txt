If the lion King has a serious story about a young lion who is revenged for his father's death, the lion is one king and half is completely opposite, full of whim and joy. Lion King told Simba a leopard from Timbaut and Pumbaa's half-viewpoint, less than a pair of people from home, who could not punch the tunnels without a punch. It has a friend and neighbor and a smell problem. The film is a short substance, but Disney works well with the sketches that Timone and Pumba draw together with because they're watching us. My favorite is the song in the middle of the movie, be sure to watch the bouncing! Disney has announced 1 and a half "the rest of the story," but it's not really. It's just another view of The Lion King, all the serious things most part of the second part of the original Disney classic. Credits such as Nathan Lane Timone and Ernie Sabella Pumbaa, without work, maybe the work has not worked. The songs entertain and laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a conflict with the hot tube.
