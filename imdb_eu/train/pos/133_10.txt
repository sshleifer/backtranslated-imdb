A few years ago, one of his other friends collected a video with the movie 'Heat' by Michael Mann. When we got up from the movie after we got up, we saw that there was just one other movie after it had not been written by the owner of the casette envelope. However, we were stuck on the seats, his credit was no different from the opening. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < ... <br /> <br /> This film was in Europe. Lars von Trier wakes up the black movies among the dead, took away the reality, which was clearly deliberate, but I often saw a resemblance to the German postwar period. And then hard cuts! <br /> <br /> The unorthodox moral odyssey at the end of this story is difficult. A young American pacifist originator from Germany has come to warlock in Germany, with the intention of paying no money for his fellows. But it mostly meets the challenge of distrust and self-destruct. Zentropa hired a company with a coacheship (based on Mitropa), and the Occupation is one of the Nazi collaborators. Our hero falls in love with her daughter - later becoming a member of the era, Nazi war terrorists. Unless he understands worlds (or Europeans), he rages his railroad with his rage under a newly saved train. <br /> <br /> As a final note, for historical justice: the real world, as men just did not care about the movie; Most of the Nazi propaganda were a coup. Three months before the capital had died two months before the US Allied Occupation chief, the Nazis announced that they would create full legions of sabotage and terrorists, a cautious man. But Hitler mostly received training from just over a hundred years, and two or three times in Bavaria to continue to perpetuate the suspects of foreign peoples or foreigners forced to survive until the end of the death and death of Hitler. it fell. <br /> <br /> However, male propaganda has had an impact on the occupiers. They feared everywhere a scary man who was suspected of a serious accident, but without exception they found another reason later (some pseudo-historians did not recognize it). For example, they were bombarded when the police station Bremen exploded the main diesel or when its Soviet military commander was in Berlin. Effects of the highest forces of the Soviets, tens of thousands were arrested (for a large part of children!) "They were suspected of being a magnifying glass, and closed in prison camps, many of whom were killed.
