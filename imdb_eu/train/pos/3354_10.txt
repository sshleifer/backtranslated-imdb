This movie eventually left the DVD in Italy (completely restored). I have seen so many times in this movie and it is still true that in 2003 the dictatorship (or the US) once again in Italy is a kind of cleansing. I'm glad I can not sing this film with Mastroianni movies. maybe Sophia Lorens of this world can teach them how to be strong and confessed as a human beings. <br /> <br /> Return to the film: this is a wonderful way to play most people here already, but it's an audio background. it's amazing. I suppose, unfortunately, something is lost if you do not understand Italian, but I can assure the demonstration of the makis, actually the distortion of reality in this radio chronicle of Hitler's visit to Rome. shake! <br /> <br /> masterpiece! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
