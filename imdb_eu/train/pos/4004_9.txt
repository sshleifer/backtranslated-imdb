'Ama' is a great part of the film: she thinks she does not have any punches, and at the end she thinks it. Very open to the character of the director. Anne Reide (that is, she briefly revealed her appearances in some Victoria Wood projects, and I thought it was a great comic) is really great here. Not a stereotypical widow's domestic ideal for marriage and motherhood. And this is not the initial free and adventurous. He plays his character with the proper note of himself (well he has done for me). A powerful cast. Excellent script European cinema revival;
