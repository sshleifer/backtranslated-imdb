What I love about this show is that the life of modern witches continue and honey is to experience everyday love, humor and adventure. The magic literature is so different, depicting the ideas of classical, medieval and modern witch-like Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina Teenage Witch, this show is very fun and unique, since it is worth seven years of this modern witch. This show has many excellent features and is glad to see Sabrina in a mortal and "other" space that she can see everyday life. I would recommend this to all the families, because the TV series is clean, fun and adventurous. Classic!
