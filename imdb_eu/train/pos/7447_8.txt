The movie is going far, but if you love the show, what you expect. It's not a bad movie; it's pretty good. If you do not like the show, do not watch the movie. It may start a bit slow, but then it chooses and it's pretty fun. There are also some "heart-wrenches" at the end of some scenes. All the protagonists can go after them dirty. In addition, Jerry believes his spectacle is embarrassed and justifies the existence of the show. It has a pretty good point. We are very much concerned about the privileged details of celebrity life, so it is wrong for those people to say that their private lives are also in television nations. If they were celebrities, we would not mind, we would eat them. Do not we like his guest to be a bad blacksmith and remind us that there is really poverty in the world and it reminds us that it's just a rich star in the movie "Itzazu Beaver"?
