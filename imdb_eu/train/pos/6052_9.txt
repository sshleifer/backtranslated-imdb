Very discouraged! !! <br /> <br /> A very well-written and entertaining movie, everyone who likes humor! Well, it's a good idea to see more independent British films against the big studios set! Certainly it is worth adding a collection of any movie. In this movie, the scenes are sure that many people will be able to connect. You will laugh at loudly and enjoy a great soundtrack. Especially with Jimmy Cliff in Vietnam and with the Orb version of The Tower of London, Freebird. <br /> <br /> Get ahead ............ you are not disappointed.
