Pecker is a fun and entertaining movie about a small Baltimore town. Every day, Pecker breaks a young photographer who takes photographs of "true things". No beautiful models, beautiful men, hard life. This wonderful movie makes fun in the plasticity of the city's art chain. There is a specific scene in a Pecker mom's store, a female homestead, who will only buy 25 pieces for Whitney art, instead of two hundred dollars. This only shows you, no matter what type of money you may not always like. John Waters, once again, sends you a laughter and raw spiral. You can have the most influential Hollywood movies, but have a "Pecker" or "Hairspray" (another excellent John Waters movie) "Titanic" or "Godzilla"!
