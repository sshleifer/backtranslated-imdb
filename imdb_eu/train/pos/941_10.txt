For the first time I saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" appearing on television. It seemed to me when I saw the movie I announced and over my expectations. I bought a DVD and want to watch it every year. Except for "wonderful life", this version of "A Christmas Carol" is one of the best Christmas films. George C. Scott is superb and is in charge of the excellent work that Roger Rees has led! Scott again proves that it is one of the best actors of our time. Scott has any role in artistic talent and acting, and the character has maintained himself. How can we even think of Patton and Scrooge? Scott makes it so easy. Direction is a wonderful film, with time-honored, seasonal and seasonal films with beautiful sensations, costumes and music. You would like this movie and put it among the favorites to see during the holiday season.
