I can not bury such films in a sarcastic crust, since they do not have to be more than just a vehicle to entertain children and have the means to prepare the next line of merchandise. /> <br /> This is a fun movie. My children sat down in silence and loved every minute. We give it, the wicked is a little bit overhead with his stupid costume and manial laugh, but it's much easier for Pokémon 3 to be dark, dark and very morbid. <br /> <br /> My children started to watch Pokémon, and soon they're going to get "childhood things off" in those years and go to others. We're glad to have fun together.
