The group behind this film has done a very good job with the limitations it has had. Only 300,000 and 7 weeks after that, the only thing to write, shoot and edit. Although this movie is not for the public (a young innocent young teenager has died and there is a human eroticism in the story), I believe that this movie is a story that is more involved in a heart-shaped tragedy. you feel more sadness. He's feeling warmer over Heaton, but it's not translated. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite British movies and I really liked it and I could see it again. I think it's a shame to hear that a movie is not very well.
