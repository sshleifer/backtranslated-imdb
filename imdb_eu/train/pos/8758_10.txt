Jonathan Kaplan's "Brokedown Palace", Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) decide on a high school graduation trip to Hawaii, but they hear a lot more in Bangkok, Thailand. more fun Plans changed and they decided to go to Thailand without telling parents the change of plans. While they were in Thailand, Alice and Darlene met a beautiful man named Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine). He said he would market his first business card to Hong Kong to get three business cards to get his Hong Kong tickets this weekend. They accepted their offer and when they entered the airport, they were arrested for two drug trafficking. They were punished and imprisoned for thirty-one years. <br /> <br /> I think Kaplan said that it was a good decision to make the decision, in one case the wrong decisions could change the direction of life forever. We also think that a friendly face can be friendly, when we know the true intentions of this pleasing face. These girls decided that their parents changed their plans and changed their lives forever. Things are happening in a funny way, what we have decided on. Sometimes, life is not correct, which is why it is important to think long and hard, because we have never been able to go back and change the possibilities we have made. <br /> <br /> This movie has an excellent setting; Most of them shot in Thailand in Bangkok. This movie also has wonderful music; My favorite songs are Delerium's 'Silence', 'Plumb's Damaged', Sarah Bightman's "Delivery Me" and Nelly Furtadok's "Party just has started." I went out, after watching this movie. These girls were young and naive and failed when they did not think well, anyone could make a mistake, so this movie is good for everyone. There is no difference between young people or the elderly - we are all humankind and mistaken. However, I liked the way he finished the movie - what was really smuggled with drugs? - I would definitely give the movie.
