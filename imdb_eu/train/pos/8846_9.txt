I liked Sidney Lumet's drama. The best word to quote is madness. It takes around one to fifty minutes around the viewer and does not leave until the end of the credits. Believe me, this film will give you the whole path. <br /> <br /> The story is very well crafted and is almost brilliant. It's almost like Tarantino's story more difficult. The play is amazing from all the carriers and from small pieces. Cinematography liked me, it gave me a real feeling as if it were an independent movie. It was very wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie is excited, tiring and mischievous. Watching is hard, but you'll be happy.
