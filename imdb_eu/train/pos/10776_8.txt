"Radiofreccia" is still a good surprise in Italian cinema. The film is based on a book by the Italian singer, Luciano Ligabue, who directs this film and writes a musical score, of course. <br /> <br /> The film is a portrayal of the northern Italian province of Emilia Romagna. in the region. We are in 1975, the first radio station for boys in the movie "Radioraptus". The issues of young people, friendship, love, sex, individual dramas and unemployment are among those issues, but the film also talks about drugs. -Freccia, the main character, is a victim of heroin slavery. <br /> <br /> Without a boredom and a moralist, the story is spilled very well; The spontaneity of the actors is powerful and straightforward. Undoubtedly Luciano "Liga" Ligabue is not Fellini nor a professional film. First of all he is a musician. But he has made a good product. Unfortunately, the second movie "Da zero a dieci" does not repeat success - it's not a good thing. <br /> <br /> "Radiofreccia" are not very popular actors, in general, Stefano Accorsi is the only star. One of the most famous young Italian actors. See the Italian singer-songwriter, Francesco Guccini, a communist barman and a nice football coach!
