I do not know how and where the Iranian director reflects when they come up with such a plot. In fact, many plots of directors may be very simple, but may even be screened on a movie that is not Jafar Panahi. <br /> <br /> Movie 2 is like a rotating world. at the same time, one that is related to each other - the battle between football matches and sex that occurs behind the stadium walls. <br /> <br /> You feel like you're in the movie and you're one of those characters, and while you're watching the movie, you'd like to watch football match. You will feel the same excitement as those of the film's actors. It is included in the way you see it at the end, if you want to know the verdict, you will see what will happen to the girls. <br /> <br /> I like conversations between each other. the burning girl and the military soldier. Venus is like VS Mars. It really shows the difference between thinking between men and women and women, equal rights and opportunities, especially in a patriarchal society like Iran. <br /> <br /> This is the second I saw the movie Jafar Panahi (Crimson Gold first) and I look forward to looking more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have linked myself to Iran's films, which is essential!
