Most criticism is a movie that is in the midst of Antonioni's fast, as a bad look at the American culture and politics of the 1960s. As we deserve, I have found shocking and memorable films like La Vivura, because it shows emotion and empathy more than anywhere else. The story is simple, but Antonionian's excellent observations and supposed consumer culture are used to criticize Americans, students' lives, anti-culture and anti-war anti-war. <br /> <br /> From a simple technical point of view, a very elaborate film; the initial credits sequence, the unusual desert in "love", the use of fencing and 17 camera configurations until the last Katahart period. The Wild Bunch). Also, Antonioni chose one of the main ladies, Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful screens. There is not much involvement in "interpretation", that is, it feels like a docu-drama, and therefore the use of non-professionals is that the excellent couple works effectively in this context. The soundtrack is not only full of wonderful music, its use is also impressive (I can not start the movie because of Pink Floyd's music selection, because it uses the images correctly). <br /> <br /> I recommend that people like the opposite, this is a great achievement for film, and I like anyone who likes or tolerated. Well worth looking for, and one of the 60's key roles that requires DVD restoration / release.
