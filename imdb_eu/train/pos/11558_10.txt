The film "The Odd Couple" is one of those films that exceeds its reputation. Everyone knows everything, they're amazed by the theme song, they're complaining of a "Oscar" or a "fiery Felix" ... but they're not selling any movie yet. This is just a straight guy who is not a relaxed guy who lives quietly; The divorce agony is a portrait of two friends who help each other. From the beginning to the end it is also fun, but it is a type of comedy that creates realistic, stressful and horrible situations. So, some viewers have actually found the movie to be uncomfortable, but I think that its authenticity is the strength. Besides, it breaks the face of Matthau bulldog! My favorite comedy, a country's mile.
