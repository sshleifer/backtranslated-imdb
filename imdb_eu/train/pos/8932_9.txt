The film is not spectacular in the ordinary sense. He does not present beautiful photographs. Instead, the visual film is interesting. The audience can continually process or perhaps imagine the context of different shots. This type of thing is easy to try, but it is hard to succeed. The backdrop of a genre of film refuses to get the viewer fully responsible. Instead, the movie is played and moved through different genres. The movie loves tricks to be able to enjoy this toy. I think 99% of North American audiences will not get that. If you try to determine the synopsis of the narrative, or philosophical message or symbolism structure of this film, you will lose time. There is not one of them. The movie only feels these genres and others. The only unifying force of the film is Claire Denis's meaning. Kant has many feature films to describe what art is, that is, the enjoyment of the power of judgment, instead of substituting conceptual experiences. The movie is a simple way out and chooses the easiest way to understand what happens. Most movies are not art. Most movies do not approach art. When the movie is done, as it does, and it's a pleasure amongst many audiences, it's a miracle. My negative comment is that sometimes they find the movie in a very simplified way to purchase different thread threads that run through it. Although Tahiti's father-son narrative, though it is unusual, he eventually turns things light and easy. He overwhelms too much.
