I never think an old drawing would bring tears to my eyes! When I bought Casper & Friends: Spooking about Africa, I liked Casper's first cartoon The Friendly Ghost (1945) to see the first drawing, but when I saw the next picture, There's Good Boos To-Night (1948), It broke me! I could not believe the sad and tragic after seeing Casper's fox died! I have never seen other cartoons like Casper! This is the worst of all! It was so bad, I could not see it again. Lassie is like killing the end of the movie. I know it's classical, but it's too much to handle the old cartoonist like myself! If I want to see something old and classic, I'd like to see something happy and fun! But when I think about Casper's cartoon, I think my cats!
