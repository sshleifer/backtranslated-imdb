Bertrand Blier is afraid of French cinema, and in the 1970s people could always be amazed. With his duo fave (Depardieu and Dewaere) and filmed with a regular sex dose (Miou-Miou plays his role, if at least one of the seventies was short, we know that a decade later he would be the best French actor ever). . It is also the first roadmov of the first "Valseuses" because it leads to the viewer's two minor criminals. Those who are happy with family life or just do not know anything more, the movie would be quite astonishing, but this is just a movie, we can think about all the ordinary things in life (working for the car, being at work, etc.). It's a critique of this hypocritical society that we are living here. An excellent job and two things: Young Dewaere is also young as a topper, and of course Depardieu, it would be better if he had to connect French. The film shows that nobody can overcome it. Timeless classical and 20 years later, I still get bored ...
