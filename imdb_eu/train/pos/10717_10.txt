Great show Instead of seeing the same type of old sitcom, the same old thing that shows different "stars", this refreshing show offers a fascinating insight into the status of the offices. For 2 years we had been watching a television and when we came back, we were expecting to see this show on W. Shame on Global in all the shows available. I thought this would be a winner. We can be realistic, doing BETWEEN TRANSFORMATIONS. I like everyone who is talking about this show and I think that Global World was a long way off. I think I want to make efforts with the typical shows of the typical US concepts, it was a great promise to launch the show from Canada. I am not mistaken, I enjoy a lot of shows on TV, but come to the people, keep up the variety. The unique show gave a complete overview of comedy about the life and relationship of office life, with special characters that you can not see in the current or past sitcoms. It was very wrong to say that this was not a nonsensical mistake.
