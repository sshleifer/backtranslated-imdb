I watched this movie in theaters when I was 6 or 7 years old. I liked it then, and I recently came up with a VHS version. <br /> <br /> My children between 4 and 6 years old love this movie and have repeatedly asked to see it. <br /> <br /> I saw more. Even though I have to admit that it is not a good TV a bit. <br /> <br /> I do not have older children, I do not know what they thought. <br /> <br /> The songs are pretty. My daughter continues to sing again and again. <br /> <br /> I hope that helps.
