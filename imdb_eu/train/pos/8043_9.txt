I've heard people say that the movie is sad and sad. I do not think it's a good movie. This is not a prototype action movie, thank God. <br /> <br /> This is the psychological drama about the rookie and his tutor that just happens to kill people. In this way it works very well, with the best performances of Berenger and Zane (which does not fit asleep in other roles) really resembles the theater. to the end of the action - there was not much sense in it and it was not happy to complete the rest of the film. But see Zane's face, while terrified, while Berenger makes dirty work.
