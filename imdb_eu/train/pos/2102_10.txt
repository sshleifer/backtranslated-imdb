When I sat watching 'Largo Winch', I did not expect any action scenes or fascinating cars. When I was up, I saw both; and more. <br /> <br /> In the end, Karl Roden was not antagonist at the beginning of the movie. Kristin Scott Thomas played a great role, but I think the two real stars were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, brilliantly playing. Radivoje was depicted in Bukvic's Goran. <br /> <br /> The mixed linguistics brought color to her, but I understand why people would get bored. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at the landscape of Hong Kong and especially the stunning coastline of Croatia, and I barely missed my eyes on the screen when I entered the beautiful Largo Island. <br /> <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500 and BMW 7; If anyone loves the expensive limousine; This is his movie. It is a film directed towards people who like action scenes, good performance, great landscapes and especially fast-moving and well-written action, with fascinating battles and wonderful interior theater. /> My vote, as the dark day has clarified, is that: 10/10
