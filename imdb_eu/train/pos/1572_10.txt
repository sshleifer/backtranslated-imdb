When reading the opinion of another user, when it says it's a great game, I could not be idle or do nothing! <br /> <br /> Well, this game is very good, with news clips (with two real people, full of humor and credibility!), it's a good story! I complain only of the enemies when they start to die when they disappear; and some frustrating situations in the LEILA VR missions on a bicycle, here and there ... <br /> <br /> Except for that, it's a great game with wonderful story, good graphics, great characters, excellent soundtrack. ... I recommend it! I'm sure! It may be old, but still nice! At least in Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version will be the same.
