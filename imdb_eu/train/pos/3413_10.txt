Just come out and you can not believe that great documentary. You rarely get a movie theater and you're surprised. In recent times, the films have increased so much, a thrill that is rarely found to find something really special and unique. Amores Perros did this for the first time and the movie is being made for me. I did not know about that, and what was surprising. If you listen to the concept, that is, it is one of the most exciting films about a superb musical victory and we are trying to convince you, but then let's not let it go. Fortunately, this movie is not. People tell the story! This makes every moment of his work in his world and the second feeling that we feel with them. All that goes much further on that rise is more complete. The Voiding Touch was an exciting way to showcase the mountain climbing document and the intensity, but this movie is much more human. I saw it today, but I'll go and I'll say that it is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.
