Michelle Rodriguez is a crucial actor and can be the main driving force behind other actors. It is the hope that must be acknowledged for the hope (and what is to be expected) of the role of a very strange girl with her courage in the beginning of her career. Later on, although the film is linked to the same role, this film was made for a rough one. <br /> <br /> His character is a student / fighter / lover romantically struggling to overcome the imbalance in his projects. a little bit in the movie ... but not a girl. This aspect of this film is not very original, but the story goes deep into the warm relationship that the girl has to face when she boils and starts her anger. <br /> <br /> 'The cast took an actor when he made films, and I'm glad that this Hollywood tour is getting this. This movie is an average story of the young ghetto for me, it's been 7, but it's a great actor that has rarely seen the role in the minimal film budget. Great job
