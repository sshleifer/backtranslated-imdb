"Panic" is a fascinated and blurred giant movie, with a young moon unveiled with the reconciliation of a goddess of middle-aged late-boyhood, with his wife and son, the duty of his employer and his father's personality. The film has an immensely endearing effect and is an ambitious ending, but it is an excellent production in almost every aspect. The storyline and clarity of the characters can be so fascinated and annoyed by a story that can not prove so.
