When I first saw this movie my father was there. He encouraged me to watch this movie, because it's one of its favorites. After watching the movie, it soon became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> It crosses the river It is about the two brothers that give way to two lives. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is the oldest of the two brothers and is on the path to education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is a young rebel brother, who goes through obstacles. The film will follow these characters because each one follows its path. <br /> <br /> There's no problem with this movie. The path will be completely entertained. Playing, directing and scripting is perfect. Extraordinary things are both filmography and score. Both Robert Redford brings you into the world that creates you. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful classic movie, to be a classic. I'm sure in my book. If you have not seen this movie, as soon as you can see it, it will stay forever with you.
