A flying crew made by a space crew of about 20 space (literally) travels on Earth over a hundred millions of years ago to a land that is banned in a colony that was created 25 years ago. What a man finds is a more advanced robot than anything else that can be imagined on the ground, a beautiful and completely social young woman, and a philologist who is visited by his father, more than the devil of ancient civilization. <br /> <br /> On the cover, the story is: a ghostly mystery. Some compare it with the Shakespeare's Tempest, but this is a stretch, and in some ways, an insult to the scifi genre. Scifi is a movie, surely, called The Tempest, but how many hundred movies can it be given? <br /> <br /> Below is a story about advancement and technology, and a social evolution that requires adequate and safe use. However, the film continues with all the expectations of the future and we expect from the shows like Star Trek. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anne Francis is not the only reason that describes the most beautiful movie. The special effects, as well as the aesthetics of backgrounds, can not be addressed by those who are more powerful and imbalanced. If you were not going to be a goofy science fiction retro art series in the 1950s, you would see a piece of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This is a classic sub-genre. I like science fiction in the 1950s, and I do not think it's best for anyone interested in the science fiction movie and special effects. The clear plot, now Star Trek, Lost in Space and even Farscape reuse for reuse for six or seven passages, is very well worth the effort and keeps the interest of most of the fans of science. Trekkers will be interested in different aspects of the film, it seems inspired by Star Trek's 12-year-old series. However, the sexism of the 1950s (quite mild) and feelings of any kind would be felt. race integration I do not mean, even though this movie has no social progress, it was the main problem. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, surely, this movie will make Leslie Nielsen young and well-known in one of her main roles. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is average and sometimes poor diarrhea is right (especially at the finish line). Walter Pigeon, in spite of his many other films, goes beyond his role. Mrs. Francis and Earl Holliman and the Robby Robots are superb agents in the field of people, but in general, the band's actors work well. With the worst problems, I think, the blame of the director and the editor is, like anything else. Without a doubt, most of the movies were OK.
