My friend recommended this movie, in Des Howl, my main character, referring to my voice and similar similarities. I think that, as far as I can see, and maybe a little more, I do not know whether it is a wonderful portrait. <br /> <br /> This is a unique work, this is the only movie. More than one eye resemblance would be True Romance, not the content or style of the filming or the rhythm of the conversation (Whale Music so much more, well, calmly.) But they represent the two modern love stories. <br /> <br /> In general, Canadian films are about music and musicians (for example, I recommend it at the Hardcore Logo) and this film is particularly important. It has an unusual charm, Des always is not always the best, but it is something that generates empathy.
