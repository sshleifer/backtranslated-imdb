"Itch in Time" Bob Clampett is one of the home-based households, WB, in the early 1940's, including "Horton hatches The Egg" and "Tortoise Wins Hare A Hare". It is immersed in a manic and excessive time, especially a saga of a flea that works for a new house, and a broken dog that breaks the dog. The master Elmer will give him a terrifying bath, despite his scratching, the painful misfortune of a dog suffers from a spiral uproar to clear the earth through corruption. Eventually, this small monster threw it into the back of the victim to a small explosive coaster. The explosion is horrible, and bad appearance opens its eyes on the back on the fourth of July. This is really a hurt and the dog takes a flight, but he stops the action and says with a happy smile: "I will cut you better, I think I like it." Years were confirmed in these years by kinky, but the current recordings have recovered the clips, so today the audience can enjoy the original glory with the devil. Still cuts, however, the cats cry out, "Now I've seen everything!" This was a normal birth in the WB, but since then this drawing has been cleared and others, such as 'Horton'.
