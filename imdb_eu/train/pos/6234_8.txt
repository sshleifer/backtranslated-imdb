This is my favorite Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie. Both conversations are so nice and fun and very clear. This film is not mentioned by some of the best songs recorded by both films. As I put my eggs in a single basket and let music and dance. If I remember correctly, the movie was presented to Fred Astaire, so it will always be a special place in my heart (I'm sorry for the most sensitive feeling but I am a woman, so I'm over). All of this film gets 8/10 for me. It has been an excellent choreography and Lucille Ball is even more so.
