I love this film 'Spring and port wine'. In Leigh, 7 miles from Bolton, I was born and I went to Bolton in 1965. When I was 20 years old. My job was done daily by Little Lever through Farnworth, sometimes on a bicycle but on a car, then I paid for it. Films almost always reappears all the memories of the working class, but they always help you who it might be. Fred Dibnah Bromwich St. he was in the corner. If you have not seen the movie for the first time, you will be sorry to compare it with a soap with Coronation St, I agree that it's a soap, but then 'Kitchen Sink Drama!' He was called. Check out this movie for talented cast. Shortly afterwards, they became the original names of television roles; above all, I see that I feel the people's plans and the poor but happy people.
