The story of Hare Rama Hare Krishna, when she saw the fallen values ​​of hippy and Kathmandu who came to Dev Anand, visited Calcutta after protests against Prem Pujari. It was a small spirit that was against its film and some burned posters of Prem Pujari. But the story of a hippie's life that devours a movie to Dev's mind is awakened. Dev Anand was perhaps the best managerial effort. The movie was super-successful at the box office and Zeenat Aman Dev's sister had a great impact. <br /> <br /> This movie was called by Dev Anand to support the moral value of the nation. <br /> <br /> It's about a Monterreal-based Indian family, and his brother is very loving for his sister. But parents fight and separate their father Prashant (Dev) and Jasbir (Zeenat). He tells us repeatedly that his mother and his brothers are dead, and in the end, he says he'll never see Prashant again. <br /> <br /> His friends treats him badly and runs away from home. Dev grows up to become a rider and learns that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with some hippy. <br /> <br /> To get together with her sister, Dev goes to Kathmandu and meets Shanti (Mumtaz). Janice is also Jasbir, with a new name and identity. He has forgotten his childhood and Dev too. <br /> <br /> Dev is suspected as a thief in Kathmandu and expects people to suspect people after their life. <br /> Dev Anand has directed and directed this story. We will see more about Aman than Mumtaz. But Rahul Dev Burman's music was well-formed. Dev offered the music for Sachin Dev Burman for the first time, but Burman Da did not want to make a movie for Dev. Although Dev was very close and Prem Pujari was his first movie, but it was the opposite of Calcutta. Burman Da Dev wanted to try a lighter theme, as the hippie cult movie could spark the anger of the people as an outrage for Dev. But Dev's Burman is ongoing with an innovative film and the movie was a success. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> R Burman wins Ashi Bhosle's Dum Maro Dum. Kanchi re Kanchi was another good number. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a good movie.
