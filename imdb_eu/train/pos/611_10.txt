I say that everyone is responsible for creating / approving the trailer for this movie. I do not know that I wanted to see this film based on the movie previews, and they all really saw (I know that) who loved ... The advertising campaign is shame / destruction / madness. <br /> <br /> Open behind # 4 ... <br /> <br /> # 1-Rush Hour, I did not see, average rating of around 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2-Bourn Ultimatum, I've seen an awesome movie, but 3rd week away, the average IMDb 8,7 score (I'd say I'd be worth it). <br /> <br /> # 3-The Simpsons Movie, I've seen, well, but the fourth week, the average score of 8.1 8.1 (which I think a bit high). <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust, 8.4 Average average score (below Bourn, but that's been our 3 weeks). <br /> </ p> <p> Due to the fact that advertising is inadequate or inadequate, I believe that the competencies behind this movie have led to a great deal of time! Can you announce this fantasy / fairy and not as a fairytale as a stunning movie? Very bad :( In any case, now I do not make much difference and ... Awesome movie, go see!
