This movie has taken a lot of sticks. When the critics arrived, Nicolas Cage's career was crisis-free. People do not think that having an epic Oscar of an opponent of a movie does not have an excellent "Bruck-buster" action. Fast cars, fast editing and excellent soundtrack. It's what he's saying. At the same time, it is just a drink that you like. Everything has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and do not forget Eleanor! I think it would be hard for you to find a better action movie and, personally, a better movie! So again, maybe, it's just for me!
