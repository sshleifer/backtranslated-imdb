This show is about three little girls. (D.J, Stephanie and Michelle) Their mother is killed by a dead driver, so her father, Danny, invites her brother-in-law (Jesse) and her old friend (Joey). So, the whole show is about life. Girls spend life problems and have life lessons. They develop tears, boyfriends, and much more. The whole show will basically go. You do not have to miss it. I think this show is very good and fun. When I saw this show I grew up and I still see it today. I'm glad I'm still gettin 'on this television show. Every day I see. The score is 10/10.
