At night, a thief was the best in every final victory. I do not know what people are complaining about when they swear when they say they're afraid of God's acceptance of these films. They ought to find forgiveness and blame the night robber. Do not listen! These films are not only one of the many tribulations, but they are very funny to see in their simplicity. It is a small budget, which is a little obvious but it is not very obvious when you first see it. I had no idea, that's why, in the 1970's, many movie theater films seemed to be a bit small budget. <br /> <br /> Thief tonight tells the story of a young and cynical Patty Myers. Life is like a coming, her husband, and almost all his friends are disappearing in their prophetic warnings. Initially, the movie is not based around it until it's rapture. What happens is that it shows that others that are around them have become Christians and believing in Christ, that is, a lot of people. Everyone who knows and loves it will definitely disappear, and everyone who is behind is who denounces himself. No one can ever blame themselves forever, because there is always reason. <br /> <br /> Like the jokers that complain about the movie. These people must be adults. I am thirteen years old and you are not crying, I was especially like Patty when I was rebuilding Christ in my heart. For those who have not seen, if you want to wipe a Christian movie instead of stereo instead of others, you're in the wrong movies, just like A Thief In The Night. Do not touch before trying. Something new is always good. Trust your instincts.
