We saw the VCR and were fascinating. I do not know anything about this true story, I thought: "Oh, no, P.Brosnan, American American (in the" Red Indian "), what a bad opportunity" I found the truth about Gray Owl. The film works well to show the dignity of these original nations and undermine rational myths about them. And Annie Galipeau, WOW, which is as compelling as beauty and an Indian woman (I think she is French-Canadian, but that's why it's going to be translated into well-known words). However, as Brosnan's uncomfortable style and scream, he is enduringly credible and generous as a man. The plot is a bit fragile to turn its trapper into an animal conservative. A good movie, highly recommended.
