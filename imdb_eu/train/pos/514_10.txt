It's one of the best British films ever, if not one of the best films ever made. Acting in a writing, cinematography, direction and solo class. This film works on many levels. So why are not ribbons available, DVDs. Have you ever seen on TV? Why is it hidden when it is regularly exhibited in London movie theater halls for packaged houses?
