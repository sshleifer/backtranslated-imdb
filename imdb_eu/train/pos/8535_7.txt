This work is a bold look at the men who find themselves in a wheelchair. This movie never tones this, cotton candy, or gentle soap disease, confusion and the life of these guys. That's the strength I think. But even the performances are fantastic, the well-designed and delivered interview draws you and a bit of experience. Characters never strive to try to block the viewer, that is, what they are in their hearts. <br /> <br /> I found it nice but it's nice. <br /> <br /> 6.6 / valued from 10 ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend :.
