In the end I rented the animated version of Lord of the Rings after watching the video's live action FANTASTIC 2001. The Peter Jackson-directed trilogy directed by Peter Jackson will undoubtedly be much better than the trilogy of "Star Wars" by George Lucas (it will be a real fantasy series of the 21st Century ever) <Br /> < I remember seeing the baby's animated version and I did not understand the depth of the film at that moment. As I read books, I understand what the whole story is. Indeed, some characters are quite absurd (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying for Star Wars Episode One Jar Jar Binks (AWFUL!)) It's almost a bit worse, and it enters two parts of the book, the two towers. Good things is a fun activity, and some animations are very prominent at the time. The bad things end up in two with the two towers , Without attempting to destroy a Frodo ring, and animation looks pretty old in front of current rules. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not so bad as everyone is saying, BUT, 2001 z The latest action version is The New Lord of the Rings! Ralph Bakshi took at least one script seriously! Peter Jackson has said that the animation version inspired reading books, which at the same time led to the creation of one of the greatest fantasy series ever made, so we could thank Ralph Bakshi at least for this! I will take the animated version Lord of the Rings on the day of Harry Potter's live version! <br /> <br /> A version from version 1 to 1, which is seven times less than the 2001 version of the action. but very close as well! The Lord of the Rings's book and movie enthusiasts.
