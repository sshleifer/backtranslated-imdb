Unfortunately, before seeing this movie, I do not know Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> I had to do some research, because it really did not guarantee the disease, as well as its nature. well?), what was wrong. I was completely looking at this beautiful lady. He threw it successfully. <br /> <br /> Who would think that the last wishes and special needs of a young woman would be sexually explicit as to be romantic and tender? Well, perhaps, when the right performers present themselves correctly, like this wonderful movie. I forgot this movie, Miss Carter, how vividly she saw her. I have often said that it was the most beautiful creature that lurked in our land, but it seemed that this particular movie was drawing on its head. <br /> <br /> I hope anyone watching this movie. As I enjoyed it. Thank you for expressing my opinion.
