Although the melodrama is in the center or, rather, under this film, the story is beautifully and firmly cited and the play is excellent. <br /> <br /> Yaja, studying at Princeton, returns to his native Israel, Talia, his oldest friend and dear, a funeral. Yaara lived with his mother's parents almost after his mother died and lost his adopted sister. And since Yaara, born blindly, guided and guarded Talia, suicide her friend because it is impossible, understandable. <br /> <br /> The girl is blind to solve the mystery. death Without vision, it even has a vision. Although he can not see, he finds what is outside of people around him. In this way, Yara becomes a mysterious absorption of reflections on the relationship with Talia, her family's adoptive home, ribbons, newspapers and Tali's past and present people. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of Yara's accounts, the movie is also seen from its perspective, because it sees, believes and imagines what it is. The solution to the mystery is common, but the search is so sharp and rigorous and it gives the answer a very beautiful and pleasant response, easy to leave. Truths are gradually emerging, it is still impossible, not only to tell the life, but also to clarify the relationship with Yaara.

At the end of the film we fully admire its ability to find its place in a trusted world. <br /> <br /> Specifies the modifications that are repeated in the place and actions that are small and meaningful and never change. - An interesting decision to represent the youngest character and the teenager Talia. I will lose the last statement of Yaara with Gadi, along with the latest Talian groom, on the edge of the precipice, but the trip on the edge is so wonderful that the image will last longer than it will be remembered.
