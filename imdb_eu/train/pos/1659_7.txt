A part of the life of the first female painter, Artemisia, tells the story of the superstitious story of a young Italian woman with Artemisia. The film has a costuming and splendid set and good cast and performance. However, he strives to represent the esoteric and temporal art, and is not inspired by the artist's passion to paint in painted canvas and through the participation of men. A good movie for those interested in Renaissance painting or film.
