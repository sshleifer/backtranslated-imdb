"Daytime" is a wonderful image. In some ways, the third type is better than "closed encounters". (I prefer to have a relatively small budget quote for spectacular budgets) whose special effects are EXCESSIVE, but it's a great deal of fun. Jim Davis gives a great performance. One of the best roles ever in a function might be. music score is very good. The story does not make sense. But that only makes more INTRIGUING all. Like many of the best artworks, at the end of the day, it is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. The "end of the day" budget can be a low indie film, but it does not compare the excessive range with the "existing" films of the 1950s and 1960s. (many of them were independent of low-budget productions).
