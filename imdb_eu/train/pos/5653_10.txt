His style was different from that of others, and the whole thing had a horrible air confusion. All you need to do is read all the positive comments (I do not see it as negative) to find out what is really innovative and how to capture the imagination. Now I understand reading comments because it is PRESENT that this is so incredible. What to do to make this set of turkey-shaped "turkey-free turkey" (or maybe still run).
