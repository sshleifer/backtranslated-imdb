"What would you do?" It's a question you'll have after a few weeks after seeing the emotional Brokedown Palace. Likewise, you will be asked if Alice (Danes) knew or did not know the truth about a problem that was left unanswered and reasonably. This is a very well-interpreted and well-filmed movie. Although slow, its pace is a reflection of the line, but many movies will be on the edge of your seat; to know what happens. In the end, Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes will also leave the image of the great characters who interpret well. Bill Pullman's play is also recommended.
