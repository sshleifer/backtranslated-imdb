This movie was beautiful. He was full of memorable images, good performance and tangible themes. It would be very easy to write it to be quite sensitive, but that is the feeling trying to get this kind of movie. I'm totally involved with the story and presentation. Some were in a hurry, but it is still expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint that one can think is that there are not many details. However, this film did not create Joseph Smith's life, ministry, triumphs, debates, errors, etc. One of the most amazing American and historical religious religions of all time was designed with a clear look.
