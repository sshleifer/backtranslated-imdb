I saw this tape, immediately squeezed it again, I saw it again and I laughed twice. I recommend this ribbon for those who do not hate it, but it is uncomfortable about transvestites. This shows that travesty is a characteristic, rather than the integrity of one's own. Comedy is not the only issue. This man is brilliant. All comics want to get rid of limestone, intelligence and talent.
