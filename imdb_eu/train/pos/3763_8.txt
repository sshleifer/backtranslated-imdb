Now it's like this! The first film had some loud conversations and weaker performances, but the group behind it seems to have taken things out of the sequel and made a solid, pleasant, hilarious and creative comedy. all the way <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is full of gorgeous things, full of creativity, and it's not so bad in the 80s. The hell scenes are very good as well as heavenly. There's really no excitement for the adventurous rider, and there's no other movie like that. The last hammock action on the movie is not as bad as the first one; In general, it is mild and pleasant in the heart of the whole family's congratulations. And Keanu Reeves, even though he's been around for 30 years, is not so bad here. <br /> <br /> I like it a lot.
