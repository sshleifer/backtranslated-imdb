After watching this movie at SF Independent Film Festival, I could not wait to get a copy of it. Jim McKay gave a lecture on the Q & A film, which presented his ironic situation: how to get a film that depicts a minority (women, non-whites) in the resolution of controversial issues (teenage pregnancy, teenage motherhood, race identity, ...) single mother houses), and how to write a fake handwriting on all these subjects with a mid-male male in the thirties. A fantasy movie with a maximum adult multi-racial audience, delighting with the exact portrait of the characters and the fantasy portrait of "real life teen". Most teens, however, left the building; That's it, I think it's a movie that is best seen by kids as adults, as a starting point for discussing, because many adults did not feel it, "teenagers should watch a movie about them." That's why questions about the distribution: how can we get hands? Internet (retailer) would be an excellent way; that is, a movie that will bury the modern "Pups" or other modern teen films. McKay was the most responsive. As a writer / conductor, McKay's work was very sensitive and accurate, because it linked the film's Crown Heights neighborhood to the viewer who had to work with actors. Be - a realistic, unsatisfactory result.
