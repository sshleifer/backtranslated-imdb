Just at the beginning I saw Bugs Bunny (first time it was named here) and Elmer Fudd cartoons linked to ThadBlog YouTube. Chuck Jones was the first time of "wascally wabbit", and Bugs is a different voice from Brooklyn / Bronx that we know from Bug Blanc. Actually, as Thad says, Jimmy Stewart is focusing (the "shy" type of that era). In any case, when Elmer buys his pet, Bugs is misunderstood by echoing all the radio stations, his master repeatedly showering his shower, saying "Turn off the lights!" When Elmer catches her in bed. In a different voice, Bugs himself is evil and I am nervous all the time! According to Thad, there was another scene at the end of Elmer at the Bugs's home, but it was probably sad that it was considered because of this point, the scene is cut. is lost In any case, I recommend the Elmer's shell rabbit.
