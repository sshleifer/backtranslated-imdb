That's why I turned to digital channels for subscribers two years ago and thought I had to watch "Girlfight" for half an hour as he was expecting to start "Hart's War." I figured it was a "B" exploitation about bands of urban girls that I calculated with a title. <br /> <br /> My surprise was not about that. Instead of playing well, a good story about a young woman in boxing women is well done. He is responsible for bringing his young brother to his practical sessions and is interested in watching his interest. As he does not really want to be a boxer (just following his father's wishes) he will convince the coach to replace him. <br /> <br /> The story is developed intelligently and unbelievably after testing. To begin with, his brother's coach does not want a boxer to take a woman. After grudgingly, aligning matches is their problem. Then he learns what happens to his father. Yes, the interest of love is developed, but it is useful for improving the plot, which interacts with more interesting human interactions, related to the consequences of its struggle. <br /> <br /> All this, jacket, is a great sunset. They seem to have heard little. Some time later when I saw the acclaimed "Million Dollar Baby", I thought "wait a minute, which seems to be familiar." Needless to say, that night I did not see the "Hart's War".
