I'd like to know all the fans of this documentary because Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I'm very proud of him. The mini-series featured on VH1 is an excellent look at the culture of the last 30 years and the uncle worked very hard. I have had time and effort in this documentary and have started to watch everything (Can not Find My Way Home) on TV. I know what he loves and does well. He spoke of his own eloquence in conversations and in the amazing comments he added. From music to video, and on the other hand, it is an excellent documentary that shows the experience of drug culture in the eyes of those who have lived. I appreciate any comments I like (or not) and I'd love to hear fans! Three applause for Uncle Martin!
