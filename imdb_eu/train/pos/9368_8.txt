I returned from the two-hour show, and I was very happy when I left the movie. It's very lively, and the closest one in a movie I've been crying for a long time. That's Sand Sandler, who gives a good performance at many levels, and who probably deserves Oscar, if he did not go to the start of the year. Don Cheadle gives his usual direct behavior to the man with Adam. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of humor, but most of it is fun with only tears compared to Adam, with his loss, and he wants to help. Adam plays two very good levels ... when it is a steady intellect, it's fun and enjoyable, but then, well, it's less stable, strong and dark. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend that anyone who likes friendship and loss of drama about difficult troubles.
