This and the "Hidden Fort" are Kurosawa with my loved ones. I do not distribute 10 like sweets, but it's definitely worth it anyway. Although it is quite long (it is similar to that of Kurosawa), it has agreed to a trace of most of its films; stories are often loose and slowly evolving, unnecessary or excessive scene, with the purpose of describing the story or characters. Dodesukaden himself gave me the experience of "Hidden Fort". In spite of it, I did not cut it for a minute. <br /> <br /> Although a regular Kurosaw movie is not very common, it has no story, but it is much more based on smaller independent stories. Unlike Kurosawa, I've seen so far, unlike any other movie, a description of the characters. In the same way, it will be much more focused on the conversation, which uses it perfectly (especially the father's son and the son of "his house"). <br /> <br /> Still doing a masterpiece describes how the subject is so manageable as it is so tragic, so humanly and sympathetic, pointing to where it is now. From the beginning to the end, it gives an emotional scale in laughter and tears in perfect balance.
