Heaven to Go All Heaven, in my opinion, is the best animated film ever made. I am not a fan of animated films, but there is something better than any other movie I have ever seen. It is a wonderful music, such as Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise and especially Ken Page's King Gator shows. "Let's make music together", perhaps, is my favorite song in any of my favorite music films. This is definitely essential for people of all ages.
