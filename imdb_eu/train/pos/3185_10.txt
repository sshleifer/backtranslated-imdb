The fairy tale ... Ten times ten years ago against all age and sex media ... not even a lot of comedy (compared to almost totally wet movies) is quite fun. It's not a fan of music, so it's probably too much for me, but it's time to keep a drink or soda out of it without losing anything important. Maybe it was a version in the fifties that was a relationship sally? Ahab is not really, but I'm sure you'll like this movie as if it were mine ten in the end. It really leaves you feeling hot, what you might remember and what it was like to have the love to do. My summary is best described in a few words ... it's very charming
