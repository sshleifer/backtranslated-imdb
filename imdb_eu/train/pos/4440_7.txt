Since Ogro was published in 1988, it has not been very successful, and I think it's a reason that maybe the subtitle "Demons 3" was bestowed to sell it better. . Well, this film is directed by Lamberto Bava; The first two demons films, and the men behind ogres and demons are the same (both are 'monsters'), but this movie has no connection with other films. However, it's good! Italian filmmakers are well known that their well-known films are being extracted and it is not clear; I think this has influenced Hellraiser. Land, his husband and son focus on a horror writer moving to an Italian castle. When a baby was there he was immersed in memories and found an ogre that is in the basement. There's a lot going back into the castle before returning these views ... and maybe it's a case because it thinks it's a deadly ogre living in the basement. <br /> <br /> The movie was, of course, He was shot in a budget and was made for Italian television, so it would not be realistic for him to expect something excellent; But for that, a horror movie is very decent. Lamberto Bava might not have a passionate eye on his father Mario; But it takes time to build a real atmosphere to complete the movie well. The central area, a huge castle, is the perfect place to make a story like that, and Lamberto does the best; even though sometimes it is necessary to rip up top-level movies; For example, the Inferno style pool. The plot is not as good as the atmosphere, because the scene is too long and the relationship between characters is strange (especially between husband and wife). There is no major blood flow, but Bava does a little bit with special effects. The work itself is very nonsensical and it's a good job we do not often see. We read an aptitude, if it is foreseen, the end and, in general, this movie is much better than expected and is recommended.
