I really liked Timothy Dalton, though Mr R. Mr was young and beautiful, but Zelah Clarke was also wrong and short. This version, however, was very similar to the novel and shot very well. I've seen 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite Mr R, although George C Scott has done well and Joan Fontain and Sussanah York are a raffle, although they are both too old. Recently, I watched a great television version with Rebeca, with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. When I first saw Ciarin Hinds, I'd like to see the version of Jane Eyre. I think I was Jane Eyred, but I will never get bored with the first minutes of hearing the voice of Joan Fontaine. I've never seen the first version. I always want to go back to read the book again.
