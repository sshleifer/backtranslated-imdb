Elephant Walk (1954). At the beginning, Peter Finch was depicted as the lord of the house, in abandoned plantations of God, and there is always danger of elephants or English, at midday and in the sun. Well, eventually, after the burst of typhoon or cholera, of course, and much more Mayhem. Taylor replaced a boiler / adventure in Vivien Leigh's illness. When Elephants attacked the house and caught Liz on the stairs. Thanks in part to Dana Andrews to save the day. My favorite pleasures. In color too!
