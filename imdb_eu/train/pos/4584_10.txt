I did not see all Chan's movies, but it's the best I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Your own story is nothing special, so I did not get it. Enter more deeply. What is unique is stunts, fighting, good acting, humor. The movie is dumped all the time and you are still visible. All cool exercises (of course, by Jackie himself) want to leap around the couch and screams. It's wonderful! Even though my mother saw a horrible movie surprised. <br /> <br /> I know that the history of the police can be pretty hard, at least here in Sweden. But I can assure you that it's worth it.
