Jeff Wincott is not just a hunk, he can run. This film has been one of the best martial arts movements I have ever seen. Well, so maybe Bridgette Nielson would not hire me as a ruthless person in the first political person, GREAT did a job anyway! We must not forget that Wincott has partnered with Karen Sheperd's martial arts and cartoon artist. So it is not Cynthia Rothrock, who CARES?! It's as good as it is, if not better! (Look at her movie scene at the end of the movie, a word: OUCH!). My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, if you have not seen it, you are missing out on the martial arts action you are really missing.
