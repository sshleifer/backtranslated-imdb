A new civil war with historical drama and colorful people in New Orleans. He begins to wake up, but he's getting tougher people and he's getting started on the floor. This is not a story about the exploitation of black women, because people were free. All white rights may not be, but they certainly controlled more than their fate rather than the ancestors of the slave. Young men in this story must choose their own way of life, be persecuted or optimally residing in the system and help their community. They liked all the characters, but their favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
