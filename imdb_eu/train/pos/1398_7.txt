Another episode of childhood, as an adult, I look back at another point of view. This was one of my favorite episodes of my childhood, for which he consolidated the worship of this show. However, after spending 20 years, I would like to say that this is the first time and the best time to laugh and play the lightest, rather than the dramatic and well-constructed story of the previous episodes. . Perhaps this section was written for R & R hobbies! As Mr. Spock would say, the story is not logical, but there are some fun lines, such as Mr. Spock's last. When asked by the captain, McCoy et al. As is clear, he raises a eyebrow and says "Fascinating ...", Mr. As Spock can do that way. An interesting story, of course, a really fun idea of ​​a amusement park (for example, a "fake and often annoying" "recreational" Disneyland game) makes your own wishes come true. Really, great idea but not well executed. And Theodore Sturgeon, one of the other great short story writers who used the first season, asks how much tinkering was made by Sturgeon's screenplay. <br /> <br /> Now, there is a bit of curiosity about the curiosities that I have learned in this site: In 1987, James Gunn was awarded the Theodore Sturgeon prize for the best science fiction story. I will mention all of these: In 1968, {Sturgeon} wrote "The Joy Machine", the third screenplay for Star Trek television {Amok Time the other}, which has never been shot. The main reason not used in the series was that they had costly sequential effects over the budget with special effects. However, the script was adapted by James Sci-Fi writer James Gunn (Star Trek # 80, Original Series) and published in 1996 by Pocket Books. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this section is still very enjoyable, especially if you do not think too much about it. We will laugh and enjoy, and the next episode will be able to return to serious things for the protection of the universe.
