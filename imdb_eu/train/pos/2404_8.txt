I'm a great fan of M Lillard, that's why I've finished this movie. Honestly, I doubt that if I did not enjoy it in the movie or even I saw it, I realized that the story was quite decent. I must finish it bad, but I saw it coming. It's a low budget movie and some actors did not work very well, but overall, I mentioned this movie 7/10. <br /> <br /> Lillard really kept me in the way he was asking me. I'm interested in this movie. <br /> <br /> Its a good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
