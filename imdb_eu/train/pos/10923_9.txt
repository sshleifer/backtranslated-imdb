This movie is very good. The plot, which works as a puzzle, thinks and guesses the audience, what happens next. This trick brings a lot of surprises and the viewer guesses a genuinely invention. Fight scenes are very good. There are many different styles of combat (although one of the styles was real for me, but it's my opinion) and it's a wonderful show. They look like the only thing they can do. Slightly (at least for me). Hong Kong was always good at kung-fu movies in the 70s and 80s, especially the best Five Venoms (or other versions).
