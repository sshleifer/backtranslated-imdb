This movie was hysteria. I have not laughed for a long time. I mean, it's not "Will Will Hunting", but was it supposed to? I went into the advanced projection with much less anticipation and I was pleasantly surprised. Comedy is hard and pretty constant. Amanda Peet is hot and wonderful. The whole audience I showed, I liked the movie as much.
