I really liked this movie. Sometimes there was a lack of humor, but I liked the story that was dramatic and serious. This is the second single I saw in the interpretation of Verdone (the other is 'Un sacco bello'), and I understand why the Italian seems to be difficult, but believes that his role has played well with his father. <br /> <br /> I found out that the only drawback to this movie was in the Italian place - in the middle or in the south, I thought, but I did not feel like a place. This movie could take place in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehli ... I always think that watching film is something important to link something to the audience. (Did I miss something?) :) If you like Italian movies, I think you'll enjoy it. It's not a Fellini or Rossellini: it's not realism or neo-realism. We have serious moments that could happen to everyone.
