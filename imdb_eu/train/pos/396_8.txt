You're a legend <br /> <br /> I just remember the original Zu Warriors made by Tsui Hark 18 years ago. In a Christmas, when Channel 4 broadcasted in Hong Kong's Hong Kong movies for a week in the UK, Zu Warriors was so strong for a young audience and his brother, and so it was memorable, he was now recorded in memory. up sprog ... <br /> <br /> Actually, I saw the original Zu Warriors as one of the first films I've ever seen, I clearly remember that I remember the story scene and action. And Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others are seen in his first classical remembrance. <br /> <br /> So when I saw this version of Zu Warriors, there was a feeling of arrest. Could it be overcome by the memories of childhood dreams of the original, or would the remake of other remedies continue in the kung fu movies that will kill the wicked and their necks? <br /> <br /> Well, I can not say the answer. But this is not a remake. Stories (and styles) is almost completely different. <br /> <br /> You Legend tells the story of King Sky, the only loner, his master, his love, but his life. Insomnia called the monster. Two hundred years later, Insomnia returns, regenerates like Dawn Enigma and Insomnia has been destroyed. Meanwhile, White and Red Eyebrows, with the help of King Sky, try to stop Insomnia. <br /> <br /> The plots are not twisted and rounded but enough detail has been for me to be interested. But I love this movie or I see you hate it. The film is very much about special effects, most of which take part in various computer-generated environments, like Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. Unlike the rest of the two, the graphic film was not excessive, and everything went well. There's nothing running running - unlike Hero. The origins were similar to the play and were not staged. <br /> <br /> The story brings together many characters and transforms the mix of many people into an intriguing movie. Perhaps "too many chefs" were on the verge, but in general, each character took part in the story. But I think some roles are "expanded cameos", and somehow I doubt that. <br /> <br /> Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo have a very central role in the film. But I can not say that this movie showed the best performances. It seems that Cecilia Cheung has at least acted out, but they are still quite raw. Kelly Lin was a new revelation for me. Despite being a very short role, I apologize and accept apology! <br /> <br /> In general, I have to say that I enjoy this movie as I enjoyed the 'original'. Due to the fact that both films are based on the legendary Tsui Hark, the two films together are part of the conference as it shows how Hong Kong changed in two decades. And that's a beauty you can not really compare to all the two movies, apples apples and pears are pears. <br /> <br /> In the end, both are pleasing films. to the right. And I recall again the original observation again. <br /> <br /> To see both, but not compare.
