A man who lives in the mountain wakes up early and loses the cat. He walks through the woods to see a murder, but he has seen the murder or has he lost sight of it? Is he aging? The film is so big that it is because the viewer thinks it's going to happen. There are not many interviews in this film, but it does not need words, the whole movie speaks for itself. You know what happened and I liked it. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it was the last autumn and winter forest plans. They were nice, but I did not like the perspective of the old man's clothes. It could tie a bit closer, but the movie was quite profound.
