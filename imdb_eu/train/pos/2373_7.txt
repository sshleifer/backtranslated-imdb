The new film "The H G Wells War of the Worlds", by Pendragon Pictures, has been developing the first faithful adaptation of the original novel for about 5 years. There was a version of this year's theater (March 2005), but this did not happen. DVD Spielbergen version, theater on June 29, came out to match the next version. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie with some reservations. <br /> <br /> Loyal expressions? There is not 100% faithful to the Wellsen book, but 90% - 95% is just enough for me. At least some scenes were completely new, such as the Ogilvy astronomer's confrontation with the peasantry, and the unnamed writer / narrator, with his cousin with heavy tea. But, in general, this movie book continues very closely; Without a doubt, George Palen is much more than the classic version of 1953. <br /> <br /> It's a great mistake, of course, that the budget is very cheap. It seems that most have been shot in blue screens and digitally rendered backdrops. This is particularly annoying in most indoor plans and scenes of crowded streets on the city. The London 1898 summaries seem like a video game. The scenes of horse carts were faked out, I think they could not rent a horse. The only scenes that were shot in "real" seem to be in open areas or in forests. <br /> <br /> But within these budget constraints, they have achieved a lot. Artistically, the movie looks good. Martians and tripods are pretty well done and they are very good about Wells's descriptions. I was particularly surprised. The Thunder Child sequence, although it should be one of the main events of the film, is very disappointing. It's a big pity that there could be no more sets or high quality animated animations. <br /> <br /> The play and the direction are not won by the Oscars. Mostly competent, not bad, but not prominent. Music is pretty good, but not in line with the greatest Hollywood composers. <br /> <br /> I'm really glad that this is not a theater release, as if it were a quote limit. looks much worse on the big screen. As usual, I would like the BBC-TV adaptation of classic literature. <br /> <br /> Some refining: Most scenes are presented with different colored filters (mostly red). It may be an artistic choice, but it is used in an inconsistent way, and DVD mastering seems to be inadequate. The writer / narrator's mustache is fake by changing scene and scene. <br /> <br /> The bottom line - is it worth seeing? If you overcome technical constraints and budgets and take into account the story, I think that you enjoy it, especially if you read the original H G Wells. However, if the price of commodity prices are easily eliminated, you should pass it (if you are a fan of MST3K). Please note, the film is full 3 hours, so I do not recommend that you be sitting there. <br /> <br /> BTW: A completely different version of World War II ("INVASION" called "INVASION")) was released on the DVD at Spielberg's theaters the same month as http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/. It has also been done with the budget, but is now updated as a Spielbergen movie, but it's a lot better! And finally, Jeff Wayne is making an animated film from the album that he has sold since 1978, but this will not be until 2007.
