It's not an excellent idea to watch Hundstage if you are not sure about 100% of your psychic stability, since there will be so much testing on the film as it's sensible. I have to say that Hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment movie, so that most audiences would not have the "maturity" level in their handsome part. Tarkovsky as a movie, but in a different way. I see myself, I can not say, I had fun. But it's a great and very interesting experience, for those who only torment the topic that Hollywood offers. Hundstage is one of the right fingers that goes into your brain and it takes your head to head. You can not just sit back and watch, open an exclamation or glance over the film. A similar movie like this is at Nachtgestalten, but it's been a lot better and less violent. This, for example, is not a child or mentally bidding or temper. Most viewers will probably give this movie 10 or so. I give it to 9 because I have seen several stories in a movie, in another movie, and it was better. But this is an excellent piece of it. It's worth seeing, but ready to see something alarming.
