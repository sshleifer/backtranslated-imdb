Laurence Fishburne is a good actor and is worth a try to respect, but it's not like Shakespeare's great, like Olivier and Welles; and suffers more from Kenneth Branagh. This Irish, always excellent, cleans the show away. He acknowledged the power of Olivier in his production and he knew someone who could revive him. I did not quite realize Iago's choice, the most evil character of Shakespeare, but he shows us the depth of Branagh. I'm glad that Venice also looks.
