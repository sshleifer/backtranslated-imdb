I would like to say that this movie gives birth to a trauma that a young man can face when a family is divided by divorce or other disaster. I would highly recommend this movie especially to people who plan to become a parent or a family. <br /> <br /> The characters have been very attractive and very original from many different dimensions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> I thought it was a great movie!
