It's not unusual for me to enjoy the Invisible Ray of 1936. But we can not forget it. The story is elegant. Karloff is bored in his cartilage reticts in the Carpathian mountains, Janos Rukh is reading genre science to read the ancient beams, to find out about the conflict in a large radioactive event in Africa. He is a clever partner, Lugosi (a strange hero), who studies "astro-chemistry". Frances Drake is a young and very little woman; Romantic temptation by Frank Lawton; and the divine Violet Kemble Cooper is Mother Rukh, in a performance worthy of Maria Ospenskya. <br /> <br /> The story goes through fast with a bang episode, with still beautiful special effects. It also has wonderful lines. Rukh recovers his mother's sight, asks: "Mom, do you see, do you see?" "Yes, I see it more clearly than ever. And I am scared of what I see." Even more, when Rukh says her mother, "she broke the first law of Science." I am not only amazed at what my first law of science is for many years in my acquaintances. <br /> <br /> This movie is an abandoned island material.
