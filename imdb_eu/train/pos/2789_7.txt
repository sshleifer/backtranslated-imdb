It has become a fascinated stroy line that is full of intrigues with scenes like Beckham. About a girl named Jess, she tries to get her dream to become a renowned football player and eventually allows a local team position. There are so many limits and constraints that the faces hold, it still determines and strives. I would recommend anyone who likes a beautiful light film and want to inspire people through what they can achieve. The songs are very good, "swear my children, just move ... to your destination and limitations and complications". In any case, I hope to respond to your needs. Beckham's brilliant movie
