Madhur Bhandar has given everything raw. But the best thing is not to forget about the ingredients. It's short and crisp for the audience and now the viewer is making a choice. Page 3 Page 3 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Madhavi (Konkan Sharma) is a journalist and enjoys her work. A simple and peaceful lifestyle worsens with passionate courage and pleasant friendship. It covers the page of Nation Today Page 3 (Celebrity Page), with the supportive editor Deepak Suri (Boman Irani). But he takes life when he strikes his first blow and leaves his page 3 off and the crime is gone. bit Omigosh! there was a new world waiting there. He is surprised, excited, surprised by the revelation. His reaction has lost his job. Finally returned to page 3. Now when he is known by a celebrity in a party, he knows the real look of each one, hidden behind his face illusion. <br /> <br /> The movie is a message and that's raw. Audiences must get their color. The theme and the script were wonderful. There are very good thoughts to prepare audiences. As an entrepreneur, the exhibition of the club is prior to pedophilia, a brief suspension prior to gay bathroom actions. The interviews are strong and the actors are very good to give it. Charu Mohanty's two words speaks of a great volume and is very successful in arguing these two words, such as ingenuity, to the effect. Selected settings have been better. The songs are not anywhere; but in the background they needed it. The Atul Cigarette has a high impact foil. Some errors were visible. Atul Kulkarni, Konkan Sharma, has explained that honesty must be labeled with understanding. It seems that the conversation could be a better predicament. The meeting between Thaparren and her daughter does not want to act. This scene is not very professional. <br /> <br /> In general, pedophilia incident is an optional option before the incident. This can ruin your mood.
