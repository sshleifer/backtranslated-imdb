This is a completely beautiful and unexpected film. You still have a youngster who expects to qualify for qualifying football between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran has won, he will enter the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that young girls are girls and girls (or women for that) can not get into football matches with "sit" with men. Below is a wonderful comedy, played by a small team performed skillfully. The film examines the nonsense of the restrictions on women's freedom (which is why young people force soldiers). There are excellent pieces set out, especially when the girls go to the bathroom and, of course, the stadium does not have a female connector. The camera's work is the easiest and, to some extent, it could play this story. However, the movie is a small scale that gives its bite. An excellent movie? No, probably not; great entertainment - surely
