The worship of all Russian intellectuals. Everything is brilliant, especially acting: it's out of praise. The movie, as a book, is full of symbols: my favorite is the most glittering symbol of Razrukha (often referred to as "destroyed" Russian verbs, often depicting the chaos of the life of the civil war in 1918-20) - the widest door closes and the brick wall is shaking in the snow Is it black hole holes in the doorway door? <br /> <br /> Now the movie is released on DVD with a completely restored image and 5.1 sound. Also good transliterated subtitles in English, Sharikov's darker words were replaced by softer versions of the translation. I do not know if the DVD is available abroad, but if it is taken immediately, it is worth watching. <br /> <br /> And, as a result, it is true: about 50% of modern-day Russian people, young people, can be largely identified as Sharikovs. It is the Soviet population's influence: Soviet countries seem to be unprepared for information on Western civilization, television makers and filmmakers made the entertainment industry and the media surprisingly aggressive, soul-stricken. Russian instincts. Some third-party Internet users use dark language in forums and conferences, which is very rare in their regular speech.
