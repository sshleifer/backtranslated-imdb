I saw this movie as unexpected, and I do not know anything about it. I love. A very tight and very good plot, a charmer, like the ugly, crunchy and red-haired girl, and the rhythm that accelerates. <br /> <br /> Much better film, the director's De Battre mon coeur has stuck straight. It was boring and disbelief. <br /> <br /> The only thing was not working well. The girl thought it was fat and supposedly not ugly nor fat: solid, certainly, and very convincingly beautiful, but so many characters on her face were on the screen whenever she was there. Excellent. I want more movies and, in general, better ones. I saw Gilles' wife and a mustache a little bit and they looked like both, and I saw De battre mon coeur got all the stitches, and that's litter. It seems that a few will come, so I will cross my fingers.
