I'm a fan of animal films. If you take a plot and put animals as the main actors, you usually earn me. This was Homeward Bound. They took a plot of land that was as old as the time and put a new spin on them. It was a complete success. It is a very archetypal film. You have the group (shadow) obi-wan, as a scholar and logical case, you have a lofty but impulsive and non-confident option, and the Princess and Princess who should overcome and praise her. These three people are very good at each other. I also like how Chance and Sassy made dynamic characters, and they did not delay them. Most people say that it can not be good because there are too many children's films. However, they are forgetting that they are a movie for children, and this is still not removed from the acoustic film. The movie is good when you get bored and just want to watch the movie. Disney is a cartoon movie, with a better cartoon air. Certainly, I would like to consult.
