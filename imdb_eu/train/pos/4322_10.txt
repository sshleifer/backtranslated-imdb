Perhaps you will not take care of the social commentary or filmmakers' perspective (I believe that I am mystified before the gap when it is promoted by Kasdan, when the actions included in the film promote CERTTAIN, they confused me). However, there is no denying the way the story is presented. wonderful symbolism all over; thread characters arcs; visuals; conversation masterwork is absolute. I've seen the movie several times, and I'm still mad at its perfection. Everything that is unrelated to the topic is not a moment, action, cut or line. Real realization of all actors. Scene scene is fantastically woven. <br /> <br /> I have a nice metric level. Rumor has never crossed this film. If you are a thinker (rather than an unknown viewer)? This film gives it. Exponentially. Amazing wealth (Is not it okay to appreciate the message display? Who cares if it is hot or fuzzy, was it interesting?) <br /> <br /> Personally, did the movie affect me? remarkably My 5 at the top. <br /> <br /> Note: The reviewers in the previous page clearly speak of an incorrect perception of African Americans. He could not admit, something, was his hand? shake It's not by hand. The white man spiritually dead ", he saw a man respect and admire. And he did something. Since he was black, he was not related to it (the only color is used to draw a parallel, and the cave is used to color the black and white sequences of the beginning of the story). If you watch black movies 'token' ?? YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOURSELF. Maybe you will only see black and white, right? Just a thought.
