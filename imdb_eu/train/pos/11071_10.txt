It's one of the best ten films I've ever had. Imagine, surprised and amazed at the whole picture, Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and all the crew, a wonderful game of stunning land ... Look at yourself and take it to your courage to accept it - it touched the soul, because it's strange, but there are all the answers you're looking for. ... best, sir. Ritchie! NEVER STILL. Those who looked for simple images and fights, crying. But there are many Hollywood films, but you can not remember what you saw the next day. On the contrary, it is the only Revolver, I could hardly ever hope to portray the picture and lightness of all of my imagination. Undoubtedly, amazing, brilliant ... I can not get that seen, I'm not sure about it. Actually, there is no word to express my admiration ... I still wonder how we could see this hilarious Hollywood movie after that. Thanks heartily, it's just the best.
