FORBIDDEN PLANET is the award for Best Golden Age Film SF Films. The movie is amazing. As the spacecraft comes in between the audience - by crew of ships - it travels with intelligent and sometimes horrible adventures. We will find Robbie unforgettable, mysterious Dr. Morbuis, beautiful and innocent daughter Altair, and old people on the planet - The Krell died that night. Or were they? <br /> <br /> You can make mistakes and say that the planet, of course, is painted in a studio shot, but I feel the sense of claustrophobia and I feel Bebe and Louis Barron's electronic music. <br /> <br /> I am impressed by this film among the best 250 IMDB films.
