The best horror novelty of Cheryl (horror Bryant) will be the summer vacation, with Tom's husband (pleasant Paolo Serra) and Bobby's son (a well-interpreted Patrizio Vinci) who will be traveling to a remote rural area. As the local legend says, the area is damned. Cheryl, who lives in the basement, dressed in a terribly terrifying costume from David Flosi, has found her hairy, hairy, and wicked. Cherry needs to overcome fear of childhood horror to defeat the evil discovery. Lamberto Bava and co-author writes an expert on creating and maintaining a bad and confusing nightmare. In addition, Bava does not prevent the traditional and fairy tale of the traditional evening fairy, who fights the traditional way of preventing the routine of the fairy routine. Sabrina Ferillik Anna, a friendly teacher like Stefania Montorsi, a kindergarten, and Maria Dario Dario, thanks to Sabrina Ferillo. Gianfranco Transunto's glossy filmography monitors fluids and there is a lot of atmospheric lighting. Fabrizio Sforza's raw makeup, Simon Boswell's immensely mind-bending reflections and intricate corners and roofs covered corners at the skin's crawl site. Enjoy viewing.
