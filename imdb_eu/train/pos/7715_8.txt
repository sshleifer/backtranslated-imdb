First of all, consider this film almost fifty years! However, it remains one of the greatest films of all time. I wonder what many current celluloid productions will talk about in 2050? <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but strong enough and the effects are bad day-to-day phenomena. I still remember the first time I saw it, the baby, when the monsters enter the field of force that protects the ship, and you need to see its scheme for the first time (and only). He scared me afraid, I'll tell you. What looks like today, but it is still effective enough. <br /> <br /> The scenes with the Tiger are now showing age. You can see the scheme immersed in Tigre Altaira's plots, but they are only visible. <br /> <br /> Also, this creature's melting effect on Krell gates is wonderful. <br /> It's amazing that Leslie Nielsen (who remembered the plane and Naked Gun) was seen as a young but mature man. At the age of 30 when this movie was released! About 80! <br /> <br /> A good movie that will continue to be a favorite in the coming years. Timeless
