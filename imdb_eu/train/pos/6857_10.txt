"Dressed To Kill," is one of the best-ever emotions. The relationship between sex and violence is an adult film. Brian De Palma once again proves that another director can not tell a story about his camera's use. He directs many non-dialogue scenes and tells a great deal of his story, through his use of the lyrics and an excellent score by Pino Donnagio. Filmed in the Panavision film, it must be seen in a wide screen, and uses the full De Palma film to tell its story. Crop, in the video "Dressed To Kill", there is hardly any movie. The good results of his work, excellent management, and perhaps one of the best films ever written, is "Dressed To Kill".
