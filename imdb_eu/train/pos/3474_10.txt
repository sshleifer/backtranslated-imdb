This movie is only visible on John Lennon's great portrait of Jared Harris. It does not matter that Harris does not seem exactly Lennon; His manners, statements, attitudes, accents, and attitudes are pure Lennon. The best scene: Lennon's local coffee shop would like to speak Paul McCartney and Wings's "Silly Love Songs" in American # 1.
