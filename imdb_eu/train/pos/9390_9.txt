This movie started in a Nick Cage shot. It's a story full of twists and turns, a motive and movement movie. Dennis Hopper, of course, was ham, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect person to catch the most suspicious men who have fallen on their site. Everything about this movie is good: cinema, story rhythm and finally. Cage is the best one, it's not an act of being a hero, but a man who has been caught in robberies of life.
