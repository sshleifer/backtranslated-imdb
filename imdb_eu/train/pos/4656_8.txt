Peter Ustinov is a mysterious and fun accident that says he is a London-based conglomerate career. Maggie Smith has contributed to the stupidity (and fraudulent rigor) and a jealous Bob Newhart company risks compromising. This is a movie with a lot of brain. Ustinov is sensational and Smith and Newhart are very funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden as a pill that opens the "executive vice president". Malden has seldom been so common. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley appeared in some funny cameras. Laurie Johnson has a magnificent musical score. The tone of Eric Till is hard and Ustinov and Ira Wallach are the first and most intelligent screenwriter. Good break!
