With most of his films, Ralph Bakshi seems to be like two-edged swords. You will get something extraordinary, but only if you put senseless and unnecessary youngsters. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story, perhaps it was not always shining in the animation section. <br /> <br /> Bakersi's creativity and animation from an animation standpoint. The rhetoroscope is more precise and the animation has a passionate look. Still, you still paint sad cell cells and a bit of background, but it looks even better than Bakshi's latest epic fantasy. The animation is almost realistic and naturalistic, and unlike the LOTR style, the content is often real, which improves the special atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie fails a significant story that comes from its skeptical space and, in fact, most of the motivational characters are quite faded. Lorn and Tigra are simple cases, but Necron's main villain has also been difficult to keep track of Guy Aurpegi's Furry Mask (Guy That). Although most voicemailers were good enough, the audio section is strangely curious, and it seems terribly horrible for Tigra. <br /> <br /> However, I think the value of the film's own entertainment is useless. stupid run of line rows The poor character of the costumes is never achieved, but we remind you, perhaps, that this film is not seriously considered. It's still cool and really funny.
