There is no doubt that "Dalai is the first direct film" rather than a "sequel". Good dogs, good actors, jokes and the right slapstick! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, who has a great therapy, is now a dog and very friendly. Many, such as Chloe Simon, the owner of a dog who tried to kill Cruella, does not believe that. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (2nd Chance Dog Shelter), have thought it changed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dipstick, with her friend, has created three wonderful babies! Small boat, Dummy and Oddball ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Eric Idle is the star of Waddlesworth (the horny rule), Glenn Close Cruella himself and Gerard Depardieu Le Pelt (another bad name should give a track), the family's movie is good, excitement and much more! The only fall of this movie has a lot of painful slapstick, but it's not so overwhelmed as the final movie. It's more fun than this last film. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
