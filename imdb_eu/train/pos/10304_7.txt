It looks like "Bruce Almighty" and it looks terribly stupid, especially trailers. However, I found deeper messages, they really liked this movie. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry at God, and gives divine power to know if he can make God work for a week. Morgan Freeman plays a man who symbolizes God as a God. Although it's not the usual movie or its rocks, it works very well. Although sometimes they are raw, the film has some laughter, Bruce half-heartedly half the red-hot soup, like customer reactions, and the seemingly absurd and absurd image of Freeman's God. Sometimes it's excessive and humorous, but overall it's fun. There's good support, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell, who always help. The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tearful, and the message is clear, God called us what we should do and "we should be a miracle." The movie is not perfect, but it's still nice and much better than me and many people probably expected it, especially if we see a deeper message from the movie. <br /> <br /> *** **
