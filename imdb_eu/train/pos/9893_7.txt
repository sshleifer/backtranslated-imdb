The weak geeky Marty (Simon Scuddamore) burns wildly because of the cruel passage of April Fool's day is very wrong. One decade of advanced Flash and those who participate (Caroline Monroe, well-known horror fans known in her Maniac, Faceless and Last Horror movies) are pranks that are not aware of a 10-year secondary school meeting, a judge is hiding by a Jester judge-mask killer (now closed) to be in school and revenge. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It has all the features of one. However, there is just something about it, I feel forced to see it from time to time (preferably beer in hand). Even though I want to forget about a totally horrifying end (I hate it, I hate it) I like it. I like it about a fun atmosphere about it and some beautiful dying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for men): Josephine Scandi and Donna Yeager get two topless <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for women): free of Simon Scuddamore money set at the beginning of the film <br /> </ p> My rating: B- <br /> <br /> Lionsgate DVD Extra: optional curiosities. the trailer of this film; My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing Trailer
