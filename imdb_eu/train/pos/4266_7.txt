For the first time I saw half a month ago in black and white TV we thought it was a little Samooko town and hilarious. Now, after seeing it a second time, much later, I'm not ridiculous. I'm not laughing anymore. But this is a confusing and fluid comedy that moves as you move forward and I enjoy it. <br /> <br /> In 1945 and Fred MacMurray 4F will join one of the armed forces. He casts a lamp on the crusader that works, and a genius gives him some wishes. (Ho, right? But, if the tickets are fine, the fantasies are very lively.) MacMurray will tell the genius that he wants to be a soldier. Poof, and Washington's soldiers are drawing up in a particularly warm and inviting USO. June Haver and Joan Leslie are lace up and dressed in everything, and lavender wigs. Washington will send MacMurray to spy on the enemy - red coverage, German Hessians, and not Brits. The Germans are involved in a Bierstube and sing a fun drinking song that praises the Vaterland's virtues, "where white wines are nuts and Rhiner of the Rhine / and bratwurst slower / and yellow hair yellow / and yellow Frauleins are jucier / goose and goose are the steps" . Something like that. They are wonderful characters, just as good as Sig Rumann. Otto Preminger, Hessian, is suspicious and cunning. "You know, Heidelberg, you are against you, but you have no fear." <br /> <br /> I can not go long with fantasy with them, but they are very entertaining, so they are also letters. When he wants to be in the Navy, he arrives with MacMurray Columbus and presents fantasy as a grand opera. "Do you not know that western investments are expensive for leaseback? / And who does what resources mean / but Isabella, Queens queen." When you see the New World, someone warns that it looks great. "I do not like what it looks like," colonizes Columbus, "but this place will be called Columbusland." <br /> <br /> Anyway, everything ends up running, even if it's not the current one. Pretty drunk, and MacMurray finishes off at the navy with his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> I thought it was very nice, but it's very nice. Children will enjoy rigid smoke and a magic and love story. Adults face the biggest challenges in the story (who are they who are Hessian?) They receive a bachelor's degree, except in case they want to stick with a leger and "Wow! Awesome!"
