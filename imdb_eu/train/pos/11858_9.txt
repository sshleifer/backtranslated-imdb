The movie is excellent. If you want to see it, you should see it. Although Paceto's film is not related to its original 193, Pacino works with Tony Monteser to move around. <br /> <br /> Pacino knows that way, he's able to say everything and still say it. to be wonderful. If you thought you were good at Pulp Fiction (if you've seen it), then you should also see how Scarface looks like an actor can tell another angle. (it's pretty sweet) <br /> <br /> Even though the movie has a lot of action and the plot moves over time, the real-time aspect ratio is not straightforward, it's easy to follow, but you have to peel your eyes to lose anything at all . Personally, I found this movie a three-hour watching wind when I found it. It is very good. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films that make up and direct this film, not only that. You have forgotten that this film was made in the 80's, but being the root of the evil idiot ... "So, tell me good night, BAD guy"
