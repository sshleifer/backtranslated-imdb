Love the characters and the story. Very funny action. Thomas Ian Griffithe and Tia Carreras give good performances. I enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of Griffith and Career. Donald Southerland is very fond of and surprisingly sympathetic. All three actors are among my favorites and they like to have them in this special movie. My extensive DVD collection. This movie is highly recommended. If you want ... Mrs. Smith, Replacement killer, L.A. Confidential, Long Kiss Goodnight, Cliffs and, The Whole Nine Yards ... you love this movie.
