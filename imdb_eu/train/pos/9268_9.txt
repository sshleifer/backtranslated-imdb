The movie about women who want to watch the football match is not like someone who has little interest in football, is not about football discrimination and love women. . <br /> <br /> The film opens the decisive game for the decision of the World Cup between Iran and Bahrain. A girl tries to get dressed as a boy trying to reach Azadi Stadium in Tehran, she's going to get it. until he tries to find a soldier. Once trapped, it will take you to a small area outside the outside stadium, a handful of women already trapped. There, a small group of soldiers who think they prefer to return home to their home. livestock We do not ever learn the names of the characters, but we know people as those people, as girls ask their cares to keep up the wall of a nearby wall and refuse to avoid making a comment at least. <br /> <br /> In addition to an important point on gender-based rigidity, today's film in Iran also has some fun moments, such as "dressing", womens and womens. He was disguised as a soldier, and he only seized it because he chose to look at the seat reserved for a senior team. The excitement of girls in the game, such as the end, is that the viewers will be on the edge of the seat that Iran will win and thus go to the finals in Germany. Soldiers are not the basics, they are simply concepts that need to be there, and girls explain why women can not see male sports, they will not convince their arguments. <br /> <br /> Sorry, this movie can not be seen by Iran, but it's good to see it in the open world, so that ordinary Iranians are not a fanatical bunch that allows westerners to lose ground in the West. But people with equal passions and worries like everywhere. It's a great job because the characters seem like real people, rather than pure characters.
