Thanks to Kevin Meyer's book and script editor, "Perfect Alibi" is a mysterious and entertaining thriller. The film begins methodically and generates perfume, as the signs begin to appear, nothing seems to be. Teri Garre and Hector Elizondo are excellent, as Nick and Nora Charles in Theatre Man have reminded them of their mystery. Kathleen Quinlan is brilliantly successful by Alex McArthur's wives and veteran characters, Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey, and Estelle Harris, and they give a clear moment at the right time. There is also the power of Rex Linn. In all, I felt I was reading a good fire book.
