I had never heard of this film, with George Clooney (whose company he produced and featuring a very strange medium) and the Ocean's 11 director with Steven Soderbergh. Worse, we received this discount for $ 4.99 (Canadian dollars!) What a wonderful and enjoyable surprise. But then, I think that William H. Macy is there that you can not be disappointed. In the 1950s, the ealing of England's comedies was very hard. OK, very ugly. It's a curious film, and sometimes it's split up. The real lies laughed so hard I was crying. Perhaps the use of historical film clothes is much more fun. Maybe I was in the slightest hope, but I saw it with a group of people and we exploded. The 5 best times I've spent.
