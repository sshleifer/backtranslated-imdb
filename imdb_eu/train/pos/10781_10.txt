Master Road Rovers was a great show on a superhero for dogs selected to face crimes around the world. The show was fun at least. Simple and complex jokes for all ages. Eat joking throughout the series that can make a drinking game. The action was brilliant and poorly configured. The character was very original, each one with a very different personality. But it was the depth of the characters that gave me the opportunity to enjoy the show. Each of them has difficulties and difficulties that are never expressed, but they are involved in subtext. Fortunately, one day, Rovers will be a way to see the action again.
