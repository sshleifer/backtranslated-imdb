The films say that it is as spectacular as a lot of movies. The film plays as a fun and entertaining time. And that's exactly what it was. A male Korean version is Bring. <br /> <br /> Since then, you are feeling the rest of the movie and how it ends, but enjoyment is no surprise at all. It's a copy of another movie. Instead, to delight the two "rest thugs" men traveled on their own as men. So the movies are fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The operation of the camera, in particular, the movements of the dollar were well executed. The script, the weakness, was very nice because the characters were not 2 dimensions, but life and desire were full. This movie has not won an Oscar, nor a DVD, but a fun watch and a fun experience.
