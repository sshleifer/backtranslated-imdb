Bottom line - never the best romantic comedy. This film tries to make all the best films: we want to visit the world again and create time and participate in the human era. When I am blue, this movie raises the spirit and laughs to me (and this is still true after many visits - always fresh). <br /> <br /> It is made up of all actors. Characterizations are so dead and the characters are so good that you forget what the actor is (it's hard to do it with Matthau, Robbins and Ryan). The works are excellent: Fry ("agae", "total pygmy package!"), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (three theoretical physicists "Greek choir" - "but the time does not exist"), Durning ("NJ can be launched something "), Shalhoub and Whaley (Robbins boss and co-worker at the service station), and Curits (Eisenhower - how many comedies Eisenhower ??). <br /> <br /> Don did not forget that treasure.
