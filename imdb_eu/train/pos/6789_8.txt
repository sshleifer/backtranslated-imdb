Dragoon's legend is one of those popular games that people love or hate. Some say it's very similar to that of other games, that is, the Final Fantasy series, which is understandable, originally meant to be the equivalent of Sony's Final Fantasy. Honestly, I can not say anything like that, FF games do not know very well. <br /> <br /> I think that the favorite aspect of the game is the battle system. You do not have the capability to switch to a stronger dragon, you need to pay attention each time you attack to complete the attack by pressing the buttons at the right moment. Not only this, but sometimes your enemies will attack you in the middle of a sequence, which means you have to press different buttons to take damage. Although some use of attack elements is necessary, some button mashing is required. If you do not want to attack, you can always protect it, not only because it only cuts the damaged damage but it also cures the healing points without using potion healing. <br /> <br /> MEGs are pretty good. Do it on the same quality as Final Fantasy 8. However, the graphics of the game are not according to this rule. It's nice, but it could be - and honestly, they should have been better. Translation also leaves something you want. It only sets close relationships with the character, but there are also some grammatical errors that must be overcome. <br /> <br /> In other interesting things, the main aspects of the game were to be lost ... nobody dies and the other becomes the party's useless and leaves. Although the death of a person is often said to be out there, at first, you will realize that characters, while heroes, are still deadly as the next person. People who represent lost characters gain their statistics, so play-wise transition is pretty smooth. Perhaps, my complaint about the characters is the love of the main character, Shana. It's like a protective woman with a need to recover, allowing a player to scream in frustration. It's so easy to use in your party, it's very weak. I do not know what the power of his dragon is, I did not like it, I did not use it so much. Rose, on the other hand, is a favorite character in any game. It is not a suitcase, and some of its magic dragon are very useful. Although Meru is quite powerful, it is sometimes an annoying snack. <br /> <br /> They were designers of characters, like most, that women seem to be pretty characters and did not think about the real utility of clothing. Seriously, no armor and no skin help fight monsters. But I will give them props, women who serve as knights in many countries. <br /> <br /> I could not comment on the plot, honestly I did not pay much attention. where should I go? I do not know if this says anything about the plot or my game style. <br /> <br /> Everything is very nice. He has no mistakes, but he has to think about me and just hit the buttons and get the correct balance to kill the monsters.
