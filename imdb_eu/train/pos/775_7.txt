It is a strange story, but somehow impressive, about love. Personally, I do not ever mind passing a moving story of real life. But there's the image. <br /> <br /> The title is a story that says "ill". After looking, I did not get a feeling of "disease" about the rules of society. This movie is something beautiful ... something horrible ... I can not use moral and social contradictory rules. <br /> <br /> <br /> The film focuses, above all, on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins, evolves and eventually ends. You feel the moment when this love flourishes, the first whisper, touch it. You feel connected. And I'm still not that immoral. Although, in the end, you expect to not break ... it can not break ... it is not appropriate. In the end you feel the pain of being a rod ... <br /> <br /> But I also have to add a negative button for this comment ... I do not know if the story is in some way unless * * they showed that they are only in the disease but not in the content to feel You do not have a total story, but only parts. When the movie was started, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu was already in place. So there is no relationship character. You only feel the tension between them ... the struggle of love and the desire to break this relationship. Kiki's Sandu line says: "I want to stop ... and if you love, you will do it as you ask." <br /> <br /> This movie will push some questions, most likely what is love and what moral ... and the boundary between them? I do not know the idea of ​​this movie "to conquer all love ... but social and moral standards" or "beautiful love ... does not matter or not". But, in my opinion, the movie is already a success, if you think it's a simple reason ...
