The movie "A Thief in the Night" is a movie that has been ignored in general, due to the low budget (as it was evident) and its theme - the true Christian reaction and the fate of those behind. However, it was a passionate story about the celebration of the audience and, definitely, the relationship with Jesus Christ. They all touched, showed a shepherd who preached the word, but did not believe it, why he was left to know. This movie and its release have to be viewed as "Distant Thunder". With the "Left Behind" series, counting the same budget story, it's still the same impact. "A Thief in the Night" has broken the basis of this genre and will always be remembered.
