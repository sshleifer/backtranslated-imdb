I understand why some people like it and why not others. For me, however, I really like it, although I found it to be a bit good and not so strange. The animation was really brilliant, just like Charlie's dream. The characters were a mixed bag, Anne-Marie was the best, Judith Barsi, later. (Physical illness happened to me when I read what happened). Also, Carface is very compelling, especially Tay Tayback. (I especially love Morona, who is Morona), and with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat, Don Bluth is probably the most memorable one. Charlie and Itchy were just missing the same lightning, but I loved King Gator and his song. Some movies are very amazing, like Annabelle's "You can come reven back", such as it's still terrifying to me. Unfortunately, there were two bits that I liked so much. The story grew awkward and inadequate, but Disney's Black Waterfall suffered the same problem. In addition, there were dark scenes that would be amazed by children, but the end is very poisonous. However, the biggest mistake were blurry songs and songs. Especially not one of them stands out, except for "Let's make music together" and "loveably alive", and Burt Reynolds can not sing and Dom DeLuise has sung much better. Eventually, a spectacular movie could have been more, but it was definitely memorable, and I would see it again and again. 7/10. Bethany Cox
