Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most amazing and enjoyable film I have ever seen all year round. It's about a prison program that I remember somewhere in California, where prisoners have heard and play the Shakespeare play over the past 14 years. The film tracks the production of "The Tempest" through performance, and in the process we learn stunning things about these stunning men, all for the most serious crimes. True fiction is only strange. If anyone wants to adapt this story to a fictional movie, the viewer would never buy it, but seeing the true knowing is literally wonderful; I gave him a loud voice, especially when I met a great man. Oz is like a loop episode, and it's even more entertaining because the characters and their strange stories are true.
