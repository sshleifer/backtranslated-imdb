Jackie Chan's best movie in the 1980s may have been on the map. The scale of this self-directed police drama is obviously opening and closing, destroying the occupation of a town and a shopping mall. Clearly, there are differences between original Chinese and English dubbed versions, and the latter did not get jokes. It also prevents stars that are not like Chinese originals. Indeed, the only thing that led to the duplication is that they made a trial trial at that time when the Hong Kong colonial essays were conducted in English, because the originals make this scene in Cantonese! <br /> <br /> However, Chan's fighting style and martial arts choreographed humor as much as possible; Therefore, non-cantonese audiences have not lost much. After all, it is not the conversation with Chan, but it gives him action and difficulties. This story is easy to follow: Chan plays an unknown Hong Kong detective following the gangland pad (Cho Yeun) and assigned to protect a star witness (Brigitte Lin). The action is excellent from the beginning to the end, and it does not take a long time to breathe. He never thinks, but what a fun and well-connected film. Undoubtedly, this is one of the best martial arts movies.
