I approached the film with little hope, but I was very surprised. It's been well done and in recent years it plays hand-in-hand dancing movies, especially "Strong Room". While the music is pleasant and while the dance is colorful, the movie is not dancing. They refer to the Japanese organization that goes to work and free time at the office staff for men after a job that does not involve their family. Here we have the whole family and the men with large mortgages and their living carving. She draws an attractive image of a young woman while she goes to the dance studio, which brings her to dance at the dance floor. At the same time, the Japanese is clear about the frightening reasons for the new passion, but, in any case, they eventually accepted the family and the audience. Ballroom dance positions, as they are shown in the film, are not western, but they are a cultural and cultural discipline of Japanese music. So, cultural counterattacks are of interest. Apart from cultural views, colors, dances and the enthusiasm of the players make a fun show.
