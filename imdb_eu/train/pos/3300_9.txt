Pakeezah has a very interesting story (what is documented in 'Trivia' section). It seems that fate was intended to test Kamal Amrohi (director), and at the same time wanted to complete his masterpiece with the secret. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah walks metaphors, poetry and visual elocution. As a result, the intensity that comes out of emotions is a totally real dimension, but they are very effective and affect the viewer. <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari lives in Nargis and Sahib Jaan's tragedy. The rest of the film stars Ghulam Mohammed (music director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background score) and Joseph Wirsching (d.o.p). It gives them their music and cinematography. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic movie world. Every time you see it, it will show you new layers. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare poets of film and has given us a gift.
