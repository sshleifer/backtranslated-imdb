Jane Eyre's film and television productions have been the focus of each one, but I suspect that people still know and love in the decades to come. It's just classic (and it's a lot more than everyone else). Timothy Dalton is working hard on her rochester, she is rarely missing; Its performance is amazing and very colorful, but it is never too far from the complexity of the dark characters. Zelah Clarke's Jane is a little bit older than the rest of the world, but with Dalton, he plays the perfect role (who appropriately sets himself apart!) His nuances of performance are best seen at a second glance (after Dalton's absorption of charism .). There are some technical faults and a couple of moments that can be better production values; Although this was a relatively high production time, according to the BBC rules of that time. But real pleasure is the performances. Do not miss this!
