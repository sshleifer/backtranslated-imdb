These years I have not seen this film because my knowledge is rusty. I recall that this movie is double the Braveheart movie. It's just realistic and has credible characters. Ridb Roy thinks Rob Roy looks like he looks, dressed poorly and shaved with simple outfits. Likewise, Liam Nesson has a look at Celtic, which looks like Scot and, more importantly, looks like Rob Roy. It's a comparison that makes people angry, but has compared Mel Wallon to William Wallace. Gibson is thinking of a legend described as a giant 6-foot-7, Gibson is almost shorter. The story has a small, conspiracy and remarkable romance. Listen to something like Braveheart? But instead of a movie called "freedom", we get a film that tells us freedom and nationalism to honor, love and justice. This movie is more interesting. Like Gladiator The play is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a great leader in this effort. The story is great about heroism and humanity. When Mary is raped and the scene is burning out of the house, it's a Scottish force that clears up the horror after pulling her thigh. This is something that Braveheart's heroine would never have. In general, the watch is stunning and almost perfect. Go and see
