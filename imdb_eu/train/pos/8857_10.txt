Sidney Lumet has made masterpieces, such as the Network, Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico. But he did not have any luck on his latest works. Gloria (1999) was pathetic and Find Me Guilty was an interesting but pure experiment. Now, Lumet brings his latest movie in decades, and from my point of view, it's a real masterpiece: Devil knows that you're dead. I think this movie is like a Lumet resurrection. It has many layers. Also, the end of the film is perfect. The unexpected are superb. Philip Seymour Hoffman's usual performance is commonplace and undoubtedly one of our greatest actresses. He's also an excellent actor, but he's not based on my point of view. It's a great job. The rest of the works are excellent (especially the great Albert Finney) but these two actors are wonderful. Oscar great pathetic. The film has a good intensity for performances and, to a large extent, a great screenplay. Devil Knows You're Dead is a true masterpiece with an excellent direction, excellent script and superb performances. We need more films like that.
