Right now I'm watching the movie for a second time (on TV) and I've fallen for an hour for the second time (I think I've seen 2 more time this time) This movie is amazing how Goldsworthy looks at nature as you never think of changing nature, it's amazing. All the movies give you a warm feeling, watching the love of playing around. Or only when you see your hands, it is touching you with dirt and broken nails.
