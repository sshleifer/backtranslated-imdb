Yes, it's a mistake, especially if Hollywood movies require a lot of effects, if you're looking for a fun or fantasy story or plot, and you can not think of yourself. <br /> <br /> Roegen's films are for smart filmmakers and Insignificance is an excellent example. <br /> <br /> Characterizations are excellent, the story is superb, but, like every movie in Nic Roeg, you think about every aspect. The reality that never appeared before. His films always think about you, and I personally like it in a movie. <br /> <br /> So do not expect to see this movie and feel happy and happy because it is likely. be disappointed <br /> <br /> But I think it's very good.
