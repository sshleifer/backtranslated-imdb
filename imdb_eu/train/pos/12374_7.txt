I do not know why this movie has been exiled in darkness; Sentinel is a horror movie that is bright and rich, with most of today's ghost stories praising more than earning money. Michael Winner has often admitted that he is not good director at all times and this shines brightly with this film; But it must be said that although the film does not work, and that Winner rounds out some talented team, it somehow solves more than that. It's a rich mysterious land, and Alison Parker and his hunting center begin to focus. He finds that most properties that he does not find can not be accepted, but he believes that his luck has changed a fully furnished apartment at affordable price. His problems begin soon, because he does not like many neighbors ... and as a result, the neighbors say he has only one neighbor; An elderly priest in the upper floor ... <br /> <br /> The cast list is really excellent, Cristina Raines is quite unknown in front of the great aesthetic support. Chris Sarandon is a little bit of wood against Raines, but lesser parts like John Carradine, Eli Wallach, Ava Gardner, Jeff Goldblum, and Christopher Walken are named in less than a portrait of Sarandon's life. Michael Winner does a great job with his main location, because the block of blocks offers a horrible and macabre story. The movie is about to start slowly, but it's never boring; And Michael Winner's script is a surprise, it's almost impossible to guess from the offsetting, which undoubtedly deserves some praise. Like similar horrible horrors, this is not getting the initial shot of money, but it's not so often that the end is a kind of end to Winner, if he sees the viewer completely, and if he is a real man who uses the rumor. curiosity is true; I must say that it works very well! In general, this movie may be pure hokum, as you look in any way; This is one of the best films of this kind of Sentinel, and without a doubt the CEO has to stand out.
