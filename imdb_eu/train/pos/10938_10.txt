I rarely will ever find this film, I must immediately speak. This movie is undoubtedly one of the best entertainment and very authentic. I was seeing a duplicate version, but right now I have a DVD Recovery DVD for the original report. However, the dubbing is not on the way and sometimes it gives a serious and funny mood: "Poison Clan world rocks !!!" <br /> <br /> Storytelling is a Chinese intrigue, a suspense method that remains true. and people's relationships. You can expect both earrings and eavesdropping on both ears. <br /> <br /> The martial arts martial arts is a choreography and it is believed that it is necessary to see it. It's like watching true animals, but it creates their martial arts. Cast's training is the perfect level in today's cinema. <br /> <br /> This combination provides ancient Chinese culture with serious dosages and I recommend that you focus on the movie fight alone. The art story and the mastery of its execution. ... Of course, if you want to see people behind each other, together with the raw Chinese torture, be my guest!
