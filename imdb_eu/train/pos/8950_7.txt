For those who do not know Jimmy Stewart, he is one of the "less" films he has made in his career. And, compared to other films, although it's not an excellent movie, it's not a bad thing and a good time is decent - but not much more. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a witch. In New York and for some unforgettable reasons, Jimmy decides to witchcraft to fall in love with Jimmy. Over time, Mrs. Novak goes cold and dismounts, and Stewart begins - and, apparently, in the witch's rule book, this is NO, NO! <br /> <br /> The film is about sensitivity to witches. They are not sacrifices or powerful varieties. Most magic is very limited and insignificant (for example, Jack Lemmon, his tools to turn off the streets). And, very surprisingly, it seems that all the witches are bohemians, people wearing badges and people who hear dirty jazz. Regarding what I think of jazz, it's really enchanted in the world of this movie! <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie is quite romantic and comedy is lightweight, but I did not see something I could get. The play is pretty good, but the script does not earn enough to make it a great movie. In fact, I got almost 6 movies. He was very close.
