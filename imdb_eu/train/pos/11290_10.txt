The publication of TARZAN THE APE MAN in 1932 led to a sensation. It's likely to believe, 70 years later, but the film has been the same as the impact of THE MATRIX or THE RINGS of the LORD, when films and radio stations were the main sources of entertainment. Tarzan became an instant pop icon, a noble fantasy about wild woman, and every man he wanted. Unlucky person about the situation was Edgar Rice Burroughs, while MGM's creative freedom agreed upon, and when he regained his rights, he felt the "bad version" of his character. grows up), his vision was unfair (he started a production company and he soon made his 'Tarzan'). Although MGM realized the value of "the newest star," he knew that the sequel should be more spectacular than the original ... and it was delivered by TARAKAN AND ITS MATES! <br /> <br /> The movie story was interesting. ; Cedric Gibbons, by the legendary MGM Art Director, committed to studying before TARZAN THE APE MAN before he had never directed (the studio had not planned the movie). , and I do not think a beginner director would have had a much more indifferent film in the "novelty" ... and the heads of the Oscar-winning department wanted to be happy. Gibbons, a talented and talented visual artist, loved the freedom of Hollywood pre-code, and TARZAN AND ITS MATE decided to push the "envelope" to the limit ... Tarzan and Jane were swimming naked, and Jane. TOPLESS would appear on most movies. Maureen O'Sullivan said in a previous interview in his death that in 1998 he used double-spas and relied on the studio and "did in the top two films," but it turned out too much ... headaches trying to move plants and fruit much more. She is blocking her minds, and the idea has been abandoned (the money she was going to film on these days would be worth the fortune!) She made a nude silhouette in a tent, her breasts flashed her "swim" and a "jungle" mask was renewed, very provocative, very thin and open on the sides ... and, consequently, called "Hays Office" and this self-censorship would be created loosely. Soon the whole industry would fall. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < critics ... Although James C. McKay directed the movie, Conway worked on three other projects, called VIVA VILLA in 2006! <br /> <br /> The film included the best original elements (safaris, dead tribe, tarzan jungle beasts to save to death Jane) and really improved the storytelling. Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton), first film, returns to Africa with the "Elephant Cemetery" marathon, and Jane will try to get back to England, offering silk dresses, underwear and perfume gifts. It will bring Martin Arlington (Paul Cavanagh) to Holt, the actor who refuses to hunt Jane's pursuit and Paulir Cavanagh, and in any way (he would conquer and kill Tarzan). when they can not see when they can escape. Arlington finds his chance, only capturing Ape Man, and fights for himself, and then returns to the outside with his story of extinction. Now, Jane does not have reason to stay in the jungle, and allows her to go straight to the Cemetery, before returning to England for a long trip, Arlington will be so pleased. But a wild tribe and horrible torture are waiting for the group ... could Tarzan, healthier to complete his monkeys "family", to save Jane time? <br /> <br /> <br /> Stock footage is rolling again. In the 30s, racial stereotypes are evident, and gorillas are actors with monkeys, TARZAN and HAZ MATE achieve a degree of sophistication in any other movie "Tarzan", as well as in the completely erotic BB Derek. APE MAN could not touch. Johnny Weissmuller was physically superior, Maureen O'Sullivan was never more beautiful, and 'Africa' was never romantic, dangerous. <br /> <br /> TARZAN AND ITS MATE has been a victory (although it has been completely edited for many years and the classical series of the series remains!
