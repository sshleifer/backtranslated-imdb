The story of Victoria and Albert is a new side by the director Jean-Valle Valle. The Queen of Queen Victoria is a woman who has been a woman who has reigned for several decades and has suffered mourning. The role of Emily Blunt is more capable of giving audiences a different perspective. He portrays Victoria as a young man, climbs to the throne and portrays it in the early years. Blunten Victoria is a fresh and limited whole movie. His most powerful scenes are with Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All actors desperate Miranda Richardson, what role could it be. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a story with dramatic bows and "drama", the story is still quite interesting. to be worth seeing. There are some historical freedoms on the screen, the film tries to be a relationship between Victoria and Albert and the social and regular structure of time. The set design and costumes are remarkable. <br /> <br /> The whole story of the film, during the period and those that draw on Blunt and other actors, will be very much appreciated. Intense recommendation <br /> <br /> Grade: A
