One of my favorite movies, forgotten by the abuse of movies, warns me. Unwanted by Ang Lee, most young actors have been the most important protagonist, such as Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker. Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson and Jewel. The performance was superb and every one of the actors he gave was memorable performances, especially when they portrayed Meyers when he was portrayed by a malignant criminal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw it. However, it is seldom seen in the cable. I hope the ones that others propose are not well known.
