I think this movie would be more enjoyable if they thought it was an image of the colonial African in the 50s and 60s as a story. Here is no real story. It's just a seating on the other, just like a small point of light art that does not paint a picture. I saw Chocolat for the first time, I did not really "get" to think about it until a few days. Afterwards, I realized that many things were "achieved" by the end of colonialism, just around the corner, without any plots. Anyway, it's one of my favorite movies. The airport scene, the short shower and beautiful music, was a mere poetry. If you like "exciting" cinema, do not look at it - you'll get bored by tears. But, some of you ..., I can thank you later.
