Being a fan of 'Columbo' was very disappointed in 'Corky Romano'. Although it's a fun movie, Falk's mafia was very far away with the adorable lieutenant he played for so many years, especially with the offensive language that he used. After 'Corky Romano', Peter Falk surprised me honestly. However, after finding 'Finding John Christmas' and his predecessor, 'A Christmas Without Christmas', for the first time the weekends with each other, I have to say 'Max' is a beautiful character in two films by Peter Falk. surely memorable and lovable like 'Columbo'. Although the parts of the film are very predictable, these scenes do not enjoy the story they are playing at all. I would also like to record both of these wonderful Christmas films, and I recommend that someone Falk's fan, a Christmas nut or someone who enjoys occasional occasional movies. This movie may be lost among hobbies in TV's, so it's not found 'Finding John Christmas' before it's too late.
