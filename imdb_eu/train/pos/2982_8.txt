I really like this movie. I believe that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are comical geniuses of our time. They are nonsense to add the nonsense of pop culture to the level of innocence, but in a realistic way ... if it makes sense. This is especially what South Park makes fun. Once you have never been to a definitive and never-ending cartoon, you see the message you are seeing on each section. This is evident in BASEketball. Although directed by David Zucker, it is very dangerous, a good message about the American corporation and the embarrassment of the great league sports. I am also a fan of sports, and sometimes I find this movie ridiculous, it's so true that we love people in a weird hate. The initial preamble is wonderful ... The tears that make you laugh, football players start Riverdance every time I see them! Some may not like this movie because no one owns a cup of tea ... but like South Park, after overcoming nonsense ... it has a real message through literal comic. I gave it to 8 stars from 10 stars.
