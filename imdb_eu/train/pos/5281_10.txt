This is not 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Thelma and Louise', but the road movie is beautiful. She sets her two main characters slowly and easily. The audience learns the underlying tensions quickly, that is, the tribute to the director. French youngster (and English) has a French son who wants to do well, he has a girlfriend and drinks alcohol, young people. And he is a Moroccan-Arabic (and French) father, who continues his Muslim faith, who rejects the generosity and the wisdom of elders and the new culture around him (as mobile phones). the film will be able to analyze a very powerful policy - former Yugoslavia, Turkey and later Middle East Meka. These are Muslim populations who have participated in wars, repression and ethnic cleansing. the dictators have achieved torture and summary executions for power and religious communities in a constant lethargy fight. However, the film moves through these places and options. The relationship between them is a fundamental part of this film and faith is a backdrop. It seems we are all human beings, and we need to understand each other and take care to manage them in this world. Without a doubt, it is not "Natural Born Killers" and that's why it's better.
