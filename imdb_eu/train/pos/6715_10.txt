I was love to see "Sabrina, Teenage Witch" on Friday nights at ABG's TGIF. I think this was one of TGIF's best shows. We met with friends and friends this Friday to see this show and we never lost a section. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salem. It was fun and fun. Sabrina's boyfriend, Harvey liked it too. It was HOT I think Melissa Joan Hart has played a good witch. In my favorite episodes, "Sabrina, was an obvious sight" and "Hilda and Zelda: they were teenagers". They were great episodes. <br /> <br /> In general, I missed this show. One day I hope to bring ABC with new episodes. This day I give this 10/10 box.
