A great movie about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy is an excellent actor. It was a pardon to see the same scenes with Campbell, someone who looks like a sexually neurotic object, but does not have the steak to work on it at the script level. But he's a good actress, he's got a lesser degree to work on scenes. I am applauded by the casting of neglected by Tracey Ullman. Who knew? Sutherland is also very good. The way he moves has a higher character (in some scenes younger). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
