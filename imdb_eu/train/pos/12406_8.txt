A long-term prison sentence of more than 20 years opens again and Ethan Sharpe (Lane Smith, a feature-length and feature-length actor) puts his guard as a guardian. As prisoners are set to work in place, they will be given access to the old execution room. This creates a sturdy spirits when they blame the two sponsors and the prisoners; Burke (Viggo Mortensen, the true little key that shows the beginning role) is driven into the role of the heroine can be cool-can-can-be-can-be-be-can-be. <br /> <br /> I know it's a place to praise a non-brainer. In the film's atmosphere (Rawlins, Wyoming) was filmed in an abandoned prison, but this horror film rises to a high level, with a great deal of recognition, initially set forth by Renny Harlin, his fourth executive director, "Nightmare on Elm Street 4 ", and made a great career in action movies, thrillings and horror movies. <br /> <br /> He may have creatures, but he has a throw-in theme: he is fighting for Chelsea Field for the imprisonment As a young woman, as a veteran condemned by Lincoln Kilpatrick Cresus, Tom Everett Rabbitt, Ivan Kane as Lasagna outfit, Tommy "Tiny" as a tiny tiny Lister, and Captain Arlen Dean Snyder as Horton with Kane Hodder (first vengant spirit ) must be emphasized as a first class credit, which helped the concert that Jason Voorhees played on "Friday, 13th." <br /> <br /> The special effects, Mac Ahlberg, the prolific genre photographer, Richard Band and Christopher Stone are amazing music, wonderful images, awesome locations, and fast and lively presentation, to help them become entertaining. It's fascinating, awesome and fun to be a fan of horror. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
