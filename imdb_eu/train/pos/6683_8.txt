Forget deep meanings, leave your logic at the door, and have fun all over the life, funny and fun "cartoon" action. MYSTERY MEN is one of the most watched superheroes you ever watched, but it is very difficult for super-wannabe to be very interesting, diverse and well-molded, with its own personalities that are memorable. Dark moods, unfortunate dizziness, good faith, and even a bit of time, combine fantasy comics to become a true winner of lovable losers. The tale of the comedian actor Mystery Men - including a Mystery Woman - is a perfect footage for Wes Studios only in Yoda's bargain and Geoffrey Rush's most popular. the wall (and surprisingly charming) the wickedness ever before Dark Horse comic book pages and the big screen. Are you ready to laugh, cheer up and say "huh?" more than once ... Enjoy!
