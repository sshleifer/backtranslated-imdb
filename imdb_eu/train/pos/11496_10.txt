Love this movie too. I was first seen in a small independent German cinema in Frankfurt. It was really crowded and very atmosphere. The erotic movie came to the audience and always debated with producer and director Moritz Boerner. In his genre it was a very ambitious film, especially when you think it was an independent movie. <br /> <br /> There are not many copies of that film, Mortitz Boerner was from the theater and he had two or two. Three short films worked for television before doing a kind of therapist. <br /> <br /> You may find it again for people who want to watch the movie, but it's not easy. Search but it is possible.
