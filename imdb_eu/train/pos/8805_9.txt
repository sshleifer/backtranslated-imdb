11 stories from 1111 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (such as the first ones); Sometimes Americans say, "We have more death than you and you have the protection of murderers." Sometimes very curious (but very symbolic and interesting). I really loved Claude Lelouch (the personal life of a couple in New York shows that "problems" are unimportant), Shoei Imamura (generally, strongly anti-wars) and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny) Africa's most optimistic daily misery. ), and Youssef Chahine (Egyptian intellectuals, peace-makers, who have moral difficulties in admitting to the Arab countries of the U.S.A.). I'm glad the Americans liked the movie a lot. We show (or? I still have blacks, but I live in Texas for 12 years) who are also interested in other cultures and are able to question the past and current actions of our government, as we need in democracy.
