This movie has been seen at least 4 times since 84, and it's still great every time I see it. Carmen opera is a very compelling version, an amazing flamenco dance, babe sets and, of course, wonderful music. <br /> <br /> This narration of Carmen is a story of a story, each parallel to the other, to the double end of the tragic. The Spanish low-budget production, of course, is home to several Spanish flamenco dancers. The combination of wooden bands and red dancers performs a much stronger story. <br /> <br /> What makes the best film and probably my favorite. foreign movie
