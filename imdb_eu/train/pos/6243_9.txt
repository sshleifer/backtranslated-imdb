The movie about cruelty of the world. I found the liberator because the truth is only. Bit plays pretty funny. Some of the plays are extraordinary, see Maria Hofstätter for example. The director has tried to represent the most realistic life possible. Consistently, the sex scene is explicit and more than a hard-core movie is fake. Though I did not understand a phrase, I found the film's vision in the original language subtitles, much more enriching, since it duplicates half of the actors' work. Maria Hofstätter remembers a duplicate voice of the character played. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie
