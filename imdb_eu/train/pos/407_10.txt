Oh, my lord ... give me a minute of breath. This movie will take you on a wonderful journey and you will not be allowed to hit the last face. This is a movie for fans of Stormriders. Your story was beautifully created, although I did not like a few things, they used a lot of stands. I wanted to see the real people fighting, but, well ... we've just missed a few, and I did not want to like it again until I saw it again, when you understand it, it throws A ** completely! I encourage anyone to watch the real movie Asian, to see this movie. This movie is one of my greatest ratings. Go and see when it comes to America!
