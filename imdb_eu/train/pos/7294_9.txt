After reading some comments, I had to add my two cents. One of the most memorable short films "Sorrow Lost" is one of those I've ever seen. I was able to see the New York Independent Film Festival. I thought this movie was very beautiful and emotional. The story was very complicated, especially in a short time. The story is aimed at a young girl who is a victim of her wicked father. Soon a demon played by "Witchblade's Eric Etebari" allows "stop". After seeing the show, I was surprised at how unique and different the character was. I could never have done so well! His character was very complex and very persuasive. The cast was great for him. The girl was well and the father was decent. Death is also possible until this girl is able to escape from her future. Effects and cinematography were totally undermined. I ask that they have at least a hundred thousand budget for that. It's strange that you see a very short quality. The inauguration was absolutely unique with the feature film. This does not mean that he does not make mistakes - I thought I needed to take a little while and it was a long introduction. But I saw him stuck in the daytime. There are few short films with this quality level.
