Tell me what you want Andy Milligan - but I think it's a 10% strange family, but it's a bit worse. Unfortunately, the printed video of this film introduces sexual scenes in order to retrieve the distributor from the originally filmed image box at the box office. Several times during the film, the camera camera and silent film silence end up endlessly, and it suddenly looks good on Milligan's homely actors and begins to make psychedelic guitar from the 60s. It's easy to move forward if you are trying to focus attention on Milligan's original movie, which, unfortunately, is missing a little action to stop for more sex scenes. However, it is still a compelling thing. I do not think of any movie I ever saw in a film.
