I have read most of the comments published here and I can say that most of these posters have great problems in their lives. This show was unlike most gaming shows, it was fun. Mr. Shatner, the so-called ALL, was the success of the show. It's really wonderful as a personality. It's fun and it smiles and the show is too. Dancers and questions, appeals to fashion shows that are presented. And if there is a lot of money, it's fun. The pressure on most game shows (stress) DOES NOT exist. Some people who posted a few posts complained about how long it was for the dancers and choosing the questions, & c., Millionaire has no similar time. You can tell that most have lost the whole concept. Here is the idea of ​​owning FUN and LIVE. It's something for everyone. Qustions to test your knowledge, eye candy (dancers), suspense, Mr. Shatner's fun-filled personality ... well if that's not the case after the perk-up guys, I feel bad for you; and if that's not enough, FIND YOU! I will definitely miss the show. From all the games that have already been shown, and to be very frank, I show GORPUTU, I really liked it and I really missed it. Another game show that I liked was the Match Game.
