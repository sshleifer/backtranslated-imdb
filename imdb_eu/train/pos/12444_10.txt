The best film of Modesty Blaise that I have seen so far. It's like a good rider for the TV series. I think that the "worship" is a little, the magic of Quentin Tarantino, or something, like that of the lyrics. They have caught a lot of Modesty's character, but I admit that I'm missing Willy Garwin. Although I've read comics and books by Peter O'Donnell, I'm not disappointed with this movie, quite the opposite. This story about poverty and childhood is amazed. I had not been so happy because it was a bad movie since 1966. So maybe I've passed this film a bit. If you like comics and other stories about Modesty Blaise, you should definitely see this! can not wait for a watch ...
