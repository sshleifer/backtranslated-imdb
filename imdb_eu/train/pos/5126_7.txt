In Urban Cowboy, John Travolta plays one of the most powerful alpha men on the big screen. He is a young man who leaves his father's home and is a young man who plays a role in the great city of Dallas, who promised to work with Petrochemical uncle Dallas Barry Corbin. In 1980, growth began to grow, and the United States became increasingly popular in Texas. <br /> <br /> Travolta works well when the viewer cares about her character. Sexist pig Debra Winger learns to get acquainted and get married, but she has some ideas that women should not be shadows. And when he plays at Gilley's mechanical running, he's playing for a man, that's for him. Urban Cowboy is a real serpent, who looks at Travolta goat and moves to Winger. Travolta, at the same time, takes the girl, Madolyn Smith Osborne, who plays for Gilley. <br /> <br /> Despite being a character, Urban Cowboy was one of the biggest honky tonks in the world. Gilley is no longer in the Pasadena Texas suburban community, but memories live. And in the case of Urban Cowboy, they are a wonderful country / western song that characterizes the film. I do not know if some songs are not written in Urban Cowboy, but I can only imagine why the Motion Picture Academy rejects the musical aspects of this film. Especially because I loved the Love for Love of Johnny Lee, especially if it's written for this film, it's not bad to have been nominated for the best song. She does not lose trace of femininity, but she is in favor of Travolta and she does it in style. This review will still be an unknown woman and today she will be the first bullfighting bullfighter of the Bullfighting Professionals.
