Masters of Horror: Right to Die Late late night as married couple Abby (Julia Anderson) and Ciff Addison (Martin Donovan) are driving, but when talking, Cliff pays attention to a tree crossing the road. Cliff's airbag works well and keeps track of minor accidents. Unfortunately, Abby was not the same, and he was upset when he was automatically thrown away, when he was soaked in gasoline on the whole body. Abby's life is simply saved. It leads to the hospital, where he is injured throughout his life and dissolves the burns. Cliff decides to kill him, his lawyer, Ira (Corbin Bersen), allegedly murdering Abby, suing the car manufacturer and deciding to sue Abby's son Pam (Linda Sorenson) to be rich and wealthy with Cliff. However, Abby has his own plans ... <br /> <br /> This co-production of American American-directed Rob Schmidt (before his horror movie was Wrong Turn (2003) and he gradually acquired it. of Horror episode) and was the 9th episode of Season 2 of the Masters of Horror series, but I did not think I was the Right to Die that was the best episode of the Fantastic Masters. However, The Screwfly Solution (2006) is still not approaching. The script made by John Espoo has a central idea, nothing new, but it's an effective way to use it, although it's different, its first 15 minutes focus on the horror element of the story, but it goes on. Twenty-two minutes into the body and becomes a legal blend of Abby's life, and Cliff gets the most important stage, it is likely that this humble and intricate heart will be twisted and twisted. . The character is a clan, a weak man, an abusive lawyer, the owner of the sex and the young cake, to get what he wants, but they all serve, the conversation is okay. I liked the rhythm and I generally liked going to the right to die for a few minutes here and lose some focus and I did not like the ambiguous ending. <br /> <br /> The director Schmidt works well & There are some effective scenes that try to alternate the scary atmosphere and foreign blood and gore. There are some wonderful special makeup effects as usual, Abby's plan burns burned skin and the image of his self-esteem shows his teeth because he has no left, because they are quite raw (images and scenes like Hellraiser (1987) reminded me of make-up. descendants), the end of the course is that Cliff eventually opens the headstock full of self-opening and opens the skin. Bringing the muscle and a cooler box! Very confusing There are also several different body parts. There's even a bit of a nuanced here, at least some beautiful little girls ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Most of the master's episodes do not seem cheap, if it's basically true. The similarity is fine, but there is little "name". Well, seeing that most horror fans should be terribly sweet and pleasant becomes. Covers It's worth a watch ... for those who have stomachs.
