I recently saw Caprica again and thought I might come and write the review! For the first time I saw that I saw the end of the Battlestar Galactica series straight away - I had the power of the universe in the show that allowed me to be a great sharp fan of the show, so I did not know what I expected ... but I've got a smile, but I have to admit it. .. <br /> <br /> The story begins dramatically in the Caprica plan, and there are several interesting characters ... I do not give too much away but there is a dramatic event that tells the story, but I recommend you to see it. <br /> <br /> You have to say ... Esai Morales is the youngest actress Joseph Adama. ... (Father of the Battlestar Galactica of Almirant) I found his play and I believed that he was the father of BSG's William Adama ... <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz also it fits in exactly the role. ..! The special note was Polly Walker outside of Rome! Do not sit down and watch Caprica like hope with Battlestar Galactica, because the story is pretty straightforward and anyone can watch it ... without having to watch BSG! <br /> <br /> This show is a good theater written by a good theater with a bit of a science fiction shot!
