Director Douglas Sirk performs again as part of all the dysfunctional family movies. This sleek and dense saga is a masterpiece that perfectly combines all the elements of Sirk's sound and puts all the films in a strategic way. "Written wind" influenced the "Dallas" and "Dynasty" TV series in the 1980s, that is, a long version of these night soaps. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall, in a splendid, after all, plays Lucy Moore, a New York secretary, a petrol baron and Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). As they both do not know, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) falls in love with a quiet but sexy secret. They return to Kyle's family home in Texas and Marylee (Dorothy Malone, winner of the Oscar) won her rojiblanco sister. Yipee! Sparks start to fly: from catkins to love, this is a tight journey. Mitche does not only have to face his best friend's wife, but Maryle tries to sleep with everyone, because Mitch can not really love her. Everything is parked, Kyle does not learn any problems, but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant. <br /> <br /> This is a pure soap and a melodramatic entertainment. How do you not love? This film is one of the most popular Universal feature films and director Sirken's best works. Some interviews are completely sizzling and visually metaphors are thrown out in this way - the wind theme is very big. The performance is very good, although Bacall is very little in the process of betting on Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss was destroyed. He believed that he was the best, and apparently he was not happy. And it was wonderful as the alcoholic cheer. What a wonderful movie! This movie shows what he thinks at all ages - Sirk is a master of the classic melodrama. Where is his Oscar? <br /> <br />
