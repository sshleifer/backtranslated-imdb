A surprisingly pleasing effort, which combines the right plot of Adam and Burt for the original TV television. Most of the flashback scenes were raised directly in Burt Ward's "Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights," and I imagine that his book was an inspiration for the movie. Like the book, fans of the original series dropped out of hunger. <br /> <br /> If you do not miss out on this performance, a friend who has been recorded has definitely been trying hard to borrow a tape. Now, I'm making a copy for my children.
