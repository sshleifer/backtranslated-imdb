This movie is a horror anthology. It's enough, but it can use a bit more. I compare it to "Doctor Terror's House of Horrors", although this title is adapted. It has four stories that connect a house. The first story is about writer and wife. Creates a killer for his latest novel and begins to see the killer in his house. This is a predictable one, but eventually he has thrown some lies. The next story is unpredictable, and you really do not know what a heck is going on. This is Peter Cushing and probably my favorite range. This man buys the house, but he is not the house he takes on stage, but a strange wax museum. The third story is pretty good and Christopher Lee offers. That is, his daughter seems unprotected, a rather curious father. The problem is that the story is not going to end sooner. It drags a little bit until it reaches the predicted succession. Then the last story is about the actor who buys a mantle of a strange store. The actor really gets paid. There is a small story about an officer trying to figure out what happened to the actor and then explains why it happened. Although I was very pleased with the explanation, I do not think Cushing's story fully explained. I think they need more of such a story. All in all, there was an interesting story set.
