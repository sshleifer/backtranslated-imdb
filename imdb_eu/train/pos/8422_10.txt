A Russian-Revolutionian movie is called an add-on to play. However, it is not extraordinary. Serguis Alexander, the former commander of the Russian army, instead of recovering the same scene of professional and personal tragedy, was a Russian revolutionary to meet the director and Alexandro to be humiliated. Today, this broken man will be the first punishment. Von Sternberg is a well-aimed animated film, giving ironically everything he can to Alexander's character. Jannings deserved an Oscar as he played his moving performance, when he generally played in his deep valley. Powell is a crazy helper as the director of the revenge director and Brent is the perfect expression on his face and movements as much as the love of Jannings. Shine around. Rating, 10.
