I swear, as the zombie died twice, and he came back. I gave it to this movie 8. Let's see people, that is what other reviewers say, that is, "camera available", filmed. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to all the indy movies. Todd Sheets, who was awarded more than 700 zombies, is paying homage to her talents. Yes, the story has gaps, yes, we see the same zombies again and again, but who really cares? Take it for yourself, a fun horror movie, to share your eyes with one or LOL people who really like it. Older people, I think you like junk jets like "Titanic" or "Twister". Peace, support and independent film support !!!
