After watching this comic little movie and comic, you will probably feel better. Animate Yves B. Pelletier to film this great moment, which I think will be marked as a brand in Quebec in 2004. Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon act as an expressionist. Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain, I would like to compare the feeling that gives me a fascinating story. So, if you like Jean-Pierre Jeunet's wonderful movie, you'd like the first movie of Yves B. Pelletier, Les Aimants.
