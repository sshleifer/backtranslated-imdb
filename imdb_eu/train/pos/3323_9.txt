A month ago I got this film and now it's Drew Barrymore. I like a happy ending, and this film captivates the truth of the Red Sox. It's about a teacher of mathematics, a success story of a successful company, Lindsey (Drew), who promises a math trip. Then, Ben (teacher) and Lindsey are dating. But it's not easy when Red Sox confesses that he is a fan. <br /> <br /> All the first things are good, but then their baseball goes into the life of Lindsey. Okay, at last, he took a shot at Drew to ride across the field! I got Blockbusters in two ways, I was happy. If you like movies like Drew's Charlie-Angels and 50 first dates or even Hugh Grant, you'll also see a new movie called Music and Lyrics.
