This movie was one of my childhood favorites and, unlike other films from that era, I had to keep the quality of Baghdad's Thief. Children are just a movie to enjoy, and even adults can watch and enjoy. This is the only disadvantage, that is to say, we can not overcome the bad effects (compared to the current effects), as it could be when a child was. I did not remember anything of these effects, of course, I was ten years old when I had watched this movie at the age of eleven. Who then sees the effects? We look for good stories and entertainment, which is what this film gives. In my opinion, this film of XX. It's one of the great adventure films of the twentieth century. Let's think Indiana Jones is very similar. Comedy, love and adventure all come together, creating a wonderful blend that will take you to the end of the year, although it is not a modern movie or movie style and a non-modern style. dust and old. All of this is, above all, a great story, good directors and good performing actors. This section highlights Sabu (Abu) and Conrad Veidt (Jaffar's), featuring comedic and horrifying elements of the film. An excellent movie and "antique", definitely, a "goldie". I hope someone will come to mind and release that courage on a DVD one day. 10 to 10
