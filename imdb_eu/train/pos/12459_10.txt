This movie is definitely my favorite movie. The interaction between respectable and morally unknown characters is a time between knights and honor robberies and police. He deals with issues such as tasks, guilt, word, manipulation, and trust, just like a few films, and sadly, at the end of the 70's I remember the "death" of "police". Sequence is delicious, it is essential, nothing is lived, and so it brings the viewer into a wonderful and direct plot, often attractive and spectacular looking scenes, so that audiences in smaller genres are awake. This scene is not present or necessary. The argument is visually and honest to the viewer; Because the suspense is an active genre that gets through the treacherous audience. No, this is not lost ... Music notes of happiness in order to see and enjoy a movie not only to see.
