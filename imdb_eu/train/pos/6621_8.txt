I saw the pre-release of Noir's science fiction film. The style is definitely the only one and is well done. It has been filmed with real actors, but it turns into a black and white comic style that you have never seen. It goes one step further than Sin City, and it does well. Successful combination of French comic and film culture. Blade Runner reminds you of the story and the mind, and if you like this, you will surely like this too. The story is intelligent, it is never boring and trivial. This movie is inevitable for all filmmakers, except those who do not like science fiction or b & w.
