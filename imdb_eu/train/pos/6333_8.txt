I used the video and I saw it last night. The performance was very bad (hey ------ hey ------ twister), but it was very good soon after. Tornadoes looked very fake, and many of CGI's effects were very dodgy, but the house was broken and the contents swollen, and compared to movies such as Twister. The destruction scenes were also very well done. The story was very well written and it is refreshing to see a movie that is far from different films like this and has been the genre's film for 30 years. <br /> <br /> While this has been a very weird mix of movies with FX and interpretation, this is worth my book A.
