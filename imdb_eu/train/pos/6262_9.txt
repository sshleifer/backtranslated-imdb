It was incredible that it was difficult to believe that the "neglected tribes" would make this stunning migration twice a year and filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, gave scenes and shots. But what are the shots! Cinematography, in most extreme conditions, is superb, and the Iranian music score released by videos is a memorable documentary for more wealth. <br /> <br /> I watched this and I had the pleasure of "Kon Tiki". At the same weekend, it was a thrill and, of course, people could be hard-pressed and daring, courageous, primitive survival or adventure or science needs.
