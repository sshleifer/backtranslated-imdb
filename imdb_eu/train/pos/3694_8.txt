He did not know what to expect from the amazing collection of stars and directors of this movie, but he did not disappoint at last. <br /> <br /> For me, it was the last episode with American tourism. Talking about the incredible French accent (that is, what feels better than mine) was really moving and was a great way to complete the movie. <br /> <br /> The story of the paramedic and the victim is also very moving and the comedy has been awarded Coen Brothers and Steve Buscemi. The clip by Tom Tykwer has been spectacular, but in an ambitious field. <br /> <br /> However, Bob Hoskins's segment was totally dull and the vampire story was absolutely awesome. Wes Craven's interview was also forced and Chinatown's story was completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> In general, this film looks good and has a solid finish. It's not very painful to get into bad parts - they last only 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Ca vaut la comb!
