I watched a version of 139 min (panoramic) versions with some friends and we were amazed away. I do not repeat saying others. What they do with the filmmakers concept is unexpected and fun. The terrible fight is tiring. Afterwards, we were surprised to know that there were still about 30 minutes remaining, but this did not get completely involved and entertained. <br /> <br /> It almost ruined something and it was. music / songs. Blues, Country / Folk and Rock Ballads are not included here and we all laughed at each one of us. It's horrible You have been warned but you are told a story and story. <br /> <br /> There are great moments to appreciate talent behind the camera. There are many uses of silence and slow work. I really want to delete the music, but, oh! <br /> <br /> Find this. It is fun, it is different and it takes you to unexpected places and is very refreshing.
