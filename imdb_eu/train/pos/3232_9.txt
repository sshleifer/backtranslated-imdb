I wanted to see this Finnish movie and I have to say that it is one of the best films I have seen this year. Intrigue is made up of 5-6 different stories and is performed in the same day in a small Finnish town. In the end, stories are very good, perhaps reminding us of the way Tarantino films are. Most actors acted very well, this is definitely a kind of realistic drama. I especially liked Sanna Hietala, the actor and the playwright Juha Kukkonen. I noticed IMDB's incorrect information about Sanna. The name you would notice in my review;), It's NOT Heikkil√§, but Hietala.
