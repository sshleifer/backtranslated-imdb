The film begins with Vincent Price about his work as a magician. However, in the midst of a very successful show, the police come and close. He seems to have deceived his old boss from the tricks he created Price - even when he was home. As a result, the price causes a bad male to die. The problem is that the viewer understands why Price died and this was surely good, because Price was a bit unhealthy (like Lay-Potato chips). <br /> <br /> With a very creative and spectacular magic film (including a large circular icon and cremation for shows), including great plots and exciting action. It's sad that you can not say about this movie. Although not very subtle, it is very funny, although it is worth a look. <br /> <br /> I never saw Vincent Price's version of HOUSE OF WAX. They scored 8 or 9. For this reason, THE MAD MAGICIAN is a wonderful film that reminds us of this film (HOUSE OF WAX). Based on the success of HOUSE OF WAX, the monitoring formula has been renewed. Both were made on 3-D, and Price also has a plot that kills all the justifications, but it can not stop when it is committed, and both are very entertaining. The biggest differences, and there are few, was the HOUSE OF WAX color, and it was more than a horror movie and THE MAD MAGICIAN was definitely a bigger mystery. <br /> <br /> My advice is to see this movie AND THE SMALL HOUSE (Price only). Both are horrible horror films.
