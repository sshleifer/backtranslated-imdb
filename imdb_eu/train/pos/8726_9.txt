Now, this is a family movie! In recent years, there are few movies for families or children who deserve really worth seeing; but it is one of them. My entire family came out of the movie, horrified, entertained, fascinated and happy. There are still little passages we're writing there. The kids got up and we too (hubbie and I, respectively, 36 and 32)! ) very well developed. Not one of them you can not empathize with. These people, who bring these little creatures to life, have good voice talent, combined with the best Disney animation capabilities and art. Walt Disney is a movie that deserves it. I think that Mr. Disney would accept this new movie ... Flick, Dot and his little small heroes may be as well known as Mickey and Minnie in our time. <br /> <br /> This is a family. To watch the theater again, and buy it or put it on the video or DVD. I'm eager to see you again ... for the first time you missed it. (I have never seen my children so quickly and strongly identify and embrace the characters before ... my daughter is still talking about the little "Dot") fun for the whole family!
