A horror movie full of fascinated faces, but Cristina Raines (later stolen on "Flamingo Road" television) is a beautiful but unstable model, with a gummy smile that is in charge of protecting the laughter, taking care of the Hellenic Door. Raines modeling scenes are well trapped, moody music is perfect, charming Deborah Raffin is Cristina's mother, but when Raines turns into a stunning Brooklyn Heights (when a blind priest on the floor lives) things get started really. . Neighbors, including fantastically evil, include Burgess Meredith and Sylvia Miles and Beverly D'Angelo, many diabolics, and Eli Wallach is a police detective. The movie is almost pollinated by "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist", but what a combination! Based on the best vendor of Jeffrey Konvitz, Spooky's "The Sentinel" is entertaining, and Michael Winner has a lot of good-looking shots. *** 1/2 ****
