An expected movie in 2002. After three years and a half hibernation, Rajinik has played in this film. This movie was hype toooooo high. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical Rajini movie. In this movie he also offers some spiritual messages. But acts of Rajina, styles, songs, etc. He has a good movie and gives good messages. <br /> <br /> This movie will be excellent for Good Day instead of the script. Movie to watch. Do not miss!
