The first picture of the film shows a hillside morning in the early morning clouds, and my thinking was: "That is, it's almost too beautiful." And so it continues: images of scenery and animals that look like a romantic drawing series, each of which is perfect for every detail. Even the girl's room, the father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. This seemed obsolete and elusive, but a story of silent beauty fits between the life and fairy tale, Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. Every minute I liked. The extreme parsimony of the movie, a simple and slow story, a single actress and almost special effect, had a strong magic. So, in the last minutes, I think that this parsimony is canceled, and suddenly there are two additional actors (women as their age and their son). Another mistake is music, often intrusive, Hollywood, and sometimes inadequate: I could not bring English pop-song to a French mountain glory. I went to the movie together with my two young daughters, but I recommend for adults because they appreciate this type of film. Of course, no one is.
