I will give this movie from 10 to 10, because the roles were interesting, and an unknown woman guesses an interesting "guessing" game. The movie, however, needs more Robin there. He appeared at the beginning of the film and the rest period. I always thought that the new animated series were committed to the new Robin character, left with Knightwing. This film has a bad tradition. The film overwhelms Bruce Wayne and his love movies would not be so bad in a movie, if love was so unbelievable. It's a good movie if you're still a fan of Batman and I'd recommend watching that.
