The voice of Tressa has been brilliant! Tressa played a female singer while Richard was in the club. When he got out of the stage, and started riffing and began to work his things, he shook my soul. His voice is platinum. It has to make a CD. He has more fans and he realizes it. He liked the beat at five rhythms at heart, because he was the star of Leon. How can a little girl make a voice so big? It's really amazing. Good voice Good, Good, Good, voice voice, voice, great voice, great voice, shaking back, tearful cry, uplifting, in the day of your voice. If you read the promise of commitment, take my advice and start recording a CD. If it's not for singers love for lovers. I think you can really do it. Check out another single soloist, lol.
