A predecessor code with Stanwyck that plays a pioneer whore that reaches the highest level. These preconfigurations really leave the imagination untouched. Stanwyck's Lilly is as prominent as the owner of a father / daughter's father who sells his patrons (johns). After the death of the old one (good!), He directs it to the big Barb town to get better things. sleep at the top. John Wayne's "cameo" is a bad thing and proves that the actors get up with their age and a better theater coach. I love mixing actors and strong lines. I recommend all movies to watch this movie and see Stanwyck as beautiful as Lilly.
