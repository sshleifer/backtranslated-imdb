With Will Smith and Gene Hackman, this movie resembles "an enemy of the state", a genius of innocent male (black) with modern "knowledge-intensive" humans. Normally when such a story is copied, the result is a disaster. This does not apply here. Of course, David Mors likes everything I do, so maybe my comments are not correct, but that's a good thing about that movie. Doug Hutchison's worst performance was brilliant, and the story was excellent, such as David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), was the worst part. So it has no place, no matter how much it is, it does not evoke the public's sympathy. Or do not start, it's strange to grow in you (and even to your followers!). I did not expect much when I rented it, but I was amazed by a good movie buzzing action. 7/10
