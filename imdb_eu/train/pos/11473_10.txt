Zero Day has seen a lot of people and have gotten that shame. <br /> <br /> When I saw the end, the two main characters go downstairs and pity people and then commit suicide. and I took my stomach. I was trembling, this movie is very powerful. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing. It's impossible to get a ten. It's sad that the beauty of this movie really understands so little. A movie does not work well, the amount of feelings that the authors make. <br /> <br /> I leave you with a permanent impression on your mind that you just can not get out. The shooter realizes the real fear, especially if you know this person, and you feel like you know this film. <br /> <br /> I recommend Zero Hour for those who feel mature. to see enough I am fourteen years old and I think this movie is incredible. It seems that you are seeing something really happening.
