The Technicolor Cinematography pioneer (winner of the Oscar Special Technique) is a wonderful one. Add a lot of glamor and variety clothing and a group of movie theaters, such as Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer, and a nice "picture". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, you want much more inventive plot and even more ongoing actions. However, they are not the most impressive Technicolor films (1936), and since then, very little, which is superb in this spectacular color. The fans of "Robin Hood" (1938), "Jesse James" (1939) and "Gone With The Wind" (1939) have enjoyed the great film industry. "Allah Garden" will always be synonymous with excellent cinematic color.
