At the beginning of his career, Capra got his camera and time. It's a thin story, sometimes very predictable, but it's very good from its cast, and it has some intricate camera movements that intimately involve the viewer. The first part is like a Cinderella story, although it seems that anyone with the brain will fall to the bottom, "a rich prince" will lose his fortune. <br /> <br /> However, thanks to its good cast and fast pace, you will easily find it in the topical. Then the movie becomes more original, because the husband and wife have to find a way to get life. Finishing is very predictable, but satisfying. I am also delighted with writing the title: very fun and fun.
