A great movie and a great example of a movie that has not shown anything to the viewer. It's a series of stories about terrifying and horrifying people from an old-fashioned house and their imagination. All of this includes a story about a missing horror movie star of Scotland Yard, an inspector. The main character begins with a story about a mysterious writer that is totally realistic, after a story that has become obsessed with a wax image of a wax in a museum in a museum. But not, and close the story of the movie star missing and what the inspector does. It's a lovely print, so that the work of Duffell's manager and those who had a little budget to get the most out of it. Add Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee plays, and you've got a movie that you can enjoy again and again. Do not answer your phone if anyone in Stoker Real Estate calls you to offer a vault in a beautiful English farm house?
