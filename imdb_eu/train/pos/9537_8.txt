Some people think that the evaluation is very generous, but this is because I think managers have done a good job at their disposal, that is, a movie, a movie that has a taste of it! <br /> <br /> I immediately thought that "The Thing" was a direct connection to classic classical worship, that is, foreign parasites in foreign spaces, a great host of human hosts, in order to find out how much they could do. <br /> <br /> You can see that this film pays tribute to a film and other horror / gore genres, however, although its originality is carefully maintained, these things fight each other and eat opponents who eat it later they continue! When a new human needs to die and choose a human being! Then pick a fight with another infected host! And this film also casts a love story, but I do not say it, otherwise, it seems too much. <br /> GREAT! But as I say with the flavor you get, so do not be surprised if you do not like the movie. The budget is low and both blood is thirsty, creatures / foreigners / things that appear in their body morfing look gross weapons, that is, saws, drills, blades and even odd guns but decimate there opponents. I thought I was showing up, but at the same time it was stuck on the screen asking what would happen! <br /> <br /> So, if you like gore, you like foreigners, want to fight and you like it even more. I'm going to recommend this film somewhere, somewhere sweet, somewhere. I wanted to find it before!
