"Casomai" is a magical tale that depicts the story of a young couple who travels through dark water. This story is very credible amongst the winking and constant interference of others, which is very unbelievable in all of Italy (maybe it might be asking whether they happen elsewhere). Pavignano and D'Alatri started writing very well, and this is one of the strongest points in the film. Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo's hands are hard and sound. The sympathetic priest is a funny and round image. In the end, a movie that deserves, probably one of the best Italian annual films.
