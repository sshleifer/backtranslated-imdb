Nacho Vigalondo's managers need more outing for their talents. 7:35 The absolute morning is genius. The director of Hollywood gets short films that can be transmitted by Nacho in 8 minutes. I saw this smiling, but I felt dirty and not sexually. You sit down and ask yourself how you should feel after seeing this 8 minute. Nugget. I was entertained, but at the same time I was disturbed. Only a few people can do it in 8 minutes. It's pretty easy to start. A young woman enters her usual place to have breakfast. It starts to sit and sing somebody. From there, the film will take you through different emotions, it is very difficult to describe it. It is in black and white, but this helps thanks to the feelings of the film. This film seeks out more information about the characters, the ways in which they interact beforehand and how they end up after those lives. I think it's like the old phrase: "Leave it for more," Nacho Vigalondo can do that. Check this whenever you can. Show your friends and ask how 8 minutes can be so much fun without removing your clothes.
