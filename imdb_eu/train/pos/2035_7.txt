Well, I'm going to go on the opposite side of the movie, it seems. As I was confessing a horror fan, I was seated what I expected. I'm afraid after 2 or 3 minutes (quite strange). The movie, of course, has a small budget and is located around the crossroads, but the films do not take away the story of missing money. Yes, the story is very far and not very clear, but THE CREEP is a class action and cuts and breaks everything that goes into its path. MOVIE MEANS !!! CREATE CINEMA IN YOUR RELEASES TO USE CINEMA USE OF ANY PART! You will understand when you see. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a good movie and changes to watch a good slasher movie that really frightens you.
