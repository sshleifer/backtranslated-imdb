Jeopardy has a feeling of being a lot of movies. There, it is one of the most important quotes and box office booths. It's just 70 minutes and there are not many sets, and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star, of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a tough lady with a convicted rescue while waiting for her husband in the desert in Mexico. Most of the film focuses on how he worked with his own sperm whomever he wants to exchange for his help. They are fighting psychologically. <br /> <br /> The little film is surprisingly effective - it stretches out a short length and Stanwyck is great without mentioning it (but I still praise it every time).
