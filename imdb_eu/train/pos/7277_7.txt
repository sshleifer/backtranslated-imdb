Hohokam is a curious film about an archaeologist who studies the ancient Indian culture. Outside of the tomb cave (actually a false appearance) he takes a mummy and goes home to investigate. Well, it's pretty curious and it starts talking to that momia. Shortly afterwards, the son has the spirit of momia. The most strange events occur when the spirit tries to destroy the woman's family. That is, it really really gets bored, in general, and will make you sleep for the first time you will see it for the first time. If you still keep it, it may take you to the end. <br /> <br /> Ahah! What is the secret of momia? Is Mummy's spirit angry at the cave? You may not know what the motivation of the mind is, but if you like terrific quotes (70's!), It will appeal to you. <br /> <br /> My way of describing the story is much clearer than the story that narrows the story with the dull way. Is it boring a brilliant movie? Well ... somehow this is accomplished. Maybe this is a good-hearted movie, but run in a nasty way. I do not know. I know they enjoyed it a bit, despite being proud. <br /> <br /> The fans of "Spider Baby" will be interested in using a couple of musicals in this movie. (including the instrumental version of the theme song). <br /> <br /> The sequence is terrifying and quite well, and rocks and rocks begin to attack themselves and attack many people in an excursion. The other movie scenes are scary or extravagant; But this scene is really terrifying. <br /> <br /> See this! It's strange and it's worth your time. You may even want your shelf.
