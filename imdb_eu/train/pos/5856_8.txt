Evaluation E (it has violence). <br /> <br /> I had an original game for the PC spiderman for two years. I still do not beat, because I'm on a Windows XP account. You will notice that you have XP. But for those who do not have XP, try an attempt at this game. Action is a wonderful and fun game with family. Spiderman and criminal criminals that you take. Spiderman is a fun little game and I recommend that you have spiderman fans or parents who want a fun and clean game for kids. <br /> <br /> 8/10
