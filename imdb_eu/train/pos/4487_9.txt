"Fraidy Cat" is the fourth of these cartoons. I like it at least, so I'm surprised I get mixed reviews. <br /> <br /> This is a rather funny story, even though it has its own comedy moments. It's a dark and terrifying atmosphere. Suspicion is another solid element here. Regarding humor, it's mostly dark humor. <br /> <br /> In short, Tom listens to the awesome nightly radio shows and is terrified, because it's ghosts, what he thinks. While Tom dies, Jerry sees everything and can not laugh all the time. In fact, Jerry finds a way to quickly and more torture. With the help of a white T-shirt and a vacuum cleaner, it creates a "ghost". Although Jerry clearly says Tom for good reason, the story is fun. Also, there is no violence again here, because Tom and Jerry are one of the oldest cartoonists. However, I did not get Tom's 9-year-old joke into almost vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br /> In the end, when Tom knew that Jerry's entire scheme, and Jerry was stupid. Jerry «enters his hand in the cookie jar» (it's worth it). However, Tom shows an incredible patience before reacting. It turned out Jerry looked about a minute. It's fun to invite him to laugh at Jerry Tom and take him about half a minute, Tom looks at him with a serious face. Jerry wants to be fun, but Tom does not laugh. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a different, unique and outstanding Tom and Jerry experience.
