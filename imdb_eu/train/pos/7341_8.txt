I enjoy the Ralph Bakshi movies ("Wizards", "Cool World" and "Lord of the Rings" animation greed) and Frank Frazetta is a collector and a fan. Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard also share the sword and sorcery they love the world. <br /> <br /> I lost the "Fire and Ice" version of the play in 1983, and I want to wait to see it. then videos or resurgences. So the 2005 version was a dream for me. However, I bought a little I questioned, I expected it would not be worth watching only once and then I hope to collect the shelf "collection" to collect dust on the day until I die. Luckily, my fears were grounded and this movie seemed very pleasing to me. <br /> <br /> Like Frazetta, physics and sexuality are the most difficult in fantasy / sword and sorcery films. cursed or dirty. Art is good and you will see the amazing Frazetta pictures. Although my young boys liked to see me and asked me to see them again and again. However, my wife has some disadvantages for the generosity of the princess (very Frazetta-skier). I do not like it, it's incredible and there's no sex scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are roto-scoping used, but I like roto-scoping. He is a lightest and realistic movement of characters that finds it difficult to find in animations. <br /> <br /> Despite some monitoring problems, I would recommend this movie to Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan, and sword and sorcerer enthusiasts. Enjoy!
