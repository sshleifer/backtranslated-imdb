I started to see this show recently, and I had to say it to make it laugh. You need to take into account its realistic aspects, along with everything else. Others have said that this show has to be more realistic of the dead, among other things. If you want to admit that Ned can bring life to the dead, you must admit the other crazy shows. I could not see it smiling at all the sections. I really do not think it's so good that a show can bring a very strange topic and really make it look good. I love the narrative I absolutely love, I think it's a little bit strange to the whole show. A writer can not always compare the old show with his new; because you need to take your own entity. Certainly, give yourself a chance, and just enjoy it as ridiculous portions.
