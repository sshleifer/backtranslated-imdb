This science fiction masterpiece has too many mistakes when editors have been released since editors in 1936. The sight is to see it, but the scripts and advances provide intellectual intelligence too. Anytime you give a message to recite great messages. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, two great actors, come out like a fanatic couple. Ralph Richardson is a great megalomaniac "Major". World War II's prediction was very dramatic, as it was at the height of one of the most devastating conflicts in human history. I am sure that the war has taken place unlike the movie. There are sequential mounting of stunning visuals, jumping between the passing of time. Although it's not entertaining as I did not expect, this movie will come into your head after you've seen it.
