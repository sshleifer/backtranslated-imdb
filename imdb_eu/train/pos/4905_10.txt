"All of these songs are considered as new." This film ignores the moments that open some rhythm and dark moods. And why not? Dame Judith Dench's awesome talent, as a widow who plays saxaphone with the street musician, as a source for many of his marriages, as a source of many of his marriages, as a source of many marriages as a widow of Olympia Dukakis, is a drum as Ian Holm. They loved all the members of the Second World War (one or more swings). But wait, there is more. Add low to Leslie Caron, and finally a great voice by Clio Laine, and Blonde Bombshells, the hottest group in England by the Beatles. Well, well, not really, but this movie is the winner. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Elizabeth (Dench) spends her whole movie with Blonde Bombshell trying to meet her granddaughter's school dance. And before rolling your eyes, think about how difficult and courageous a series of sex-oriented women will be to stage before a Britney Spears generation after an action called "Open Wound". <br /> <br /> One-way career with actors over the age of 30, the second most popular band is the compilation of the greatest hits, and more than a month of music for the old has almost no airplay option, it's an excellent talent, real music and a great one to see it. It's a really good movie, where else the BBC. <br /> <br /> I love this movie and I know I've seen it several times and I will enjoy it every time.
