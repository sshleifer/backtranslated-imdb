It's wonderful! In Story Mode, from punk to pro. You must complete skating, driving and walking targets. You create your own skater and give it a name, and you can look stupid or realistic. You play with your friend Eric during the game and betray you until you get the skateboard team (you can select a team) and start your team! Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 in New Jersey, Manhattan and even II. School (although not as a story), you can unlock Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another skater. You can create your goals with SKATE Letters, COMBO Letters, Tricktris, Gap and much more. You can create a pedestrian goal and speak to write it. If you get bored of this, you can make pre-parks in premade parks. The only thing that was not about this game was that it was sometimes difficult to drive cars. 9/10.
