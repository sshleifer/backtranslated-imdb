I think they've told the truth all the time ... I can not turn anything trusting ... hell with the family went by. These poor guys were too young to understand what was going on around them. But still face the rumors. In addition to losing his little sister. I do not think this case has been extended for a long time. The jury can not see the truth, even though the bishop has thrown it away, I feel for this family and I know what happened to them. I would, I would. I do not know what happened, I can not imagine. After watching this movie, I was crying and I had to look at the little girl on the bed ... I think everyone watches.
