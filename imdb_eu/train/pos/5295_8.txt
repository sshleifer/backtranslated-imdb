I thought this film was charming. Apparently, John Waters's strict autobiography is: Pecker's greatest gift is the ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong works well, but the best performances are Grandma, Mink Stole (a hilarious camera) and Patty Hearst. I think the reviewers are far from this base. It seems that the worst assessment of Pecker's gospel work is being done, I think the movie is actually an artist's hope.
