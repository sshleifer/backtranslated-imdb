Dicken's adaptation of "Oliver Twist" music. In most cases, the original story has been preserved, although some of the underlining in the film flow (such as the summer and half brother recovered) are not excluded. The biggest difference between the film and the story is that Fagin is hanging at the end of the book, which is a very different end of this film. <br /> <br /> This is a type of music ... style and scope really did not exist before or after. Songs are often not very memorable and memorable, but the choreography of the movie is to see the sight. In most musicals, a few people or maybe a small group with a choreographed dance, here numbers are hundreds or even more. The sight is really watching and I was fortunate when I saw it in the theater when it was released and it is one of the first memories of childhood. After seeing it recently, I would say that the movie was only improved over time. Wonderful sets, wonderful performance and singing - this is a treat that is hard to love. <br /> <br /> I watched the video again tonight I was surprised again for myself. Mark Lester's song was for the movie. According to the IMDb, his singing was dubbed by a girl and this would account for her voice.
