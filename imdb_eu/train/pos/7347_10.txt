The masterpiece Fire & Ice Ralph Bakshis is forgotten in the OOP rental video studio. <br /> <br /> Well, one thing, that's what you've ever seen better than Conan-esque any other movie. Sure, it's cheesy, but who cares? Time was tested and the only beginnings of starting a cheesy look are LOTR: it is comparable to modern fantasy theater like FOTR (even if it's a movie that loved it). <br /> <br /> Plots play: Fight between Fire & Ice, a kingship kidnapped by Jarols (Izotz), the most subtle creatures, while recovering only one survivor of a town victimized by the town. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's not as good as the original Betty, but that's not it. It's really an interesting idea of ​​two enemy worlds: Fire & Ice. It's a success. <br /> <br /> Considering the scenes of the actions: excellent. They handle well, they have a great suspicion and they have a lot of noise. Check out the climate fight, now it's over! <br /> <br /> Impact and conversation: the competence. Really They will not be nominated for an Oscar, but they are good and they are not nervous. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty good. 3D shot and rotoscoped (THINK) seems pretty good. Numerous origins are very accurate and well-designed, and while character designs are 1-sharp, they're fine. <br /> <br /> In general, this will erase a little jewelry and entertain you more. "entertainment" than any superficial one. 10/10
