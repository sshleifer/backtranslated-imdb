Ever one of the best comedies. I watched this show 10 times and I'll probably see another 100. So much so, according to the DVD we mentioned by my friends and family, we thought we had not seen anything. The initial part of Alcatraz is slow, but it will be crossed either on the Eddie stage or on the stage. Check the part of "Cake or Death" (Joking about the Church of England) and part of "Hitler / Pol Pot" (it's hard to see, just see). The best part of the show can be Eddie's facial expressions. He can really tell with eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow will probably help, huh?) Fair Warning: Eddie tends to throw four words into a lot of words.
