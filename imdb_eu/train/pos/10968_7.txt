Gray Gardens were fascinated and crazy and you could not really look. It was so strange, funny and sad and sick and ?????? ... can not really describe words. The Gray Gardens movement is amazing. I read this head because my uncle John was offered by the Great Bathroom Bathroom Reader, the Bathroom Reader Institute, and it is worth renting and connecting with the upper part of my movie queue. This film is about the strangest people ever shot. It's best to see Edie's favorite outfits, I'm sure the curtains will come in. When I got old I wanted to be like Big Edie, my nose was normal and socially playing.
