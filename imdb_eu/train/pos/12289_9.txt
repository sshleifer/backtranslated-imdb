In the end, I'd like to emphasize that I did not read the book, so there was no chance I could be disappointed in this respect. The main fault seen was historical detail: various cars, trains, clothes, etc. I thought that those times were not. <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of the movie is ok, nothing is allowed. But I think, it was horrible. I have no experience with acting, I still can not believe how people watch this. Perhaps they have seen two films (never), and the other one must be very good! <br /> <br /> Especially liked Jeremy Irons, and he really understood his character, someone who climbed up on the stairs. After a very hard job, he is fighting against those who take his life for himself. Only he will enter into that battle, he does not realize that reason is no longer there, and a man stops beating and disappointed. Irons gave him so unbelievable that he had a relationship with his character despite his brutality. <br /> <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a young romantic woman, involved in the revolutionary ideals of her groom (Banderas). I think it's an undeveloped part, and Glenn Close was also very good. Meryl Streep had an average performance, it was not bad, just the rest of the actors' standards. Be careful Miguel Guilherme, a fine Portuguese actor amongst many stars. Compared to today's films, interpretations here are only people, but at the same time not disturbing. Cinema, trying too much to be intellectual. The best proof I really liked is writing 7 years later.
