In the old commercial audio casette, the label line "is it authentic or is it Memorex?" The same thing happened about the events of this event - a collection of "The Cage", the first Star Trek rider. Mr. Spock asks the ship to take it to the forbidden plans of Talos IV, allowing the captain Christopher Pike, his first captain, to allow the first captain to burn and stop. Why settle? Having a contact with Talos IV asks for a death penalty. That's why it's never been explained: it's just like me, but it just adds to the story. After traveling to the Talos IV, Mr. Spock turned to Dr. McCoy (chief officer, Captain Kirk, who was leaving the sea) and said: "It's a mutiny of cargo ... I have never received a ship to take it." Below, it comes from the Talosians It is a military court. We know that Pike Pike is so important (notably in paralysis) to endanger Mr. Spok's death. The thrill of thrills, the background music and the story are incredible. And Meg Wyllie, Keeper (headed by Talosian) is wonderful. Call me a sexist, but I never thought of having a female in that role, but it was perfect! The Talonians, almost all the physical activities, and almost exclusively under the illusion power, also have unisex; You can not really say that because of a male or a woman, it really does not matter. This section, more than just any other than the series, awaits and prays where there are other worlds and up to now civilizations! What a wonderful thing! This is one of my favorite episodes and, on the other hand, I've often seen (even though I'm in the video), it never fascinates me. Meg Wyllie is like an alien, and I do not say that unkindly.
