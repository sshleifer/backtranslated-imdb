The end of the season confused messages, I felt the feelings of joy, as well as the lies and deceiving feelings. Roseanne tells all her viewers that she is very distant for nine years, her husband, Dan, was killed. Also, he admitted that the family never won the lottery, and what season 9 was a lie as he wanted or wanted. I am still confused when Becky was with David and I'm confused with Darlene Mark, because Becky and Mark are pregnant. So I think that's how he wanted to, but it was not. So the end of the season was good, but sent mixed feelings. I'm always a fan of the show. :)
