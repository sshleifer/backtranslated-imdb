First of all, I mean, "Thank you, Disney for the final release of" Cinderella "on the DVD! Now you have all the Disney animated movies on the DVD (limited edition 1999)! What will you do next? You'll be traveling to Disney World !!! !! "Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) <br /> <br /> In any case, Disney is still a terrific event in 1950 in the classic" Cinderella "movie. . We all know the story of Cinderella, her liars, date, glass slippers, a pumpkin that turns pumpkin "Bippity-boppity-boo!", And of course, trying to get home at midnight! <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: it's a great fairy tale that kids like, now in a movie format (even on DVD) !!!!! <br /> <br> /> "Cinderella" - thank you, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
