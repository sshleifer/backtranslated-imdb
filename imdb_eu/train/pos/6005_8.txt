Although this movie was somewhat sanitized (because people did not talk about sex at any time), the short film is very helpful in knowing what men expect from menstruation before getting ready for the girls. Not surprisingly, it was paid by Kotex, though it is a lot surprising that Disney made this film - in the 60s, 60s did a lot of educational films. Even though the well-known film filmmaker has lost a real chance. Instead of being a pretty voice and a rather flattering voice of the narrative of the woman, Minnie Mouse and the rest of the gang would be wonderful for the use of the gang! I know that old Walt would be given the heart, but that would be a great movie! By the way, the notion of sex is hardly ever shown in the film, although it generally explains menstruation. However, I would like to include some of the details that are missing (above all, about the interview) with the attached brochure. <br /> <br /> Now, I know why I saw the cartoon about menstruation.
