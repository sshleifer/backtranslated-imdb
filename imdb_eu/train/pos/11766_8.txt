This movie has everything you want in an action movie. Blasts, shooters, bad and worse. It's fun to escape from the problems that James Belushi needs to use his humor, "The Skipper," the last major boat stole $ 12 million, which, of course, was a movie in Zinema, but the current DVD dump is much better than it's live If you get rid of this nonsense line you will find that there are a lot of surprises in this movie, you might be able to discuss the preview events, but the fast pace of this movie is not too much time to think, that is, a blessing, because this movie does not want to be the last tour Only the title is misleading and many people hated that movie. Probably, they expected a movie about Mafi, instead of a double cross.
