The latest big budget for the most successful franchise in business, film or television history is the start of a 90 minute session called 'Broken Bow'. First of all, we enter into a massive sequence of action, followed by Koblon following the Suliban (that is, the main enemy of the first season of the spectacle). From there, television travels rarely into a journey, with some of the best character development, story, and action / visual effects, in a period of so short period of time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Opening credits is not a matter for the Entrepreneurs' minority minority, some believe that there is no place for the song. Unnotice words are the lyrics themselves. If we hear the real song, instead of the theme, the pieces of the puzzle begin to spread together. And, finally, the series continues and we learn more about our courageous captain and his team, the song becomes really meaningful. In general, the subject of Diane Warren is beautifully orchestrated and singer of the singer of the song Russell Watson is also sung. <br /> <br /> Everyone is desirous to watch the show and the watch on television, and lay out the structured mode in layers. The company is (in my opinion) Cast Next as one of the best shows since The Next Generation. By choosing Scott Bakula, captain Jonathan Archer was the best choice since he wrote that Patrick himself Stewart Jean-Luc Picard. As the captain always carries the spectacle, Bakula adds a bit to his function and brings a great smile to the faces of those who pump their veins in the blood. It's only that (just a wise actor and a wise character) a great man, and his charm, sense and compassion is complete. As for the other cast members, my favorite John Billingsley is Phlox. It's also nice to watch playing a non-boy role and get the decision to give a dog named 'Porthos' well. The character of the show was brilliant, fast, well and almost perfect. What I said was almost sad, British Anthony Montgomery Travis Mayweather's character is a bit weak at the end of the first season. There are some things here and there, but it is important for producers to be more important. Jolene Blalock is wonderful, sometimes, as Commissioner T'Pol is a tough guy. Dominic Keating Malcolm Reed considers the lieutenant as a strong force and an army officer credible. Connor Trinneer plays Charles "Trip" as commander Tucker, who adds the character of charm and comedy to his character, and finally, Linda Park Ensign as Hoshi Sato, often faces a weaker character, but fortunately it makes it very interesting. All of the characters make up the Enterprise and Star Trek brings a long-standing quality. Every person deserves to see. Smiles and good feelings are guaranteed for the first time that we see all together in the NX-01 Enterprise. <br /> <br /> <br /> The ship itself, NX-01 is doubtful in the design. This series is 150 years old and 100 years before the captain Kirk ahead. So why does the ship seem like a design in the midst of the mid-century ships, that is, the star of the Akira class? The constant problem has been in the Enterprise, but fortunately Rick [Berman] and Brannon [Braga] provide a good explanation for each one. Continuity is just a problem when you are looking at the concept and are obsessed with the smallest details. If you see the show open and wide, you will not have any problems, but why it's time to know it all. So what did Berman and Braga do about the decent ship dedicated to the Star Trek hobby bases? According to them, NX-01 has been the result of the first contact. When he saw through the telescope Zefram Cochrane Enterprise-E and under the leadership of the Riker commander, he talked about ideas in his mind. That's pretty good. Let me move forward. Certainly, it is not easy for some fans to accept such responses, some refuse to watch the show until they get a reasonable response. Let's grow boys George Lucas destroyed the Star Wars series when he started up with a new non-profit trilogy, fans could not do anything but watch it and frustrate it. And then they learned it, well maybe it's not so bad, after all. If you do not accept the quality show, what's in it, what should it be, and go elsewhere. Or try to become a producer in the show and see what you can do. <br /> <br /> Enterprise groups remind me of Deep Space Neko Defiant. They often appear cold and look like a modern structure, and cry out as the military. Maybe that's why they like the USS Enterprise crew (US fleet pilot). The sets are exciting and they represent the show perfectly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It should be and in the right places. Whether they are technicalities, images, sounds, editions or scores. The company is a television science fiction, in short, how it can be shown in genius's hands. Gene Roddenberry would be proud of the series and, as a fan of Star Trek.
