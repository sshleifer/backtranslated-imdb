1st View 29/29/2009 - from 7 to 10 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): The Chinese peasants are well-informed and protagonist in the fight against Mother Nature. This film is based on an unpublished novel and chronicles with families agreed with a child with a married child. The film works well to keep your interest in just a few pointers with Paul Muni. It's a chronicle, Wong Long (a character who plays Muni) and how he cultivated the land, he buys more land and eventually becomes very rich, but then he returns to the land he originally started. Luise Rainer's relationship between his wife and his wife is the main thread of the story (apart from the country) and a non-Chinese agent, but it's a pretty good job of showing the country and people. It is evident that MGM is using money to create a real epic with which it is likely to be paid. The scene with the locks is very well done and the rest of the films seem to be the Best Film Award for Best Cinematography of the Year. The definitive definition of an epic is what this story is about and quite well.
