I worshiped this movie. Although Moritz Bleibtreu is an enthusiast, almost every German movie is counting. But NO main actor is NOT. Directed by Barnaby Metschurat, the only reason to see Juliet's 2001 is, and this movie is really on her shoulders. (this is my invention and ironic ...) inexpensive work in the steel and coal industry. However, they eventually open a restaurant and the film only makes this journey so poetic and at the same time fun and charming. From that moment on, the story tells the two brothers of this family, especially Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi threatens to become a filmmaker threatening his brother's return to Italy with his mother. Below is a great look at what life makes up through your options: a totally neutral one. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film will not tell you what life (Gigi or Giancarlo) was more. Success or more or more interesting. It gives us a compelling look at what identity it should look for when participating in both countries and mentalities. and this look is not just about any affliction or disdain of any country, that is, any wonderful film that deals with immigration tensions. In the 70s, Turkey's director Fatih Akin moved to Germany, giving him a great deal of emotional credibility and accuracy. Cake ice cream is a wonderful performance, especially Metschurat, and - this really must be stressed - this is a small boy who plays Gigi. This child would have something to do with anyone! Great movie, go see.
