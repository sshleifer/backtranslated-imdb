JUST CAUSA is a bad but dignified film, combined with strong strengths and creative writing (but very predictable). Sean Connery is an attack on the death penalty, apparently refusing a black young man (Blair Underwood) from the final punishment. To get things right, it reminds us of the scene of Connery crime. In addition, in addition to the passage of time, Laura has to be part of Fishbourne. Twists and turns and roll-rehab are numerous - some are amazing, some do not - cruising aging endeavor to outline the mystery. It's a playful ending, but JUST KAUSA deserves a look at the slow night.
