Damn, it was a lot to be taken. I liked it a lot. It was very perfect, although there was a lot of editing about it. I can not believe that guy was in good condition for many of them (especially Anton) to achieve this footage without any seriousness ... Dandy was a welcome one, that is, middle-class children took advantage of their situation (and guessed it) for Jonestown wrong I felt and especially for Ant√≥n, and maybe it was not felt by many other people. Excellent piece of filmmaking and excellent selection of themes. I recommend for any music / movie lovers. You will probably learn something about cinema.
