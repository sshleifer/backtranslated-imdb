I remember this series very well. It was excellent: strong and credible, elegant and sexy characters ... and all the offers of the time was different ... and now ... I'm sure it also inspired the "Dramatic Traders" drama. <br /> <br /> Season 1 and Season 2 are available in the UK 2 DVD region. The series is again seeing. <br /> <br /> Season 1 is 13 episodes and 2 season seems to be 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that it has finished after two seasons. <br /> <br /> This series has been very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can get special in Amazon.co.uk.
