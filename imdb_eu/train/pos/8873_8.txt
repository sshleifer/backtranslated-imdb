This movie started at theaters and went on. For its nature, you can see the reasons why it was not well received. It was badly panned rather than the actual movie itself. Higher Education is not spectacular, but it's been a good idea to talk about a horror topic in America: racism. <br /> <br /> Plot / Story: Higher Education Malik based primarily on Omar Epps. Naive star of the track is not enough to face, and the stern teacher (played by Laurence Fishburne). He has a friend of Fudge (Ice Cube) and a beautiful lady called Deja (Tyra Banks). They must face some skinhead later on campus. Remy has a confusion with Michael Rapaport and reconciles with some skinheads in the campus. After imposing their own opinions, they become racist among themselves. <br /> <br /> Review: Higher learning is not without its mistakes: there is little character development, Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and leaders. With skinheads (I forgot my name), Busta Rhymes does not fit into this movie. More men have had male abuse after the movie, with Kristy Swanson as I did not like part of this movie. In addition, the movie was not half bad. Laurence Fishburne was a good teacher at Phipps (although I could not do it without accent), it was the best Fudge Ice Cube and Michael Rapaport remake was good. In the end, John Singleton was one of the best films and one of the reasons that he is now putting down. Film requires Higher Studies, Mississippi Burning and American History X, and requires less films like Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 and Furious and Shaft's remake.
