I saw Soylent Green when it was first published in 1973 and maybe eight other times in T.V or videos. It was always my favorite science fiction and / or Charlton Heston movies. <br /> <br /> Recently, the Egyptian L.A. Theater had a retrospective of Charlton Heston's twelve films. I went out of the situation to see both films in six films. Soylent Green looked great on the Egyptian screen, with the new print. Its initial installation was an excellent start to the beginning scene and the ending of the movie. <br /> <br /> As a policeman who lives in a dog, Charlton Heston feeds on the dog world, but has little natural resources. The world and the man who remembers Eddie Robinson is very old. <br /> <br /> Their chemistry is wonderful. The film looks like an excellent 35 mm print. Fleisher knows the screen filling and the movie theater, writing, music and everything about it. The movie is a very powerful and horrible vision of the future. Think about how the world's population lives, the extinct rain forest, the resources used, the greenhouse effect has been damaging since 1973. I wonder why this film is not in theaters. His reputation should be better. <br /> <br /> Speaking of great repute, people often talk that Charlton Heston is not an excellent actor. In El-Cid, Soylent Green, Warlord, Omega Man, Will Penny and Dundee, I am sure that it is one of our best actors. Yes, of course, he made about a dozen great films and those who cared for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
