This movie surprised me. My friend told me that this movie was "Chick Flick". Boy, it was wrong! This movie has a great family appeal, but it does not play the sex scene. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a great job on Homer Hickamen shoes. The support works are excellent too. <br /> <br /> Science, age, family lawsuits, an excellent train scene ... This film has everything. The soundtrack is good, although the score is quite compact. In the 50s, the greatness of the music movie increases. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth the DVD worthy of coal. The reproduction value is great - I've already seen them.
