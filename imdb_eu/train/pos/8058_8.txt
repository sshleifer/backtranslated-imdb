Like many people here, I've tried this film, I began to test my patience. In the end I poured some tears. <br /> <br /> The oldest movie seems to be dragging 7/8th in length after the fire stops. The oldest filmmakers learned to spend some time through sluggish parts, knowing that they were on the way to paying for quiet payments. But this is not quite accurate. You will see, from the previous viewers, what are the "main parts" of us with the main body of the story. They saw anecdotal and thematic interests. Modern audiences, Spielberg post, are constantly waiting for a small look every two minutes when they are older movies. It is the problem of inflation of modern film. Well, that does not happen. It's not necessary to apologize for this film; You only have to adjust your expectations and personal rhythm when you only see them. At this time, the difference between Avatar and Informator is like the difference between Euripides and Rent productive passengers. Think for a minute. There is no great importance, but Euripides is still worth the try. <br /> <br /> The most exciting "IRA" for the most up to date audience begins with the scene of the court, and it arrives at the last minute, that is to say, when aboard or during that time, you will have your heart broken. It's not an abstract high-resonation of forgiveness that was asked for abstract forgiveness. It is a milk for a single accident and those who forgive for the big lummox, for a little pity. That person is, and that is a nasty recourse. Indeed, after being mad at Gypo, you are angry with angry, that is, if you think it's the most amazing character of all time, eventually Gypo's wife's wife is getting along with another woman, telling her that she will be easy. <br /> <br /> The film may have a feeling, but the sensitivity is not cheap, as some of the people will charge. Here is a life and death that is considered here, and if you take a serious life for a client, sensitivity is the most serious thing. <br /> <br /> 8/10. And its fault from 10 to 10 is not my own and partly yours, if you are reading this. All the more, we have demanded faster and faster, faster and faster, until we can not put ourselves in until 1935 - yesterday, really - as easily as possible.
