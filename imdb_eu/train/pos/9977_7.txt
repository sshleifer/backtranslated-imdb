SPOILERS THROUGH: <br /> <br /> I'm really in this minority, but I like this movie. It is not classical, but it certainly implies and is very adrenaline. I definitely thought that he deserved at least 7 ratings. <br /> <br /> The reason I liked was that I did not see the original. Something tells me that such a movie will be the strongest fans that have not seen the original version and therefore do not compare. This was not a masterpiece, but I went in a lot and I wanted to see the original. <br /> <br /> I liked a lot of things. One was the casting of Kowalkski. Viggo Mortenson was superb and brought a lot of charisma to his role. Since a large part of the film fell on the shoulders, it had to be really brilliant and it was. It was a great task for him. <br /> <br /> Vansishing Point was another thing that was interesting for television. I did not know what happened to me. It surely seemed like filmmaking and I would never have guessed it was not a big screen. <br /> <br /> I found the story too absorbent. I'm not an action movie but I'm absorbed for that. Moreover, it was much more that the action movie, theater, mysticism, love story and people were sensible. (I did not even know Priestly.) And it was moving. This was not a great movie but it's a watch. <br /> <br /> And then it's at the end. It picks up a solid drilling and, if it is included in the story until that moment, it is very difficult to avoid getting it to the end. I do not know how I feel the end. As a result, Kowalkski supposed that he was alive, and, although I am very skeptical about it, it is a movie and realism is not always an ingredient in the mix in the movie. <br /> <br /> So, the end I should have said was very unrealistic, but in a very manipulative manipulator, which I usually like but, for some reason, it is almost to be forgiven in this film. Actually, a lot of things were just at the base of the plot (criminals were more stereotypically?) But the makers did get a lot, although many things were wrong. However, after saying that, I can understand why someone with the most original fan would hate this version, although I have not seen the original, I have seen many original movies have renewed tremendous results. (My favorite is the sequel). But I understand low scores if originals are of high quality. <br /> <br /> People have compared this to Smoky and Bandit. Do you know the version of "The Legends that falls" on the roads? Thelma and Louese? I feel the hints of both films (I like them both.) However, I do not think it was a wonderful movie. The average was better, but not very high. However, an intelligent film with a great casting character is absorbent and adrenaline. My votes are 10.
