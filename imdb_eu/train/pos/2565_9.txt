I really enjoyed this movie about the relationships developed between Japanese women and Japanese women after the war after the war, as well as the barriers that emerged from the prejudices. Japanese Brando (a natural WW2) wants to fall in love with a Japanese woman and want to marry her. His performance is fine (I'm not the main fan of his play) and the movie is wonderful. Red Buttons received an Oscar for the fascinating love of another GI in Japan, although the Japanese women who reverse made a great job. <br /> <br /> I do not want to ruin it. But it's a good movie to see with a fabric box. <br /> <br /> This movie gets to say ALDEA and at the same time entertain it. A most extraordinary treasure.
