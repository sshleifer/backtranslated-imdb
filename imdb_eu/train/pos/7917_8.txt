After reading other reviews and hot comments, I felt that I needed to be baptized in this movie. <br /> <br /> Roeg's films do not associate with one another, and one of them is expected. He likes it is probably out of the mark. <br /> <br /> This movie is a thoughtful and pure gaze on religious faith. A similar movie to him, in his religious message, should be Tolkin's "Rapture." <br /> <br /> <br /> I was surprised that anyone can tell that the story is mischievous and supernatural. The Catholic Faith is a simple movie about wonders and salvation, although you would never have guessed it until the end. It is also the only movie that you can completely think. <br /> <br /> I fell down a Catholic (fortunately), I know what the movie has, and somehow I find it. The love of the last innocence in relation to God and mankind. But if you do not know the type of theology that is based on the movie, you will go overboard. <br /> <br /> As a movie - In front of a story -Cold Heaven's it's not essential. "The Rapture" has a great pictorial and cinematic meaning, but "Cold Heaven" extends its cinematic features. There are no eye-catching plans, no edges, attempts to adapt content to the form. It's a professional shoot but it's tight. He has not even talked about engaging in a great drama class. It's just a simple story that develops. It looks strange; but in the end the mystery is revealed. It seems ambiguous; But with just one line, ambiguity disappears in the fall of the Catholic dogma. <br /> <br /> In that sense, "Cold Heaven" is the same thing that drives a movie like Sting "or" the sixth meaning "or" last fall "or" pure formality "in Polansk. All of these are tricks that make sleeves. They will frustrate you on the way, but they have a clear point, of course, but it's fun, at least in part. <br /> <br /> Still, although it seems that more than one puppy story is punctured with a line, it is worth looking at how it is directed or directed. Try, especially if you are Catholic or have always been.
