Although it is a low-budget production, it is worthwhile to watch the performances and songs of this movie. So far, Walken is one of the most important musical roles. (She is a great dancer and singer and she also shows her acrobatic abilities, watch the car!) With Jason Connery. A great story for children and a very popular character.
