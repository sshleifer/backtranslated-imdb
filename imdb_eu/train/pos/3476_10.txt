Let's go ahead: if you're a baby-boomer, it's been a little while since McCartney was about to go to the city of John's hermit in 1976 and spend the day with him. Certainly you wondered how things went. I heard the writers of this movie from the specific reports they heard from John and Paul, and I agree to the rebuilding of the meeting just like this movie does. However, I did not even buy any imagination in my eyes to make tears work and this fascinating performance. It is wonderful, very credible and 100% saccharine. Now, can not anyone explain why I have not heard this masterpiece before being promoted by CBC? I mean, it's been three years old, good to God! Yes, if you're a fan of the Beatles, it's a must! The Beatles' back melody is also inspired by fine paraphrasies.
