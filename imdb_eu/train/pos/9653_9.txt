It is capable of constantly avoiding first love in clear cinema: all the passion involved is imitated as pale or even worse, ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Lifshitz avoids all dangers and gives a moving, sexy and compelling story of love, disaster, and salvation, while suddenly touching on some of the deepest issues in human existence. <br /> <br /> Main story Mathieu, a 18 year old, is a loner, Cédric, brasher, prominent, but lonely, introverted boy, on a family holiday. They fall in love as they become hot in the summer and decide to live together when the holidays are over. A year later, the relationship ends at a disaster: Cédric exchanges Mathieu, who tries to live himself. He survived and returns to the coastal town to discover the perspectives of his life, this time he was covered in cold winter months. The never-ending impact: it's much implicit, not all sequentially happen. time view Fortunately, the three time lines used (summer of love, psychiatric hospital and winter reconstruction) are color coded: hot summer and orange, hospital scenery and hot scintillation. and blues on the winter coast. <br /> <br /> The two main actors have performed great performances, however, it is a good idea for Stéphane Rideau (Cédric) to have all his power (I can see it more than I can see with him). - Which is immensely widespread in Gael Morel's plays, Jérémie Elkaim (Mathieu) has to be a special mention: his loneliness, then you can feel an almost unbelievable passion, then his character has broken behind an aphasia wall.

He took him to the hospital in an attempt to commit suicide (none of them see) and will we desperately try to get in touch with him again? But he can not understand that he has perished forever, because he seemed nothing of anything with Mathieu's nonsense. <br /> <br /> While there is no hope in the cartoon of Pierre et Gilles in the dusk, it is not unexpected: we will see slow and painful attempts to get in touch with Cédric's life, first by taking a cat, then working in a local tobacco shop and Finally, contact Pierre, who could be his next love. .
