This show really deserves to be seen. I have the best talent cast that I've seen for a long time. The show's unique and fresh premise (ABC's managers did not use it too much, as it was not a reality show). However, this show was incredible with likes and wonderful stories. I probably do not like the show at age, like I'm fifty years old, but I love many of my friends (Late mid-40s and 40s) and die quality shows with talented members. I do not think the show has given enough time to get a viewer. I think I would spend more time with this show that it would be very good. Once again, ABC is not a real opportunity to give a real potential show. There is so much opportunity for so many shows and it's not nearly worth it! They have to show the quality of the real opportunity and really click and earn a viewer. I really love the characters and when I look at each section I look forward. I've watched the sections of ABC videos and the show is improving. I think we owe one more episode (number 13). What we can do to see it! Bomb it with ABC emails and letters and see if it is possible to save this show from disappearing. Without a doubt, he worked for Jeric√≥. It is worth saving some things and this show is one of them.
