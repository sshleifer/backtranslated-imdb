I really liked Tom Barman's AWTWB. You just have to leave and enjoy yourself while it lasts, and do not expect anything. It's like sitting in a cafe-terrace, like beer, summer sunshine and people watching. Certainly, then, it will not keep going, it's true, but this is not a condition for a good movie. It's a great experience in that movie. <br /> <br /> I felt a few more sections that could be worked out, but I'm looking forward to being a Lynch fan. I do not care so much anymore :) <br /> <br /> And the style or tone of this movie * I love *. It's thin, but cool, and the soundtrack beauty. The music lover will receive any AWTWB shots, I can assure. <br /> <br /> I will give it 10 a 10. <br /> <br /> (from 10 to 10 on musicians))
