This is not another look at the Holocaust, but an intimate story about events in a small Berlin street. This movie starts this year in New York, where Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) is mourning about her husband's and relatives' deaths. Ruth's daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) slowly learns that her mother has been raised by a nigery nation called Lena Fischer (Doris Schade) and therefore travels to Germany and places her about 90 years of Rosenstrasse's events. <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERTA ***** <br /> <br /> Lena in Berlin speaks in 1943, despite the fact that the Gestapo had all the Jewish spouses in a Rosenstrasse street building, the immunity to be incapable of Arian In the afternoon, a group of women would be asked to wait and warn a while away. Eight years old Ruth (Svea Lohde) is waiting for her mother to go and she does not go anywhere, but she meets 33-year-old Lena (Katja Riemann) who leads her. Lena's husband Fabian (Martin Feifel) is also inside and finally tries to try. so they can do something to socialize with the official Nation. <br /> <br /> This film, directed by Margarethe von Trotta, has its first feature film almost 10 years ago on television. He continues to be one of Europe's most beloved directors. This is not one of the Nazi films, because we see a horrible anti-Jewish act, but we are dealing with a serious treatment, that is, more than one confirmation of a person and a death event. This movie is not blocking anyone or trying to open the discussion door, but it's only a clear idea of ​​what you want to do is just a little but true event in the historical period. A part of the film comes from its actors and Riemann and Lohde are particularly bright with good performances, and it's always good to watch a good role Schrader (Aimee and Jaguar). This is not an excellent movie or a vision of World War II, but I think that due to the events that have taken place I have died of innocent lives, the only reason is that it is enough to recover the real story.
