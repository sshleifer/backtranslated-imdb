Among the principles that Disney does not have, Cinderella will most likely endorse the appeal. I can not say why, but for some reason, generational generations encourage the top of their lists. As a little girl, I wanted to be Cinderella with a glass shoe. It was my favorite mask. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I do not think there is any other opinion. A human heart than Cinderella. Who has never wanted to flee from everyday life and find someone who does not see it? The story is older than English and, to some extent, is true. <br /> <br /> With regard to the characters, Disney can not make a wonderful misunderstanding. Lady Tremaine is infamous with T, which she marvelously calculates, not in a totally physical way. Her cut language and her eyes work for her; It does not have enough lightning to affect your heart. Animal friends tend to be, especially that stupid Gus. I started to cheer on Lucifer's cheeks to discover his destiny. Cinderella did not make any claims, sometimes, quite wrong comments. However, he did not feel enough to feel guilty. Of course, the animal was nice and nourished, but what was it in that place? We never know Although he has become a maid in another house, he will be paid at least and will be respectful. Cindy seems to eventually that the only reason for things to do is that everything will fall into his lap. He never dreams of singing. It's never like music. Ilene Forest has a beautiful and rich voice, probably my favorite Disney heroes. Some great standards were created here - the dream is your favorite heart, so this is love, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo ... <br /> <br /> Cinderella is a wonderful story with remarkable musical points. Although it is not missing in the development of characters, it offers some classical criminals and excellent vocal works. If you are feeling badly in heart, cover it - it will warm you up and it will make you lose Mmm Mmm! <br /> <br /> Film quote: <br /> <br /> -Support! Surprise -Duh duh duh- Happy Birthday!
