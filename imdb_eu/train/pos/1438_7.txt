A full record of Pacino's speech about the coffin on the dead baby; Shakespeare's Mark Antony would be embarrassed! <br /> <br /> Was Paul Schrader or Ken Lipper who was to meet those great conversations? They are rich and intelligent and well worth the time if you like movies with scripts. The narrative story is very well developed in front of this voice message. <br /> <br /> There was not much debate in this film; Even though John Cusack has made this a better role. It is interesting that the film is aimed at very masculine - women are mere attachments.
