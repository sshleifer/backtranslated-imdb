I'll give it to you directly ... the movie is wonderful. Foreign gay films are shooting so fast in the quality theater and theater production of American gay movies. American gay indie films are so much spicy, bad sounds, amateur plays, sad stories, and a nutshell or a strange lack of madness, and gay high quality foreign films have appeared in France. Cinematography is beautiful, thoughtful and meaningful. The story is mature and complex (but nobody can follow), acting is lively and professional. Both directors are wonderful, as well as the whole cast. The boys are more than good and there is a lot of forehead nudity. You continue the whole year of these guys until the end of the meeting. All small nuances of a relationship, details of falling, and love, are beautifully accomplished. I wanted more. look!
