I had nothing more to do with this movie, I saw Boston in a run out of cinema. More than a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans went to the Boston Common Theater to see a comedy ... about them ... Red Sox fanatics! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are a great comedy about love and lust. It is the love between young lovers. Compelling Red Sox has won the world series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor in the role. It's fun and it gets the most laughter. Barrymore, too, is old Barrymore. Sometimes I think Ione Skye was an actor actor better. In short, all Boston Red Sox fans love this movie. For the whole world, it's just fun movie.
