Cinderella was one of the first films I ever saw, and it's time for me. It is a beautiful image with a beautiful animation. My favorite animated scene was the dress scene. The songs are also beautiful, not as good as Snow White, but the songs are songs, and it resembles Tchaikovsky. Dream is an Wish, so is love? stand out. The characters are happy. Crayfish is idealistic and strong and the mum gave them a great comedic relief. There were also drunkennesses, as well as Lucifer. But I loved her grandmother, it was really bad, compared to the great nature of the fairytale mother. It's true, the movie crawls a bit, with mice plays, but it was so fun, so I do not care. I do not think it's overrated, do you mean underrated? It is rarely played on television, but the bad sequel goes on with the Film Festival. If you want a great fit for cinderella, try Ever After, or the wonderful Slipper and Rose, which is not wonderful. But whatever you do, let's avoid the fight, I'm giving it to you, I'll thank you. 9/10. Bethany Cox
