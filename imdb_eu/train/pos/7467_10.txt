David Aames is a beautiful and wealthy man from New York. When Julie Gianni is jealous of her 'dormant partners', when she falls to Spanish beauty in Sofia Spain, David enters his car and loves David and only says one man he wants, but because he is in love with Sophia. He decides to commit suicide, with David in the car, starting with a bridge. David stays in the crash but has a shining face. Then Julie is dying. The thing is that David does not know what is real and what is not what strange dreams are (most are really nightmares) and flashbacks, some of which are just for the sensible. Everything will come soon to him as soon as he begins to know the truth. <br /> <br /> Well, here's all the stars, including Tom Cruise, Pen√©lope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor. In the film they put very different things, such as happiness, sadness, angry, etc. Steven Spielberg also has a short movie. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a well-done, different, interesting and original film that will talk a lot after that. It's not just a thriller, but it's a real psychological thriller. The movie trailer is very good, but the movie is so different. It was very well designed and there were some great scenes here too. In the end, the movie to be really enjoyable would be nice. The shorts are already "Are dead, are not who is dead".
