At first glance this film does not look great. Only 166 votes on the Bette Davis and 6.5 ratings were worth it. But the movie is a wonderful and original surprise. <br /> <br /> At the beginning you would expect that this is a normal movie that is a typical love story in the 30s, but the movie is surprisingly well-built and has an unusual and original story and also helps make this movie really enjoyable . <br /> <br /> The story is made by two leading characters played by Bette Davis and George Brent. The cast was one of the fun characters, but the film works on both sides. His character is also writing a love story. This movie is not only a beautiful little comedy but it is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite short (about an hour), which means that the story does not waste any time. line lines, development and characters. It also makes the film a fast pace and helps the film to be perfectly visible today. Perhaps, sometimes, it sometimes makes a simple movie, but this is not a matter of recreation or fun. <br /> <br /> To watch more simple and pleasurable religious comedies! <br /> <br /> 8/10
