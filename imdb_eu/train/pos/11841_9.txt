It was a great story with a good story. My children (10, 7, 5 and 4) loved the movie, including myself. It was also a wonderful music. No, the horses do not speak, but instead the story of Spirit. And listen to a story that tells the horse is fun. <br /> <br /> The title says everything, the "spirit". This movie gives you a sense of family and home and friends. I should say that my 4-year-old boy and 5 year old girls really touched on that movie, and they got even more involved, they laughed so hard and eventually encouraged the spirit. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the "Spirit" with your family and your spirit with this stunning story. They will love your children. I also think so.
