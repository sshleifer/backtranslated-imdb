I realized I was using the IMDb during these years and I never reviewed my favorite movie. I want to say that I do not like the favorite I want to say, I mean that this movie is supernaturally perfect, a lively experience that will never touch you. That is obvious, I will never be a baby again; I watched this movie at ITV in the early 90's. I was 12 years old and it is the age of this film. I am also a male; This film is a genre aimed (the majority of the protagonists of Miyazaki are female). That's why this movie has been inspired by my indeliceless psychology of childhood and Carl Macek (sp?), I'm in debt, it's a movie that's a lot more fun than this movie. This theme is capable of being viewed, of course, subtitles are the only way, however, the Macek version is very good (with voices that play exactly original Japanese actors) this version is in Japanese DVD! It is not available in any distribution in the English-speaking country. Go to the image. <br /> <br /> There are hundreds of competent reviews, so I will add curiosities here, not the final information archive of this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> First of all, I would agree to review it from Miyazaki's 10 films with 20 reviewers that we need; Therefore, when they combine the entire catalog of the IMDb, almost all of them fail in the entire catalog. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie is fascinating that Miyazaki was in the Greek village of Seminars on Slag's Ravine (Peace Village). At the beginning of the 80's (perhaps in the late 70s) he visited Wales after one of the biggest mines strike. In the sixties as a student of the socialist movement, he felt his situation. At first, it is a struggle between citizens and pirates to illustrate the empathy of this employee. This film and especially the clouds remind me of where I grew up imagining a fantasy version of the western mountains of the western half of his film. <br /> <br /> The island, of course, is Swirly satirical genius. XVIII. Novel of the century - Swift's story is deliberately ridiculous. Castle in the skyn, myths like Miyazaki Atlantis and Babel Tower. I also believe that, because of the architectural base of Peruvian waste, I'm sure, someone told me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < based on the novel The Incredible Tide. ). Conan Laputa Pazu and Shita are a prototype. In addition, you may not know the first masterpiece of the theater, some of its key frame animations. He also made the key to Sherlock Hound. I also have some of the best known I've ever seen. Also, watch Miyazaki and Takahata's first feature film Horus Prince of the Sun (1968) due to the astonishing standards today. What else ... Gauchist cellist and Flying Flying Ship - though quite rare. <br /> <br /> This film is a gift, I do not know what we would do with this story about this story, it's like an oasis. Arigatou Miyazaki-sensei!
