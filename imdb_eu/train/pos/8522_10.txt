I found this show very late and I tried. It is a refreshing change in any other way that you can see at night later, if you catch it. The simplicity of values ​​and the sweetness of the heart remind me of friendships as were the children. This is something I find (that is, it's strange, maybe I should check the lists! Haha) ... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so nice. As a good chick flick, you are really emotionally involved in the characters. Good Lou 'May Alcott is still a good inspirational story :) So apparently I have to fill out 10 text lines so that my opinion is valid, so I'll tell you a bit more. Children are acting talented actors and actors who are beautiful and full of nature; Another thing we can not see on TV. I hope everyone will give you a shot. I know and I am very knowledgeable, but it is a good heart. As I said before, it's refreshing.
