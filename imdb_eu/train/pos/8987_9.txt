Recently, I rented this document, I heard about it on IMDb.com and I was fascinated with that premise. I knew very little about one of those groups, but I recall that The Dandy Warhols recently heard and enjoyed "It was not the last land in the ground". That is to say, this is my approach to the document: <br /> <br /> I have found something incredible about this film, but it is not necessary to have any prior knowledge of one of these. The director (Ondi Timoner) does not stop time by directing the audience and contacting people in this film. It was Anton and Courtney's lives and their bands quickly became The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. I think that this doc is part of that good, and as a result, Ondi Timoner makes a major documentary. <br /> <br /> In addition, the "story" of these bands told me how I loved it. The majority of people you see are the tour groups. Both teams play small scenes and are struggling to enter the recording industry. Throughout the film, each team makes every effort to continue to be the only rules and uncontrollable. However, both teams are similar, and therefore, the two teams of a feather go on in different directions. <br /> <br /> Basically, I would recommend it to those who like film making. . You do not have to have any documentary or group love. It helps the music, but the music is the backdrop to the love and hate of Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols.
