This movie takes everything that deserves a bad movie. Sloppy editing, little or no continuity, insane conversation, bad performance (maybe not even saying), unknown story lines, plans that are too long ... and ... MST3K style riffs are a great example of "Gorp Eaters Drinking Game": Scribble on forms ... take a shot - Sign your name ... shot - Catch a bad Foley edit ... take a lot, different shots. <br /> <br /> The only reason I was not older than 8 is the only reason, because there is no nudity for free, and its malignancy is insane, it's just one hour - this movie would have been at least 20-30 minutes!
