Daily Mirror strip cartoon Jane for someone who remembers, watching this movie is nostalgia. In this context, it is wonderful, but the younger audience would definitely find unlimited comedy and the actors can say they are cartoons. It is a fast drawing for today's audience, but it reflects the ingenuity of the 40s and 50s. Jane, it was necessary to remember, was part of the fantastic escape of the war years, which was created to promote moral troop. He gave him a double meaning of the cartoon "banda". The story is similar to Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard stories. The readers of that period would be a popular topic, and some of the Nazis, who have been so much aloft in England, are in a hurry, and, of course, in the African jungle. <br /> <br /> See for Jane fans. The rest, a damp cloth. <br /> <br />
