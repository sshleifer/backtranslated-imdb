To my surprise, I enjoyed the last animated feature of Disney. The movie had its decline, but overall I felt the story was strong and easy to link the characters. It was very enjoyable that an animated Disney movie was not a musical. I ran across Tarzan. Fortunately, they gave a rest for the musician. Another nice feature of the movie was that the comedy was not completely immersed (a la Hercules), but the children still laughed, but the adults did not feel terribly stupid or absurd. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was an animation. With the great animated films that are out of the Disney studios, you would think you would be moving a bit. There is something to say about tradition, but think about the Atlantis story! In general, the movie was entertaining, and definitely worth the trip to the multiplex journey. <br /> <br /> <br />
