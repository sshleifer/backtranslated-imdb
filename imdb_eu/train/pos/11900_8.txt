Both visuals and musically amazing. Eye and eye eyes. The key element of the initial sequence was Victorian, and Dickens was proud to create a Christmas scene. Technically, production is visual stimulant and special effects are designed with imagination and are creatively achieved in a traditional scenario. The dance of many of the great artists is very good. Photography and lighting is first class and sound recording works in a great way with the overall technical skills. A great movie for the whole family during the Christmas season and one of the most beautiful discoveries.
