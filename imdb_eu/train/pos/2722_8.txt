This malicious murder in Kansas in Kansas, Kansas-based Kansas Capote, filmed in black and white by Brooks and Hall cinematographer. Blake and Wilson are good performances as a killer and as a police officer after Forsythe. The assassination scenes that were shot in the home were murdered, with a breezy soundtrack, they are very hot and cold. Brooks speaks extensively and uses some interesting scenes transitions. The only complaint is that they are more than just a few, dragging and preaching efforts.
