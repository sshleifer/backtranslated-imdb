Of course, a very influential movie, but also a genre action. As a fan of George Lucas, the Star Wars series paid tribute to Gunga Din's homage. The characters depicting Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks are the pioneers of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca. Even if Sam Jaffe's Gunga Din C-3PO and R2-D2 enter and liked Jar Jar Binks. <br /> <br /> Today the movie is not like a PC, but it is a talk by Eduardo Ciannelli Guru. Many of the feelings of today's resurrection were the Indian leader of the opposition against the British. <br /> <br /> It was a great movie for a young boy. Only three powerful portable men and romance. One time the girls thought they were kissing the boy on Saturday, it was just there. It's not like today when it has more skin. It's too late to cry for innocence. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it is not forgotten this film and some channel surfers will stay in TCM and replace them with action, adventure and thousands of songs instead of CGI. actors
