I'll start by mentioning my first encounter with the Prince's music. It was in a bar, when I was 39, and one girl played with one of the other "1999" dancers after another. I asked people, who is the singer? They told me it was a prince. He was so good with me from the beautiful and magnificent dancers. Then I began to hear other Prince songs and really "punch" them. When Purple Rain came out I learned very little in Minnesota. I was away from the movie. Immediately I became the 1st generation "War Baby" of Prince War. Later, I learned that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary, and I and my nephew V.I.P. Prince concert where he was sitting next to his mother ... what's cool! Regarding the available topic, I agree with Siskel and Ebert, who called the classic Purple Rain. I've seen more than 17 times and I absolutely love it. It seemed to me that Príncipe's performance was great, Apollonia struggled a bit, but he played well. John Gielgud was not available to play "The Kid" when Prince took on the role. The film has an amazing vision, at a great pace (never slowing down), and incredibly correct. I rank among the best Musical Movie of all time. I watched the last time after a 7-year emptiness and it's still delivered. In my life, I am very proud of the Prince Rogers Nelson, and I would personally like to say. He went before this previous concert and told me "Hello" to my nephew, but not me. He was talking to a mother. I was a little broken, but it's still not with me.
