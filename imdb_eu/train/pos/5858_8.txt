Spider-Man is considered to me to be the best superhero ever, and this game is the best superhero ever game. Although simple enough, you need to play several times to get costumes and books for comic covers, that is, how easy it is to get through the game. It seems difficult to initially control, but once it's hanging up, you will be web slinging like Spider-Man itself. <br /> <br /> Leaders, as easy as levels, are easy. fun The first Scorpion leader is very easy to beat, as the comic book fans know, Scorpion is one of the most deadly men in Spider-Man. Rhino's second boss is also very easy. The third boss is Venom, in my opinion, the easiest thing in the game, which should not be forever. The fourth commander is again Venom. This time, it's a bit harder to beat, but it's still easy. The fifth boss is Mysterio, I think it's the funniest boss in the game. It's also one of the toughest bosses, but it's pretty easy again. The next boss is Carnage, who is, you guessed, beat easily. But Carnage's fight is really fun. The seventh boss is a Doctor Octopus, just as simple as all the other bosses, but not as easy as the rest, because he has a shield. The eighth and final boss is exclusive to the game, never in cartoons or cartoons. I do not play havoc for those who do not play, but the boss is not an easy player at stake. I try to try 4 or 5 others trying to find the first or second. <br /> <br /> Everything is a good game. I gave him 10 to 10. The reasons that I gave to 9 or 10 is that when they pick up costumes and comic covers they get boring (it'll get a little bit of everything), it's not very accurate depending on comic books or cartoons, the boss is very easy, and Hobgoblin and / or they should use Green Goblin as the leader, I think it would be fun to air in the air! They did not even attend this game! Well, Green Goblin is the next Spider-Man movie, and so they make a video-based video game.
