Someone who has ever come to the story is a patient. I rented it to sleep for an unforgettable party and we were all terrified of ourselves in a class of acting together, and we met some classmates. The whole night was weeping, and I also had awful nightmares. Oh, I continued to think God, if I swim to go to the bathroom, I will delete it or I will do something. I can not go to the bathroom, because we saw this awful horror movie. I also figured why the girls are being topless in this movie, but do we not have a boy's unit? You should do a horror movie where the killer cuts a girl and her unit. I would see it repeatedly. Call hard or soft or something stupid like that. I only have 9 films, FREAKED ME OUT FREAKED.
