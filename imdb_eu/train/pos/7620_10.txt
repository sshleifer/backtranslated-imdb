It's the best lost show. First of all, GREAT has a great actress and director. Writing is a controversial issue, but it was a perfect writing in the first two periods but 3. Who is Jacob? Why are white bears on the islands? What is a fog? How did the island disappear? Who is Richard Alpert? Many people believe that writers are losing out and many questions and mysteries have been raised. they can not explain. I've made these people wrong. I believe I'm confident in the writers. I think from here the mysteries reveal that all the charm of the series will disappear. However, the series is undoubtedly lost. and it will be for a long time.
