Recently released in France on dvd - I would be redirecting to subtitles in English. Do not confuse Penelope Cruz with a remake that looks bad. According to Gerard Phillippe, a farmer says he is about to marry a king's daughter. He begins to join the Navy and goes to war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in his first film. I will not end the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, which was a great loss.
