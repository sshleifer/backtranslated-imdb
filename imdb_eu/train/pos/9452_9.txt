After watching Deliverance, movies like Pulp Fiction did not seem so extreme. Maybe today's standard blood and bulleting does not seem so sharp, but if this happened to you in 1972 and you think the movie is a real sharp nerve, you think it's different. <br /> <br /> When I started, we could not see anything like this movie until we got the scene of "Dueling Banjos". In this scene, the brutality and edges of this film are really visible. When I saw Drew (Ronny Cox, Robocop) with a seemingly recaptured young head, it really shows how sharp this movie can be. When you think of a small baby boy, you can probably do it manually, compared to the pretty Drew guitarist, how four men leave you in their territory. <br /> <br /> The soil is very compelling and never leaves its borders. Actually, the movie that truly separates the four male companies that have had more than participated in the cannon, the director John Boorman (Excalibur) deprives all characters of caricatures or ordinary stereotypes. So, as I enter the movie, I'm afraid and awake, I took care of all four men and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> The effect is universally excellent. Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, State enemy) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease). Jon Voight is probably one of the hardest among all the films, and this is a very compelling task to transform from one family to another from one warrior. Reynolds, unlike a character who is a warrior, transforms Voight's character through the film. Ned Beatty (Life) also plays a very tough role, making it a rape on a hill, while Ronny Cox makes it a compelling performance. <br /> <br /> This real movie is a great thing for me. I was as scary as the criminals I ever saw. Bill Mckinney and Herbert "Cowboy" Coward were great and awesome among the hills. <br /> <br /> In general, Deliverance was excellent and I recommend anyone except people with stomach and weak children. 10/10.
