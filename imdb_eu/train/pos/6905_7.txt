I thought Dreyfuss was just as perfect as the actor and dictator. Julia was a co-star, her role was perfect. It was interesting that Richard Dreyfuss was opposed by the dictator to his will. Over time, it became more confident and comfortable. Because everything happens for a reason of life, I think that he was forced to replace the dictator to stay there during the year. I guess he stopped, because he thought he compared to the good life he had with Parador lived. I think he has given up too many things in life and he has managed to prove serious reality while he was in that country. <br /> <br /> But ......... ... anyway ... why did I give them 10 of these films?
