We've been looking forward to all the horror movies, such as remixes from Saw 2 Hollywood, to absolutely no-minded, indie peoples ... in every dark movie, "Dark Turtles", "Tracks". <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> This film was screened at Shriekfest in 2005. The listeners loved it and I think they won the best film. <br /> <br /> Although Estudio's films have a quote or star strength, it covers serious punchings In horrible atmospheres and horror categories, it's an imagery and cinematic image, but the vision of this movie is a good direction, the story and the characters are developing at a good pace to give them fantasy fears. <br /> <br /> Editing and visual fx also have a high level melody Many films of horror are not useful to use music, but adds "Dark Remains" to more religions. <br /> <br /> I know films in a series of festivals It's raining, but nobody is next to me, so I can not wait to hear it will end up on the DVD. Believe me, if you are overwhelmed with the current situation of horror films, try to do this ... you will not regret it!
