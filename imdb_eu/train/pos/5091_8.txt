I have seen two sections. We enjoyed the story and saw an older Patrick Swayze as a hero. Alan Quartermaine was very credible as a hunter and definitely improved the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I confess that I would like someone else to see it as "in danger". Alison Doody should not be with modern pieces of the day. There was no appearance of the 1800s. The rest of the works were excellent and the lines went well. I am pleased that the actors of this generation are not afraid of trying on different characters and not afraid of being older. Age is inevitable, but let's not hide it. A man under the age of 50 may be more sexy (and Patrick is really sexy) and then young green, beautiful and beautiful. Character lines to go along with a big smile.
