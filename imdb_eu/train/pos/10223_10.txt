* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> I was surprised I was shocked by criticism (acting, acting interview, story light). Belafonte is brilliant as Brandoesque, a menace and a spirit of swearing, because he needs to win his wings, but he is really poorly equipped for the past life. She learns too late how hustling her materialistic life was in love with her. Mostel is also a wonderful woman with his wife Fanny. While praying for a miracle, his bitterness did not accept (or believe) a single one. The two social worlds that characterize the characters alternate alternately and alternately, resulting in a hilarious and dreadful outcome. <br /> <br /> An endless film is consistent with the rest of the movie. After looking at Belafonte everywhere, Mostel looks up to see the falling feather, and he will at last merit to believe in the angels and miracles. But Belafont did not give permission to the miracle (to recover Fanny's health or to recover faith in Mostel), so he never achieved his wings. The pen is floating strongly by Mostel, the metaphor of two men's life: it's too late and you do not get a second chance. "Like a wonderful life," this movie is magical, wonderful, funny but incredibly tragic.
