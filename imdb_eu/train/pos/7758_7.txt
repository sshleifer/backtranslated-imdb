During the time (middle of the 1950s) and great food melodramas were defined. Rock Hudson, in love with the hulk, plays his usual stereotypical role, but when it was done in Giant's year, when his material and co-protagonist (Taylor and Dean) exceeded the average, it's just this movie It is not enough to raise the caliber beyond the bad breath of the story that is difficult to be rich and happy. The self-destructive brother and sister (Robert Stack, drunk with a drunk movie by himself, and Dorothy Malone, a poor vampish, is considered to be a little rich girl) overwhelms the losers and gets Hudson Bacall - who is rather in the wooden part, not enough characters or spirits in the part. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, an end to good fortune and bad misfortune, this is the meaning of fiction. However, I was interested in the fact that the movie was based on a real story that claimed the plot. Like other films of the time, homosexuality is hidden in heterosexual terms. Perhaps the movie may be renewed: Stack's character would be more true if Mitchen's feelings were hiding homosexuals. Todd Haynes's Far From Heaven was greatly enhanced by That That Heaven Allows, directed by Sirk. Perhaps Haynes can remake the Voice Recorded and give us a truly memorable movie.
