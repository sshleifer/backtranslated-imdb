"Luzhin Defense" is a movie worthy of anyone. The film is lively and lively and I have kept my attention all the time. John Turturro is astonishing as a charming Grandmaster with a stunning portrait of Emily Watson, who is a soft but rebellious daughter of a very respected Russian family. The chemistry screen between Watson and Turturro is evident when the characters are in the story. In short, this movie is one of the deepest looks of the chess grandmaster's life. Turturro and Watson do not have the most responsive sequential movie. Most people come out of the minds of the theater, and it is totally affected by this brilliant appearance in love stories.
