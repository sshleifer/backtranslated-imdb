In the premiere of the conduct, Denzel Washington takes a very difficult story, is a very difficult story and brings us the honesty we expect from the efforts made by Washington, but we now see it as a director. <br /> <br /> We have seen recently the bad results of children who have crossed public protection cracks. This story suggests a nightmare that leaves horrible scars, but eventually suggests the victory of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> The first effort can be a lot of problems and not the best. The edition of these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that project this power can not be emphasized. If the academy overcomes this film, it will be a huge feat. This film does not do anything and the story's fierce events go, since they are not usually the novel that goes through the screen with the purity. This, of course, is a tribute to the director. <br /> <br /> This is a dandy, so watch it and tell your friends to watch too!
