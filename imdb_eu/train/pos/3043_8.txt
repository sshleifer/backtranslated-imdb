This movie will tell you why Amitabh Bacchan is a male industry. This movie will also tell you why the Indian filmmakers are becoming so powerful. <br /> <br /> Amitabh was at the peak of his dominance in Bollywood, when Prakash Mehra decided to reuse his image once more. Prakash has the habit of building subjects and stories, adding Bollywood's sensitivities and topical liberal dosages. Zanzeer saw an angry youth. It was Lawaris bastard, and Namak Halal was about the loyalty of senior officials. <br /> <br /> But, then, the subject was to move through the record three hours of script, dance and theater. The film's component is a caricature of Haryanavi that goes to Mumbai and becomes a regulation hero. Amitabh saw his or her own abilities and words, earning more money without his own, thanks to the excellent mistake of Haryanvi. For me, this is just the biggest draw for the movie. The rest of everything is a typical script on the Bollywood screen. <br /> <br /> Now Amitabh had to be a typical comedy scene in all his films. Esker Manmohan Desai. This movie had a good dose. The party's shoe hat, with Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare monologues, the meeting room mosquito challenge and the standard drunkard Amitabh standard. <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapoor added his moody mood to the giant movie (Remember Ranjeetri "Shaaadaaaap" asking "poisoned cake after the event"). He was his master while Amitabh was his faithful servant. But he knew Prakash Mehra in India. intelligence ... and so Shashi had to bring his own movie with the rest. In fact, it was a character that was able to develop a serious film. But this is a hat, do you remember? Thus, people came and Amitabh was dressed in a new hat and returned home happily. The end is always predictable, and the good one gets lost and the wicked goes to trouble; Once again stressed and everything is fine. <br /> <br /> So, w hat is this movie that makes it close to the classic? Amitabh Bacchan Haryanvi. Prakash Mehra created another icon on behalf of a story. Chuck story, characters and argument. My remarks are only Amitabh.
