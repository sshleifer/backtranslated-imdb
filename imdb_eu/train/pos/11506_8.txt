"Kolchak" was a television series in any category. The fear of the game, part comedy, throwing some social conscience, and what we think is that people were not ready for something. It's really bad, since I began to see these shows on the Chiller network (I've never seen any originals), I realized that it was really different and interesting. <br /> <br /> Darren Mcgavin, as a reporter for the international news service Kolchak and led by Simon Oakland, is always angry at Tony Vincenzo, after the show they have followed the news of a Chicago news reporter. a part of the story, while the nightmare would find the winds of the moment. Belongs to Macgavin's charm show. A foolish guy, who always carries the same suit, can not love you. His jokes are excellent, and he and the skeptical editor back and forth, Oakland, are not completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The stories are largely quite good and the performance is very good. In the 70s, there was no dramatic period for special effects, and the show is suffering, but if you interrupt your beliefs, it's a series of fun before time.
