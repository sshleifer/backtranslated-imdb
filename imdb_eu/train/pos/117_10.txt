Lars von Trier's Europe is the echo of The Third Man, which is coming into Europe after the Second World War and is involved in a dangerous mystery. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler The German-American American who did not want to join the US Army during the War during the war ends in Frankfurt to work as a roommate in his sleeping Uncle Zentropa train. I do not know what the war is like with a crust of theater groups that directs America's allies. Leopold does not have to take any advantage, but he has been fascinated by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the female daughter of the railway company owner. His father was a nobleman, but American Colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) was pardoned for re-launching the German transportation system. The colonel soon needs to be a spy of Leopold (without the possibility of thinking) Werewolves could make trains attack. <br /> <br /> Soon Leopoldo is stuck in an adventure in which he participates in both sides of the conflict, because he participates in a mysterious and mysterious film, which everyone does not seem to be. It is very surprising to note everything that is na√Øve to Leopold (his lover, terrorists, colonels, annoying travelers, his shaky uncle, even the civil servants of the railway company that analyzes their work ethics). control The film is constantly unpredictable. <br /> <br /> He has filmed a beautiful movie, and it always happens during the winter during the night when snow falls. Shot in black and white, whenever the colors are randomly displayed. In addition, the rear screens that show the images that work together with the front images. Add the narrative hypnosis of Max von Sydow, and becomes a place of dreams outside of Europe. <br /> <br /> This is my personal favorite movie.
