<br /> <br /> The presentation of Lily Mars with the studio system disappeared along with the disappeared movie genres. Now if you know my bias, here are some reasons why this film emphasizes. <br /> <br /> 1. Lily Mars (Judy Garland) has become a star in the basics he plays in New York City and has earned his director's heart (Van Heflin) a beautiful Hollywood story of that era. Writers change their subject slightly. more than usual Despite Lily's breakthrough in a massive solution, she does not have to succeed and proudly boast and plays a small role in the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (enough to say!) <br /> <br /> 3. Supporting tasks are really excellent. Spring Byington, Lily's mother, is very wonderful, such as Fay Bainter (director's mother - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). It's worth noting that Connie Gilchrist is the actor Frankie, a theater-maker who is acting for a while. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching. One of those films designed to feel the world and your dreams better.
