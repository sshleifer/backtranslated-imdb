- After being tired of the New York City rat race and curved living conditions, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) finds his property, wife, and children. He intends to find a simple life. But building a house is very easy. As they begin to accumulate bumps and bills, they laugh. Will Mr. Blanding get the house of his dreams? <br /> <br /> - This is a movie that is so special that three main actors - Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. The three groups are capable of making a movie on their own, so when you combine their talents, almost every scene is unique. Grant has always been my favorite in this type of role. It's very good for her husband to play. Loy watching is always pleased. Thin Man with William Powell is very close. Douglas has become my favorite in the last three or three years. Douglas also came to The Old Dark House for me. <br /> <br /> - The film is a product of its time.

And that's when the comedy enters. How many people have made in this movie some stupid things for couples who only have more money than they expect? - Mr. The biggest complaint about Blandings is the "dearest wife" of my best friend. Soil need is not necessary and it is very uncomfortable according to the one presented.
