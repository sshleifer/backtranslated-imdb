I thought the movie was hysterical. I have seen several times and it is highly recommended. Mel Brooks was great. The throw was fantastic. I do not understand that this movie gets 5 points out of 5. I like it ... I've seen other movies and it was fun, but this is because of the spirit in my mind. I can not say enough about this movie. I will be periodically, but it's never enough. The people who play homeless people were compared to the funniest parties. Please put this movie more often. I can not see enough ... Leslie Ann Warren is also my favorite since Cinderella. I always thought it was not very funny, but he loved to play it. This movie was very fun ... and his and Mel work together. His films should be much more on television.
