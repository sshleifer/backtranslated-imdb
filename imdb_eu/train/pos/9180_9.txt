I saw the need for adaptation of Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke's "Jane Eyre" in 1983, about an article about the 2006 BBC "Jane Eyre" about TheScreamOnline. <br /> <br /> So I approached approaching home-based work. <br /> <br /> I was angry at the beginning. In this version, the lighting is bad. Everyone is cleansed in a shining white, in some scenes the shadows on the wall behind the characters. <br /> <br /> And the sound is not bad at all. I felt I was listening to the high school theater. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the pancake make-up is cumbersome. <br /> <br /> And the groups do not give a totally gothic mood to the novel. Abuses are too much, Martha Stewart too. I see Bronton Rochester as well as Martha Stewart's home arrangements. Orson Welles was like the moon in Rochester, a very good idea for the Gothic mood of the novel. <br /> <br /> And yet ... with all of this ... this is not the best "Jane Eyre". I have seen that the best adaptation of any novel I ever saw. This "Jane Eyre", despite his technical defects, gave me the feeling of "Jane" reading. Eyre "for the first time. <br /> <br /> The critics of this production say that it is very close to the book. For me, if someone who evaluates the book does not need a" Christian "or" Christian "or does not need more sexuality, this version uses Bronte It's the best asset he wrote about the reliability of the novel. <br /> <br /> Bront wrote a good book, a reason that lasts more than 150 years, but other more melancholic and comfortable texts have disappeared. <br /> <br /> For a long time, a fan of "Jane Eyre", I was damned with Rochester by Timothy Dalton. Rochester is not well known, Jane and Rochester are a rare pair of literature, and Timothy Dalton is nothing beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> But Dalton has a stunning performance with Rochester. He has been expelled. I have never seen his role, text, conversation and deep devotion to Rochester's love for Jane. Dalton opens up the life of Rochester on the page o to the screen. <br /> <br /> Rochester is terrifying. Dalton is terrifying. Welles was afraid, for example, when he shouted "enough". When Fontaine plays a short piece of piano. Dalton is more than scary here, here. You can not really know if Jane, or herself, hurt her with despair. Rochester's empire, humor, rage, weakness: Dalton conveys everything, sometimes in seconds. It's amazing. <br /> <br /> And here's the key: Rochester has been saying that the actor has spent more than a decade in the midst of despair, with loneliness, living with a ugly and destructive secret life. . <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton will try a black hopper of that other actor I do not see. Toby Stephens's current fan did not try. Dalton leaves the park. I would say Timothy Dalton at Rochester in a single bar: "This man is the problem, do not look at it." It is radioactive with broken agony. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is not only, overall, the best Jane I have ever seen; Janet is one of the few Janana producers who released books that Jane could throw. . Only those who are familiar with the "Jane Eyre" version of 2006, Bront does not describe Jane's statue, solid, with fixed eyebrows and sour lips. Charlotte Brontor Jane is, in fact, poor, plain, dark and few, and NOT pretty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zelahek has a small mouth, close eyes and nose. It's really "small". It's not a fashion model. And Jane is the best, the most true of the book. <br /> <br /> Some were cold or boring. No, it's true for the book. Jane's Bronte is not a hot red mom; He is a protected and forbidden friend, whose inner passions only come out of the main moments, as Zelah does. The Jane of the book is one of the people you need to watch carefully, carefully, patiently, if you really want to gather in its depths. You need to see Zelah here, who really knows. <br /> <br /> I'd love to like a fire more than Zelahe in a single scene, but that's a scene from five hours. That is, otherwise, very good. <br /> <br /> Even though the text is close, like all other versions I have seen, it explains fully the themes of "Jane" in Christian themes. Eyre. "Christianity is not under the influence of" Jane Eyre. "<br /> <br /> Helen Burns teaches Jane in Christianity, and thus gives them an offensive and contradictory way of reading, condemned, detained, of life. It is Christianity, and the Christian God, Jane, is poor, plain and obscure, who believes in her deserving equality, the need to live her ideals and reject a marriage proposal, which is not quite clear here. <br /> <br /> Anyway Also, Charlotte Bront wrote an excellent, complex, and rich novel, and she's among all of the things I've seen, mines and honors. I saw the best adaptation, which she says a lot. <br /> <br /> Books are not completely honored they get to see it in many places, whether Charlotte Brontok's mind about the child's treatment or the appearance and the hypocrisy of a money-based culture, a large part of the book is that people have it will be something to stop it again. Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> This version, like the Bronte novel, tells us everything Bront wrote - about Jane's Lowood experiences and St. Their relationship with John is part of Jane's relationship with Rochester. as explosive and unforgettable.
