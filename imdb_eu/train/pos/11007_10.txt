Morgan Sullivan, Jeremy Northamen, a medium-sized and gentleman, is fascinated to see strange pieces of jewelry that are under the influence of a sneaky scotche and the presence of Lucy Liu's presence. Trying to offer a cigar in the barn, it is an old habit, it is made without thinking or wonder, and loses its face, neck and lips. Whatever the brain cleans, love has a sustainability way. Love can not "cleanse your head" with one of his two wicked wives. Gradually, in stages, the glasses will begin to be removed, a different way of walking and talking, and even though the face is different, the film progresses. The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and sometimes it guides it in the right way. Using black and white and gray shades makes almost "black cinema" in the tradition of many classic thrills. I would like to see a greater vulnerability in the portrait of Lucy Li, whenever she sees it in her broken states, who plays the role of the man who loved her and the blind faith, the weak weakness and the true splendor of the sympathy. it would have been less of a concern in terms of performance. It does not match one of Northam's talents, but I enjoyed this movie, and I'd like to know some of the other scriptwriters he wrote.
