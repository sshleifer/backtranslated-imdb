The movie is a small budget and shot in British Columbia, Canada. The obstacles to overcoming this film (the barriers set in the early 60s and 80s) were well thought out. I think this is the best and most accurate version of the zodiac killings filling in the area of ​​Vallejo and Bay. From 1968-19? (never caught). Edward James Olmos (Det. Dave Toschi) and George Dzundza (Zodiac, Arthur Leigh Allen, washed the DNA and fingerprints), the cat and the mouse play again the crime they are visiting together scenes, to activate each other in an emotional revelation trying it. Olmos is dying of a terminal illness and is known by Dzundza, who is still obsessed with losing his family and becoming full of alcohol. Dzundza was totally ignorant and absorbed himself (like all the assassins of the series), for the destruction of his wake-up. The event was different or "fairly detailed". If you have a typical Hollywood fluff or you are interested in Zodiac cases. , look at everything.
