The "Eighth-day" graphic elements seem to have been done many times, the film has a lot of spark, mystery and symbols with the first film by Jaco Van Dormal. Although it's just as good as "Toto the Hero", it's a lot of emotion. Daniel Auteil, a non-tireless "Wardrobe" from 2001, explains his parts, afraid of being afraid of the previous one (so his role would easily be performed if the actress was very dramatic). However, I felt that the part felt a bit more realism, focusing more on the character than just the growth of the character. <br /> <br /> Do not enter the humor of this movie and wait for unexpected twists. The one from "Toto Hero" would have been disappointed. However, the movie is a decent film, but it does not work well
