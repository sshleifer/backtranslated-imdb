This first Sirk melodrama, shot in black and white, is a small movie. However, the German director's showcase shows that the difficult line of story resembles art. In the 1910s, her husband left Barbara Stanwyck's look at the stage of Chicago and was a woman who left her a small family. He never filled his mind and carried it to the village that left his letter with his daughter, who had liked the theater (ie, high school production). In his old town, he returned again to the smallest childhood, and must face his older daughter, a shameless (and boring) daughter (Richard Carlson) and former lover. The plot has nothing new, but Sirk distinguishes himself by creating meaningful compositions, carefully screening all the frames, and helping Stanwyck being his main wife. It is crisp for 76 minutes, and that's fine, because the material does not stretch its legs.
