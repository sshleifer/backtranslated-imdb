Although good, but not very good, I agree, for the reasons that were mentioned for other posters, I still enjoy it. Music is a reason: Candoli brothers - Conte and Pete - would be a very entertaining look at the scene that plays a great nightclub. They were two of the best jazz trumpeters of these days, and Jimmy Stewart responded to the conviction of the mind, with a trumpet partner, a trumpet on Stewart's ears. Kandolis has also played well, but I suspect that the music of that scene has doubled twice. I do not know much about George Duning, who is credible for music (it seems that he has worked in more than three times), but Candoli brothers were thrown into the battlefield. a nice touch.
