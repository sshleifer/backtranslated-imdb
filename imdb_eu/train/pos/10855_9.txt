Looking back at the past 28 years (starting from the first show show), I can say everything: When you get it, you will remain with you. I recall my initial reaction: 1) abuse has been abusive, 2) underneath 3) unknown characters <br /> <br /> Well, two years later I've seen several episodes again and I do not feel so annoying. A year later, I received the whole series from the beginning and I caught the story of human misery and happiness in the saddest point. Yes, the show has a style that is not everyone, and I am sure that the value of previous production will be difficult now. But, I still think that the show is about at least once a month far from terrifying, terrifying greed ... It's a married man ... (for those who think) this is a show for women
