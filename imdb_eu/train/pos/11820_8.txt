Yes, if you compare the Dark Knight 5.9. With an annual comic-adapted movie, 5.9. That's what you can do to attract your attention. I know every day that there is no good movie complaining about people, they seem to know only the latest blockbuster. It has never been bad to find and explore old movies, especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy can not be outdated in terms of technology. <br /> <br /> Negative reviews, in particular, denounced the "confused" story of DT. But it seems that the story is fairly clear and I have not had any problems going on like this. I did not see comic books, but I'm not a fan of American comic, but I'm really grateful for movies and performances. Perhaps the expectations of most people were very important in the story. But if you see a movie together with Madonna and Warren Beatty, what would you expect? I've had some scratches in my head, and I can not wonder, did we really see the movie? The title, even though it was sound as competent as it was, was still captivating and captivating by the audience. Madonna was much less attractive than "breathless", but she gave her a funny story. Al Pacino was fun and marvelous. It seems that the pre-successful roles have a great tendency. We can see Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro's hybrid laughing at laughing. And a lot of makeup. <br /> <br /> It's not bad for me. The surreal feeling really got me right.
