Pialate filming people in extreme emotional situations, usually with various violent scenes. In the case of La Gueule, the husband and son of a woman who dies at the cancer is facing the destructive effects. Teenage sexual experimentation, along with the family, brings with it violent conflicts. Here we have a young wife to get her husband back. His motivation has sharpened, because Loulou is not capable of reading or discussing a more challenging television show; On the other hand, it has a fabulous body (I wonder why Depardieu never had a sports movie to show this physics, as it would be a great rugby player). <br /> <br /> The casting is spectacular. . Isabelle Huppert does not give a bad performance (she has given a lot); Depardieu plays Loulou with all the dynamism and charm that you want - watch the scene on the bar, where he gets underestimated, escapes and seeks treatment, and soon resumes with Nelly. Guy Marchand, with such black coal and a terrific look, plays her husband Nelly; Coup de foudre is a great repeat.
