9/11 is a classic example of film verite, a realistic documentary, as New York firefighters fight against one of the most curious events in world history. Hand-made small, generous video cameras, the quality of most of the filming (and the director, Naudet's hand-deleting the screen often) is a bad quality. <br /> <br /> In this movie, you'll find out about most firefighters - Tony Benatatos, rookie (or 'probie', NY firefighter), Joseph Pfeiffer firefighter (who later lost his brother) and others. There are interviews with most people in these films, just to emphasize the personal and reflexive nature of events. The construction is very dramatic and well done, especially during the firefighting process, with some fancy pans and dialectical editing of relatively limited work (as with Rob Reiner's A Good Good Men). ). Tony looks proud. <br /> <br /> Look and the angle of the camera is usually between the firefighters, which is very interesting and the excellent WTC1 portal footage is what Pfeiffer and his team plan ahead for. it's classical cinema. There is also the sound that falls into the outside of the man's occasional body. Then the main firefighter Pfeiffer will find out that the worst thing is that he is disappointed and probably we have no hope - and this is when WTC2 falls. You have to give me credits for knowing which faces are the movies. <br /> <br /> The sounds of the WTC2 surroundings are so dull, energetic, and terrifying. firefighters From the doorway, it seems, it feels like it sounds like the end of the world and poor firemen look so terribly frightened. You hear a horrible mumble rumble: when the giant and monolithic beast falls on the ground, as the wounded has happened since death, the adjacent tower collapsed, but the firefighter still has a WTC1 that is not known. Where is the communication <br /> <br /> This film is still brilliant, the narrative is an amateur, and it should be avoided: "this was another day like that" or Naudet's frequent silent statements, "fear" could be seen before everyone's eyes "and "I knew Tony was terrified." The movie video is a single long diary. There are no photo boards on the part of the firefighters. Imagine this movie with some CCTV cameras, some of the high-class newspapers, or some of the daily news stories. He could also combine it with the mayor of Giuliani and, perhaps, with the famous Rick Riscorla Cornishman, literally, there were many floors in the head of the hero. <br /> <br /> I do not see much propaganda film as some reviewers suggest. Riefenstahl's films It does not win the will. Some time later, firefighters approach the American flag over a nearby building On the ground, it has become zero zero. So what? <br /> <br /> In addition, there are some uncertain moments in the camera; For example, who is holding the camera when two Naudet brothers have gathered firemen? Is it staging? <br /> <br /> Very good, excellent director Alain Resnais (Hiroshima mon amour) is a superb finish, two of which are reflected in the water.
