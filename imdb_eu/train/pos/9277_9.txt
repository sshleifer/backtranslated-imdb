"Film is dead, long live movies!" Peter Greenaway, one of today's most innovative and productive directors, said in the Romanian Anonimul Festival last year, won the third edition and in the Danube Delta. This year's management award has been called "Offside" by Jafar Panahi. I saw it this afternoon in Bucharest. Film is dead but very intense. Panahi tells the story of how Iranian society views it. Digitally shot, "Offside" Panahi is a story inspired by a real life story of her daughter: the problems and dangers decided to go to a football match. This is prohibited as we are informed by Iran. Panahi, who manages to render a few resources, but probably will create a lot of cultural, creative, and humorous work in a society that positions women differently. The nonsense of laws becomes comical. The film has a happy ending because the Iranian team will go to the World Cup. The concept I loved most was the idea behind this film. Panahi was very interested in seeing other movies that were forbidden in Iran. I think the activist can be thought of as a director.
