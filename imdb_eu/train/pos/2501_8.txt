Especially Gackt is a fan of both actors / singers and for the first time knowing this movie and seeing the trailer, I think that's a silly one. After a long wait, I finally saw and here is my comment ... <br /> <br /> I think everyone knows the story and they will not talk about it. Instead, my first joke does not stop playing, in general, that Japanese films are not brilliant and dramatic. All the cast of MoonChild is wonderful and it just goes into it, especially when Gackt reflects his emotions on the characters, and it quite changes, I like his many scenes, both dramatic and humorous, part of HYDE, as his acting is good, but he deliberately acted as a cast on the back, respectively, as his character, throughout the film. I did not have some cinematography, especially lighting and some colors, but because of the small budgets, it still has a great moment, but it's a real movie curious story. It is well for me, and the theme of the film's friendship is very well developed and sometimes moving, on the other hand, the story ensures a cruel life from all over the world and reflects the visible theme of death in this subject. Aside from an interesting account, this film has excellent vampires. The movie Interwiew with the Vampire movie, the most beautiful actress with the most beautiful and beautiful movies in America, is the fact that the Moon Child is the brother of Interwiew, in some way, the original. MoonChild is a problem Sometimes it's slow, I'm a fan of Japanese cinema, and I used it but it's not changed. MoonChild has unnecessary scenes or characters. But, in any case, this movie is very good and very emotional at times. We will be able to see other films in the future, and I recommend that everyone who likes vampire action science fiction and romance movies.
