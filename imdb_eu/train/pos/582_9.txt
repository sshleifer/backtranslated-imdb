As a custom, I always like to read through any "hated" reviews about movies. I would especially like to comment on it. and it is not so much a point counter; I want to see what people are saying. <br /> <br /> However, I want to answer one thing. Many people who overshadowed it, paraphrasing it, "beautiful, but superfluous," some would not even have the desire for normality to say that his brother was at least an essential land. <br /> <br /> I would not agree. <br /> <br /> I am the brother of a brother with a dysfunction. Every day, you see abuse, knowing that the current path will inevitably lead to self-destruction. and they did not do exactly what they were doing; why or why Paul decided to match the game and people with uncertainties; really, how are the cables? On the one hand, they are real geniuses, and on the other hand, it is boring self-destructive (they are much the same as the forces driving the people themselves are driving the same forces and while watching them) and while you see this, you know this, and worse, you realize You can not do that bad thing about it. The tragedy must have happened, and who was guilty. In the end, no one is, and often, there's no reason why. but personal anxiety is needed to reach this achievement. Sometimes it takes full time. and sometimes it is never achieved.
