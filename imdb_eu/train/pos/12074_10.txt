Joseph H. Lewis was one of the best directors of black cinema. This is probably his best. <br /> <br /> There are now no standard features of a black movie. Although made by Americans, it is entirely in England. It's missing a gangster He's missing a fat woman. No fault of crime <br /> <br /> The title character responds to an ad. He is delighted that he will make some money as secretary. Instead, a few days later he wakes up in a terrible pawn. A very strong person can only survive terribly. And it looks like a sturdy woman like Nina Foch Julia. <br /> <br /> Part of the emotion comes from the types of castings: Mrs. Foch has a stylish way. He does not cry for the victim, boys. It's really frozen and patricia, though it's not anyone. This makes the situation of his character very credible. <br /> <br /> Surely the most fascinating element is the question of Dame May Witty. It has been known for the charming character "Lady disappears" (and that is). It's a sweet and harmless way. But here's the hero away. <br /> <br /> George Macready is superb in his very troubled son. The whole piece, in fact, is excellent. <br /> <br /> It seems that this great and brilliant movie was made almost accidentally. Without a doubt, the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he made a low budget. It's a real emotion and charm of black cinema, the true black film: it's small, a committed life, and in this case unforgettable.
