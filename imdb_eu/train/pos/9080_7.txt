Maybe I should look at the head, but I thought that this movie was pretty good. CG is not bad. I've seen things worse. I wanted to look like beings (and I mean good creatures and bad snakes). The actions of the whole serpent were very good, and I thought. It sometimes seems that there are some logic, and the story does not always make sense. But they are much worse for a particular character. The other names seemed elevated from other films, so it was not completely original. I think it's the original wrinkle of the story. That's why GodCilla liked us a lot (a great American budget). As much as this movie, but I still say it was pretty good. When I liked music, I think Dragon Wars is about 7/10.
