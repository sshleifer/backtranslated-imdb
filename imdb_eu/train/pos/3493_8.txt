This movie has been underestimated. I love. It was really sweet and sensual. It's a family that fights, but it's not becoming a dysfunctional function of typical movies today. The film has little or no money and the Dominican Republic has been Hollywood. Slows down the end of the movie. It has the paths to go, but the attempt to continue is honest. Her grandmother is very nice and the little boy laughed at me in a longer scene. Really a secret indie
