I'd like to laugh at it once again as I saw it for the first time. Since then I have not done that. <br /> <br /> It's a strange thing, after seeing the show again, I do it again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is planted, polluting, it is a man of the world. He is talking about politics and still does not feel the need to "engage" in political debate. That's more than that. I would compare it to George Carlin, who tries to persuade people about their ideas about their comics, and does not seem to like trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> A fun boy on earth
