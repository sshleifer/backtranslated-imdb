I was asked to remember a song of more than one movie, "Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo", as it is by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd. Rafi, Kaif Bhopali's lyrics and film photography, when the sailing boat contrasts with black backgrounds and bright stars. It should be another "Chalte Chalte". Pakeezah was the last movie of Meena Kumar's death before, and it's time to watch it on screen. Every young song has a look, but it does not. But his appearance did not change the actor Raj Kumar, he and he was particularly in love with his feet, when he left his train in the cabin and left a note that he described when he saw them. . <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Pakeezah is a great romantic story to be visible on the big screen only for film photography and songs. The film is the star of Meena kumari, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar, directed by Kamal Amrohi. <br /> <br /> Kamal Amrohi's grandson has begun to revive his father's father's studio with a comedy.
