In summary of some people, the women depicted in the film are not geisha. Oiran (prostitutes) live outside of the most renowned neighborhoods of pleasure, and their lives and experiences live in numerous Tokugawa women. I can not say stories have been particularly enlightening, but their charm is typical. The issues are universal and everyday: love, friendship and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I liked it much in the direction of the arts and the theater. As I saw as a time and place I could see. Actors, mostly wise men, played 4 women, they saw emotion. I would recommend this movie to those who like Japanese culture or those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. There are two great examples.
