My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * dizzying * CHOP} My - my - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT. CUT Playback} <br /> <br /> I never had a blow to a director's style so much. Now, it's clear that most people do not have a fascinating, brilliant and wonderful technique that Tony Scott does well-edited. If I choose to love and hate, I would love to say it. Sometimes the boundary was different, but the final result was pretty good and it's nice to see the manager in his style and originality as a creative edge (although he is borrowing a lot of MTV videos). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This style border reveals itself as Keira Knightley's role as Domino Harvey's award-winning prix. However, his conversation is surprisingly apparent. Otherwise, he is wrong because he hates his character and I'm not sympathetic with him a bit, even though he has suffered so much. We continue playing dominoes, along with friends Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The groups get confused between the FBI and suddenly has Christopher Walken's television production company reality contract (in any case, Christopher Walken does it in every movie). I think that it is a lightweight technique of film, now that Tony Scott is willing to use the feature film MTV / Reality Show when it's released. At this time, MTV becomes a pastime of culture. <br /> <br /> Then the story is told in a surprisingly fast pace, with strong, violent language violence. There are some fun jokes; At the same time it is very modern and surrealistic. It's a mix, but it's nice. After all, there are so many mistakes in it (the actors try hard to make the characters "fresh"), but it works. I'm going to give it a poor 7/10 film, compared to the general consensus that filmed this movie. But I think they have great ideas and they've run well. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10
