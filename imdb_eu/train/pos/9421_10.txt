* It also contains Spoiler * - My quotes might not be accurate. <br /> <br /> Everyone always recognizes the satire of social commentaries and economic parities - which is true. But for me, I see much more than this movie. I love the symbolism of this man in a bright white outfit. There is so much mixture and dirt in the surrounding world, but it does not stick. Alec Guinness was perfect: her young boys and eternal curiosity are so good: <br /> <br /> "Is it simpler, to tell me, what ink ratio is with gasoline?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But more than embarrassment "does not work" is simple. It never gets scared of people. Remember, <br /> <br /> "Sidney, we also stop" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A little questioned He is trying to escape again before. Have you shown what the pain that can cause her betrayal? No <br /> <br /> It's also worth mentioning Dapne's role. He is sick and tired of money and power. In the end, he has found love outside his father's company. First of all, he does not care about Sidney more than anyone else. But he came back at that moment when he got out of his car to see if he could kill him, or yet he still thinks of the beauty of invention. He has finally found what he deserves. It's a fun thing, though it's not love. It's friendship, but it's terribly ephemeral. The title is hardly suited. It's more admiration and maybe an inspirational source. <br /> <br /> Michael Strogoff does not really love him, and when he is totally incapable of looking after his father, he gives cynicism and tries to try Sidney. Fortunately, in this world, people have found themselves to be more powerful, more money and lust. What refreshments: <br /> <br /> "Thank you Sidney. Yes, if you mean" yes ", I think I would get bored." <br /> <br /> I love it at last. Not all this crazy business seems to be. But then, it's a quick and fast pace, and Sidney goes on, making her step together with the melody. Where is Daphne? We do not really know - but they were not really in love and it was not really a scientist. He managed to escape from aid and he got "shot in the arm of hope." (Pollyanna) Reception relations would be nice, but Billy Joel says "I expected more than that ..." <br /> <br /> <br />
