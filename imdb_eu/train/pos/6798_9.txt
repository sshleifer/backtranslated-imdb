(There is no deception, just plot details) I can not understand hatred in this section. Do you want to see the bad section of Smallville? Watch Subterranean - now it's a sack. Tom Welling is a good performance (I do not say so often), and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but it has a lot of time. The alternative scenes of the universe seem realistic. Martian Manhunter, before appearing in "Static", returns and says he is head of asylum-seeker at the headquarters of Clark that he is a phantom from a ghost, and if Clark wants to go back to him. The universe must kill him. A general episode, good performance and a good rhythm.
