The bad guys were attacked by the palace's attack, but the movie is fine. Woo's humorous injection. <br /> <br /> Conversion and turnaround was impossible and exciting, and you could not figure out who was good or bad or how many people there were. <br /> <br /> The sense of recovery and a well-developed surprise. The depth of the story is so intense that you get the shorts of this genre and the ways that most kung fu movies do not give you.
