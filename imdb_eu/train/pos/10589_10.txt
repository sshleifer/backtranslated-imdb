I liked Longstreet, following the success of Raymond Burr Ironside's successful TV series and intending to fight. But this show was suspended after a season, I decided - I guess - Longstreet Burr, Mr. Ironside, could not compete. <br /> <br /> I can say that the pilot of this show was particularly well-done and very memorable. I hope that a Longstreet box will appear. <br /> <br /> Writers have to note that this story was briefly analyzed here and that much more could be done and the difference between television sets for television. .
