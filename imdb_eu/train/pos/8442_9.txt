It was a great movie, kept for some scenes with the show. I compiled all the serial detectives and collected the series that were never resolved in series (thanks to NBC ...). It was lovely for Pembleton and Bayliss to see the most human and most basic people together. Braugher and Secor did a great job, but they will forget it as usual. He saw that the murder was over. CourtTV's reminders, ribbons and restarts do not show up every Friday. But the film did his job and he did it very well, he presented a great description of life after he retired from Al and the family relationship between the unit. This one really liked me.
