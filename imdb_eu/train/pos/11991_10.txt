Ahh, Talespin! What can I say that has not been said about this great show? Nothing! This is undoubtedly one of the best shows I ever found, live action or animation. Newer things are weakened by my tastes and some "mature" kids for kids. But not Talespin. <br /> <br /> Stories are attractive and very credible. Some of them will be able to stretch for an hour and two in a movie. A very dramatic episode such as Stormy Weather and Her Chance to Dream is still nice for kids and grown-ups. Then there are empty episodes of comedy, such as Baloo Bloods Bluest and Stuck on you, where zest is stressed. I sometimes choose to spread tears to myself. <br /> <br /> The drama aspect is still lacking in most shows (at least, especially those not directed), especially in cartoons. In the Stormy Weather section, for example, Kit Cloudkicker has decided to enter an air circus, but Baloo believes it will be dangerous. In the great episode of the episode, Baloo dares to Kitten to stay away with Daring Dan, who shouts Kit "YOU! You can not tell what to do!" YOUR * NOT * MY * * DAD *! "He covers his face on the pillow, and next day he goes to the aerial circuit, this type of theater is a cartoon curse and is a good idea for today's creations. <br /> <br /> They have a lot of characters, they are too much in the Jungle Book. In a lazily manner, Rebecca is a wicked businesswoman, and ideas for making money, although in theory, are rarely good practice, Molly is a pretty girl, but you can not fool it, sometimes it can be a real inference. Cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest. He enjoys trusting adults, if he does not appeal to him, and tends to break contact. Check out his expression when Plunder and Lightning take it in the grappling hook: it seems like it's ready to go straight through a pirate. <br /> <br /> In the end, these drama It is a real combination of the characters that show in # 1 my book. The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very real, almost a father and son. This is well illustrated at the end of the whale, because Baloo takes Kit, Seymour condemns animals in their aquarium with other adults. The relationship between Baloo and Becky is also realistic, because Baloo wants to buy motivation to work on Sea Duck, not wanting to help Rebekah. But they say something to me that if this duck came back, he would make Rebekhe's jobs. <br /> <br /> Sea Duck, instead of mentioning all the other planes in the series, has been designed by realists. The functions of the plane are not changed throughout the series (such a continuity is also difficult), and unlike most "super-shots" of other cartoons, there is no single weapon (unless counted) Mangoes!), Instead of a pilot Cunning is a great skill based on extracting problems. It's hard to think of weapons gun, a laser gun or even a handgun wardrobe somewhere. And to get out of trouble, it is so difficult to find a current picture. Also, it's just a damn design! <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best cartoon. Then Deadline Certainly ten worthless stars!
