Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written on June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> Only started for this machine of the market (there are not yet any sites?), So I definitely do not listen to many of them. Actually, I did not have one. When I received the message, I thought it was another code name and I was really worried about Transformers, I wanted to see a movie, so I enjoy 100% film mumble. It turns out, Transformers was not and I realized that "Neil Gaiman's film." What is? Well, in the end, Gaiman is a fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star. More than that I would like to provide information on the land (a) for the non-fulfillment of the contract and (b) ruining your fun. If you really want to know what you want, go buy the book. Rumors say it might be a Gaiman writer. <br /> <br /> Knowing what to expect in a movie can be very enjoyable if it's a surprise. And this was definitely. This show was "special", not only for film critics, but also for exhibitors (often mixed performances) and science-fiction / fantasy local people. So you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with the crowd and Stardust, what I expected. <br /> <br /> Oh, how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a fairy tale. a famous author in the comic book. But he was not the ruler's lord. There was no Lord of the Rings anywhere else (Erem, Eragon). All this was much more intimate. <br /> <br /> But, like the Lord of the Rings, he sold the fantastic features of the humanism of the film. It's really a romantic story, but it's generous full of humor. And humor is not like Shrekismo slapstick. They are dramatically more dramatic than comedy. Before you go ahead, do the review of this movie. <br /> <br /> Making it at least good. It's hard to always say more than just fantasy films, but I think they've been very good. Michelle Pfieffer is not, unfortunately, one of them. He plays the evil and does the job. Nothing special Rupert Everett, however, was a real jerk. That is, a great nasty. Peter O'Toole, well, Peter Frickin 'O'Toole, that is, wonderful. Ricky Gervais perfectly delivers and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to be most exciting. When he wanted to deliver goods, he did so. And Charlie Cox (who?) The main character has never been to the boy who has never heard. <br /> <br /> <br /> Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I've always thought about it. It can be great, and then it can not miss the mark. This is the first one. And literally it is the protagonist of this movie. Of course, his accent stays here and there. Yes, yes, it's not as good as Cox's scene. However ... well, see yourself. <br /> <br /> The special effects are still muted, and they only have to be significant. The best flying boat still - Barked Potter. Direction is a clear heart and it is a pleasant spill. Cinematography could have been better, but there were not all the films in New Zealand. All other is the upper bracket. <br /> <br /> And now it's done ... <br /> <br /> ... writing. Oh, writing! Neil, devil. Today's climate is hard to do when you start something original and start wondering. Realm, the king who dies, to prove a worthy boy, to prove witches, ghosts, or quests (or three). What's new Gaiman's story, however, draws you into a superficial acquaintance so you can immerse yourself in a delicious and original story of the boy and his heart. And yet, if you suspect how to go, you can start surprising in the third act and, when I am there, you will find yourself in the best climatic confrontation and the best. In the end, you will find this story, this movie is for all fairy tales, but they are often not. Fantastic and authentic <br /> <br /> (I can talk about Septimus vs. Tristan, but I will not break it down.) For those who are reading the book, be sure. <Br /> <br /> I felt the one I later spoke about . A great movie for everyone, enjoy it, and get this new generation. The spacebar just finished being released because you expect it. However, you know how to get it out. I'm honestly expected that Stardust will not get lost anymore. Although I know, I'd like to get into the hands of all I know. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> You have revealed what you missed. I am a few years later, but ... "A great movie for all ages and a new generation PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation". <br /> <br /> A high-value evaluation, but I am still sure that it is the same answer to the years, "Oh, I love that movie", it's the Princess Bride today. .
