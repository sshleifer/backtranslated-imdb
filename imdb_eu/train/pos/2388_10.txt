I love Doodlebops. My son watches over a year. Last year we went to Doodlebops concerts and a concert yesterday (Connecticut). He loves them. Doodlebops do not teach alphabet or numbers, but who cares? Are you serious? Television does not believe your children teach about numbers or the alphabet. parents needed it. Download Doodlebops really sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice and you can sing 3 of them with a good vocal song and NOT sing. Imagine, dancing, singing and singing. I like to see the show, I love to love the kids. This show, to date, is the best television show for kids. And a group of children's rock. What's amazing Why do people say that Chad (rooney) is gay? from where you heard Whether it's amazing is it! Leave alone No one has anybody promoting homosexuality for our children!
