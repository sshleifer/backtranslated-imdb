It was very good for low-budget films. I've put the average action above your B movie. Sean and Corinne delivered this movie, and it did not look like a shy camera. Take care of Jeanne and Jared's cameo. I did not think that the producers would think this, but the champions are worth a lot. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to Sean and Corinne's films for the entertainment industry. Sean's character seemed very real, and sexy Corinne's character was pretty tough and was at the point. She closely linked and searched the sequence of actions. It was a great idea to throw Billy Zane into the most elegant and brave nasty. The charisma of the screen is always a pleasure. The chemistry between Zane and Sean's star was pretty good. The sequences of the actions did not appear to be cheesy and connected to the whole movie. Obviously, there were errors, but with the territory. <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie was a good movie for a quote and television. Sean and Corinne did a great job because of the arrival of the new game. I hope that Jeanne, Jared and the rest of the Star of the Next Action have become a success for their entertainment. <br /> <br /> Last trial: *** / ****
