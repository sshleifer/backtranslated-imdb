This movie seemed fun to me, I loved how I made the current sports policy. This movie is not as funny as South Park, but it's pretty funny. As a sports fan, I like to have fun on how to do some fun things about sports sports. This movie is not ideal for lovers of sports, it is probably better for those who are better off going through them over time, asking why they are sporting so much insane norms and complexities and so much for that sport. Also, I found the real game I found to be interesting, similar to a horse and a psyche (at the shooting). In general, I highly recommend this movie, and you think that this movie will end. However, if this comedy style is not your favorite, you probably will not like it. (but with any comedy movie)
