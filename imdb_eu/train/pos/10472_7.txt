Those who love rehearsal music will enjoy this movie. I have some minor complaints, especially paingura and some actors (not Maury) casting really are not about persuading their roles, but I do not have time to write a detailed review. I would like to inform you about what this movie is about to watch or plan this film on CBC television in Canada: CBC versions are similar to WHALE MUSIC --- Reader's Digest version. It captures whole scenes and sub-planes from the movie (preferably). The CBC, which presents most of the untouched movies, has taken off half of the WHALE MUSIC media. I do not know why. It's horrible for what the film did. Rent a video or watch in the theater, but do not listen to CBC on TV.
