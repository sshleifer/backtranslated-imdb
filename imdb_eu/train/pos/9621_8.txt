Last night I watched the BUG movie at the Florence Film Festival and let me tell you that it was a real treat. The directors were there and later they did a Q & A. The movie begins with a boy who falls under his head and finds his car near a car that breaks the boy and asks the boy why? why? He needed to kill a living creature? As the young man urges to make mistakes in his way, man does not pay for parking, that is, some fun things that are unrelated to the people, some fun, dull and horny. This movie has a lot of laughter, Lots! There are many actors you know well. The main actors that featured me for the movie include Jamie Kennedy (in his comedy show, Jamie Kennedy Experiment, which plays John Carroll Lynch (who plays Drew's brother on the Drew Carey show), just like a guy Brian Cox (the original Manhunter Hannibal Lecter) plays a germaphobic owner of Donut and Chinese Food Take Out. Cox has a line where he cleans his pig's blood from the pig's blood, which is called "clean death". It's fun especially because of the rehearsal "Cox" "Germs." The funniest moment in the movie is when a young man imitates his father when he first heard it, in the classroom, "MotherF *****" cried out, Trudie Styler (madam) and another scene that is performed by other actors in a cable car that performs a scene is very fun and fun. Plastic bubble access Watching the bile is amazing, so severe and abominable and the performance given to himself is fascinated by the doctor and the bubbles of plastic bubbles. In this movie, there are a lot of actors and actors and a lot of fun, and they have shot less than a month with a budget of about a million dollars, Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (who work as screenwriter and the next Tuxedo Jackie Chan) fun and enjoyable.
