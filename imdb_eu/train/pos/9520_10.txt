This is a beautiful movie. The true story of the relationship between father and son. That is, so far, Tom Hanks his best. Tom Hanks really is out of the box. He usually has roles with a guy. However, in this movie a short film comes out, but a smell like a rose pops up until the last scene, because it kills its character. The cast of this movie was well taken together. All Mr. Tom Hanks character. I love the silence and silence of all Rooney's team. There is something cool and ineffective in the scene, just emotions. I love John Rooney's appearance, even when he noticed the face of the character of Paul Newman before seeing him, that Tom Hanks gets his revenge on his character and knows that his destiny has come. I watched the movie for the first time away, and I saw the video I had to take it out and since I added my favorite movie to my collection. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actress, so this movie is a special place for me.
