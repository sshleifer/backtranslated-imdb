Tali of Kali is an original horror movie that is part of the work of a worship group formed by German psychologists in India to learn how to control their will and their bodies, as others can "heal". the radical demilitaries that release demons that release devil daughters (nightmares, hallucinations, and physical pain and torture). the aforementioned worship group. The first segment is slower than the others, but works well to set the rest of the film. The rest is considered in the mindf @ c, some basic keys that appear in the mix (full face nudity, some gore) to be happy. <br /> <br /> I looked at him. It can not be impressive, but the concept is quite neat and it's in good places. 8/10.
