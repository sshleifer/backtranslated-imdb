Are you a giraffe? ... ask John Nadi, and he, yes, responds well: yes. In that way, both men who do not know each other, and women at the same time, will start communicating between men and women who start to ask questions and doubts about "Birthday Girl". I've heard the movie several times, but I have not seen ... I dare to write this for two hours. At the same time, Nicole Kidman is one of the best actors (I've never seen pretty nice and intelligent). "Birthday Girl" is a story of a lonely and ordinary man who searches for the internet wife. The woman who finds her comes from Russia. It seems that a woman is tricky, normal, not more. One day, on the birthday, suddenly comes his cousin and his friends. Men will start to know some things. Here, since then, he has always been the lonely and most ordinary man. <br /> <br /> We think many of us think that this movie is exploited and regular. Many of us believe that actions and emotions are safe and have no novel. But "Birthday Girl" is the opposite. This movie is full of great surprises, good performances and an imaginary plot, I never saw and imagined. This romantic thriller with a fun touch is an excellent natural natural film that has a lot of proposals for such films. "Birthday girl" has beauty and skin in her scenes, but at the same time makes them become more tangible and deeper. but in the end, it is completely encouraging. And I do not feel that it's a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the wrong ... well, if any.
