Welcome to Collinwood a lot of things, but it's not the following: <br /> <br /> George Clooney star vehicle Unfunny Un-Original vehicle <br /> <br /> Yes, I know, the basis is another movie movie. As it goes to Hollywood, this is the classification of most of the real outputs of these ten years and for me. <br /> <br /> The movie is from the beginning to the end, absolute gas. That's why. <br /> <br /> There is no bad performance in the film. Fun pieces are fun. The parts are sharp. The script is not the most intense moment of conversation. Cinematography is cool and beautiful. And it does not fit in with Hollywood's rules (you'll see what you mean by watching the movie) <br /> <br /> When I was a kid, I remember watching the movie ads. This movie has gone much under the radar at the box office and is not a classic worship. The reason behind Transformers 2 is that it is seen among the average movie, because it is accustomed to seeing Transformers 2, as if it were original and fun, it is pumped more than one million pieces. The film experience would be much cooler - <br /> <br /> As they said before, they did not "welcome" to Collinwood. <br /> <br /> Caper, a mini-masterpiece, is not fun, because he does not deny the compromise. One of my favorites.
