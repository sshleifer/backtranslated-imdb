Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a great deal of success in television. However, the work of the film has been much more (The Bank Job 2008 was well, just like Across the Universe the previous year, for example). <br /> <br /> Still Crazy, fortunately, it's a great success. An excellent story, great performances, humor, wonderful music and also a real heart. <br /> <br /> I like "a few moments", and this film has one of them. Love is nice
