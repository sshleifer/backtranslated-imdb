Preston Waters is a bad summer. A birthday is born and nothing else is expected. <br /> <br /> First of all, she needs to share her room with relatives that run a business. They can not do in their rooms, because they do not have enough space. For a birthday party, he only scored $ 6 for $ 32, $ 35 and $ 50. When one of the birthdays get out early, it only gets a check out of $ 11. <br /> <br /> Moving to the bank you need to start at least $ 200 to start an account. Leaving the bank, a bully will steal the check. The children continue to run by a criminal called Quirley (directed by Miguel Ferrer) (probably ruining his motorcycle). Quigley also comes from the bank to give it to tomorrow's owner for $ 1,000,000. Quigley begins to check the damage, but only writes his name when a police car surrounds the area. He frightens him, gives Preston a check, informs him that he ends his assignment to his father. <br /> <br /> That afternoon, Preston tells his father that he does not want a new bike, he wants them. The room is back, the better still his house. Father introduced him into the rest of the afternoon. Sucking in his room, Preston can not get worse, he forgot that his pocket is still in his pocket shirt. It's empty <br /> <br /> After using the computer and carefully examining, it takes about $ 1,000,000. The next day, when he tries to charge the bank, he thinks he is the person who is going to provide $ 1,000,000 and that's what he does. Even then the real person named Juice comes later. <br /> <br /> Now, these three must follow Preston. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Preston buys all the fun. including his house, and even though he is going to date the bank deputy lady who is really and the FBI agent (trying to track 3 bad guys). This person calls his Macintosh and works, even though it's a birthday party. <br /> <br /> But finally things get caught (money is running out, it gets bad). <br /> <br /> In general, a fun movie. Miguel Ferrer plays very well. If you enjoyed Another Stakeout, he loves you here. It makes evil things malicious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fantastic driver Rick Ducommun (Ghost in the Machine's boss) is wonderful.
