The Amicus British production company is known as a specialist in horror anthologies, and this brilliant omnibus called "The House That Dripped Blood" has definitely been the best Amicus production I have seen so far (I am sure that there are some who still have it. see, however). "Blood That Dripped Blood" has four macabre tales, all in mysterious mansion. These four stories bring you in a beautiful Gothic setting, and one of the most powerful imaginable sets. Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee (Cushing and Lee are two of my favorite actors ever), as well as Denholm Elliott and Ingrid Pitt in this film. That's why it's possible to miss the horror fans? Nobody is, of course, and offers much more movies than an excellent cast. "Blood Dripped Blood" is a strange country house, and rare things happen. In four parts, the film tells the story of four heirs. <br /> <br /> The first story, "Method for Murder", tells the story of a horror novelist Charles Hyller (Denholm Elliott). with your wife After changing, the writer feels strongly about his creativity. The first segment is an excellent shot of the movie. The story is amazing and full of macabre, and the performances are very good. <br /> <br /> In the second story, "Waxworks", Phillip Grayson (Peter Cushing) retired, the employer enters the house and suddenly feels a mysterious wax museum in the nearby town ... Peter Cushing, again, has a great performance It gives this one, and the rest of the performances are very good. The story is very enjoyable and the second of the film, after the third. <br /> <br /> The third story "Sweet The Sweet" is one of the most fascinating and fascinating of these four. John Reed (Christopher Lee) moves with his little daughter. Private teachers and nanny. Mrs. Norton, Mr. What Reed has sent to her daughter, is impressed by the rigor of the employer's daughter, and she is eager to see why the prospects of her father's alleged expectations may be ... The best part of the segment is a very environmentally and truly scary plot. Christopher Lee, as always, is superb in his role. Nyree Dawn Porter is a nanny, and my special praise goes with the 11-year-old Chloe Franks. It only performs simple segments for real-world fans of horror movie. <br /> <br /> The great actress Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee) gets into the house with her sexy lady. Carla izar (Ingrid Pitt). This fourth story is satire, rather than fear. However, it's a fun-filled satire, and there are many quotes for horror movies. At some point, Henderson mentions indirectly Christopher Lee, the star of the previous third segment ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br As we have stated above, the third segment is terribly and more credible, but the other three are also atmospheric and terribly humorous. Horror stories, all of Horror lovers appreciate. Awesome atmosphere, humor, authenticity and bright work is essential. To sum it up: "The Blood That Dripped Blood" is a terrifying, terrifying British lover. Highly Recommended!
