In the 1950s, after the use of special electronic necklaces due to the killings (caused by a "mysterious dusty space"), a lonely young man, Timmy, Fido (Billy Connelly) found a friend. Newly acquired family home area. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> Carrie-Anne Moss) when he was psychologically frustrated by the child (when he had to shoot his father, he tried to eat it!). <br /> <br /> But Timmy worries when he turns his neck on his back and attacks and kills the elderly. If Fido's authorities, if they had trouble with a local bullies partner, and had a relationship with his mother's home help with the dead, could Timmy find his new friend? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Romero is a zombie-verse and a transplant in a small town in the 1950s America is a genius blow and the result is just one of the most innovative films to "face the dead alive". <br /> Connelly's Fido Undead is a movie zombie movie Hall of Fame, along with Dead Of Bub, and Return of The Living Dead's Tarman; It's not often that I feel like I'm getting a pedestrian corpse, but Big Yin's performance is great, when I've actually found it, I was promoting my purple blue purple! The rest of the work also includes good performances, with young K'Sun Ray (Timmy) and Ms.Moss deserves special mention for Ray, for a young person, especially guaranteed and because of Moss. it's so bloody it's cute! <br /> <br /> This is the third part of the movie that I saw this week (others are somewhat depressing Planet Terror and Dead Of Living are pretty fun) and to my surprise. It's also the best. The director Andrew Currie is a talented talent to go forward to watch and give a glimpse of the genre's enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 8.5, they are rounded to 9.
