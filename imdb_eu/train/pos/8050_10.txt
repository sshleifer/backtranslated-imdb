The wise guy in the art of fighting, faster, makes it back. The hero of his character, a first film Sammo imitating Bruce Lee, is surprisingly Sammo Lee in his actions and fighting. The way Bruce's style goes, and then the more well-known kung-fu's way back is a joy to see and show how his art gets and adapts. Eject slapstick humor, a dear as much as this movie and a comedy (comedy (like some unwanted ones, such as fake blacks), some films with incredible action and fights ... <br /> <br /> Anyone who has an hour and a half hours worth of beer and friends.
