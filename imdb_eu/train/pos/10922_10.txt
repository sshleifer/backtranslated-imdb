When I was very young, on a local television show, all kinds of kung fu movies would be shown on Saturdays. I've watched Kung Fu movies at the weekend. I have a lot to remember. I've seen some great movies like Crippled Masters. Bruce, Kung Fu Zombie, Shaolin Drunken Monk, The Rage of the Master, Tattoo Dragon, and ... Five Deadly Venoms.Ith I remember the day.Me and my dad just had lunch at Burger King lunch. see what the movie would be on Saturday. We went into the house and jumped on the couch, set the set and we entered 56. Kung Fu featured on long sleeve Kung Fu on Saturday. Then it was the title of the movie. He told Five Deadly Venoms. Then the movie started. I went to my burger with a pre-sealed credit sequence. I loved this movie. Toad Venom It was a hard ground to keep up with that age, but that was not what I was drawing ... it was a fight. The fights were so ... amazin g Every time I hit a commercial I watched and I soon saw the best movie was finished 2 hours ago.
