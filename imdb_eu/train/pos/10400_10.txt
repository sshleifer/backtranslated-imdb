Perhaps the best fantasy movie ever made. A flat color, spectacular set, Miklos Rosza music scores, scene and atmosphere. The interventions that may be rhythm and detachment have been excellent, but here the poetic conversation speaks kindly (it speaks sensibly (humor is fine and beautiful). <br /> <br /> Certainly Spielberg and Lucas were fascinated . "The Four Feathers" (1939), one of the best films ever released by Alexander Korda and London Films --- one of the best films ever. <br /> <br /> True and compelling. Classic!
