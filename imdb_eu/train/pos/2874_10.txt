Cinderella is a beautiful young woman, who treats her virtuous and adventurous grandmother. One day, a ball will be celebrated in honor of the prince, but Crash does not go away, because his grandmother and grandmother will not leave. With the help of his fairy grandmother and his animal friends, he goes to the ball, with a warning to return home at midnight. He joined the Prince Charming at the Balloon. When the clock strikes at midnight, he goes home, leaving one glass shoe behind him. With the help of his animal friends, his true identity is revealed. After having married the prince, they always live happily. Cinderella, 56 years ago, was a great success at the box office and, to date, the audience has a great deal of enthusiasm. He has a well-written script. The characters are memorable. The songs include "A Dream is A Heart Your Makes", "So This Is Love", and "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo", which helps to tell the story. This has grown my favorite movie and has not lost its charm. Authentic Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The latest DVD book is the best way to see this movie, including featurettes, deleted scenes, music video, theater radio programs and the printed version of the movie.
