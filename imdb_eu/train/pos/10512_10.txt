First of all, I want to buy this VHS movie on DVD, it's my favorite movie of all time. I read the book, but I think the movie is a lot better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow, because Mr. Emma and Jeremy Northam had chosen Mr. Knightley brilliantly. It was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10 is a movie !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
