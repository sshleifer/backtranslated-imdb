I know some purists are that something similar to the original is poo poo, but sometimes spin-offs may have their merits. I like the new Iron Chef, similar to the Japanese version, but also an American spirit. I like Alton Brown as a comment is fun. Iron Chefs are very interesting. I know it was the best chefs on the planet at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American Beat Chef. Mario Batali seems to be the most important in cooking, making comments and creating a fascinating one. I have watched the series and all the players are doing well. Judges do not always have the best options. There are a few exceptions, as the lawyer likes, but most of the jury is doubtful about what it is to be served. I see the love of chefs and the challenges are amazing. In the end, food is amazing and sometimes it inspires me in the kitchen. Maybe anyone can ask you to really eat what you are serving. The only thing that I really changed about the series is to ask for a bit of clarification about the show. Sometimes a little mood becomes too much, and that's not always fun when you wait for play. I liked the version of William Shatner (Iron Chef USA), which was as great as the original, but I know the proposal was quite expensive. I would like to say that it was with this version between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, they smiled for an hour. If you do not expect the original Japanese version and if this series is approved by its own merits, it may be a nice time.
