Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I am not particularly interested in spy stories and I do not know that. The only reason I saw it was Nick Nolte, one of my favorite actors from the "Champions of Breakfast" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the movie brought me a pleasant surprise. It was a lot, of course, but also in the plot. There was little political intrigue and the moral question was much more focused: when reading his anti-semitic commercial radio with secret messages hidden from Americans, he helped the general attitude of the Germans (and later appear). Americans) to Jews or Hitler. What is greater weight, at his service in his country or unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? The dilemma is even more noticeable, since these words are never spoken or narrative. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who has learned to conceal these feelings from people, who do not open them, nor in their memories. Such an internal conflict is almost impossible to portray, but with the help of superb photography and photography, this film is managed. <br /> <br /> There are other points, such as the humorous or ironic use of romantic comics (such as the White Christmas song) that differs from American medium-sized movies. I recommend everyone who is bored with Hollywood spy films.
