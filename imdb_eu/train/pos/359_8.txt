I can not believe now that I'm watching this movie. I think maybe it was a movie about slaves who suffer abuse, and for the same reason I have promoted roots as I do not have to see the Schindler list. If you do not want the pain of other peoples to be "entertained", it does not matter which one should be authentic or informative. <br /> <br /> So the main thing I realized about Purple Color was that. There were no blacks for blacks. Blacks were able to rape their daughters, or offer them to treat "husbands" as slaves. It looked painful, but eventually everyone recovered, and the play was phenomenal! I can not believe the character that played at Oprah 35! And I love to start Whoopi - it was amazing. I'm glad I felt badly yesterday at the evening and Showtime run The Color Purple.
