I saw at least fifty times this movie, and I saw it for the first time last week, I still do not think so. <br /> <br /> The same story was incredible, but Spielbergen's experience sparked great work by Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery. Akosua deserved the nomination of Oscar for the Oscars as a short but powerful portrait of Nettie. <br /> <br /> You will see every emotion when you watch this movie. I laughed, shouted and annoyed. Like most of the great cinemas, it detected the Academy but without victories. But, definitely, the movie is definitely one of the best films of all time.
