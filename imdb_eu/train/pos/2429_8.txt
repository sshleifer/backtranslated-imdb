If you love Deep Cover, this movie would like too. Many poetic interludes, which Fishbull says in Deep Cover, comes from the lyrical "Behind life" script, written by Fishburne in the adaptation of a play. If you love Larry as you love me, Larry completely loves this movie, hot and totally proud. Of course, we use guns and we use illegal substances, that is, it's a gangster film, after all, but the script is beautiful and it's touching the story, even a bit of a Chick film. <br /> <br /> AMAZING film ... dark, terrifying, sexy and exciting. If you go out at night or if you are hanging in a room in the room, it will help you narrow the set (the echoing of life accumulated). It's full of pre-eminent and complex relationships, this film is tight ... it's always reflected in decorative and camera shots. LAN ONA!
