"Home Room", "Zero Day" and "Elephant" were inspired by the wave of new school shows. But unlike other two films, two subsequent survivors of "Home Room" (not shooter or dead) survived. Explosive and more useful is the wasting of wondering questions that do not respond to a small effort. <br /> <br /> Do not give up this little movie in the first 20 minutes, that is, it is supposed to create a real story, but it plays like a "Hill Street Blues" episode. It's stubborn, but it suffers, at least the length of the race is enough to classify the movie as a feature film. I highly recommend this jump and do not jump from the stage of the hospital, there is nothing here that you can not get from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Like a lot of good movies, creativity was the one-man show by Paul F. Ryan. This arrangement does not guarantee a good movie, but it is a good sign, because it means a certain construction and execution unit, lacking large budget dramatic budgets. Because the screenplay "Home Room" is a true force, the writer has also run production and has made his vision come to the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan takes an incredible opportunity at the end. it tests the limits of the tolerance of feeling of the average audience. It runs from the edge of the right, but it cries against everything logic rather than cringing it. The latest work is why the need for the audience to be combined at the end of this type of journey goes on, the song (Sarah McLaughlin's "Sweet Surrender") and an amazing last-minute edition. > <br /> The other force of the film is the protagonists of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) casting. Although Phillips's bright teenager and her intelligent daughter, Christens's good family, they give more intensity than ever. The life of two little girls' family is very good and very interesting for Ryan. What is happening here is one of two, despite a story that asks about a detective, trying to connect with Alicia with a single shot. If the film has ever cut and cut it again, this side story must be condensed. <br /> <br /> There is hardly any innovative idea in linking the story about two very different girls and helping each other, and Ryan can easily film this movie. topical and forecast. But, instead, the script seeks to enter into a fascinated, cuddly and unbelievable game, slowly moving away from one another and sharing the moments of weakness to make them go back. You just violate Deanna's "Everywhere die" line: I can not think of a moment in any other movie I thought. He has to wake up the connection that desperately relies on Alicia. Deann goes forward only. The audience continues to wait for the group that never happens. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is not a great suspense, but it also allows you to admire the characters as well as the actress of both. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
