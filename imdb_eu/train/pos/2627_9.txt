Finally, Timon and Pumbaa in their movie ... <br /> <br /> 'The Lion King is a new look at 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata'. What classical story do you ask? Why, of course, "The Lion King!" <br /> <br /> Yes, Disney has never had a lot of things, it's narcissism. <br /> <br /> But that does not mean that this is not a good movie. Basically 'The Lion King' events are told from Timon's and Pumba's perspective. That's why you'll have to know the story "The Lion King" to see where it's coming from. <br /> <br /> In any case, I saw it on a level and I thought it. "Oh, my God, that is so ..." and on another level there was a ball. There is a lot of anticipation - I mean that Pumbaa consists of two beds, one for himself and Timon, when we all know nanosecond Timon will be great. But that does not hurt, the IMO recognizes Hakuna Matata. It's not what happens, how does it do it. <br /> <br /> And a warning note: there are also some templates. Actually, did you expect something other than Pumbaa in a movie? But as they go with fart jokes, they are particularly good and they should also have the most accurate knowledge. <br /> <br /> The voice translator's talent is great. I am surprised that some of the actors have been willing to go back, most of them have only two or three lines (fortunate enough). Whoopi Goldberg is particularly pleasing. <br /> <br /> Music is excellent. From the beginning of "Digga Tunnah", "This is what I need," "adaptation of" Warthog Rhapsody "(" The Lion King's song ", and this is very much improved in this incarnation), music gives me nothing to complain about. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Timon and Pumbaa are superb characters, and arguably "Hakuna Matata" is just an excuse to see them in fun and varied situations. then be. It's strange to find just the wrong characters to spend time with. <br /> <br /> I started to be angry? <br /> <br /> Either way, if the king is lion king 1 1/2, it is great if you have seen the "lion king" regularly. Especially if you think you're right now "Do not be stupid, there's not too much to see" The Lion King! " "
