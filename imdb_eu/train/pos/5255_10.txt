Tim Meadows has to pay tribute to SNL's recent cast members. Initially, the low-lying look was like a gig, a 90-minute, very entertaining time, even though it's still on the brow. Do not make this pop so worthy of cinematography or Oscar's performances. Going forward with Tim Meadows and doing the best with Will Ferrell, the audience laughs. <br /> <br /> Leon "Male men" is similar to a sex show. There's nothing short of Wang's paths. As a man of peoples acquired, he will lose his wife's wounded sweats so that he can hunt him. The director makes a work inspired by the guiding actors, in a comedy session that is totally complete in the absence of plot development. How much land would you expect from a SNL skit? Although some scenes break a bit, most of Meadows's linens and absurd sex fraud have caused the bones to entertain. For example, in a scene, Meadows compares it with his mother Teresa, but for bonuses. Are you sure of the rails, but do we not forget about the privacy of all our homes to advise the whole city "not"? In another scene, he makes a sensitive kiss with the female head and remembers his benefactor immediately, a woman who had been sleeping a year ago. He was obviously standing up to the woman and says that "Men's men again" says it clearly. <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams leaves the ball bartender / narrator. Will Ferrell, repressed homosexuals, will perform solid performances. <br /> <br /> See if this movie is humorous. If not, be distant from the distance.
