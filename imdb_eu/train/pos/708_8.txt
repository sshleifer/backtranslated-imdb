A good movie about evil syndrome. The mother has twins, she is very ill, the other is good, but she has a fall. Mum does not believe she will raise her to 15 children with 15 children. Mum does not like this and believes she should be with her family (I agree) that they are going to court and the family is destroyed and they lose their grandparents, has she never said mother or daughter make-up? I think this movie is good, but the plot is popular, it's still good and it has some unwanted laughs!
