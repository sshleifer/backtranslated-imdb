As Jim Carrey's usual, and not just "Jim Carrey moments," there's a movie called "Jim Carrey." <br /> <br /> Especially aimed at children and I enjoy enjoying it. such a movie. Jim Carrey's other movie was driven by Israel; So those who expected a strange comedy were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film has some nice moments and works like a children's movie. I can not say I love this movie, but again I'm not the recipient!
