I grew up in Houston when I was nine years old when my movie was released. As a result, I do not remember the movie. Thanks to Gilley and the running of the bulls, "Lookin 'for Love", I remember Gilley and the mechanical bull, when I bring memories of childhood. <br /> <br /> However, a few years ago I first saw this movie as an adult and I can say that I've been on it all. Some movies are harder. It's as raw and authentic as this movie. Uncle Bob's ranch house, Texas City, Gilley dancing hall and Bud and Sissy chemist's workshop. And maybe that's why it does not have a wider appeals. But you have not noticed how you feel about country music (although I do not have any roots in Houston anymore). Urban Cowboy is the only American pie pie. That's why I love it!
