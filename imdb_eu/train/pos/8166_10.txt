This movie is great! The play is fine, the excellent casting by Corbin Bernsen as a perfectionist of dentists and torturing the sick. At first, he watches his wife with the pool and then crazy. He also takes his wife and a pool, revenge after the torture of the mountains. The special effects are also beautiful, although some are fake (even if they are away at night and that's when they are still red in the morning). But the scene of torture is very well done. This movie is very weak; In some heavy parts it is sometimes extreme tedious. But this real horror / thriller fan is required to watch!
