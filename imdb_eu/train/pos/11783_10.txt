Rock Star: I've never seen the best INXS music shows! They had some of the greatest rock n 'roll songs ever written with 15 talented singers / performers. Likewise, in my opinion, in every reality, the most surprising and sensitive endings of all TVs were. I was lucky to be the winner! For 13 weeks of this television competition, the audience knew and met all the competitors. The rest of the following episodes of thirty episodes liked most fans to compete with each other in a reality show than to be unknown to each other. And INXS was one of the biggest rock and roll groups, and still continues to add to the emotional tension created by this wonderful series of reality. If you have not recorded the series, DVD STAR: The INXS DVD is an excellent alternative.
