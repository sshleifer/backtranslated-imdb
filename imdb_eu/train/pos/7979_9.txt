Tony Scott can do good and bad movies. Personally, I think it may be a little bit brilliant and trashy and its work, of course, compared to the famous brother, but surely its the best movie. <br /> <br /> This film is so great that Scott Scott Denzel (a fiery form better than a training day) and Dakota Fanning is a real time to develop a true warmth and warmth. Composition is NOT boring, though it takes time - it implies and takes us on a journey through character - Radha Mitchell's role as a mother. All this serves to make an action more efficient, because they are invested in the characters, since all vulnerabilities are evident. This film is put in its entirety and you do not copy it to the end. <br /> <br /> The movie would be Washington, of course, nothing. I often wonder why they play so many roles, it is very clear that there is almost as good a man as anyone (I really can not think of it, Daniel Day Lewis, on those days with a bigger power on the screen). . This film should be huge, given its state of affairs and its performance strength and the quality of the film. We'll see if a studio does not return a movie back, the video goes live. I would like to see this on the big screen.
