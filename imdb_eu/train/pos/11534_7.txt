Mirage (1990) is a horror frightened in 1990; He has released in the UK on the "New World Video" label. <br /> <br /> It's a desert movie about a young friend. on a weekend break, to kill only one stranger force that drives a threatening black truck. This movie has awesome scenes and some gore here and there, but I must say that the actors were so dirty, even though they were low budget standards! But the movies were very funny and I liked it, and I never dreamed or turned off, it's always a good sign! I gave almost 6/10 this movie, but when I saw it falling on the ground, I had good moments of gore and hanging, I had a good nudity, and the blonde woman who plays the role is also a hottie! I will give it 7/10.
