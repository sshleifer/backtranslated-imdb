When I was 12 years old I remember the movie, it was amazing ... I remember the day, then I did not see any more, though I tried to buy it, but it's like wild horses! However, the performance is a bit too massive, but the story is astonishing, I saw 20 times as a surprise because of the fact that the low-budget B was a real movie. It was a very good movie and I loved the idea of ​​fighting a giant robot-controlled giant man, it was blamed for "Crash and Burn" by zeppy spin off, do not watch that movie completely pants! If your true Sci-Fi movie is to be a fan, if it were to be re-created today, it would be a winner. I'd like to see a remake again or release that DVD.
