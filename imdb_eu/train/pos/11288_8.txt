Almost all critics consider Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan as the best film, I do not have any such argument, although others have seemed entertaining to me. One thing: it's the longest series I have ever seen in 105 minutes. I only saw six of them, but I thought it was longer than this and I thought it was a long end to the end of the action. <br /> <br /> However, one is a good mix of actions, suspense and love. The only thing missing is color and stereo sound. The initial special effects are not disturbing me, because everything that was in the thirties. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, this movie stands out for one thing: skin! "Jane" had never dreamed of something wonderful after this movie, when Hays' Code was set up during the next Tarzan film. Her outfit depicts a beautiful character by Maureen O'Sullivan. Underwater underwater scene, however, was not there - with a long break. The woman under water does not have any good image, anybody. <br /> <br /> There are many activities here. Until the end, it was not widely accepted. He lasted for 15 minutes and was so intense that he could see it. <br /> <br /> Still, this film offers everything except "Boy" (except for their son's consent). - I'd like to see you in a Tarzan movie, though O'Sullivan's Tarzan shouted a dozen times. This "partner with Birik" was not the problem.
