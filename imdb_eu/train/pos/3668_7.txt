I recently saw this movie and I really liked it. It gives an overview of the movie indie film and how much work it really is when it comes to low budget, you need an actor / actor name, people to come see and show the movie. Modin and his partner Saul - Paul Linder, Bobby Myeres, an excellent combination of eccentric Miachel Bates, the actor of "NAME" by Alan Bates, was perfect in the film and in the film. My favorite cast member Sandy Ryan Debra Kara Unger played an excellent and underrated role in his unique performance as part of the new movie. If you enjoy watching a comedy, this is for you. The small budget has lower budgets with a great smile.
