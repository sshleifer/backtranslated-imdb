It was a great movie. Communist regime of Russia in the 80s defines the fight against ignorance against ignorance. This film gives me a higher mark, because there is no research on the birth and development of the forensic investigation (thanks to the Regime). It is a graphic film. It presents an image without violence and is a tragic catastrophe. Nothing is "covered with candy" in order to distinguish between rough and grim blood from the cruel reality of the screen. This movie is based on the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. I know the true story I know very well to be a true appreciation for the movie. It's not a comedy, but it's a must for those who appreciate dry and dark humor.
