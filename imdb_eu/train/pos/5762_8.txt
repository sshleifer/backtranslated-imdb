I must admit to enjoying bad movies. I love them. Fear especially. My friends and I get together at school and a heavy bundle, rent some crazy ribbons, ask for a pizza and blast it out. I had a big picture, so I expected less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story is about a home built on a nuclear installation that has undergone underground layers, and the other is covered by underground layers. The inhabitants of this town have found a surface covered when some children fall into a hole in a cave. This awakens some zombies. <br /> <br /> From that moment on, it's part of the city. Gore effects and actions do not stop until the end credits. <br /> <br /> Okay, it's not a great art, but that's it, with its joke, and with our condolences, our favorite. in the afternoon. In fact, I've had the best pleasure I've ever seen, "party guys". And it might be said that he was made without money, with a bunch of people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (a kameo) and is just a wild journey.
