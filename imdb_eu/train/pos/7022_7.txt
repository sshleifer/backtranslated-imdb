FINALLY !!!!!!!!!!! Almost a year in the cinema, this movie was released and it was finally released in the SB. I met some of the actors I liked very well and they were a great movie. I saw the trailer so many times and I did not know what I expected, but I totally sucked it. The movie was very beautiful and it was good music. I recommend Ryan Donowho to anyone who has a fan, and Dominique Swain has been good at it. other good actors were also excellent. I hope the DVD will appear soon! <br /> <br /> I first went into OC's OC watching and then I saw the bundle of good indies on a good indies like Imaginary Heroes. This film is very good, and all that is done is indie. I like Dominique, but I have not seen it. Wait until both be seen soon !!!
