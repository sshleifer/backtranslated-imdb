For those who think that Lady May Witty Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes is a nice old lady, she needs a movie adjustment. Here is not pleasant or cumbersome. Instead, George Macready, his son, is horrible. Do not knit, otherwise your eyes are blown and there is no safe cushion for furniture. We now know what Nina Foch has caught if he is able to get him out of the hands of his mother. <br /> <br /> A very stubborn movie with very narrow movies. The script is never faring away from the dilemma of Fochen. The sea has been arrested in a large Gothic house on the banks of an angry sea. They will die, but why. His situation makes no sense. He tries to escape when he escapes, but even strangers are against him. We begin to feel more defenseless and paranoid while the world is away. The director Joseph H. Lewis directed the film to the councilor for this film, and it is very understandable. Also, watch the outstanding Foch Run through a series of emotions. Witchcraft is also terribly terrifying if a matriarch, who knows what he wants and how to get it, keeps his Wacko son on the line. The main event seems to be my only reservation considering the main event. However, it is a great way to spend more than a few hours at the University of Columbia.
