I want to add the value of my two cents, and I'm sorry, I'm repeating something that's already published, but I think it's worth remembering to Damon Runyon's genius. Without a great street, Damon Runyon's hilarious essays would never make this film, no other similar classic game before the 1960s. Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper man and was in Colorado. But I'm sure the street scene on the east coast. Unless you're a fan of Hollywood comedy oldies, I would recommend other films in Damon Runyon's writings; "Lemondrop Kid" and "Little Miss Marker" are promoted by Bob Hope, his politics aside, has always been fun. (As a liberal West Coast, his politics seem pretty fun!) He lives in Damon Runyon!
