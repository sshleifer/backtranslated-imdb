Hello, Playmates. I've seen this movie for the first time and I have also had the first experience of Arthur Askey, I have to believe that this film is very surprising. The black and white films, in general, the pimple passport, the lavender mountain mafia and Tommy Trinder (a seemingly distant relative), when this film arrived, was given a British humor. Some of the critics of Askey's performance are here, but I think it's a test of time as a comic-cinematic feature of the 1950s, and something adds to the image by creating more characters than pure stereotypes. It seems that the movie is now the dominant one. If you have this movie, I suggest you think these films, in general, will not be shown on Sunday evenings. I'm glad I could see another piece. Arnold Ridley's work (Godfrey's private father's army). Thank you
