This movie is perfect for all the romantics in the world. John Ritter has never been better and is one of the best films! "Sam" is close to home, it's very nice to play with the play. Ben Gazzara cast was brilliant and easy to fall into love. I am sure I was somewhere in Arthur's travels. It's a great opportunity to get a great night out around it! :-)
