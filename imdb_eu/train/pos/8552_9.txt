This is one of the favorites of American Pie Spin so far, especially in every other, the main character (one of the young Stiflers) seems realistic. <br /> <br /> For example, AP: The Naked Mile. You have a young boy surrounded by college chemists, and he's particularly hot in his career to get rid of his "problem" of virginity and at the end stop middle-action and ride a horse to sleep with his girlfriend. Note that he gave him a "free weekend of guilt". I value the romantic aspect of everything but to be realistic; Watching these movies does not mean that most people are looking for a romantic story. <br /> <br /> Lately the viewers and the good Erik Stifler seem to be waking up and smelling. roses and as always, Mr. Levenstein brings his "completely natural" comic strip to the equation and has touched on this new movie.
