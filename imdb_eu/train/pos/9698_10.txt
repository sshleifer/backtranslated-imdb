I've seen this movie for several times and for me all my life, I can not understand why it compares some people to BABE. This movie is not the secret life of all the animals that can secretly speak. Instead, he talks about the parrot that begins to learn to talk, the owner, to help a little girl with overweight, overcome oral barriers in order to distinguish her from the beginning of her heart-turning scene. Then a great journey begins. Paulie Parrot, his great friend, Marie. He intends to try. <br /> <br /> On the way you will meet wonderful people and evil people. The parrot of a girl falls in love and has lost. He was captured by a wicked scientist who was forced into the crime of life and then exploited. <br /> <br /> He tells his story to a handsome Janitor who works at the Labyrinth to find his beloved and help him find his beloved. Marie. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub, with an open heart and wide heart, is a beautiful and bright food and Paulie is a little helper despite the dangers. Jay Mohr listens to Parrot's voice and a character he will encounter. <br /> <br /> There is a small suggestive language, but this movie is ideal for most children, and even more so when parents are fun and enjoy watching. The animal adventure story is rich and slim and eventually it is a love story about Bird and his girlfriend. Most people who do not know much about Marie, who seeks Marie, concludes with an unexpected surprise. <br /> <br /> Los Angeles and Pasadena Parrot Green Parrot, who have watched the local tribes, will especially see this movie and Understanding Birds, especially the parrot that is not thrown out. Everyone that goes on everywhere will see that pets make up deep attachments and that they are a gift to respect the love and loyalty of a dog or loro. <br /> <br /> So, do not BABE here, turn an incredible trip over. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and try not to scratch in the most sad parts.
