"Adult-directed movie" is a strange thing these days, but Moonstruck does well, and the average movie is still better, aging well. Although the comic moments are smaller than the rest, the film has a wonderful peculiarity (Brooklyn Italians) that is not used to exchange characters or audiences. (that is, the monsters never appear as an assistant. It never turns into a grotesque My Big Fat Greek Wedding). Secondary story lines are financially tense with short scenes that allow you to break through the main thread. These are the scenes that are still in today's movies, because the immediate value is not surprising with producers and bigwigs. I missed this scene. Beautiful old people who also know. The movie is a calm and calm path to conclude. There's no place in the written scene to misunderstand some sphincter directors to relax. Cage and Cher have a very nice job. <br /> <br /> Moonstruck calls the old school, ethnicity and nice work of New York, like "Marty," Moonstruck is not so absurd.
