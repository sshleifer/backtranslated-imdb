History of the FBI, told by agent Stewart, through flashbacks, related to his personal story of life. Stewart and Miles (as wives) are quite good, as Hamilton is a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story is difficult. It's like watching the weird and small pieces of twelve different films, because it gets a glance at the gangsters. Some episodes are too long, some are too short, and there are only a few (Stewart's daughter's school sequence). Overall it's too long. However, it deserves to look at the valuable values ​​of production.
