I hate to read the criticisms that say something like this: 'Do not waste your time, the movie is dull.' Still to the reviewer for me, my charm can be na√Øve. If you like other films in the 'Whistler' series, this will be visible. If you like noirish film in the '40s, this will be visible. <br /> <br /> This movie is not in my opinion, just as good as the first series of the main characters of Richard Dix. It's much slower, and the plot is trite. You have seen the same narrative used in other films, and usually better. <br /> <br /> But the performance is good, as well as lighting and conversation. There is no energy and surely what is going on and what will happen over time will be more than a quarter of the time. <br /> <br /> The Whistler series is semi-black, and there are no more characters, mood, lighting, camera movement and angles than the story. But this movie is not black. Lightweight and the innocent Hollywood for that. Richard Dix's character was not one of any of the women in the previous films. Until you have finished you will never know. <br /> <br /> But anyway, I recommend it at least for a single look. At least twice I saw myself, and I felt it both.
