I think this is still the best routine. There are others like Rock "bring the pain", and Allen's "Men are Pigs" are hilarious; "Damon Waynes's last stand" is also fun in a tearful way - but this routine is not a mistake. All jokes are fun, and it's a perfect 70 minute break. He's been long enough for 20 years. I love the viewer how to give himself and his unlimited nature. I am a fan of classics and I'm a guy who has been thinking a lot about Jim Carrey. Watching a comic post is pretty nice. It's not a category with Ellen and Newhart, but if you have something you can see. Thank you Eddie, God bless you.
