I do not know about this theater masterpiece or the murmur of the show and images. In any case, I'm sure I love it. Stunning, stunning, intertwining stories, stunning performances by Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, and all that is struck by the brilliant color, that is, to the top trash and this is very funny. They do not mention the wonderful and underscored sexual underlying subtleties that go through the whole philosophy, since they threaten to escape from a picture, but never do so. I'd be wrong to say that the full value of the movie entertainment did not help my love, but it was a strange comic, unintentionally (or was it?) Behind the comedy, and I really really puzzled it. I would really enter this melodrama.
