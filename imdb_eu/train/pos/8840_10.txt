The Devil Before Watching is one of the best experiences of my life in the cinema. I really knew the mixed answers to the movie - and for me, extreme reviews have touched something that the film embraces or reveals to the general audience. He is one of those films he has continued with me, and I continue to think and think. <br /> <br /> Are you sure that DVDs would include themes and other structural films? These include: Sidney Lumet's return movie, a storyteller's time-shifting technique, an excellent combination of Lumet and Masterson, and why it works well, the direction of the teacher, which Hollywood movies are quite rare for men and largely condemned. The fight for women's open book of accreditation, presented below, but, nevertheless, by taking into account Marisa Tomei's performance, and, of course, Hoffman's brilliant monologue at the center of his sections ... for me, the heart of the movie. <br /> <br /> Phew! Surely a master film. So, think of my disappointment when I see it in front of the advanced DVD - only comments, in the background, dialogues, or add-ons. <br /> <br /> Hey - distributors - sort!
