When I was in Philadelphia, I saw this independent film and it was a pleasant surprise. I reached the theater smiling with my face. It was so fun that it was one of the things that was based on a real story: to the family! In addition, he has good character actors. Mindy Sterling is very good. I loved Austin in love. Howard Hesseman is also wonderful. I remember the class leader. I'm tired of dark and dark films that continue to grow. This is funny and lightweight, and I can see it with my family and I'm not embarrassed. I will continue to see when it's coming to DVD. I will definitely buy it.
