Doctor Feinstone dentist gives. He has a beautiful wife and a large pool with a large house. Then he realizes that his wife is in the pool. Everything is clear, but his patient begins to torture. ... Corbin Bernsen is superb as an incredible dentist; it is completely credible. There is a surprisingly small gore, but the scenes of tooth torture are very rough and grotesque. It is highly recommended. "Dentist 2" is also worth seeing!
