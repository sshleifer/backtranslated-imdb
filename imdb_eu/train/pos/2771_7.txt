David and Bathshaba are Hollywood cinema filmmakers from 20th Century Fox created by Darryl F. Zanuck. Directed by Henry King and with Gregory Peck (King David), Susan Hayward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kieron Moore (Uriah). ) and Jayne Meadows (Michal). <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the Second Charter of the Old Testament of the Bible. David follows the king, because a baby who killed the giant Goliath city, and now we find the second king of Israel. The hard and safe king, David, however, causes heart problems. Once Betsheba showered a bath, the beginning of a trip includes adultery and betrayals; A journey that will end in the judgment that is called God. <br /> <br /> Normally for the genre, David and Bathsheba are a huge and impressive production. With the excellent design of Technicolor photography (Leon Shamroy) with excellent sets, it has enough quality to be able to offer the best production value in the genre. Curiously enough, the movie goes smoothly and focuses on its 99% worth of interviewing. This is not for anyone who loves action or a swash. It is a very humanistic figure, it is not burning around that bush, a Bible love story covered with sins of heart. But this is not a bad thing, because breaking is very well done, {Peck has a stoic religious thing, a real thing that is happening well and that pushes Hayward to a greater extent; Henry King frequently neglected skills. And even though some conversations are clear, the character flow has never been interrupted by the screenplay of Phillip Dunne's (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir) Oscars. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a neglected image in terms of genres of Biblical / Sword and Sandal (probably because it is a piece of heart), but it really deserves the most interest of the genre. 7/10
