I was amazed how much this drama could be heard when I liked it, which only got an impression of 6.6. I rarely give the time of day to less than 7/10 films. That said, I am very pleased with the respect that Stone Angel has given me, so deserves it. And this should be the case, if you are more and more curious about the sensitivity, soul, and thinking of people in this country. <br /> <br /> I have to say it in many ways (though not all), viz. its issues, execution, style, production, etc. Stone Angel reminded me a lot of "Notebook" praised. So, I am surprised that other comments do not have a lot of similarity on the part of the whole movie over and over again, so I assume that those who wrote comments have to see the Notebook. They may not share any topic on Alzheimer's, but I'm sure I can say that you enjoy "Notebook", without a doubt, "The Stone Angel" will make your time more productive. Even if you have not seen the Notebook, or read the book with that movement (probably, I do not even do it), you should find much more to keep your attention firmly - if they are your favorite genres. Do not enter fast paced thrills. This is a thought for thinkers and people who are passionate about the past. As long as life changes, and looks over what life could have been like over the years. <br /> <br /> This strongly underrated yet great movie really is worth about 8/10. I can not blame only his / her current 6.6 / 10 low rating idiots that gave 1/10% 11. At the end, he has attracted less than 300 votes when writing this comment. However, as little as 11% were given by car, they expected explosions, why they did not look ... a few seconds in the movie premieres and promotions? Oh dear ... Get in the world, do not miss the worst treasure in a movie, but only if you have one head (that is, your ten players do not even include Transformers, Fight Club or Terminator).
