Hollywood stopped after a few years after World War II. England developed a very productive film industry. In "The Man in the White Suit", the inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) never creates a suit that is dirty. Unfortunately, this means that other businesses will not be out of business. How can this Sidney deal with and maintain her dignity? This is what Alec Guinness is starring Obi Wan Kenobi as an example of excellent films. It's a good look at the general nonsense of the business world. If you plan to start any type of business, you might want to watch this movie.
