Now here, a movie taken from my childhood, my family was saved; but somehow it has been mastered and lost in years. Now I was fortunate to see the whole movie in youtube.com; I loved this wonderful movie when I saw him in childhood, and after seeing it again (online), I still do it. The favorite song of my movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I will always remember this sweet song forever). <br /> <br /> I was surprised at the initial credits (about who encouraged), some animators put them in the 1930s (WOW! 47 years ago).
