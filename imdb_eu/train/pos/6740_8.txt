The film's overwhelming character, created by its past police and the clear self-destruction of the spectator, is only one in its time, 1950. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Dana's eyes shine with anguish, Karl Malden stands out over his leader, who has no nonsense, but has mercy on those who command him. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger made his kind of film. Doubtless, Gene Tierney's beauty would be amazing, it seems impossible with a hard-hitting police officer. The cafe scene, however, is wonderful and it's real. <br /> <br /> Tom Tully, as perfect as his father's side, is Gary Merrill's hood. Great lighting and mood. A building with a very atmospheric murder, I love the old woman in the basement. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 8.
