I've been watching this show at the age of 14 and I love it since. I love this show because it's just fun! You will enjoy this show because it shows something new and fun everyday, and Benny's latest comments always have the latest comments by George about his gross giant head. * Laughter * I laughed and I would see it as if we were seeing a fun but short home with my friends. Love George Lopez Fun, talent, fun and spectacular. It's a nice series of family-friendly comedies for all and you can definitely enjoy it! And if you have not seen it, I propose you do not want to start watching. Although there is no title event, I still enjoy it again. Still fun It never fades. <br /> <br /> 9/10
