Well, what can I say to see this fantastic movie, when the nerves are still confused! Director Jacques Audiard must name his name in France, and reasonably. Vince Cassel is not both Tom Cruise and Emmanuelle Devos Penelope Cruz, but these two are fantastic actors, and this is a thriller that is heavy and compelling, which starts slowly with some light construction of some character and then tension begins with a fascinating tension is a head ball Others have written about the plot, so I will not say anything more than all of this movie, which plays a role in the improvement, the director, the actress, the cameraman, and everything seems like the stupid guns, the fight. It happens so credible, expressive, emotion, as you are almost as an audience. Get yourself aside, get a DVD, a bottle of wine, turn on the lights, take your phone hook and dive into this hitchcockian thriller :)
