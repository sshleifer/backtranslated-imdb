This film was the first time I saw it in the eighties, but now it's been reviewed that this thriller is genuine. The newer films deal with similar topics, but they do not match this French milestone. <br /> <br /> The President, of course, JF Kennedy - is filmed openly in public appearance. As a result, the image of "Lee Harvey Oswald" is guilty and, nevertheless, one of the jury has insisted on making further inquiries. It shows some stunning proofs ... <br /> <br /> Unlike the one in Oliver Stone's JFK, the movie is the same movie - this is not playing with emotions, but concentrates on how exciting and conspicuous a description of a conspiracy is. drawing a new murder image. The true psychological experiment is also used for this explanation of the crime scene. Compared to JFK, this film is more reasonable, more intelligent and more exciting. Parts of the plot can be found in the newest movie. Sometimes he was sitting already in the cinema. <br /> <br /> "I ... comme Icare" "must see". Special and brilliant, and Ennio Morricone is a wonderful music. This film deserves a very good place, if it were a Hollywood production, it would surely be popular. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
