To be honest, I expected the car behind this car. It was one, but also, the 'Freeway' was a great movie, I'm happy with the DVD player. The name of the cast is really great, the psychiatrist of Richard Belzer's HOMICIDE and Billy Movie's excellence Billy Drago, Revelation-quoting Freeway Killer. The rest of the work, in general, gives good performances. I especially liked Darlanne Fluegel as his character, Sunny, gave him his voice. He could have a helpless character for the victims, but he is completely rounded with the help of James Russo's dragoon seeker Drago. <br /> <br /> Russian, I'm afraid, it's wood, but then again, the character that Frank plays is not well-directed to get the background story that Sunnyri has given his senior officers. The very tone of the very threatening movie is a great way to build tension LA solitary lonely lane LA and the seductive gray sedan at night, and the music that is used to emphasize the movie. I do not know why some people hate this film. I think of several folio blow ups. But I thoroughly enjoyed 'Freeway' and it is highly recommended.
