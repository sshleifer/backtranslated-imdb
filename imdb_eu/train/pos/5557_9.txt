"A Mouse in the House" is a classic Tom and Jerry cartoon, faithful to their tradition but with their jokes. Hysterical, hilarious, very entertaining and quite fun. Artwork is good quality. <br /> <br /> This is not a matter of trying to capture Tom by Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and is trying to catch the mouse, "in the morning, he will have only one cat at home - and the cat that catches the mouse." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you ask, there are a lot of cartoons. It's more fun for me, for example, Mammy Two Shoes looks at two sleeping cats and says sarcastic sleep: "I'm glad I'm having a nap and I'm not expecting it to be happy." There are two cats left. Another fun one is disguised as Mammy Two Shoes and he whistles Butch in the pan, and then, Butch plays Tom with the same trick. Of course, this is even more fun than Mammy Two Shoes, and both (cushions!) Are shaped by Cats in Mammy and then attacked behind them - lol. Of course, when it's crazy and crazy, it's not a mess. But Jerry does not win that victory, because he is also eliminated.
