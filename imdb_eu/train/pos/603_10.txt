Albeniz's music is included in this film. Sometimes he plays with original instruments (for example, the piano, but never the whole orchestra), but often works with other contemporary groups (such as guitar) and treatments (for example, jazz piano). Sometimes, music is the only film: for most of the time there are many dance music, often flamenco, but not always. I guess 12 scenes that are not bounded by a plot. Not all scenes will reach the individual audience level. In my case, half of them came to the pinnacle, but all the others were very well in their own way. Those who worked for me took me an aesthetic aesthetic flesh; Indeed, the final scene made me happy. And in a magical way you get into Spanish culture. If you do not want subtitles, do not worry. The film is almost non-verbal, even though each scene is taken by Albeniz. When you see this beautiful movie, my complaint is hardly available in the DVD in the US. Especially, I am thinking of the flamenco version of "Carmen", a spectacular piece of art available in Europe but not available here (European DVDs will not play on American DVD players). It's a scandal
