Of course, 65 years have passed since Thalbergen's latest production was filmed. The IMDB member, though, is definitely one of the masterpieces of the 30s! It's 10 years. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I watched at the New York Museum of Modern Art, around 1970 (I was a teenager). To find out how expensive the scenes of that poverty, masterfully captivated, often exciting, and always passionate, MGM film production was the best for me. What did the viewers see when they saw an aggressive attack, when each person saw a palace, enormous poverty and glitter of wealth, <br /> <br /> Last week, the Oscars' auditors saw a joke. "senior" Oscar rewarded, Luise Rainer. How beautiful it has been to see one of the best and most famous works of returning to the most famous in history. <br /> <br /> Ok, so he did not win the previous year (Great Ziegfeld), but do not blame Luise. This debate was only ten years ago when it was released and its conversation was limited. Like the awning, visual and vocal use is a memorable one. <br /> <br /> A great and moving scale, what more would a movie lover want!
