Explained? Is my comment necessary? We are talking about masterpieces born throughout time, for all seasons and for all generations. I still have the only kind of film to look at. In this, like other Disney movies, it's a kind of magic. All the characters say "alive" and "real" somehow; So it's easy to understand, even if you do not understand the language (as I understood the first time I had seen the movie, it was about six years old). Maybe my English is not so good, but I've learned most of what the movies in this movie know, and this is a great dimension of this type of film, which is rare today. But there is a lot of embarrassment. In my country it's impossible now to watch this, or another Disney movie! We do not have copyrights, so our kids are disabled to enjoy and learn that kind of film. So we'll see the movie again "Once a dream" or ...?
