Here is a weird, evil revenge with Denzel Washington. Here are three characters: mercenary drop-offs and low-cost loans, now boy boys, then a loving kind father, a little girl, then a brutal mania, loose answers and revenge. <br /> <br /> The story is recruited as Washington, a guardian of a American girl living in Mexico, kidnapping of children regularly (at least according to the film). our day actress, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning has kidnapped him, Washington is responsible and no one pays. Caution: this movie is not a taste. <br /> <br /> This film is elegant, good and bad. I really liked it, but many people have been frantic because of their tastes, because the camera's work gave me a headache. I thought it was an exciting excitement that seemed to be brilliant, but not for all tastes (shaken camera). <br /> <br /> In addition to two zeros, Christopher Walken is always interesting, especially. little key, and many great actors. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is limited to basic emotions, but it works.
