A 1934 movie made up of Tarzan, including a terrifying and boring piece of Greystoke in the 1980s, is a wonderful 1934 movie. After seeing the audience in the first three scenes, it is sad, Tarzan and his Matak shoot like a shot, offering unremitting action, humor and love. Maureen O'Sullivan is a charming and beautiful Jane and starts with a movie. Weismuller is also strong. Highly recommended
