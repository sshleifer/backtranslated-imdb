Sandra Bernhard is a pretty character and definitely one of the most entertaining women in the world. It began as a comedy in the 1970s, but its great rest began in 1983 with Jerry Lewis and Robert De Nirus, who had little masterpiece in Scorsese's "The Comedy of King". However, his professional career did not quite take off. He made some entertaining but entertaining images, such as "Dallas Doll" (1994) or "Dinner Rush" (2000), but he created the most amazing pieces. <br /> <br /> <br /> "Without you I am nothing", it is definitely the best effort. Is it an adaptation of a super-production that broke off its off-Broadway shows? And for four years Madonna's best friend. In ten choreographies and performances, Sandra Nina Simone goes to Diana Ross, talks about her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco, and plays Burt Bacharach, Prince or Sylvester songs. The director John Boskovich managed to perform a performance of 90 minutes in a fun and entertaining way. If you're a fan of Bernhard, you can not miss the movie. a tribute to his talented beauty (strange) for his comedy. And has his film director affected? "Hedwig and the Angry Inch", for example, would be different if "You Without Nothing Still" does not exist.
