Rating is only 5, it's a movie that can be used by the actor and director (or at least music!). However, due to Walt Whitman's accomplishments, he deserves 10. A previous poster is called a movie, but I think it's not easy to see the tree forest. The filmmakers wanted to have this story more than being a brilliant Hollywood movie. And to this end, I applaud, it does not prevail, which also reflects on Whitman. This movie is more documentary than for interpretation. Being fascinated with such stories, when you hear very little about these types of stories that shape today's mental health, it's the most important thing. I found a pleasant look at history.
