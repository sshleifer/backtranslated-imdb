I love this movie. He works well and has good cinematography. The story combines action, humor, mysticism and tenderness with excellent sets and beautiful locations. View, buy, show your friends. <br /> <br /> The effect is good and Murphy, especially, makes a beautiful work that is reluctant / difficult to portray the hero. I have enjoyed all the characters and have found very interesting and well developed dynamic interactions. <br /> <br /> What happened to me and what was happening to me was a good prediction (earning good men, getting the hero). The surprisingly attractive girl and the holy child save lives - who does not see that coming?), I was still glad when everything was over, at last. Thanks to God, the dignity of this film never deteriorated. Pick up popcorn, pick up the couch and watch this fascinating, fascinating and entertaining movie.
