The film has been very good in all areas. The performance was superb from all the characters, especially Ms.Stone and Morissey. Tramellen turns the characters intelligently and psychologically for a moment. Although it is interesting in the plot, this film has to be more intelligent among the main characters and how to continue writing with new and crunchy new features. The setting was also wonderful and the whole atmosphere of the film was like mysterious, master thriller. Go now, watch the movie, which is better than the viewer's achievement, because it deceived the horrible, terrifying opinions about the film (Even if you started it before) ... you will not regret it, if you would see it ...
