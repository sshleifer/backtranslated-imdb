Okay, before reviewing, I have to ask: why not list it individually? It may be just an Italian television series, but Lamberto Bava is for his international fans for his FILM. This American movie is distributed on VHS and DVD with "The Ogre" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know that there is no "demon" that is unrelated to the cast team and the crew. But yes, I was very pleased, I found it so useful in this site. <br /> <br /> Finally, review "Ogre". I saw the trailer on YouTube several times and, in fact, it seemed terrifying to me. The film itself (it's a long length and therefore a movie that turns it on) has many parts and it scares a lot. My latest affirmation worried me, but overall I did not regret buying a DVD (available at Shriek Show). The movie is the origin of television in the last action. I will not give disaster. <br /> <br /> Land is well-known: an American horror writer makes an enormous castle to find only his husband and son, which resembles the setting for childhood nightmares. There are shades of "Shining", but a supernatural horror brand is different. The woman (Virginia Bryant) finds more and more evidence that the nightmare is a real place, but her husband does not believe it. They keep upset and fear. <br /> <br /> Nightmares were awesome. The effect of the Ogre kokon was good, and reminded me of the resurrection of the first "Hellraiser" of Uncle Frank. In addition, there are good touches and a good underwater scene. I think that the movie never imitated American films with similar concepts, imitating "A Nightmare on Elm Street". "Ogre" is the original. And the monster itself was terrifying when it was properly presented. <br /> <br /> Shriek Show DVD is an interview with Lamberto Bava, where it should be mentioned with great care that it is not part of its classic "Demon serie". He also gives a lot of credit to the real castle that filmed the film. In fact, the movie helps a lot. Simon Boswell also helps music. <br /> <br /> Here are some good things. "Ogre" is not perfect, but it's worth seeing. Take Lamberto Bava for less achievement.
