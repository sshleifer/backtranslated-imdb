Where the sidewalks that end up in black and white crime is a pretty good drama and shot in black and white and in the spot. <br /> <br /> Kobre murders an assassination and protects himself. Many people who have done a lot of crime in the past do not like someone else's guilt. But eventually he has created the owner, but he did not know that he had killed a woman who had fallen in love before ... <br /> <br /> Andrews was dumped (while the city slept) . Demon of the Curse), Gene Tierney (Laura, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir), Gary Merrill (Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (The Streets of San Francisco, Beyond Posidon Adventure) and Craig Stevens (The Deadly Mantis). Good parts for all <br /> <br /> Where the pavement ends it deserves to know the opportunity it deserves. Excellent. Rating: 3 stars out of 3 stars.
