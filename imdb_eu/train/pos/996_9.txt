This movie shocked me. Some things were "topical" and some technology elements reminded me of the movie "State enemy" with Will Smith. But, above all, it's really fun, well with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps comedy and Julio and Ramundo 2 teddy bears (featuring some comical reliefs). This is a movie you can see again-say ... Wednesday night is something else. I gave the entertainment value 9.
