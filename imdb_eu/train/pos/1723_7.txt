Excellent P.O. adventure, inspired by real events adapted by Eric Williams in his book (part of my father's library). Could it be the first movie of its kind and, therefore, a lot to answer? Not just albert low-lipped for example, for example, ALBERT, R.N. (1953; I'll see today), THE COLDITZ STORY (1955) and DANGER WITHIN (1959), but the other side of the Atlantic, STALAG 17 (1953) and THE GREAT ESCAPE (1963). That's why it is firmly grounded: a british soldier embedded in a German camp creates an incredible plan of escape, borrowing a page from the Greek legend? The dirt used by a bargain by physical exercise and the sight of their captives! Actually, the film is divided into two parts: the slow process that drills the first tunnel is analyzed, after the end of exhaustion, when the final stages of the fortunes that come out of the camp reach the Swedish neutral. In some of these British film, cast stars stars (Leo Genn), current (Anthony Steel) and up-and-coming (Peter Finch, David Tomlinson, and Bill Travers) stars, including Anthony Dawson, to say anything , Bryan Forbes, Michael Goodliffe and Walter Gotell). Three refugees are Genn, Steel and Tomlinson: the first two stick together, the latter goes its way? to meet security with others. As it can be expected, the narrative is full of excitement and enthusiasm; men's centered P.O.W. The sagas also keep the minimum number of women interested. Did Lee not have a long career? and something similar (but changing the setting and vision) A TOWN LIKE ALICE (1956) his most outstanding achievements? In this case, definitely, he said that every strange situation (even though it is reported that filming left no postponed position, Ian Dalrymple waited for the loose leftovers!). However, it is a special mention for excellent lighting (especially in the night sequences).
