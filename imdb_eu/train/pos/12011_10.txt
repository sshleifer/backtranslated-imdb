I was surprised at the negative comments that I read and I can not suppose that people with comments are less than honest. This is the real and real portrait of Joseph Smith's ever seen. It was a good time I forgot to look at the movie. From Joseph's pain, he prayed well and kept the faith in the people and God and sacrificed his sacrifice to life in silence. Any Christian religion, if you can watch the movie without touching it in a positive way, I should say that it is an individual's reflection rather than a movie. I give the movie "10" and I encourage the souls to see him. It is a portrayal he gave at least to a very credible person, when he believed ... In a world of values ​​and beliefs in a hilarious world, this movie is recalled as a supposed recollection, it does not matter what religious beliefs are .- Ann Pruitt-
