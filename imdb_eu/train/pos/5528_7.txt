It is a very beautiful and almost meditative film - there is hardly any conversation, apart from the narration; and landscapes and music have been fulfilled. Initially, I did not connect a red fox girl or fox with a friend (even with red hair!) They told me that it's almost a kind of old-fashioned movie for kids, which kids prefer today. Animations like Shrek or Toy Story ... but I think that the beauty and wonders of young people in nature will undoubtedly be included. It may not be such a great movie, but it's definitely a great and relaxing look at all ages - not just for children.
