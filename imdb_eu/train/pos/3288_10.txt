This is a fantastic fantastic fantasy movie. One of my favorites is so green. The director is Bernard Rose and directs Candyman. He made a big radio with this movie. Anna begins a movie about a girl who plays a glandular fever that celebrates her 11th birthday. A house draws paper from its library and enters into a dream home. Then each subsequent dream has changed with the presence of the person who adds to the image. In the third dream he knows a boy who thought of Mark. He makes friends with him and the relationship between them becomes stronger, the dreams become darker and terrifying. Charlotte Burke is a great actress with Anna Burle, and it is very strange that after a single movie, he must never disappear or ever disappear. never have anything He really plays a great part in this movie. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer's score also works. Broken Arrow is a fantasy and mysterious music. It's really shameful that the soundtrack is no longer available on the CD. Only the DVD R2 is available.
