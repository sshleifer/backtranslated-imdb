I admit that Oliver did not like it! As a young child - it's long, and the story moves a bit slowly due to music numbers. As a teenager, I found the experience of this movie the same experience. Unlike Oliver Twist's thinking as an adaptation, think of it as a celebration of the classic story. The adjustments are the best, but if you're really musical, there's no story. <br /> <br /> It is the core of this music movie, and most of them. narrow star and very hard. Throw or everyone participated in the stage of the music scene, and it shows in their shows and I think this increase. The plays are more "more" style of theatrical films, and they are very entertaining. The exception is Oliver who plays the baby, which means he feels beautiful. Real plays is a good way to go. <br /> <br /> Fagin and Dodger are the main characters of this film. Oliver Reed also has a wonderful job, keeping Bill Skyy as a threatening screen. Even though Sykes's Bullseye makes a good performance. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. Those who hate musics will scorn off the music they take seriously. Abandoning overwhelming historical history of faulty data, making it an overwhelming way of acting, anyone will enjoy it. Just sit back and enjoy the entertainment - it's much better if you remember, as music, that the book is around forbidden to be fantasy, not sharp adaptations.
