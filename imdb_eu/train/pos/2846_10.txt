I'm not a writer or a critic ... I'm just a student who has watched this movie a few minutes ago ... And I want to thank the people who worked for the movie! It's not the best or most ... but my heart touched ... why would I want to understand it ... it's easy and affordable ... it's a bad day for you, a movie that will feel wasting time watching! She is in love and care, about our life, but sometimes we lose material things ... We have all lost our time, but we have lost. ... why do we do that? "We need to be alive, we were dying ... watch the second and remember: if we do good things, the good thing goes back to us! And it has a special taste in New York ... I love the people and the world !!!! Thank you for the movie and I feel my faults (English is my second language) ...
