Stylishly addressed, picturesquely photographed and played brilliantly? Crosby's interpretation seems to be OK, Hardwicke has his best performance ever, while Bendix is ​​so pleasing to it? Yankee's appeal is universal and unknown. As expected, Bing has a fine voice. And despite Hardee's solitaire cut, we can still hear Crosby and Bendix, with his famous business, dancing with the joy of "Busy Doing Nothing". Although Rhonda Fleming, as a singer, had a great career in stage and concert, he rarely heard the chance to listen to the movie. She has a beautiful voice in more than one accordion, and it is very evident in Mary Kay Dodson's outfits. <br /> <br /> Tay Garnett leads his wonderful budget, using all. Resources to show each scene that is displayed in the most efficient way possible. (Perhaps the eclipse is quite annoyed, but who complains?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In short, as the trailer really describes, delight delight from start to finish.
