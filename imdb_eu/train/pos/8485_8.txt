Gung Ho tries to express many ideas and at the same time tries to entertain himself with a learned comedy. The result is different, but overall entertaining. Keaton strongly balances three aspects of his main character. Wantabedde is even better. One warning: George Wendt is very poor in his role. Otherwise, it's a pretty nice capsule time.
