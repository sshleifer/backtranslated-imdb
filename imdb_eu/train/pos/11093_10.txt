The movie "small" is excellent. "Little," I do not know how to shoot hundreds of guns or dozens of explosions, just like John Woo. Roy Scheider and three "bad" shows. John Frankenheimer seems to be luckier with today's small productions. The movie is very easy to see; The story is more than one washing machine. As it all goes around and around, things seem worse, as the plot thickens. The end is wonderful, very positive. I have never read Elmore Leonard's book, but it can not be similar to the movie, because I feel like I see a movie by Elmore Leonard.
