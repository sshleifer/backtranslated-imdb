As a lover of bad movies, I'm definitely knocking. The plot is not really bad, but in some cases you need to ask yourself "what's going on here?" <br /> <br /> This is much fun. bad movie ever First and foremost, Rudy Ray Moore was so loud and slower when filming this film, so that special effects could be a bit of time to accelerate the battle scenes. There is also a slow staging on the scene, leaping over the 10-meter wall (playing back falling), naked men, pulling out of giant letters and going down the roof with sex. The cable that holds the rope holds the fire. <br /> <br /> Of course, Rudy Ray Moore would not complete a totally free and random comedy club scene where Rudy is fun with all the people, along with people. make odd dance There are so many bad things about this movie, but they're fun, they're bad, and if you're taking off the pelt eyes, you can miss another mistake. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10 true value, cheese factor 10/10, picking up mistakes and goofs 10/10, average 10/10.
