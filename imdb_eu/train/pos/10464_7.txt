For all those who do not speak Swedish: the original title of this movie; "RÃ¥narna" is reflected in the line "The Robbers". The fact is that it is the main problem with that movie, because it is not about robbers. She is a young woman who works for Swedish police who investigates robbers. At the table he could think of an ordinary job, but that girl is soon putting on the field in her hands, just like in the story, as well as shooting some robbers ... Exactly: we've seen before. Although it is quite interesting through the plot, it is not very helpful at the end of the day as it is a topic as the first of the films. <br /> <br /> What keeps it just another than the main stream. The film is masterfully executed in every way, as brilliant as the actors are not perfect and the director is really exciting to keep up the thrilling excitement, as it is the majority of the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Nice touch! Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish filmmakers who is reasonably inappropriately punished, knowing that he is not the hero's boyfriend and he's a character in the background. you have to forget it. <br /> <br /> Everything is a fun movie that steals more money on the plot. 7/10
