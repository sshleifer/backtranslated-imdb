I do not know why they always want people in deeper senses in films, or they do not say otherwise. <br /> <br /> How are you doing? Something that Morgan Freeman has most obvious. It has a bit of a chance to show. Paz Vega, his co-star, drives his career and Brad Silberling has got a name for people to watch his movie. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. Humor, some pathos, some sweet sweets, but more than anything else. I got a special shot at Jim Parsons as a reception from the construction company. Freeman looks at her adoringly and says, "I want to be a woman." It's horny Mrs. Vega, the husband and his girlfriend, is a great battle scene too. <br /> <br /> In short, a nice and charming movie is what makes you smile. You can do it a lot worse.
