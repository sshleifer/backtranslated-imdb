I think Barbara Stanwyck should have the best performances. They were just a few actors, even now, to say more than just a single look at the whole interview page. And I was lucky to see the original and censored movie, with 4 minutes of additional footage. Very bad movie is so short. Lily is hardly a young woman working together in her father, in her illegal conversation. Whatever his connection, Chico, his good friend, Theresa Harris surprisedly. He is a African American boy (although a white woman with black women in the 30s is as controversial as the film's issues), and Lily is not a special link. And it's not sexual. Only 2 women are stuck or thrown, a situation beyond their control. After Lily's father dies and does not know what he will do, he is said to be able to get out and get what he wants. Yes, it's immoral, but that's the whole point of this movie. Then they "went" and spoiled the last minute. So until the last minutes of the movie, it's an excellent movie and it's worth watching. The "lesson" of the film is still still valid, at that time, and I'm sure it will be 100 years now. Woman, it's horrible for Lily to get what she wants, but it works. Men, notice yourself.
