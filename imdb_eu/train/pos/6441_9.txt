As in heaven (SPOILER WARNING) <br /> <br /> This is the human drama that triggered my emotions and imagination. <br /> <br /> This is a parable that reviews Christ's life and death. Daniel is an exquisite musician who is physically and mentally exhausted in his career and has to give up. When he joined the choir of the church as his singer, he brought a transformation in the life of the Christians, as Jesus did to the Palestinian society of the first century. They laugh, they start talking clearly, they are subject to their mistakes, they accept each other, love each other, and become a fundamental community. Young people with mental disabilities (? Tore) are included. Forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Pastoralists, Stig enjoyed the rule of authority over the congregation, imposing a frustrated morality and gradually excluding the Chancellors. If Stigek sends Daniel out there is a rebellion and Stig breaks down. Stig says that the Jewish rulers of the day of Jesus, in accordance with the dependence of the Jewish law, contrasted Jesus with the vivid contrast with the "golden rule" made by Jesus. <br /> <br /> In a dramatic scene. Someone says "the church invented sin". Throughout the film, there is a contrast between morality and living life. <br /> <br /> Following on from the story of Christ, Daniel Conny kills him, when he strikes it, it is overwhelmed. on the river Next scene, we can hardly believe in Daniel (resurrected!) The body in his room (tomb) covered with linen in a white sheet (nose!), Three women (three women remained at the bottom of the cross. <br /> <br /> Daniel Lena approaches her, a beautiful young woman with a beautiful beloved man (when Jesus is confused) (Jesus was closely related to Mary Magdalene) Lena, probably a high-ranking prostitute.) Through Lena, Daniel learns to love, something he likes and now he does. <br /> <br /> Gabriella, solo written by Daniel, is living for life, in the face of moral justice. Concern about sin and reason and wrong. <br /> <br /> The last scene chooses the choir in harmony and sings, like the mantra, which draws on the great audience, for example, the connection between our true fate and the harmony.
