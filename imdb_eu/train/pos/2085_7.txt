The classic "The Good Earth" of Sidney Franklin has achieved a timeless story and great performance, especially when Luis Ranier got his portrait of O-Lan. Rainers' performance is very complete, it's almost unknown. Throughout the film, there is little talk (long), Rainer focuses on facial and body language. She looks like China and talks as if it were unknown to anyone unknown to her work. <br /> <br /> The film continues to be important today, because it examines the story of wealth and its universal themes. . Lung and wife O-Lan eventually succeeded in achieving financial success after years of hunger and poverty, they found a life full of property, but lacking sense. When they return to the ground, they only get back on the rolling of crusts (when they see the special effects used to create them tremendously and beautifully). A classic movie with a special view of a Chinese family (especially in 1937). Money is not worth anything without family and friends, the film guides you perfectly at home, due to your emotional fulfillment in the last 10 minutes.
