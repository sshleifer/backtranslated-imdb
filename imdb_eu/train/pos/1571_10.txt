Since I saw Spongebob SquarePants more on the TV cartoon. The colors are excellent, the voices can not be better, the characters are so original, cartoons are great. Hope Nickolodean continues to develop this drawing. Hopefully the season's DVD will appear soon! I love such cartoons and I expect more people to watch this cartoon. It's hard to find a seasonal DVD, so if someone finds it in a retail store, let me know Know. The only available Catscratch sale in Nick Shop is an excellent look, but very expensive! If you love Spongebob; and who does not You also love Catscratch!
