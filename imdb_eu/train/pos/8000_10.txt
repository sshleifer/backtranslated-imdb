... do not read the extracts of the plot because the plots appear to be vain because they are headless and absurd. The movie is great, both Denzel and Dakota play (the sky will rise, for me trustingly), and it comes out of the plot. Really "wonderful" is a small word for talented actors. The film focuses on real events and some characters are not fictional. In fact, the accident and the successor of the film adds to the accident. You have liked a lot of actors and movies, you still have not seen your favorite ... Believe, in the end you will be curious and understandable. The movie is wonderful, watch, rent, buy or just ... just miss it
