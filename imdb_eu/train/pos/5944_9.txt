First of all, I say this: ... Why, why, can not WB shorts make the director? Sandy's director is obviously worth the WB and DC credits. Anyway, I think that a man with a $ 12,000 budget might cause a superhero fan. The World's Finest I ever saw is one of the best shorts, Trailer or not. <br /> <br /> I think it was a great choice for Superman to choose a Bodybuilder (Mike O'Hearn). Let's see people, Superman is not a super model. It can be beautiful, but it's not a GQ Stud. And I do not know what kind of maid was a comment on me, but Superman is really bad (have you really read a Superman comic?). Actually, just in my opinion ... Indeed, this seems to be so obvious, that someone who plays a muscle mass plays a Superhero, rather than a pretty face. For Batman the same thing, Bartram looks simple and Batman is superb ... I do not know boys ... If he gives a bigger budget and his movie ... Bale and Bartram I think it would be the neck and neck. . Bottom Line: Super-Hero is just a few films, with actors who watch a part. <br /> <br /> The theater is also quite enjoyable. I do not know what he's talking about, O'Hearn is not bad. It's as compelling as Superman and Bartram ... Well, it's Batman. I mean, come people, this movie had a budget of $ 12,000, what would you expect? All others are excellent, except for both faces, it seems to be a bit more common than usual ... But we only refer to Tommy-Lee Jones. Oh, Lois is too hot. <br /> <br /> SFX will also appear "sweet". I mean, Superman to see the lifting of the car ... MAN! What is it? In the Grayson "Tank" scene, I would have to put more than that, because Mike really flies and easily. Flying sequences left something they wanted, but again, with a bigger budget ... Oh, and even he used a Batmobile (probably a Model, but he was damned with conviction). <br /> <br /> Alongside this, the trailer has failed a serious budget. And the WB refuses to acknowledge that Collora is a credible director, and needs to abandon a certain project ... But not, as most of Marvel's projects, these directors will hardly ever take it into account. For lovers and caregivers, and continue to bet on these movies. Thank you God was the success he returned to Superman, or that was a serious result. World's Finest is superb, and in my book, Superhero is a movie.
