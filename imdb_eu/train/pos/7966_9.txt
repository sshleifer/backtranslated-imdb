As a child, I thought it was a great movie. He had animals, he was beautiful, and he was my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still love this movie for various reasons. It has well-trained animals that include stunts and scenes that look like a great camera. It is a beautiful and well-written music that adapts to the scene, which is the main theme that makes melodies and quick melodies and a heart. When people smoke. And my favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> According to a book, it is a story about three pet homes, a smart, intelligent, well-beloved, intelligent, but intelligent laboratory called Shadow. The fear of water called Sassy and the surprisingly curious and curious neurotic street in the bulldog, Chance. Three friends carry them to a farm, when their family disappears. Disappeared and worried, to break pets and plan a trip through Sierra Mountain to make their life a trip. The trip is truly incredible. So what, perhaps, is at home on that mountain. But what's up <br /> <br /> I recommend Homeward Bound to people who love amazing starring to three amazing actors, and others ... yes, everyone is watching.
