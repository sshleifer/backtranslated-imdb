Flamenco is as passionate, dramatic and exciting as the flamenco, the movie is amazing. It is based on the immortal life music. Original music writes and plays one of the greatest classical guitar, the main promoter of Modern Flamenco, who plays the same name by Paco de Lucia. The legendary flamenco and choreographer, Antonio Gades, wrote the script and choreographed the wonderful version of the famous Georges Bizet / Prosper Mérimée novella / opera. Antonio is the star of the famous dancer / choreographer and captures Carmen's story, flamenco style, dancing songs, and manual applause, and has a high level of dynamics. /> <br /> The magnificent and elegant Cristina Hoyos, whose technical excellence matches the elegant work of dance. Hoyos was the foremost dancer of Gades (1968-1988) and Carlos Saura was the star of three films in Gades, "Bodas de Sangre" (1978), "Carmen" (Carmen) 1983, and "El Amor Brujo "(1985). Laura del Sol, is a young dancer named Carmen. Antony first visits another Carmen, two French composers, that is, the most famous novel by Prosper Mérimée in 1846, the most famous novel by George Bizet, the most famous novel Opéra-Comique. 1875 version. <br /> <br /> Opera and novella, Carmenen Sauren's film is desirable and deadly, that is, the last femme fatale that must be free from anywhere else. He could not accept the possessive love of any man and would prefer to die. The adaptations of the story and opera eighty movies on the screen, and as different as they are, all share a tragic potential in common. Saura / Gades' unique movie is sensual and genuine Spanish. More than ten years ago I fell in love with him and nowadays he is beautiful and beautiful. Highly recommended
