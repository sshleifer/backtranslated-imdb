When I saw a great movie. You have to say one of the favorite movies of all time. I watched 8 times in the theater and I got the DVD. When I was old I saw the movie again as an average. Compared to films that know the good comedy, this is nothing. I mean, the change in the Rock's most hilarious movies and all the breeds things breaks down the huge barriers that are taking place. Likewise, thinking about how the movie is thinking goes. It's like a movie's thinking, but a little touch. I like the movie I generally gave it ... <br /> <br /> I'm still good 7/10 for me.
