Film Noir's story is very easy, it is a great story, very well preserved, thanks to Otto Preminger's superb performance and great performances. Dana Andrews often has a cold head detector who often uses his fists instead of his fists. After gradually beginning the movie, Andrews will repress and warn that if it continues, it will remain in force. A little later, a suspect attacked a crime he is investigating and Andrews is forced to protect himself. This time he does not use excessive force, but the attacker dies. Andrews is terrified and believes he does not believe, trying to cover death. Instead, an innocent man is ultimately accused of the crime. <br /> <br /> There is a lot more in the movie than this ... - A plot of love surrounding the earthquake (Gary Merrill) and Andrews (Gene Tierney). In short, this is one of the best examples of the genre: wonderful dialogue, excellent clarity and a simple but very effective story. That's how Noir was.
