One day I stumbled on television. There was no channel in the middle of the day to show good films. This, however, was good. <br /> <br /> Now Sky tells the story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by Sputnick, to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends begin to build rockets. Father is not happy to find out about his children's hobby and prefer to become a charcoal as their own or go to college as a soccer-like footballer. <br /> <br /> The story is well written. . You may have planned it, but there are not too many pieces of the story focusing on. It is important, but, of course, it is an internal action that focuses on character interaction. It's a good story. He has a number of topics, but he is well. Depending on the current event, you can not drop these threads. The characters are very good. When the story is downhill, the characters are brought up and the film's quality is high. You get to know these characters and get sympathy for them. They are well written and credible. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie. The sets and the 50's style are deep and the images are well-formed and well-lit. This is a very good movie environment. <br /> <br /> Efficiency is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal has performed a great performance as good as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper John Hickam. The rest are as good as cast. All together, this is a pretty strong cast. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I caught this movie. For the first time I saw, I learned that it was in real events. Seeing that, it might be more interesting. October Sky is an interesting movie. It's a movie that everyone can enjoy. The movie is sensitive. It's not a bad thing!
