William Hurt is no longer an American idol, but he still has a good taste on B-movie projects. Here he is a specialist in the cleaning of hazardous wastes, following the tragic past, playing Weller's pretty boy with deadly appetite. Hardy Kruger Jr. is a pretty young boy, who is more beautiful than his father, as Weller's leader in the production of a chemical plant that moves the story. Natasha McElhone is a somewhat harsh government agent, looking at Hurt for a stunning story that is inevitable for the heroic love. Michael Brandon plays a prisoner who does not come out below. Coca-Cola won the 2000 Product Placement award as a beverage throughout its production, which was located in a Hungarian winter postcard image.
