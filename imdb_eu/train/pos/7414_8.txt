It was a very nice movie. A humorous but poisonous look at the family and the obligations that it entails. A story about a man who comes home from home in the Chinese village from his father's bath home to a small Chinese town. She learns there, thanking her for getting out of her home. The film is as beautifully visual as it is emotionally beautiful.
