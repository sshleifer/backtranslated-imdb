I talked and I was angry when I saw this - GRAY GARDENS is a very fun and compelling section of the surrealist - it's not a documentary, this is really Fellini or David Lynch gives us money at weirdsville raffles. These women (who show themselves clinically more than eccentric) revealed to me in the most surprising ways of their humanity, and I ask that my life from the world exceeds something that is blue-and-blue.

This could be a dangerous film that is ever exploited, that is to say, because all Edies will not go, as they do, in crashing wastes, such as cats that urinate. bed, racoons from the holes in the walls, and the last scene seemed to me very sad. As the child's birthday party was seriously wrong. It is worth seeing and looking for a moment - you will never forget it, but it is very disturbing.
