Actually, Goldie Hawn is from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I'm digressing it. That is, Mr. Smith went to Washington with the kind of film, some changes but the same premise. My Goldie Hawn I had a great deal of rejection of the movie I took one year ago. The story is interesting, but it is very difficult for a cocktail server to get an important government job, because it saved a great shot. He laughed at me and at the same time maddened me. She laughed at me, because some of the circumstances she found herself were so hilarious, I had to laugh. (SPOILER POSSIBLE AHEAD). It was my fault to think that our government would create an average citizen as he thought. And at the end he spoke ... beautiful. Bad, many people do not like this in real life.
