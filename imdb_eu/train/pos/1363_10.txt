An excellent 90s movie! Parker Posey is a great story about Manhattan's nightly night so much money. Posey gives great performance to librarian and night-time browsers. On Saturday night the movie is good and clear before coming out. Soundtrack rocks, outfits are out of this world, the script is fun and the actors perform brilliantly. Value of salerosis: You can do this in the world, if you try, find your niche. I think that Parker Posey is a perfect actor for this kind of character: young, wonderful and broken. (You have to search for "Clockwatchers" movie). If you see the Party Girl, you have to spend a good time. Enjoy!
