Wind Way Blows Tom Barmans (the first person in the rock form 'dEUS') is a debut film. Completely shot in Antwerpen (Belgium), on sunny movies, it starts on Friday and surpasses the surface of the events that take place on twelve days. When you finish the movie, you have to think a lot, since most of the stories are open. <br /> <br /> The movie is a soundtrack (pure instrument). socks In most scenes, music really improves the overall atmosphere and feelings, actually watching movies at certain times. The main scene of the film, the party, is very well shot. <br /> <br /> The director did not hesitate to use video clips, while his main characters are dancing in one of the best soundtracks. lately heard <br /> <br /> The script is an excellent thing. Camera angles and colors are very well chosen. 'Costumes' are very hot and they are also very 'in the seventies'. And I loved (most) acting. <br /> <br /> The humor that mixes things, humor, absurdity, surrealism, dryness or very cynical about the movie. <br /> </ p> <p> Being a comedy (this movie is definitely a comedy, but not an alternative artist), it is still a horrible rumor amongst the audience and sometimes laughed. <br /> <br /> A premiere of directors should be no longer an end. In the future I hope to see more films by Tom Barman, I had fun. Cheers
