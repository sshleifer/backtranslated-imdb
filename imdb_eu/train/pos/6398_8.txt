The "Inspirational" stories about "the human spirit" tend to be for me. The most amazing thing in MEN OF HONOR was how much I liked. Previewing the movie as it does, but it works. There are many great performances given by both credits. Goodbye of Cuba is the perfect role for Jr., which is unlimited here. De Nir√∫ is expected to be a lot, and it does not disappoint. Creates a dark and funny portrait. George Tillman, Jr. The director wanted to make an old movie and he will come with a winner.
