Credible and innovative! In the beginning of Whoopi Goldberg's badly underrated film, writers draw the parallelism between Theodore Rex and "Citizen Kane" classic Orson Welles in 1941. Writers are justified to draw parallels of different looks, but audience advertising is often hypnotized to see the smooth similarities between these two schlock Hollywood movies. In the book "Citizen Kane", Charles Foster Kane is terrifying and admires his colleagues and their roots, as in Whoopi Goldberg's theater. This movie is in every love. The fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in the society of greed and acceptance. Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex partnered at the same time as Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy, and Hall and Oates were justifiable comparisons. If you want to see an impressive philosophical analysis of some of the deepest humanity units; Bergman-esqe but not so depressing, Theodore Rex must be seen immediately!
