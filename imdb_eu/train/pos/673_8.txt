In view of the great part we are hearing, we still do not know about what the eldest tribe we have had. In each case, it is about the dangers of knowing much more. On the other hand, there are others who warn us that it is an "end time". The original origin of "The Last Wave" has died, without apparent reason. When the detainees are detained, they are silent, they mix things in order. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays a Defender Attorney against the accused. Although the prophetic images of his childhood were crazy, Chris Lee (David Gulpilil) was told by modern signals that he was originally well-known, Burton begins to defend the sin of Tribal Law and, therefore, does not depend on standard justice. The film is full of overwhelming apocalyptic disaster catastrophes and dark images and warns of future tsunami and hell islands. Black drama and deep rituals are a great horrors for this film and, therefore, it is not for the sake of heart; In fact, the most amazing appearances can last for many years in innocent movies nightmares. Good silent drama ****
