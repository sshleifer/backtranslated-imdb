When I saw this movie, I was amazed that it was a great movie. That is, the only movie that would give me a star rating of 10 stars. I'm sure this movie will always be in fifth place. <br /> <br /> The effect is excellent. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are the best. I do not think anybody can have a better job than Kate. <br /> <br /> If there is a rainy day and you can not decide what to rent, yes, that is. You will love all the plays, special effects and much more. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, rent or buy! You will not regret it. <br /> <br />
