The only reason I saw this movie was Jimmy Fallon, the first year since its 9th grade SNL. I'm a fan of the Yankees fan and I have not found the movie until the last 15 minutes, when the clips of the ALCS games began to appear. I had to cover my ears and make small noise, I should hear everything I did not hear, but it was otherwise portable. <br /> <br /> I thought Jimmy played very well. He supposedly had nervous and curious characters. I know it might not be a stretch for an Oscar, but the movie is just a light, entertaining and romantic comedy that is suitable for women and men. <br /> <br /> Jimmy and Drew worked. well together, and much better chemical camera than other actors in the past. (In a stupid movie by Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie? What?) I think that Jimmy has a positive career and wants to thank him because he can kill Taxi. I think Fever Pitch could help a lot. Everyone has to leave the actor's ability to be very critical before starting to film. I think it must be difficult, and if you look at one of our other great actresses of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.), you'll see that some of the flops have begun. Busom Buddies? Australian soap opera? Here's Jimmy's route on the screen. I never wanted to leave SNL, but what could you do?
