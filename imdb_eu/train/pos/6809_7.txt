This movie was pretty good. I'm not sure if this is a spoiler comment, but I do not want to take a chance. However, until the end of the film, the prosecutor reads a book and then mentions another from his memory. I can not remember the first episode that reads, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. Genesis 9:12 says, but really refers to the verse 6. This is a passage that many use to pass the essential penalty of passage. It's very bad for the prosecutor not to dare to mention the Bible. Has John Jay ever heard the justice of the Supreme Court in the history of the country? The Bible said it was the best of all books. We have lost this bad disease in America.
