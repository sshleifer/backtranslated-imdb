This movie was pleasant to me. It is a moving and centering approach, which has never been distracted. It's never been a movie I've heard, but if you want to sleep, that's it. Excellent writing, production and theater. It is advisable to have something thoughtful for the audience. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are wonderful. Why was not this film anymore?
