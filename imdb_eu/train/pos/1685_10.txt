The first film was seen in 1990 and he laughed completely. My friend's circle became a favorite cult, from which we would mention the drop of a hat ("I'll go home in the purse!"). Needless to say, humor is still there, 15 years later. Halloween has become a tradition for my new friend to show on this movie (you can still buy Ebay!) Halloween candy has tasted much better with a language that is cultivated in your tongue cheeks ... and this film includes pathos, suspense, untrustworthy love, noble and gives up the list continues. Royal Dane offers an amazing performance at Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember, "I saw Dr. 7 on the faces of Lao," I saw that he was a bad mother. Here, you feel the old man from the beginning. <br /> <br /> If you are not careful, you will think of the humor of this movie. The creators were subtle in many ways with comments, creating small subtle drawings in other science fiction films as well as a scene from Wile E. Coyote's pages! <br /> <br /> Do not give too much of a lot of thought-provoking process to study a movie, people-without having to have a fun rate with nitpicking, and it would not be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid, but they're not mocked ...) . <br /> <br /> -I'm sorry to say nothing, I'll take a Zag-nut 'bar. <br /> <br /> -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, Karaoke DJ / animator
