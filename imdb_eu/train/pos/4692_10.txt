Although critically qualified, Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies ever seen. It is a must-see to be the movie; It's a bit fun and it's not paying attention. For example, watch Michael Keaton use the price guns in the masks store ... and even in the documentary style that appears at the beginning of the scenes. Humor is one of those curiously unexpected thoughts, though you know it's a comedy. Amy Heckerling, the director, is very sharp here. If you know the best movies (Fast Times Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacation, etc.), you should give it a look. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton is very fond of the title role and contributor (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle). Highly recommended
