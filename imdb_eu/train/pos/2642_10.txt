Actually, this is a "heart-warming" movie. He won the George Peobody Award, won "Roots", so the essence of this movie will tell you something. I can ask for this movie, since the old friend of Eugene Logan's internet is writing this film, she died a few years ago, so I no longer have the opportunity to get her information. . My children, my daughters, would like to see the movie, as well as sending wonderful grandmother to them. My eldest daughter was seven years old at the time I was broadcast to television and I could see it again. One of my friends said that his movie was a favorite. I do not remove the movie for you.
