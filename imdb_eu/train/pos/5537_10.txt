It might not have been good in general, but I still remember today's second episode, the first one, which was so memorable. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I'd recommend the races and mysteries of horses. <br /> <br /> Chico Barnes's cousin cockney, who is not close to listening to London's Bow, is much more fun. The bells, but they are attractive and the shows were interesting. <br /> <br /> Sid Halley Francis was one of the most interesting characters, and the show minimizes some difficulties with the hand. It is interesting that electronic commands used in stories appear to be less functional for the users, than those of the Second World War.
