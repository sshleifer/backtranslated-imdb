When I saw the movie at the beginning of the 70's, this movie was afraid. It was an amazing sight, and the events of the European and US campuses were linked to what could be said so well within 15 minutes of Antonioni: you remembered "tyrannical" establishments and big business interests. In the midst of a desert, the coup that is repeated in a beautiful house, which is enjoying nature full of cold, cold water, is painting a plane in a psychedelic plane (although recently British Airways a few years ago). People from advertising throughout the world copied images for decades. Pink Floyd expanded even more after the release of the fan movie. <br /> <br /> You see this film 30 years later and you wonder why this film has lost its appeal. Films currently available in the establishment have a greater substance - events, documentation, good performances and excellent screenplay. Antonioni seems obsolete; a mistake wrong. Today Antonion's "Blow Up" is also similar. Password passed <br /> <br /> "Zabriski Point" needs to be evaluated according to what needs to be released. It was a great movie if you saw it on the Panavision screen, in front of the small TV screens. The visual faces of the film (Mick Jagger, Kieth Richards, Pink Floyd et al.) Still remain. The lead couple were not great actors, but they were very cute and natural. One of them (Mark Frechette) died in prison in the US, in the film he personified compliance with the values ​​of reality. <br /> <br /> Today, Antonioni seems like "synchronization". But be careful and you will appreciate the sounds of regular mute actors - Rod Taylor, G. Spradling, the women in the pool, the air band police. On the contrary, real sounds are non-conformist. Antonioni was important for 30 years, but the current support can not be questioned. He knew what he was doing.
