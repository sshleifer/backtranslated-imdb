I went into this completely and I could not wait for each section. The act plays a thrilling emotion that has to be a lack of respect for the family, as well as its influence over the closest ones. The only problem we had in the family was that it was quickly explained to the end. We can not clearly hear what was said, and we do not know what Gary was part of? Why did Kyle call her and why did she go with her? After investing in a series of five hours, we deceived, for only five minutes for this purpose. I asked around and saw that none of my friends was the most wise. Very rare but maybe we lost something crucial ????
