In joking, I rented the other two Monkeys the other day, because I'm a fan of Bruce Willis and I've heard some things about the movie. Good and bad, but one of those films was on the second level, so I was worried. For a minute I felt that if it were one of those films to be seen several times. But last night I saw and I was really surprised that this film had everything: action, theater, science fiction, history, dark humor, and even a little love. All the actors made a great job, I give Bruce a lot of credit during the scene with a psychiatric car. He really got me But Brad Pitt, I'm surprised I did a great job. He did not do more than his character, it was crazy, and it just worked and it was very compelling. It was just a frightening story, but a very good and awake call. <br /> <br /> James Cole arrived in the future with a virus and killed 5 billion people and only 1% survived the population. Animals are now far more than human beings, but scientists have sent James since the 1990s (actually, telling him to send him to 96) to find out about the virus's information, including the new psychiatrist James, Dr. Kathryn Raily, and other illnesses from Jeffrey Goines, He tells them about the future, no one believes it, he will return to the future, but the scientists returned a year to the place where he was kidnapped by James, but he says more and he thinks they are trying to prevent the virus from happening anymore. < br /> <br /> 12 monkeys were incredible films, as I said, the story was so scary, it's just because we're far from being complicated, but the whole movie was great, cast, set, very big picture. There was a kind of feeling there, because if we do not hear one thing we lose our pride one day. What's wrong? and what's wrong? Who knows? But 12 Monkeys would highly recommend that you have a great movie if you have a good chance, I am sure you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10
