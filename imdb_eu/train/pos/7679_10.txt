According to my scientific school project, I chose to make human trafficking. After doing some research on the Internet, I found this DVD and I ordered it. I've finished watching and I'm still thinking. I can say "Wow." Holly is a wonderful story about the American man named Patric, a 12-year-old who tries to rescue her. The end allows you to breathe, and although it is not happy, it is very realistic. It's amazing and I recommend anyone! With Holly and Patric you really connect and break your heart for him and his own. I loved so much and now I want to know what will happen!
