I like the cheap and comfortable DVD Alfa Video. One day I bought this. The 50s science fiction movie is perfect. With all the non-scientific stuff, girls with little clothes and a lot of melodramas, it's a nice movie for those who value such things. And if you have enough "disruption of disbelief", you can really escape - not only from the shock of the psychotic head or the wardrobe, but ultimately with the "perfect body". . That's it. . . . what does mindf *** ing mean?
