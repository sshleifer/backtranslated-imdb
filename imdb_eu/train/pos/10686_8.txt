And Nicole Kidman is fanatic. I would like to read and listen to the Moscow phone book, perhaps, perhaps, while talking about this movie in Russian, maybe it was happening. <br /> <br /> There are four great principles, but the film itself is not the best images and the best scenes together. <br /> <br /> There is always a time to stop disbelief. While watching the movie, this asks the viewer too much. <br /> <br /> It could be very funny (that is, in some sections) or very scary (it's only one scene) but the director did not know where to go.
