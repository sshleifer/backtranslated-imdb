Although Kate Beckinsale is not as good as Gwyneth Paltrow Emma in this movie, I liked Gwyneth Paltrow's other Emma version. Both are good in different ways. Emma's Emma Beckinsale looks pretty interesting, almost. And I liked this movie, Harriet Smith, the woman who played it better ... she was more delicious and more sentimental. There are some things I like about the version of Gwyneth Paltrow, though, the most humorous one is more apparent.
