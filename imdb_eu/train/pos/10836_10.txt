I thought this movie was wonderful. He was ridiculous Espinal Tap reminded me a lot. This is a fan of any of the 70's. (I hope my friends and my friends are not like that for twenty years!) <br /> <br /> Bill Nighy gives an excellent performance to try to recover this old spirit <br /> <br> <br> <br> Perfectly adapted to the movie Stephen Rea It's trying to keep the movie together, but it's not. <br /> <br /> If you love music and have never been a group, definitely, this movie is for you. You will not regret watching this movie. I know not. My family has also found fun, and that's what she's saying.
