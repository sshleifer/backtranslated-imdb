I was too young when I first watched this movie. I saw it a second time ago about 7 years ago. My sister told me I should see. Now, the whole family memorizes it. We mention at least one day at least. I like this movie very much. I still laugh all the time. I'm sure, it's really annoying about really drinking millions. The whole point is that there is still a humanity that loses between those we see in the movie. And all that is ready to be loved. I really recommend anyone wanting to laugh at this movie. Many laughter It's wonderful, if it's a sweet and passionate movie, "Funny" will really change your mind. Look up with a group of friends or your family, and I promise that you will never talk again with Authurne lines. The next few years will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> My family is very difficult to find a movie that everyone likes. But I feel that this film approaches us. And I know they will do the same thing !!
