Hurry up with a dark and stormy night and prepare to have fun, angry and scared. A crunchy old plot about a ghost train that runs across the English solitary dead is not quite sure, but it's really fun. There are some wonderful similar topics like locals, but they do not know. But, above all, the comic movie Arthur Askey is a vehicle to showcase the brand-name of a children's style. Askey's humor is not very fashionable these days, but if you just clean it, it can be really fun. This is probably the best Askey movies.
