A quote from Martin Martin of Houston Martin (nicmart): "Refurbished DVD" for "Fine Film, but for TV" on April 8, 2002 - This is a charming and emotional film, and I bought the DVD "it has been changed to adapt your television" Columbia Tristar Chickens There is no excuse for not giving a movie in a wide format, as it deals with all the films that make Hollywood different from what it's used to producing such habits. " br /> <br /> What is (shameful!) embarrassment. However, there is another version. See here for details http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/kingofmasks.htm <br /> <br /> The great shows of two major actors (The King and Doggie) BTW.
