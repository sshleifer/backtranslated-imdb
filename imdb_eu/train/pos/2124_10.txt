It's a real classic movie in his story, performance and presentation of the film. Full feature films are Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart. He admired his real life, and liked Jimmy, and he was given the first plays, and he helped him more calmly in the play. Both "chemistry" always appeared, and so spectacular and pleasant. She was a beautiful young woman and so pleasing to her portraits of her personality. The story of both of these youngsters, and finally how they meet together is finally the charm, and magic entertainment. The other actors who also play heart-warming presentations give this wonderful story / movie. I give my heart to Mister Sullivan 10 years of excellent cinema at the Golden Cinema Classic, which has a unique appeal for all generations. Must see!
