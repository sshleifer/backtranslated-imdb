This show I saw the baby, and I loved it! When I saw Toonami ... I saw Sheesh, I'm so old! When I was 13 or 14 when I arrived ... But, nevertheless, I had a great plot of land, and I saw (and ADORED) Sailormoon is one of those boys and I really liked it. Animation was not the best ... Fun in some parts, in truth, and the voice acting was generous at the beginning, but it was a good watch and I found that I was sucking on a day. <br /> Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warriors is one of my favorites for a seasonal and classic one.
