This game is a bomb and the annual 007 game has to be one of the biggest hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought it was a good game, but then Nightfire came and it was better, but now there's a new kind of game about James Bond. This time it is a third-person shooter and there are more than 12 missions; Graphics of the game are out of this house. The big actors and actors in this game also have players like Pierce Bronsan, James Bond, William Dafoe, Nikolai Diavolo, and Judi Dench M. Pardon me if I write all wrong. This game would be the biggest game of James Bond. <br /> <br /> I give this 10/10
