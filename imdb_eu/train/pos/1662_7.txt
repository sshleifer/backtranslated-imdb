Artemisia can be a betrayal or genuine artistic license. <br /> <br /> Which one might it be? <br /> <br /> In documented history, Artemisia Gentileschi was under the watch and was still confirmed as coming, as Mary Garrard and Gloria. Steinem has confirmed her grooms. <br /> <br /> The film, under another torture, refused to accuse her lover / abusive. <br /> <br /> How can a movie be diverted so much from the history, Still telling you the human heart? <br /> <br /> The answer is not so difficult to find. The film, the directors and casts filled the great hole in the history of the history of the image. <br /> <br /> This concluded the difference in the disk. <br /> <br /> That way. _Both_ I found the record and movie to be compelling. <br /> <br /> In both films and (apparently) in history, Artemisia was a painter, before the rest. <br /> <br /> This vision, in a wonderful composition of the film, I really appreciate. <br /> <br /> I have rarely seen this movie that my eyes needed. <br /> <br /> David Broadhurst
