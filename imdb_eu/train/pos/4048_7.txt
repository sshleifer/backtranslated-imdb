Rohmer deviates from dramatic dramas that speaks of the difficulties of an aristocratic woman in the French revolution during the French classical portraits. It's more attractive around "La Anglaise ..." (apart from the story) Rohmer's wonderful aesthetics. Images are digitally decorated and they also seem baroque. Sometimes you can not really say to see a movie or a movie from the Louvre Musseum. Each shot is like an artwork. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ----------------- <br> /> <br /> - ------------ - <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> ------------ ----------
