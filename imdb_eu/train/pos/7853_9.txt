For animation hobbies, it is necessary, but also the general audience CAMERAMAN'S REVENGE, a very early "pixilation", the hard work of Wladyslaw Starewicz. Starewicz and his assistants manipulated insect figures to explain this story to Willis O'Brien, George Pal, Ray Harryhausen, and modern lawmakers' digital effects. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> CAMERAMAN'S REVENGE lasts for about 10 minutes but includes a lot of fun in the two beetles adventure that follows the story of love from home from a nightclub, hotel, cinema and eventually from a prison cell. There are two short dance dives (a frog and a dragonfly), a mix of beetles and txitxivol, and a large-scale donnybrook in the cinema room, and the projector ends up in the flames. When they were quite elaborate in 1912, when John Bray and Winsor MacCay also began, Walt Disney still started school! <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that what caused the change could be a story that tells the title of a silent film. With two video companies, I've seen two versions of this movie and the images are almost identical, although they have two different stories from two different titles. (And in the explanation, especially, someone tells the third story, somewhere else suggests that there is another version). Printed by the British Film Institute, which contains rhymes with titles, tells the story of two hidden brothers and sisters who are married. When this information was exchanged, he inherited his fortune at the end of his father. The other, a Russian form, facilitates the story of married beetles among culprits of infidelity. In the Russian version, Beetle visits her "Gay Dragonfly" nightclub; In English, brother Bill Beetle will play his wife's music. Personally, I prefer the correct - and spicier - Russian story; The BFI version tries to try a simple story, and some rhymes are modest. <br /> <br /> However, in any interpretation, CAMERAMAN'S REVENGE is a beautiful movie, and it would be great if the beetles, WITH A BIG FOOTPRINT.
