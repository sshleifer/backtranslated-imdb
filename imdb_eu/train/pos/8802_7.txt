This is a very interesting project. 11 leading international directors and each assigning 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a selected segment. Each summary explores the worldwide redirects of 9/11. Without using Spoil, Ken Loach's piece of the crown would be a treasure, and Mira Nair's short ("India" segment), based on a real story, is worth a long film. We also realize what was being watched, why Alejandro González Iñárritu is one of the best directors in the world today? It's just a medium-sized master, because it has a deep understanding of it. Unfortunately, not all 11 sections are done. Youssef Chahin, in his "Egypt" segment, believes that the Arab self-motivated collective's fault, which could be more interesting. Badly fails Chahiner's summary is poorly written and poorly executed, at least enough to emphasize it among other excellent episodes of the film. Despite the quality imbalance, I would give a 7/10 movie for the concept, if it's not for execution.
