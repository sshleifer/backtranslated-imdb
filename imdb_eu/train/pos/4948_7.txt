This is a brilliant visual film that looks at this topic, and gives the viewer something different from it. Premise is easy: a renowned actress (Morgan Freeman) decides to visit a store that wants to investigate the next role and see people. He takes a special interest in the "10 elements or less" Caja Navarra box (Paz Vega), who finds a pleasant, strong and curious presence. <br /> <br /> Both actors play a role in each other and play a strong role in the character research. It is not a matter of ordinary character; Each one represents the whole world. Kutxa is immersed in a rugged and frustrating world of "real" life, while the actress is so full of fantasy that she can not do without simple tasks like phone numbers. He has confessed that when he speaks face to face with his face, and seeing real people does not see any of them. <br /> <br /> But the actors inspired by the actors are not only in their work. ; we also see the reverse process. He knows several characters "He" and has inspired his role as a movie. <br /> <br /> The preferred song "Al Pasar la Barca" from the box office would prefer to spend on a boat prefer to pay (ie honest work) about what you do not want to hide behind beauty. Vega is the only person in the store with the brain or ambition, who is willing to work for success. (This is a must for Paz Vega). It's a strange little head, probably added. If you do not like slow steps and a "talky" approach, it will entertain the movie. The characters are well-contrasted, and effective acting is lovable. Pleasant watch
