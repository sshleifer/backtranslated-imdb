- SMALL SPOILERS HERE! - <br /> <br /> When I looked at the votes of today's "Creep", I was amazed that "1" was a movie about a great number of IMDb users. I wonder: what do people expect such a movie? Are there so many people watching the movie, without knowing anything? <br /> <br /> "Creep" is a HORROR movie and it's pretty good! This means automatically: it has a story with holes, sharp dangers, and simple single-handed characters. So why complain? Take the popcorn and coke, sit back on the seat and then ... enjoy yourself in death! The first 60 minutes of Kate and a single meter stop are frightening. Then every corner of the screen is afraid and afraid and we will give you some rhythms that are sudden sound of the flashing neon lamp in your back. (In my opinion, the sound editor has done the best work in this movie.) The second part of the movie is not terrifying, but the effects of gore are good and the story is quite developed. (... considering that it is a horror movie that you are watching is not Discovery Channel!) So, if you want to be a very scary hour. Check out the first "Creep" and then leave your movie or TV show. However, you know the rest of the story, right? A bad boy will die and Kate will only be alive. But even when you see this movie up to date, you're not disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to push anxiety to the next level, do what I did after watching the movie: let the cinema go dark by night, go to the next metro station and take the last train home ...
