I had never seen the show 'Next Action Hero' and read the comments we have mentioned here until I read that this movie was "a prize". I was flogging the channels and found this, and I saw it, I ventured bravely to the finish line. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot (the most dangerous game, etc.) but I did. It was expected, and almost received, 'gotcha' - the protagonist will eventually beat the hunter. I think that high technology was too much (GPS) and it gave me the coolest Night Rider's sweat, but it was not too stumbled. <br /> <br /> The basic problem with that movie was the level. SOD Suspension Requested to the Spectator. Do we really think that a large number of people who fly on a helicopter can get grenades on a public bridge and COPS-EI NOT appear in the research? Does the COP Do NOT appear in a meeting point in the Las Vegas Intersection? Pleeease. That kind of thing too - watch it fun, but keep at least compelling, thank you. <br /> <br /> The final solution was good, but the ending was disappointing, with the subsequent taste Star Trek a bad episode. Now, at least, I understand why the play was very cursed - except for Zane, who does not do what the IMHO deserves - they were the winners of a reality show. <br /> <br /> Get sick.
