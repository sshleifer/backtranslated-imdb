Quick and simple, I love this movie. <br /> <br /> As I have mentioned, I'm not from the south, I do not care about popular music and I never wear a cowboy hat. (I've never been in a car with a body in the trunk, but I love "Goodfellas.") This is an excellent movie. Shaped with a 2.35 ratio and transferred to DVD beautifully. (VHS was 1.33 full screen). And yes, a solid 5.1 mix to see your pleasure. What can you tell about this movie? <br /> <br /> Texas is a great story in love and hate, with excellent performances. Travolta is fantastic. It's what he's doing next to "Pulp Fiction". He's been 25 years old in my top 5 years! <br /> <br /> Check this out !!! 10 da!
