I remember that I had a very low risk when I first got out. James "Not Jim" Belushi, a hammy-actress, and a cursi title in a formula by John Hughes. You can not pay for 15 years ago. However, they caught me losing after Sunday afternoon, and hit me at a couple of levels. A fairy tale (Pretty Pretty Pretty Woman on the other side), very weak, like Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street as a similar performance to Kelly Lynch. Above all, it slowly pulls some ropes. It's pretty hard not to fall into the story, crush Kelly Lynch, identify him with James Belushi, who has not liked a hard guy boy and he laughed at Curley Sue's lines. It has an incident, with a happy ending, and the type of message you want to hear. Come on, lose time in this movie, it's worth it.
