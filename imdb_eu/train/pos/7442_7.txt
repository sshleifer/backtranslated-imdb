I rented the movie (I do not get a theater release here anymore). The preview was horrible. I was very impressed, I deserved to see it; There was a script, almost like a movie set. He had some very entertaining moments and, despite the fact that he was not an impeccable show, and the audience was not penetrating. It's a mistake, especially in the so-called "comedy" soundtrack of shameless effects, but in general, the show's form is honest and generally true, in a generous way or by Larry Sanders. <br /> <br /> At one point Jerry Springer is a way to be critical, it's also an easy goal. Springer can make Citizen Kane and claim the worst film ever made. I recommend this movie for anyone interested in the show. An incorrect but innovative piece of film.
