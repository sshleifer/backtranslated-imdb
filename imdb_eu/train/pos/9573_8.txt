WOW. If you think that a movie may be tired of some way, you will not see Dog Dog Bite Dog. This movie does not stop the punches and does not show a disturbing image. Like Salus, this is the dehumanization of the human mind. They look, dark, depressing, but it is also one of the best films ever released in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> The script is much the same, but do not follow. Think of it as horrible. Basically, it is about an obsessive and obsessive detective of the cat and mouse game, against a professional and emotional hit-man. While the script offers a new look on the cover, it gives a lot of questions about dark side of humanity. Is violence really necessary? Do we become human or less than a five-year-old child without treatment, without mercy, without remorse? Likewise, we humans play less than weeping dogs when we wreck havoc, this is a sad truth. The director is a matter of great exploration, without limiting itself. In addition to cat and mouse persecution, the script has developed two different stories for the main characters. One is about love and the other to salvation. Although the script is not new, it's still written and keeps you stuck in the seat at all times. <br /> <br /> The effect is really good. Edison Chen is as incredible as Hit-man; It really proves that her face is not beautiful. It is disbelief, evil and kind. Sam Lee is also an obsessed policeman. Help cast, short, excellent. Music is outstanding. Ben Cheung's score is very dark, with light songs that are most prominent in the darkest moments of the dark film. Yuen Man's cinematography is very good. <br /> <br /> In general, this CATIII movie is highly recommended. Very well-paced, very dramatic, wonderful score and it's just really good at the end. However, as many have said, it is not a movie for everyone. If you exclude strong violence, you should ignore this. If you do not want to see great negativity in the movie, it's not for you too. Finally, 8/10 of the electric cinema.
