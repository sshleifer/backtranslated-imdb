"Let's Bowl" started on local television in Twin Cities. It came at night, you would find something while you were surfing the seventh after Hamm's 7th bottle. <br /> <br /> Although ads were locally produced, it appeared outside the Wally Grumpy's, a microphone and nervous. - "Ahh ... white, Steve Sedahl." I do not know why, but that has always laughed me. <br /> <br /> There was a balloon competition that was not resolving a dispute between the two players, but the game was a second level of commentaries and clips. Sedahl acted equally well, because Rich Kronfeld's "Wally Hotvedt" was a curious and balanced one. The most notable are: "How to dispose of an old old ball properly" (throw away the lake) and "Dating tips", where the couple "dates" a "couple" and Wally ends the bitter complaint, "I could not do it myself head! "<br /> <br /> Another segment, about what the pair had done for the days, - Steve's beer appeared to be boiling from beer, from the fridge to the refrigerator, while trying to climb Wallyk Taylor's falls, with his strained blazer, blue and light blue headphones Hilarious <br /> <br /> Wally makes comments on the "bowlers of the league" and also emphasizes the fight against the application of eukemia. <br /> <br /> "Let's Bowl" was received by Comedy Central. And it was good times, but the network never knew what to do, stressing the "run" of the first run and the "bowling" competition, never emphasizing the show's point. Continuous announcements interrupted the flow and the side characters (Ernie, Pig, Butch, etc.) were unnoticed by other things. The whole thing was running and forced. Even Jon Stewart left with a show on the day with Bowl (it's not enough lame, jokes?) - it's an ignominious treatment for a show that's far better. <br /> <br /> How many times do we have a bowl? Come on in the world of modern television, the local mix of comedy genius and total noise? Cold networks are part of "whole lime", but it's a strange thing to see, let's see, "Let's bowl," like weird little, weird, funny, and funny little things. <br /> <br /> Here they will be published on DVD.
