Nicolas Mallet's failure. A bank teller walks around everyone. Then his friend, a writer who likes books, has a plan to change his life. He says that our hero left his boss. It makes a lot of money throughout life and a lot of women sleep. And he just got it. <br /> <br /> If there were no deaths in the film (murder / suicide / natural causes), it would be a fake. Marriage, politics, journalism and ... there are many lives. <br /> <br /> Jean-Louis Trintignant is a nice nightmare. Romy Schneider is the most attractive. Certainly, it's worth a look.
