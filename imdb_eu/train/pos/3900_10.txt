This is at the top of the most entertaining shows I have ever seen. I laughed so much, I was sure I lost half of the jokes. This shows Izzard as a brilliant comedian. I particularly like that there is never any material for the audience as "slowdown". It's time-consuming and the routine is linked together as a piece of performance, rather than some gag-series. Thumbs way up.
