When I saw the video when I saw it, my little sister was a gift and I was probably 12 at the time ... What is most important to me was that the film lacked in the middle of the lack of conflicts in so many films. The main characters challenge each other, as they explain to themselves that they do not say the only thing that you're shouting on the screen, it would make sense for everyone to know the whole deal, which could be sensible for any person to know. say I like the movie I like most, the main characters do not say things to each other ... they do not break and make up, just like they grow up. the film continues. <br /> <br /> These two children are grouped and seem to be at the other side of the track, they are not different. Loui is just a middle-class child, she must have realized that she should be a loving family, and Cecelia was a high school child, trying to prove to her family that she had existed and would have lost. However, I watched this movie posted in Hulu and I had to see it again ... I'm sure there was no hole in the screenplay, and no, Woogek and Dweeb would not have hot dogs to eat because they were grassy. br /> <br /> Now that removes the movie is an unexpected darkness. Children under 5 years old are probably afraid of Dr. Screweyes. Adding it to the center of the movie (although it is obvious from the first obvious one) is an excessive violence ... it was a show that started in the theater, perhaps to show it. It's not that scary without dinosaurs. I think that there is a real danger to the first half of the film, so there is little continuity in the second half. <br /> <br /> Regarding the recipient of the people, with whom I am sure you can not forget the deletion of animation and conversation problems ... Therefore, I will report these factors and I will also enjoy the story. It's a great movie for kids and sticks to your head ... you think about people as you treat them and I think I'm reviewing every 10 years.
