I enjoyed the innocence of this movie and the characters had a strong animal to face their reality. The gorillas are wonderful and the eyes are very special. Sometimes, even though they are a little scary, children should be afraid to go over the top. Rene Russo has a very feminine role. In the past, these types of Hollywood films usually feel the need to create an evil straw man, but only the opponent is the gorilla. The appearance of some animals is an interesting aspect, the same emotions we make, and yet we can not really treat them because people are not people. There's not much film on this territory, and it's worth seeing if you want to see the similarity of human beings.
