Miike plays a children's adventure movie, unlike Neverending Story. True, is the favorite of the director's films. Although the worst Miike is better than many movies, The Great Yokai War is a lot worth the effort. It's just as loud and overwhelming as the American kiddie movies. I think children think they'd like them a lot (the DVD has an English dub), but like all Miike movies, it can move slowly. This means that it has a peculiar difference, where sometimes there is a great sequence of actions and the characters that are dragged on to the next scene will be permanently dragged. The story itself is not very good, and the ongoing mistakes of Miiki's incoherence go crazy. Most of my enjoyment came from technical matters. Miike's movie must be the most expensive and it looks wonderful. "Yokai" are Japanese spirits, and in different shapes, they are fantastic and costume designers, special effects and the rest of the designers in the design team have done a great job. I've seen this movie based on the 1968 movie Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare, and rubber rubber monsters become stronger organizations that you can see. effects I especially liked bad guys (or in this case) looking like an Agi, dark-skinned eyes, tight white clothes, white hives, hairstyles and quarrels. Incidentally, Chiaki Kuriyama plays, Lucy Liu as a teenage goddess of Kill Bill. 1. The heroine of the movie plays Ryunosuke Kamiki, Miyazaki's Awaya and Howl's Moving Castle.
