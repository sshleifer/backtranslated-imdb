They often laude a loud, divorced, divorced, divorced 2 person, sometimes sad - Lemmon's "neat and neurotic husband" and matthau slob sports script to reduce spending on living together. <br /> <br /> Well-photographed and targeted. The script is very wrinkled, that is, there are almost always parties in each line. It's a fun, especially, scene, about what all the British sisters (Evans and Shelley) are saying, but when Lemmon takes pictures of her children and she's an ex-wife, she's giddy with her. Matthau can appear with obvious beverages! <br /> <br /> Very funny.
