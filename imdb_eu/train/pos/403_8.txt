I recall that Legend of Zu's trailer was quite impressive and I decided to watch the Storm Riders as a fan of A Man Called Hero (my favorite time). I know that Ekin Chengen's acting capability has a lot of criticism everywhere, but so far it's my favorite Hong Kong mobile (though Nicolas Tse is better) and this is one of the factors I liked. Without a doubt, this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end. I thought the actors were only real and everything else was created at the end of the computer movie. They have to put a lot of work into this and deserve good credit for this. The story of the movie was a fairy tale of good and evil, with a love story (which Ekin Cheng makes her easy to wear). The story is not very intellectual and profound, but this is not something that you expect a movie. I liked the martial arts that I had to replace with the skewers and magical fist ability, but that's life and never was the way you want. And why did it seem like a supersonic airplane fighting in the sky? That's so fun. Your story can not be named as a man in my eyes, but it flows like video games and that's not a bad thing. If a company decides to publish games in this movie, I'm not surprised, because it's all about playing video games. Good work Make such fantasy movies more
