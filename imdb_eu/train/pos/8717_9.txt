I must admit early, I'm not a fan of "family" movies. Most of them, IMHO, are sensitive. But this, like Pixie STY, like Pixar's previous movie, is very funny. The two protagonists may have been a little bland (especially in relation to the two directors of the ANTZ, but this is a better film), but it has been solved over the rest of the film. The animation seemed very good, although the humor was very broad, it was very good (especially when I liked the Hopper line "If I did not tell him I would not kill him, I would die!") And the actors made voices, except for the two directors, they were wonderful Denis Leary was making an animated film, what concepts). And like the others, I loved the outings! I look forward to having new videos.
