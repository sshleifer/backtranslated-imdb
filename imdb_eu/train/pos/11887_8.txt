Between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people are expected to die due to AIDS. The biggest toll on the project is in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 55 million deaths expected. Apart from the harsh statistics, there are stories that we rarely hear. Christophe Honor√© describes a new film Close to Leo, a film produced for French television, within a series of youth issues. Although it is fictional, it is an unfortunately unusual situation. Impact of HIV diagnosis in a loving close family. <br /> <br /> Twenty-one years ago Leo (Pierre Mignard) tells Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) parents and two teenagers, AIDS family, whose family is devastated. Concerned for his youth, he decides to keep the younger brother Marcel (Yannis Lespert) aged 12, but listens to the conversation and starts angry and starts playing. Leo goes to Paris for treatment, with Marcel, but the boy challenges Leo and he needs to know the truth. Leo says he is sick and admits that Marcel is sad. When you meet Marcel with some old friends, the tension between them is worn out and we will create fascinating effects. <br /> <br /> I feel like I'm getting close to Leo, Lespert, and Mignard's great shows that I had in the bed with the physical relationships between my brothers. Thanks to watching the events of the youth perspective, the film reminded me of the 400 hits of Leolo and Truffaut's Quebece. Unlike American movies that are dying around AIDS, Close to Leo tells the tough truth, but in a way that is both tender and realistic.
