I thought how Grinch Stole's Christmas movie was pretty good. It was not horrible, it was not great, but it was spectacular. Jim Carrey thought it was annoying for a moment. A person with special education, whatever was supposed to be evil and wrong, but still retarded. I thought it was a beautiful landscape in the cave of Grinch, and I laughed somewhere. but I thought it was annoying at most times. This movie could have been "SO" much better if Grinch's personality changed, and more laughter would include some scenes, because humor was not funny. . I really liked how Grinch stole it from Christmas, but he did not see it.
