I have read a great deal of this unique comment from my previous film on this film, and I mean, from the previous user's point of view, I fully understand this movie: I can hardly imagine that this film touches sensitive topics and the slightest detail is very important It may well be for the viewer who is directly concerned about the events that appear in this movie. I would like to say 'Distortion' that was shown at the Geneva Film Festival in November 2005 ('Cinéma tout écran') at the festival ('Prix du public' in french).

"After almost 50 years of experiencing all this violence, we can ask ourselves to continue to be normal, sometimes we might think it would be easier for suicide.
