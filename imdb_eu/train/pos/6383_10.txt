I thought this film was very nice. I watched this movie with my wife before I had my first children. Therefore, I did not see it as an entertainment family and I still enjoyed it. It seems that a lot of opinions point out that this movie is not breaking the ground, unexpected plots and a predictable and boring movie. If these people were watching the movie that they expected to make this religious experience, they would of course be disappointed. It's just an animation movie; nothing more. If you want to watch the movie, you want to rest and entertain yourself, you're not disappointed. In the end, definitely not the best movie by Disney, but it's entertaining and I do not understand the reputation he received.
