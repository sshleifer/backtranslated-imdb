I caught the VHS for one of those wonderful moments of T.V. Is not the air ever again? <br /> <br /> It was so creative and I remember that it was sent once a week and the next step was very nervous. I want to see it again. I want to buy I can not do what they can. It's not even EBAY. <br /> <br /> So far enough, it was one of the best series of the 80s. It should be considered classically, but it will be lost in space. They mention at least this website and Wikipedia. Sober <br /> <br /> It was very attractive, fun, curtain and original. Maybe it's not exactly the origin of Sherlock Holmes, I think that Quintin is much more attractive and has a better chance than her main lady's hard-hitting Holmes ever.
