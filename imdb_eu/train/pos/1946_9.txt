I did not really have a great pastime with Star Trek for 2-3 years. Netflix and the distribution of video technology in the year 2000 have made it possible for all the Star Trek episodes to be in the past. For those who do not really see each section, and who knows, TNG, DS9, Voyager, etc., the general public consensus will say: "Next generation I like it" is the best. That's when the Captain Picard and his team starred for Star Trek for the first time in hunger. To be honest, I value Voyager's TNG passages. The episode of Voyager also goes on for a while like TNG. The data provided for the TNG is excellent, but the Voyager doctor is now over, now the creativity! Instead of being artificial and wrong with artificial intelligence, give yourself the freedom to express what you have imagined. Picardo is not only an excellent actor, but the setting of the self-realization premise is the best possible science fiction. Endgame imagines himself as a married person with an "organic", inventing the human machine interface interface receiver and in the previous section of Endgame, diverting the captain's command and making "human" mistakes. Unlike DS9: 1. First time to jump with beautiful women, Voyager has to survive 3 years without Jeri Ryan, and I think that Picardo had taken him with his personality. Yes, of course, Voyager's cast chemistry is released without effort, Harry Kim and Tom Paris - very natural. Sometimes I like humor from Tuvoc, even if it's Vulcan. In the end, I am very pleased that this original captain was removed ... oh, if you see the oddest video, thank God for Kateri! She has been a very safe, credible and respectable female captain for 7 years. What a great job! Thank you for making Star Trek Voyager, in every episode, I enjoy creative exploration, morality and our cosmic expansion.
