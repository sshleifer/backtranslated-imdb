Obstacles seem to be a series of dreaded fears. After being transmitted to the beginning of the 80's and afterwards, it has sunk without a trace. This is a cry of embarrassment. <br /> <br /> I first saw the broadcast in the southern television area when I was broadcast on Sunday evenings and was a classic concept of tea time. Even though I do not remember much about the software, I think some things have stopped. Highlights are unforgettable names. He tried to flake the flute of the music from the eastern European border, and the subsequent crash of the car (and with that scene they left me with a love of Finn-type finishing with Merc 200). At first it was not clear, the mystery solution of the series was in these titles. <br /> <br /> It was a drawing of a young music student trying to report what was happening when he was adopted. Many times and turns, but Barreras was a surprisingly adult drama. Benedict Taylor Billy was brilliant and shaky he did not do much more. <br /> <br /> This was a quality drama, making the DVD release too late and I hope to get this chance to get to know it again in the future. <br /> <br /> Hard memories of my childhood
