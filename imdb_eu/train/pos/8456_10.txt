I've seen all the Gundam / Mechen anime that I've shown in the US, and this is the best story. He has thrown the earth's rotation and rotation. Gundam Wing focuses on politics and war. A group of 15-year-olds from the series have been trained to drive outfits for mobile art called Gundams. The Gundam riders were trained to fight a powerful revolt known as Oz. As things begin to warm up between the OZ and Gundam riders, new political groups will be formed and old people will be cleansed. Old conflicts will end and new ones will be created. To get peace, the Gundam rider must know about events that occur in their world and end all battles. But how far reach people reach their goal. We recommend this anime for anyone looking for a show that's getting there.
