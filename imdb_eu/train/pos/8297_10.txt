A classic movie in two directions. He is led by Wes Craven at his advantage. As much as possible, it shows what the TV budget might have with a higher budget. Susan Lucci tries to break into his claws by Robert Urichfamily and persuades him to convince the secret of his health house. His latest invention, a series of spaces for studying people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighborhood. Anyone who sees it should pay attention to Susan Lucci. His appearance and performance had an unexpected effect some years later. Actor, scientist and parapsychologist Stephen Armourae is a fan of this movie and has written a review of this film. Lucci turned the subject of a portrait as the basis for a work he called Catherine. Lucci and Barbara Steele used portraits of 'Black Sunday' as a reference for portraits that Armourae soon removed. It's probably the personal character of Artist and Catheriner. So, seeing both movies, we can get another story and an interesting film of unknown women.
