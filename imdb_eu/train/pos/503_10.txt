Having watched the nonsense of Star Trek Voyager after seven years, I was quite shocked. The next gen and DS9 was a bloody thing and Voyager spoiled TV Trek. This is probably Trek opened with the best driver of a show. The crew were very good as well as the selection of the cast actors. Scott Bakula played a captain of the first time in the deep space, and the modes of doing things were a refreshing change in advance. The rest of the crew were very pleased with their roles, and I think they have come out in the first season. I canceled the show before I needed it. In A Mirror Darkly showed us what they were capable of casting. Pena a movie or a television movie was never considered. He has had to leave so much a back story and federation, showing disappointment with Klingon ..........
