I will not give anything in this film, describing it as an Israeli return, as a young blind woman has committed suicide by her friend and friend. As a detective story, the blind woman develops her life as her friend ends up knowing why. As long as his research continues and the information accumulates, it leads to a destructive, destructive effect. Warning of the movie with rhythm and performance, especially Talia Sharon's Ya'ara, a blind woman, is excellent. The Israeli film is of a great age and is completely competitive with other foreign films, although a few have found numerous audiences in the US.
