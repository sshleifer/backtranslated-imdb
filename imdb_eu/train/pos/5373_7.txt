Maybe it's not the absolute input from the Hammer House of Horror series, but it's probably the best-selling award! "A house that is dead from death?" This title I cried all day, I never tired! In addition to the wonderful title, this short film also boasts some stubborn and fatal moments. You may need another perspective before understanding the final rotation, but it is an original idea of ​​a horror short. The story opens an image of an elderly couple, taking up middle-aged tea at home. Husband conceals his wife and, a few years later, the "damned" house is still on sale. They start to recover a young couple and their cherubby daughter, but mysterious events occur and especially affect young Sophie. His beloved cat dies, although his birthday party is damaged when one of the domestic tubes suddenly empties into the blood (a particularly impressive sequence, this!). Is the old house really scared? Or maybe the neighbors are seemingly helpful to be terribly afraid? The answer to these questions is original and quite unexpected given the climate, and even more is a real shock at the end. The tension is masterfully built and the property is filled with horrific scenery, like the rusty wool used by his husband to kill his wife. The little warning, however, is that the cat sequence is difficult to see when you are an animal lover. As a result, he has won the Hammer series!
