I love this exhibition. Now, I'm not a fan of science fiction, so it's similar, I did not notice it. I like the story of the movie story. Although I like the love story, even though I am enjoying myself, I wonder to myself, seeing how the story's part can really be developed, because Ned can touch Chuck or not ... well, you know. I also like Chuck, I do not find his annoyance, and I generally hate sweet, pretty and perfect characters. I like the voice of the narrator, even if the family members mix and look like Walgreens ads. I could argue about Ned's other things about the problem and how the writers face each other in the future, but I only see what they see and wait.
