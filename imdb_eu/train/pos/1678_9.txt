Sergio Martino is a brilliant director, who has helped a lot of Italian genres and, in my opinion, Gialli's 1970s are indisputable indicators of his repertoire. "La Coda Dello Scorpion". In 1971, "Scorpion's Tale Case" is one of those films that Martino has contributed to in the original sub-genre of Italian Horror, and proves that man is the atmosphere, style and suspense master. The personal favorite of Martino, which I have seen so far, is still outstanding "I have only locked up your lock and key in 1972". Then, "Torso" (1973) and "Mrs's extreme vice". Wardh "(1971), all of this, in general, I like even more: it's a purely personal taste, but it's essential for all Italian fan horror films and general suspensors," La Coda Dello Scorpione ". <br /> < br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> The insurance investigator, Peter Lynch (George Hilton), is assigned to verify the circumstances of the insurance company that will pay a large amount to the deceased wife.
