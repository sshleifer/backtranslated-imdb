What happens so much social anxiety that leaves someone functioning? How can only a man get? The fact that it is too much to be part of society in the world, what happens? Frownland examines these questions. Doubtlessly the original premiere of Bronstein. The tone is strange and claustrophobic, when Keith is involved in the mind of a man, the phrase can not be very appropriate. We will continue to stay in touch with people while trying to work every day. Most of us know people like this: people who say "too much" or "do not know" I do not know. So, we know people are away, but why would someone want to make a movie about them? Well, because it's interesting, and Bronstein and Dore Mann are the main actors. This movie is not commercial, just like a movie can get. Some friends filmed a few years ago because they saved money. It was shot at 16 mm and the sharp appearance of the movie is a small budget. Without distributors, finding this can be difficult. I think that it will be random in the last year. Fortunately, at some point the DVD will be there. I watched LA Silent Movie Theater. The audience had 10 people, including Crispin Glover, who tells me something so curious. Highly recommended
