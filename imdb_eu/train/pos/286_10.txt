I have read several engagements in theaters, and they were all bad ... I think you have to have a certain type of person to enjoy these films. If you do not enjoy the Waltons or Little House ... You will not understand or enjoy this movie ... <br /> <br /> Now about Loves Abiding Joy ... I know they were bad news. The beginning of the movie ... I would like to show more at the end than to think about it. This movie has a lot with Jeff ... 6 years later, you know you're interested in girls. <br /> <br /> So far, I mean I liked all 4 movies. ... I was not crazy about books ... It is not possible to wait until the next movie. Clark helps you get the way he speaks. I'd like to look like January Jones ... Maybe a family reunion or something.
