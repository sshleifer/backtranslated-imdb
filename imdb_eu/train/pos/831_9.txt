I noticed that this movie was limited, especially for Pierce Brosnan's mustache, but it has been one of the funniest films I've ever seen all year round. It almost starts as a thriller, but continuously advances Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnea in a hilarious job full of comedy and a great professional comedy. Also, while saying this movie in this comedy, it should not be forgotten that when it's time it has a heart and it can be very moving. When I entered the theater, I did not know what silence I needed as a mustache, but I have been one of the best films I've ever seen. I left the theater, I felt very happy about the movie and I planned to see it again in the open space. I recommend for everyone who loves a good comedy with a handwritten script and a great mustache.
