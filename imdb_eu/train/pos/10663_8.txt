Here's a great Barbara Stanwyck double bill in a record. The first movie - and they believed the smallest among them - Clark's "To Please A Lady" (1950) MGM joins Gable Clark. It is basically a star vehicle with the usual Gable screen with the presence of the screen. Here, Stanwyck plays a racially-motivated race for a feminist reporter and begins a sex fight. After that, many end up ending in each other's arms, and everything close preached and pleasing. Gable and Stanwyck - You can drag a movement to the icons of the Golden Age! <br /> <br /> But this DVD's real flesh is a second feature - it's wonderful and quite unknown. Little Thriller called JEOPARDY. Produced by MGM in 1953, this is a wonderful little treasure of a non-frozen movie! Here, Stanwyck plays Barry Sullivan's wife and mother with her young son Lee Aaker on vacation, in a distant and remote Mexican beach, suddenly hits the tragedy. A flooded wooden dock catches Sullivan under a heavy pilot and guesses what? Yes, the tide will come in. The soul is not spectacular, and Stanwyck will not be able to release it himself to get help from the car. After a bit of a distance, a generosity sculptor fleeing from Ralph Meeker (for his help) wants more money or change of clothes ("I did nothing to save my husband"). "Does he or she not? <br /> <br /> It takes a picture of Meeker! It's a great performance! When you enter the movie, you can not take your eyes off. Brando's passionate style has never surprisingly surpassed his career In the movies, although he performed great performances, "Naked Spur" in the "mountains" of Mann / Stewart's "1956" Western movie was shameless and shameless, he was suffering from Stanley Kubrick's "Paths Of Glory" (1957) fame. The real claim was only Mike Hammer in Mickey Spillan's "Kiss Me Deadly" in 1955. His play "Jeopardy" had to do wonders for him, but he had a very unique career in films, he died in 1988. <br /> <br /> < > This version of "Jeopardy" is now proud of its horror scene, a memorable, strenuous and thrilling thriller, with the good leadership of John Sturges, Victor Milner's crisp film monochrome and Dimitri Tiomkin's score ferical The add-ons, however, are not shaken, except for "Jeopardy" radio and trailer movies. <br /> <br /> This record is part of the kutxa that celebrates its centenary, Barbara Stanwyck. It was tough if she had still more than 100-year-old women around! <br /> <br /> JEOPARDY - Winning MGM!
