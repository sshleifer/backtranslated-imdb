It is a live video, so it should go without saying that it will not compete with the first lion, but this is said to be a good one. <br /> <br /> They loved the kids, but that's right, they love everything they do with a cartoon. It was exciting as he liked me, I laughed in several parts (although the second templates *), the first movie was suddenly creative links and jokes. to be older to understand (but not like Shrek) ["something compensates?"]) .. <br /> <br /> A special note about special templates, I was surprised to find that none of them was just noticed by jokes. They were (indeed, there was no noise / image, references were so subtle); They were configured / sealed / etc, and they were almost at ease. I would like to think that my kids are more humorous than going to the bathroom, and this movie is very well. <br /> <br /> What else? Music was so social, compelling as the first or second movie, but it was very fun for kids. There is no painful moment, a blessing for me. A little action, but not very scary (NIMH's secret gave me my children's nightmares, but I do not know that G was right for that score ...) <br /> <br /> I say that's great. A movie for children of any age, a 100% safe movie for children (I do not feel very sensitive, but I had to leap and I had to turn off the TV for a few films that I had to do with shutdown) - but you're sure to get out of that room . However, I would say that I'm sticking around, maybe you might have liked it :)
