In July I saw this and also with Christmas theme, it was very sensitive and moving. It's not a real-life person who is full of fantastic moments, sometimes unwise. William Russ made a great deal of work on Hank. I only saw The Long, Hot Summer, in a version of the weak character. But this, in the face of his eyes, when he studied things that Hank was doing to him, was very wonderful and tender. Valerie Bertinelli was as magnificent and beautiful as usual, and she was very credible in that role. And Max Falk, Max was so wonderful and he always had a smile when he appeared in some important scenarios. There were many special scenes, including Hank, who was truly aware of his life. It's not for everyone ... especially those who have not entered into "sensitive" movies, and this is definitely! If you want everything to be perfect and meaningful, avoid this. But I think it's worth seeing again, that's why I recorded it. (Yes, some of us still have video players :)
