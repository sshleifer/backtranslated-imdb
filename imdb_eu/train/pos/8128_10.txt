I first saw the child living in the east of London. Hitler's Luftwaffe scare is evident and the movie landscape was reminded on our street. I remember having seen the nightmares after. Odd things do not really see cinematography in fiction as a social history. <br /> <br /> With the destructive world war, the scale of the machines was bad, now there was more nano technology, but overall, excellent and well-done work. It was interesting to see how the space travels were perceived. I think that shooting a spacecraft from a giant gun would surely kill astronauts. However, there was a lot. War is incessant, humanity is human inhumanity. War as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
