John Travolta, the world's biggest champions, and a mechanical bull ... what else can you ask for? Yes, you probably do not get a lot of surprises or a deep meaning in this. However, I've always been quite enjoyable to see this redneck romance. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) are in love with Gilley and they are in love. You expect a hardcore couple that you can have. The following scene sounds fun, dances, mechanical bulls and, of course, the necessary battles. In 1980, she has a good country soundtrack, "Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places", "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" and "Hello Texas", my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Get out of your cowboy boots and boot-scooters' boogie! <br /> <br /> *** (out of 4)
