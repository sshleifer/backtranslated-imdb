The genre mix, based on the mash-ups of Stephen Chow's genius for his inspiration. There is no magic kung fu, college love, sports, gangster action and scary melodrama. The production is superb and it's a quick career, so it's easy to overcome a lot of mistakes in this movie. <br /> <br /> A baby is left next to the basketball court. A homeless man moves to a Shaolin monastery in the center of the city, with a man-made man at home and with a special kung-gu handbook. The old monk teaches the boy, but it does expire when trying to control the manual technique. In school, a school teacher, kung-fu, attended by four monks. The new teacher is now mad at the 20-year-old boy, because the teacher's measures are not vulnerable and they spend the night. The boy throws rubbish into a basket, a man who takes an incredible distance to the gangster club to play darts. This involves a great fight, the boy decides to expel the monastery and make men become a college basketball sensation. the first 10 minutes. The first problem is that, apart from short story tales, we first know the main character in the short film. The man who uses the boy more clearly defines the first third period. The plot has no terrain in front of the activity's insanity on the film. I'm sure the evil monks will show up at the end. Effects, photography and progress are superior and form part of unresolved plot. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow works much better on plot and comedy, and this movie lives in his shadow, but that's not good reason. It's very fun with a scattered end. Recommended.
