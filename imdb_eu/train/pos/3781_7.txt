I would not dare say that this movie is better than the original, but it is very good on its own. The comedy of this movie is as good as the original one, but it spreads so many scenes thinking about them. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie is much more curious than the original, but that's so great. Peter Hewitt works brilliantly by directing this film with a brilliant director. The basic works of the original film will be back to the characters of this film and all play a wonderful role with their role. I do not care what he says, I think Keanu Reeves is an excellent actor! He liked these two heart rhythms, with Alex Winter's Bill. I was very happy that George Carlin Rufus's role came back, very cool! Hal London Jr., Ted Logan's father plays a great job. Ted's scene with the body of his parents and Hal London Jr. Ted is an excellent scene and starts playing like Ted theater, and he's fine. I can not forget that William Sadler referred to Death as the film he did for me completely. The other castables are also quite good. <br /> <br /> If you like the first parts of the Bill and Ted series, I hope you like this movie too. But do not expect to be as good as the original. I really hope to enjoy the movie, thanks to reading <br /> <br /> -Chris
