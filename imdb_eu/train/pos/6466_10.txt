I really love this movie, so I saw the audience in Los Angeles. After the movie, many people were crying and how many movies they caused. I know why his homeland was so successful in Sweden. The film is masterfully mastered and each character is brilliantly drawn and finally aware of the people and their surroundings. Music is very natural and the main song of the film is heartfelt but inspiring. Without a doubt, you would recommend this movie to watch them all. Normally, people who do not attend subtitled films will also recommend it. Certainly, it is deserved for an Oscar nomination, without a reflection on the subject of the film, as well as the ordinary people of a small community. What divides us in this world is a movie that shows us the potential of human spirits. Need to see it!
