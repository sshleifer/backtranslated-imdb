Do not waste time reading my opinion. Come out and see this wonderful section, that is, it's probably the best Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon puts his son as a mysterious and charming writer to avenge the murder of his daughter. Columbo's usual rumor, which is more confusing and clearer, and the special division is a wonderful chemistry between Gordon and Falken. Ironically, what Levinson or Link's creative creators have not written, Columbo's most dense and original plot. Fully satisfying in all departments and full of venerable and horrible conversations and thoughts. It's really an unexpected and inventive one. 10/10 ... find it in Netflix!
