In 1971 this version did not like this version of Vanishing Point. The 1971 version seemed quite annoying. If I get up in the middle of a movie several times (as I did in 1971), it's not so great. Of course, that is, at least, when I was nine years old when I was released in 1971. However, I have seen a lot of remakes, where I like the originals and the older ones better. I saw the plot of the 1997 version more intelligible and I saw that the original was true without damaging the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt that the 1997 version had more excitement and I was not so "blase" (Boring).
