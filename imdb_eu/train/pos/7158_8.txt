Holes (2003, Dir Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> If Stanley Yelnats IV is guilty of wrongdoing, he will be sent to "Camp Green Lake". In the camp, the Director, and his two friends, Mr. Dr. Sir and Mr Pendanski promise camp after holes dug in the hole after the hole. But why? Stanley wants to guess. <br /> <br /> I never wanted to see 'Seeing the pitfalls', and I have to admit it, I just saw the movie, because I'm a fan of Shia LaBeouf, but you're not a fan of it, it does not matter. 'Zuloak' is one of Disney's best to enjoy the whole family. The story is very written and the flashbacks of the past entail a wonderful idea. These are not distracting and really gives a great story back. All cast are excellent. Young stars work well, and Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver are delighted. Shia LaBeouf can not even make a mistake at age 17. This is a Disney movie, definitely you would like the family. <br /> <br /> "I learn from bankruptcy." - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
