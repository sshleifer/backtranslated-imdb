This "age" film talks about two young girls' experiences, Dani and Maureen, who learn about life and love summer misfortunes. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Mulligan, he made his brilliant work. The movie "To Kill a Mockingbird" does not play a fake note. All the acts are excellent. Like Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes some great releases. When I watched this feature film, directed and edited, I felt that I was looking for a reality through a window, rather than watching the movie. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie at least 5 times and I can honestly do it. In addition to being a young man, he is one of the best films on adult changes and changes. Families with children between the ages of 10 to 15 should use them as a debate and debate, their love for siblings, their love, their parents' responsibilities, etc.
