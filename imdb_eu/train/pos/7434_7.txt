Thirty years after, the third version of "A Star Born" has come to the DVD to end up enjoying the most demanding fans of Barbra Streisand in a package. This would include me, among other things, since I watched the song of the 1976 song "Woman in the Moon", a feminist hymn. Easily Removed, the story of the polarizing story of the movie is a solid compilation of the Hollywood style, whose variants are part of other Streisand "Funny Girl" films. Then, regaining the scene of the musical scene, following the self-destructive rock star John Norman Howard, he meets Esther Hoffman's singer club, which is waiting for his rest. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < John Norman, Esther, represents the latest film of happiness and at the same time attracts a creative and dignified musician under the facade. Aside from the big movie scene, Esther had a great rest at a gym and started her career. Inevitably, he can not handle the failure of his career by his incredible success, and if you know any version of this story, you know the rest. Under the direction of Frank Pierson (though Streisand's management talents are clearly visible), the film still draws me for me, although I do not know the insanity and manipulation. He still has emotional resonance despite numerous mistakes. <br /> <br /> Streisand and his first song seem to be a great opportunity to be a new star, whose screen is very powerful and predefined to be compelling with Esther. . The same is true of its stylistic style, the script seems to be a material that drives a softer material for its growns, in order to support Sand Rock's other hard-core world. As the midst of the Oreos, he can not help himself as a famous star from the moment he raises himself. I can not forgive forgiveness because it is an unbelievable voice talent, but becoming a pardon will be more pronounced for Esther as it is more terrible when John Norman's problems are awful. Thus, in the final part of the film, it is dynamically unpleasant, which causes less effect on the climate event than the response to Esther. This is limited by eight-minute uninterrupted out of print performance. Unless John Norman's style finally claims, it's great. Kristofferson, on the other hand, gives excellent performance. Throughout the whole, he manages the degree of sincerity that is based on the film, and the love, pride and resentment of Esther causes feelings of feeling. In this context, he is working on staging his vodka. Otherwise, it's always strange to me about this version: what happened to each contributor did not exist as if they were going down in the background, they interacted with the two principles. Paul Mazursky is the CEO of John Norman and Gary Busey Bobbie. With regard to the old camera, Robert Surtees, he offers creative photography in cinemas, although he maintains the printed grape level. He is currently a salesman, a soundtrack that is a lie in different styles of the 1970s. Still some songs are pretty good ("Everything", "Woman in the Moon", "Watch Closely Now"), some of them changed to kitsch. "Royal Bee", Kenny Loggins "I Believe in Love") and, of course, an essential "Evergreen". <br /> <br /> The DVD transfer on DVD 2006 is clear and the sound is really crisp thanks to the digital remastering. Streisand's participation is the main attraction of the main components based on its length comment. Provides in-depth information on film information with interrogation and mixed production. In addition, Jon Peters, a hairdresser who became a teddy-maker, and who was pleased with Pierson, was very pleased. The scene can be directly related to the comments that are more accurate. Repeats the same mood when it strikes the mood, for example, the avid person is listening for the third time how the person who drives the person who is in Peters. The second comment I think could have drawn another nuggets. <br /> <br /> There is clothes to test the wardrobe that shows the fun clothes of the 1970s, especially Kristofferson's hundred pontoons and an orange polyester shirt. With Streisand's optional commentary, twelve scenes are deleted. One is a scene of comic bread for food, Streisand reminded me of what I like in the comedic farcical. Another scene is extended and "Evergreen" plays guitar faced by Kristofferson awestruck, and then slept. It's more interesting that the ending of music that includes fast cuts, I agree with Streisand. In the same way, theater launches in three versions of "A Star Is Born" are also included.
