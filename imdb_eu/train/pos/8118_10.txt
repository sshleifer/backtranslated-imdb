For the first time I saw in Germany some TV channels in 1975 and I immediately joined. Then I watched this movie 12 times in movie theaters, and now I have a video band that I watch every year. This film is excellent in all aspects (direction, acting, cut, musical score ...). The sets are remarkable and incredibly spectacular, it seems like an idea of ​​a devastating global war in the early 1930's, "Everytown" dictator Mussolini is pure and Raymond Massey is just as charming, compelling and ideal as "hero." Positive tones about technology and progress are usually very annoying by today's standard party - especially since my eyes have always played a tear or a scene, even though the film has seen so many times. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good television, but it has been done on the big screen, so you can watch it in some movies. please, it's over.
