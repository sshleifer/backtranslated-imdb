Probably this movie never slipped on the radar screen, but it's a good quality. It's very intense, but you think it's "the only movie". Duvall and Close are ordinary people and you should never realize that big-name actors are. It seems that the joke of this story is too old to continue with Eugen's girlfriend, but I think it's possible. It is possible that the child could not travel from Montana to Nevada-Nevada, but I think it is possible. You might think that family problems in this movie are never in your family, but I think it's possible. I remember Glenn Close saying that saying "your work is the hardest part of your life, but it's not."
