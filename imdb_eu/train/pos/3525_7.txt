Man, this is a tough DVD. I only found 2 in the region, in Spanish import, and it was expensive. <br /> <br /> Is it recognized? Well, yes. Although not so much a masterpiece of the film, Curt Siodmak has directed (credits on IMDb.com read "Robert", but the DVD's Curt credits list), or some of his famous murder mysteries. Elisha Cook, Jr. and Thomas Gomez - but the curiosity around the movie is because of curiosity. <br /> <br /> Basically, it has been a respected but autonomous engineer (Alan Curtis). He has been with her wife and is in a New York bar in the pocket for both shows. A woman with a strange chapel before her is sitting next to her, and politely invites her to review music. He admits, a bit dark. Mopey Bargain eyes eyes. <br /> <br /> In the exhibition, the amazing star shows that the star is wearing the same hat and anger will appear. The drummer of the group, Cook, looking at the silent lady, did not answer. Curtis takes him to his house and asks his name but he does not give it and he does not want to know her. If it was long devoted, it would have told something about the boats that were going through the night. <br /> <br /> Okay, Curtis goes home to find out how his wife has killed her absence. Gomez is in charge of police officers. His only cousin is that no one remembers a ghost lady: she is not a barkist, not a Latin star, nor a driver ("Al Alp"), not the battery and the lady himself. It's gone, it's impossible to punch. <br /> <br /> Curtis is convicted and dying. Gomez Inspector thinks things and is surely innocent, because anyone with a brain does not make up this stupid story. Ellis Raines Curtis's unbelievable secretary joins the case to informally investigate again. <br /> <br /> Visiting witnesses again. A disturbing Barcelona drives a car, perhaps unexpectedly; so it exits this image. Latina has left the heat because the show has closed and does not know the co-operative and the hat's fountain. Elisha Cook, Jr., strikes the real murderer, but does not appear before a scene that plays a drum in a jazz group. His sweat faces an expression that suggests a lively focus, but an enormous and orgastic blame. He threw his eye on the ceiling to the ceiling, as he was catching his mouth; I laughed loudly. <br /> <br /> Nobody has a very outstanding performance, but they are all professional. Thomas Gomez is always trustworthy. Best performance, probably by Franchot Tone. He is a real murderer and he makes his coffers fake. It is reserved and artistic. Even when it is beautifully decorated. I do not know how to put it in detail, but it seems that Tone is thinking about it, and simply taking part in it. Alan Curtis is zero as innocent engineer on the Kelvin scale and in Figure B. <br /> <br /> I do not know why it's considered classical. Cornell Woolrich's basic murder is really a mystery, not as good as others. But Siodma's direction is sensitive. A man runs and his whirlwind hat around the water. The use of shadows is silently effective. <br /> <br /> I'm glad.
