"Masks" is a floating movie that works on many levels. Its simpler is the story of a street performer who tries to connect with a young child, trying to spend his creative art (masks) next generation. Sometimes, although this story turns man into employment, so well-developed (written, dramatized, corrected, and marvelously valuable in production), it is easy to overcome his serious situation. And if it hangs with it, after all, the movie is very sweet and exemplary. To all areas. It's a wonderful movie for children and adults. They want to watch out for foreign language films like Americans!
