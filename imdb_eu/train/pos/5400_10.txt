At the end of Tokugawa Shogunate is a great lesson about Japanese history. He lost a lot of fighting against Shogunate when the loyalists lost a great fight against him, the emperor had to return to the throne against Japan. Actually, I had to read a lot of history to get all the background. <br /> <br /> Shinto Katsu (also known as the original Zatoichi), Izo Okada offers one of the best Hitok (= Humanity man). Slayer) Bakumatsu. Samurai is a simple one that loses all its riches. To take life, Takechi Holds Hanpei (Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke is in Doom Sword). Hanpei is an ultra-nationalist nationalist politician, Hitokiri's team has achieved a high level of Western politicians to achieve their political goals. Izo Okada continues his leader without questioning what they are doing. As long as he has the money to go and drink and spend his spouse. Okad's killings are getting steeper in the film, and he is proud that he has a reputation based on fear and wherever he goes there. <br /> <br /> It is a magnificent portrait of a simple samurai trapped in political things, and it is really naive to realize what happens. After the first betrayal and torture, and always speaking with Sakamoto (it is a samurai that denies violence), it changes its ideas and life perspectives. Too late ... <br /> <br /> See the movie Izo to see the end of Okada ... <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the staff give a great performance. Every actor gets his job done. The sword is very special and fast ... probably now fighting faster than several films ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Look at it if you can!
