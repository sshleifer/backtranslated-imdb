Film for today's audience The masses want to see what they see. Action, comedy, drama and, of course, vibrant scenes. This is not a movie that would feel comfortable with the whole family. It's not for children's eyes. I had to do a lot of scenes. <br /> <br /> If it's just the entertainment you're looking for, the movie has everything. The songs are catchy. I need to add huge production. <br /> <br /> However, the movie message is not universal. Karma emphasizes on the idea. That is, if you do good, you'll get a good one. If you do evil, you will get evil. The fruit of good works is good, evil fruit is evil. <br /> <br /> In true life, this is not always true. It is well known that most people do not get justice in this world. It is true that some evil people meet with the evil end, but many escape. And then, there are many people who do well and yet they feel at the end. <br /> <br /> If you do not care about the message, and what you want is to escape from the reality of the world. It's an entertaining movie.
