I agree with all the people who have said that this is the best spy genre. My husband and I were fascinated by the United States for the first time in the air and when we saw each section. At that time I tried to buy the series (everything had a tape), but the WGBH told me that it was not available. I've never written a copy Ian Holm could have had a copy! Like others, I bought and read Deighton series (to partially understand the plot). If the original version is available on DVD, I will be in the first line to get a copy. Bernard Samson weak, but daring, Ian Holm was amazing. (It's always amazing)
