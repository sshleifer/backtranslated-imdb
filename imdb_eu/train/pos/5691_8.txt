I was very interested in the movie that appeared for the first time in theaters, but I could not walk around it. So, in the end, he went into the shelves, and I received it. I do not know exactly what to expect, I dvd it to a player, set it to death tonight, and press Play. Then, it has been one of the most attractive books I've seen in the last two years. <br /> <br /> * BACK NEWS * <br /> <br /> This is the story of the murder of Wonderland. To the different parts of the LA and directly to the 70's, the most important porcine, John Holmes (Val Kilmer). <br /> <br /> I was hooked from the beginning, and the feeling of the film lasted me all the way. endless art I was surprised to see the death of the movies less real killings and more before and after these events. At first, in the face of a few deadly bloodthroughs and eventually the real murderers, the movies were a dialogue and a great entertainment show that was less attractive. Val Kilmer sells me as a junkie porn star, though "beautiful but that's it" was Bosworth's joy (and just his appearance, intelligence) <br /> <br /> I personally felt the best I said , the film's party identified his missing murders. He appeared in a very dark atmosphere, so you could not completely see four of the four sleeping babies. Moreover, the sound effects of these murders were more than enough to bleed appetite. They were playing lead tubes, much to be said. <br /> <br /> My only problem was the appearance of Carrie Fisher. It was a portrayal of religious imagination, I think, it is a little obvious that its appearance. Perhaps this person was part of the story, maybe not, but I was not on sale, and for some reason, Fisher seemed to be very "acward" in his portrait. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is worth the clock, though it's worth it! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
