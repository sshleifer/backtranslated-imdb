"Midnight Cowboy" Xak received an original version in 1969. There are some scenes to understand, a little. The Joe Buck (Jon Voight) movie about going to New York City in Texas is worrying. Dressed as a cow, he tries to earn money through love action. Does not work in the planned mode. A man named Rico Riso, Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), took a first trick and stole money, became friends. They live in an empty and empty apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe needs to make some money. <br /> <br /> Surely, the movie was the main theme, but we see some weird things. The edition of this movie is great. We see Joe and Ratso dreams sequences, in a real world without interruption, in a fun and agreeable way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and collaborators give great performances. Especially Hoffman offers some beautiful lines. The score is made by John Barry and is very good. All of which won the Academy Award for Best Feature for a good reason.
