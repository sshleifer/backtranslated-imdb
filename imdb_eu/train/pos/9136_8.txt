This is not as bad as some reviewers movie and as it says in the movie IMDB summary. Why? First of all, in 1984 filmmakers thought it was brave in the face of the domestic violence issue; So the reviewers who complain about the plot are missing a wonderful point. Second, without the element of the relationship between Prince's movie and his father, the climax of the music would not work as well - so that the reviewers who say good music lost one point again. - exactly, why it's so good ... all the music in this movie has an element of the back of the graphic that makes music more efficient. Third, give this movie a break! The first producer and director of the films is not bad! The movies that get the movies are much worse! And finally, the reviewers who say "good" music have also missed this point: look at style-style music treatments, variety, musicality and stage performing in Prince. I went to music, no one else was in the 80's, and with the work of other artists (costumes and movements: what items were costumes first, Michael Jackson or Prince?) Also, if you see your fingers. Prince faces this film before Quentin Tarentino's "Pulp Fiction". As a sum of its episodes, it's not a bad movie.
