** Be careful! Spoilers Ahead! ** <br /> <br /> The Short Film is one of the two sections that describe the short part of "Matrix", where Morpheus describes how the matrix was created. As we know the story, the plot is not surprising; And brief is not so entertaining information. This is presented as a file archive file. The screen is better than the average and, in general, cold colors contribute to the purpose of the short film. <br /> <br /> A couple's problem. Story violence is a bit unhelpful, and occasionally removes direct narrative from the short story from political correctness (UN scene). In addition, the second part must be observed. <br /> <br /> The concept of Animatrix is ​​excellent, and despite some issues, this short story still meets its purpose. It would not be included in original style, content, or stream into the original movie. This is the perfect method for reporting history. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: good information. They could say somewhat better, but still strong from 7 to 10.
