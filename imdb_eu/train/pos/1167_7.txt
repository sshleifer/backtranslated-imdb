Alain Delon quickly and surely sees the crime of a dirty family, because Duccio Tessari worked as a successful "Big Guns" thriller. Roberto Gandus, Tessaldi and Scenario, "A Minute to Pray, Big To Die," by Ugo Liberatore, and Franco Verucci, "Ring of Death", act as an actor on the career of the actor. In fact, "Big Guns" is predictable, but it is still classified as solid entertainment in many wild and sudden suddenly. Alain Delon's "The Godson" is a hands-on guy, because he decided to take him to death with the head of the family under the care of his husband and his young daughter. Richard Conte directs "The Godfather" to Sicily's crime, which wants to bury the ax with Delon, but the other strong partners want to kill the murderer together. As with the greatest crimes of the 1960s and 1970s, "Big Guns" crime does not pay off against film morality. Interestingly, when the man has not survived the murder of his wife and his son's death, another reveals himself to the hero, with extreme harm. Tessari does not waste in seconds in this 90-minute shoot. Even if your mother and son are not dying to a father-in-a-car bomb, the worst thing that happens is the car's rescue yard when a member of the hero gets into an absorbed car. After that, "Big Guns" is off, but it has a large number of bodies for the 1973 Mafia melodrama. At the last moment, only the protagonist has left the guard down, so the intelligent moral eye of an eye remains full. It's a couple of twisting vents of Tessaria and the death of a train that travels in the train tunnel is so bloody. They are great compositions and compositions.
