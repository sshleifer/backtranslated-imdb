I do not think I have to tell the story. It has been said in years and years. So I will only share my feelings. I saw Cinderella when I was five years old. Ever since then, I'm a Disney child in a good way. The animation now seems to be childhood and old, but now it's its charm. Nowadays, in high school Musical and computer-generated images, it seems people have forgotten the genius and magic of Disney's first film. Fortunately I was born before, so I went into this classic. It seems like it was the age, I'll be back to that five-year-old girl on VHS. What is the true magic of Disney?
