Simply one of the greatest films ever seen. It's a parody of the life of the crime, it's a parody of everything in Chicago in the 1930s. - There's no need to downplay this movie. Score is under 5. It is a mass opinion and hypnotizes the mass. Who decides to see - it will regret, who decides not to see it, it will regret it.
