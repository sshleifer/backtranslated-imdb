The movie was my interest, especially because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actor. I disagree with other posts that the plot was not mixed up. It was not a problem (that's why some people did not eat at night). The movie was very sad and moving. What else do you want? Alexa Davalos is a new tale (also beautiful), and Tom Everett Scott plays a great part in his part too. The relationship between mother and daughter may be realistic, but the youngsters of the film did not behave. It was tragically sad but enlightening. Surely there were other shows that came with the TV New Years Day afternoon
