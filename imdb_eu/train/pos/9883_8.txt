He made 8 seasons, but for the first time, at the beginning of 1959, and the last one, in the fall of 1965, was shorter than 2-7 years. William Paley, chief of the CBS, left Rawhide's first production of the first season of 1965, in September 1965, because Eric Fleming did not like Gil Favor. The CBS single radio broadcast of 1966, on January 4, 1966, began again. <br /> <br /> I often wondered why Rawhide did not make a color shoot for the last season? The greatest western parts of the 1960s began to bloom until 1965. CBS broadcasted in color in the autumn, for many of their sitcoms, but Westerns, such as Gunsmoke and Rawhide, remained black and white. Gunsmoke was the latest Western (and last-minute series of networks to change colors) on September 17, 1966 to make the Snap Decision cut.
