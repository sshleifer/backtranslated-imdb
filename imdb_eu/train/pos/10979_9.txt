This documentary follows the life of Big and Little Edie Beale until the middle of the 50s lived in the hamlet of the East Hampton family (NY). At the time the filmmakers meet, the house breaks down, and women, 78 and 56, share frightening rooms. Edie Beale's older Jackie Kennedy Onassis's aunt and younger is her first cousin. The women who were originally forced out of the house, because they were in a bad condition, but Jack sent money to repair them so they could live there. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, this movie seems to be exploiting, a woman has no women. It seems that mental health is the best, but in other cases, cinema is difficult to get away. "Little" Edie's mother responds to her current situation and her mother refuses Edie's success to believe she would never have been. "Little" Edie has been trapped in the past, often focusing on the choices made over the past decades, and she loves to show photographs in her youth. There, clearly, it was a great debut. It seems that his mother resigns more than his fate, to live the awful conditions of life. There are temporary hints of glamor in life, just like women, from images that show a happy family, next to the great portrait of old Edie. Since we see the house, most of the rooms are empty, the walls crack and fall, and "Little" Edie chamber burns food for the party. And, of course, there are many cats around. <br /> <br /> By heart, this documentary is very sad. The fact that women do not feel themselves self-differentiated throughout life is that the life they live is terribly frightening. It is not clear if the house is running water, and the family feel they are basically abandoned. <br /> <br /> However, as a documentary, the movie is amazing to watch. , and it is highly recommended.
