This is my first review on IMDb. I did not want to write it, but for this excellent movie just 2 right now, I feel forced to go into my vision ... and no, I'm not related to film authors in any way (yes, how many times did you do here before ;-)) FYI I'm at the end of the 20s. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have to admit that I like animated movies. You see that the imagination of the creators is only limited and very imaginative here. It's not so in terms of story, but it's a very visual and unique style. The characters look good, but they are not real, and the movie works well, after all, it's a fairytale. However, in general and in general, the world is filled with spectacular symbols when my cheeks have fallen more than once. Bunny-blue dragon shows the show and has some of the funniest moments in the movie. It's still a classic, similar to Scrat Ice Age. The story is not surprising (it is necessary to get the biggest dragon you can imagine a series of anti-heroes), but who looks after the movie looks and sounds good ;-) is not a good movie for many children, with darker scenes in it and 6-8 years I would say it was terrifying for underage children. These are very few scenes but it is essential to mention imo. However, I saw a very good time and I can not wait to see it at high-level stores just for its beauty. <br /> <br /> 8.5 for me
