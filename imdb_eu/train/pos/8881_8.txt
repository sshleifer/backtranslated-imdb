First of all, films made in 1995 must be taken into account. The characters were proud, and that is their flair. <br /> <br /> Remy's teenage girl was socially wrong. and until he was acquainted with it, until the Nazis filled him with art and helped him until he was. They took them to the Nazis. The Nazis are not so difficult, but like most gangs, they fail the financial, social, and emotional gap, whatever. Michael Rappaport played well. <br /> <br /> It was a hot star shot by Omar Epps, with doubtful work ethic and shoulder. He continued to feel painful and painful, and he was able to direct his girlfriend and teacher over him. <br /> <br /> Kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and join her until she was trying to force her until she was trying. He then discovered his self-experiment with his sexuality and politically involved. <br /> <br /> This movie deals with racism and, like most of the things associated with racism, people's views will be considered. <br /> <br /> I read some comments about the "bad black", but the bad guys (Nazis) were there. And what? Remy was not badly portrayed, trying to find the way, and failed to accept some skinhead. He was afraid, he felt sad how he did to see him. Although he says before his death, I do not mean to be an engineer. <br /> <br /> Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were angry with black men, the Ice Cube was intellectual, and Busta Rhymes was simply depicted as a dumb boy. Both of them did not consider the roommate for the roommates and, in general, it seemed like no white ones. He was as angry as the Nazis, but not in the rank of Nazis in general wickedness. Sorry, this seems to be unfair, but if there are black groups like the Nazis? No <br /> <br /> People say that white = - black is the opposite = good. It is not true, the only bad characters were the Nazis and the police, which is roughly true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (omar epps roommate) was a guy, and Remy was a good man, it was right. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were serious characters. angry and wrong. The continuing persecution of the police justified their anger. According to Remy's inability, it seems that he had to justify his anger. <br /> <br /> A good movie, well made. Like all the movies related to prosecution, it's a great piece of discussion. <br /> <br /> I do not think Cube and Busta have overcome the Nazis.
