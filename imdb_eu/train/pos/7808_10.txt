It's a movie that everyone should watch. In addition to raising important points important (while South Africa is still in the process of recovery, there are still many countries still in the same situation), Denzel Washington is very well-directed, which I believe will be the best performance in his career so far. Kline gives a good performance, even if it's so amazing in Washington. John Thaw is also a good governor. <br /> <br /> There are so many areas until an apartheid movie has fallen, but this has all been avoided. It would be easy for white people to portray good people bad and black people, but Attenborough did not do that. Certainly, there were some white characters, of course Soweto's captain of the uprising, but all the additional characters added to the movie. Some people complain about the length of the film, but I think we need two and a half hours to tell the whole story. It's really incredible. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the movie is the funeral of Steve Biko. When the whole town starts singing the South African anthem, it's probably one of the floating scenes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie already: see. It may not be convenient to see it, but definitely worth it.
