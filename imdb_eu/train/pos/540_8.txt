really ... "video camera" is just that effect, it's an effect, it's pretty good ... (do you not know how to direct a movie too much?) This movie is better than the original. It's very funny to watch television for television, it does not have to follow any rules. It's hard to see number 1 because of killing the first girl, worrisome. and while Judd Nelson walks along the road, the viewers are on their way. Someday, we'll see the lake's third cab, but I doubt it. Seeing this movie is how you can understand real movies, because it looks like a film that is part of a movie. Judd is one of the most evil ones, and it is realistic, it does not ditch people like other horrors.
