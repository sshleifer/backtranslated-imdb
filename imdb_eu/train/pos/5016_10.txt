This movie is one of my favorites. It's hard to explain why. Maybe Corin Nemec's innocence and Cherk Pollak's courage are paired, but it's something with the soundtrack. Similarly, some characters have little or no line or movement. In the end, the story is always tightening my heart, and the last scene is so sour. In short, I love this movie; It is perfect for the girls and girls of the most fascinating and sentimental girls.
