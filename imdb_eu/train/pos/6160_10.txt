SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I saw the extended version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. I liked the long version, but I'd like to leave the original version on DVD. <br /> <br /> Portabello Road can reduce the original length. It was too long and it dragged the movie. It's a great dance, though it would be much better as a scene removed from the DVD. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is wonderful. My 5 year old liked it. And it's wonderful that movies that I enjoyed as a child go back to a new generation. This and Mary Poppins will be added to my collection. <br /> <br /> As I remembered! <br /> <br /> *** outside **** <br /> <br />
