A century old Italian artist and, above all, an artist, a woman from Artemisia, at that time, was a non-film-maker for women, and dared to paint her nude with her unique musculature. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The camera's work is inside the house, especially when the artists worked. There are great shots. The antecedent of the candlestick suggests the beautiful work of classical painters and it is wonderful to see the painters and their students protect themselves from scaffolding in the details of the frescoes. It is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film (costumes, faces, make-up) are very wonderful, since the Italian churches have preserved all these details for centuries. Artemisia, beautiful artist Tassi, under her great Florentine flower, has to learn Artemisia, a magnificent view and a landscape that has become an expert in art (something new), but Artemisia introduces Artemisia into more than one of the most unbelievable Artemisia techniques. After his position, Tassi raped him violently. Father is angry. The judicial process continues. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a pretty simple story, endless. The outstanding feature of the film preserves its artistic presentation and details. They add wonderful effects to scenes like children's costumes and their costumes. <br /> <br /> Artemisia pleases herself; He paints his father to please others. In this movie, I think I'd like most.
