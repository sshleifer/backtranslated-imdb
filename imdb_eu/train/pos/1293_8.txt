It's a great movie about lonely man's loneliness. Phillipe Harel, Notre Heros, Robert de Nirok, Taxi Driver, Clouseau Auditor (Stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner Being There (Peter Sellers). He's still alone, but he does not realize how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, he really does not make any effort! <br /> <br /> It has a situation and fatalism that challenges the ever-ending hope. - Jose Tisserand, his friends, is in the same situation, but strives to overcome at least an extended virgin (at age 28 and never accept sex). <br /> <br /> Paris very good outdoors in Rouen, where the software travels in two businesses. They try several nightclubs and places, but in vain. I try to mislead my theory: they go to "youth" night clubs; elderly people should try their kind of elderly people. <br /> <br /> Harel becomes increasingly isolated and Niro makes a little effort, just like Taxi Driver; has a nice nightlife with a nightclub. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it with pleasure.
