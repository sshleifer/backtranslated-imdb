The "SG-1 Stargate SG-1" follows an intergalactic exploration of a group called SG-1 using a Stargate device and all the pending awaiting pangs of the worm pit. <br /> <br /> Once this series has been seen occasionally After the first seasons are coming, I did not know how much the series could be, when I saw it in the last 10 years. My series of old impressions was great, but my impression was not far from true. "Stargate SG-1" is more than just a series of science fiction series, which is one of the most well-made, interesting, long-running and most exciting science fiction ever produced. And why? Because it works in an amazing premise. <br /> <br /> The value of this series went far beyond the movie and I think it is a good example of this TV, as a medium, with the right premise. Time is not working on the limitation of the movie limitation. The sense of knowledge generated by a series of long-term sustainability is surprising to see the characters and their circumstances over time, and adds credibility to the ability to break, and a great handwriting and all the crew work great. show. The "Stargate SG-1" adventures were offered over the past 10 years, but never feared it had a lot of time and challenge to move on to the plot. : <br /> <br /> - The first seasons, perhaps until 4/5, were much more exploring on planetary exploration and in different situations, as the episodes were relatively unrelated, if they were unrelated to Goaul'd threats. <br /> <br /> - From 5 to 7, there has been an increasing number of attacks against Goaul'd and the prevention of Earth attacks. After these seasons, planetary exploration was just an excuse for sg-1 Goaul'd / replicator / ori in a place of conflict. <br /> <br /> - Season 8 is probably the worst. It includes some current episodes of terrestrial topics, in which stargate is hardly mentioned, but the last episodes are moments of great replication. <br /> <br /> - Traveling 9th and 10th the same enemy and not Jack O'Neil. Both are good followers, although the first episodes of the 10th season are weak, because they are less than SG-1. Conflict of conflict after the war after Ori. <br /> </> Basically, after the seventh season, exploration was pushed into a backdrop, in many ways embarrassed by potential and mystery of every planet (episode); On the other hand, he has made changes to the character of the spectacle that has been working on the great episodes of constant conflict and shows how big and thick the writers have been. We have a high quality finish that rests on; For I can continue to feel; The implicated people were great professionals and the serial narration offered a lot. Last season the series's initial character was very easy and good, but eventually they are among them. <br /> <br /> In the end, like everything I liked, it's a bit difficult to finish. However, the picture that draws on the work done by hundreds of people in ten years is beauty and a true testimony to the crew, excellent actors and always mindful characters. as a collective SG-1.
