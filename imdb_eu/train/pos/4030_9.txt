This movie was absolutely wonderful. The pre-seasonal and cultural partitions have been very beautiful. Urmila has given another great performance. What I really admire about this movie is not that it's bashing in Pakistan, such as in movies like Gadar and LOC. Partition as a backdrop, the movie is not diverted to political issues, or focusing on violence, direct or wrong. The movie is always the story of Urmila's life. The fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai has been very well represented. The movie really shows how the Hindus and Muslims, people who have suffered this partition. The only subject of religion is a very important subject in this film.
