Even if you know anything about Ireland, you love "My Left Foot" (and especially Daniel Day-Lewis's performance). The brain-palsy plays Christy Brown. That's why he has spent most of his life. When people try to warn you, they laugh at you. In his darkness, the light controls a part of a body: the left foot. He uses the attachment to paint and write poems, taking the lead. <br /> <br /> The director Daniel Day-Lewis and Jim Sheridan worked very well for this collaboration and later collaborated: "Father's name" (but "Boxer" was not necessary). "My left foot" feels in many ways: sad, hopeful or something else. In any case, Daniel Day-Lewis yielded his entire life. An excellent movie in every way.
