We start all our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 films per year in the last 15 years. Recently, at any time, we received at no cost at any of the films. So we can see everything we want when we want. Consequently, KRITIKA ZERO tells. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert are not you and me. The only difference is that they write about the movie and they need to watch hundreds of movies, whether they like it or not. So we think that we have two hours worth of money, that's enough. with us! We have never heard or read criticisms. We only take care of those who are known as ours and ourselves as ourselves. That's pretty good. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. Not only good but very good. Critics are slogans. They only hated heads and tongues. It's worth the ticket price and you can ask for it. Is not this? Not all films can be nominated for an Academy Award. Sharon is a beautiful stone and works great in the movie and they ask what hell they want from critics
