I watched this film in 2001 at the Toronto International Film Festival. The work title was "Dog Days". The public reaction was confused. Some people thought that graphic sex and realistic violence were too much. Others seemed real movie was good. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for low hearts. It's like an explicit sex like 'happiness' and a more positive view of humanity. There are animal poisoning in the elderly bandage, commercial, in the penetration of candles, and the adulteration of mental abilities. To handle too much, this movie is not for you. This film shows how desperate and pathetic humanity is. We must throw away our insignificant existence to our most memorable faces. <br /> <br /> Seidle here is not interested in saving man. And why did he need it? We have excellent performances for everyone involved, it is always interesting and surely the greatest social expression in the film.
