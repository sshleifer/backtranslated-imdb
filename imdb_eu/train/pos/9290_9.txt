This is not the type of movie that John Wayne knows. He plays a diplomat, a man who makes words and words more than physical action. The film moves with a calm realism using its unexplained story story. <br /> <br /> Open, patient and thoughtful, the film is a rich representation of an interesting part of the historical history. <br /> <br /> Two stories are mixed together. A great story is Japan, an insulative and insular, and their interests that are full of American outreach are in conflict. The little human story is like the hostility of the beginning of a barbarian outcast (Wayne) and Geisha, and he likes to return to mutual respect and love. The human story is a reflection of the great story of both nations. <br /> <br /> The movie is very well made and all actors act well. The two main roles are perfected. John Wayne is an excellent blend of strength and negotiation in Townsend Harris, especially in Japanese businesses. Eiko Ando is also an excellent geisha of the title, charming and enjoyable. The interaction between his character and John Wayne is very well illustrated. This is exactly how these two would be played (as they appear in the film). <br /> <br /> The script is very well written. All pompons are missing and it is realistic to indicate how the events depicted. The characters are real people who are not "big" figures in history. In addition, they are depicted with great skill and nuances of culture and interest. Indeed, the collision between traditional and powerful Japan, a powerful and powerful newcomer to the whole of the ocean, is very well illustrated by John Wayne and the Japanese Baron exchange. Wayne charges the sinking sailors to crash into the Japanese land, and the boats can not get into the water. Baron replied that he wants to stay alone in Japan. This character of Wayne has an increasingly important international crossing of Japanese shipping and it is said that nations, as well as nationally, are not considered to be a band of attacking a major road. The real summary of the two countries' views on the right side, and they saw that the other was wrong. Two people with conflicting interests are just a collision between cars, in their history, their thoughts, a constant theme for the future. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and XIX. Representation of Japan in the middle of the century. Before the rapid growth of industrialization that was to be followed in the early 20th century, it's brilliant. An overwhelming vision and a fascinating insight into ancient Japanese civilization. <br /> <br /> I recommend anyone, whether it's a fan of John Wayne, if you can watch this movie. Please note that it is not an action movie. Historically, it is a representation of a place and an interesting era, and a slow love story, impressed with them, dominates the personal life of the two main characters. Check out this movie with its merits, without a budget, let yourself be immersed in the story, and you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie.
