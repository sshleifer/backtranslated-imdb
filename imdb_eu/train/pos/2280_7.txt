Films classified hard: maybe spy-thriller is a vanguard? Mother Night Vonnegut is a very good novel, and definitely one of her novels is longer. Film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. The idea of ​​how the "indie" approach is produced will probably be more effective than financing a large Hollywood studio. These days, an intelligent novel by Mother Night would doubt the light of the big Hollywood grinding houses. And it's usually bad, but not in this case. Mother's Night has a tight direction and good throw. Nick Nolt seems to make the best roles while older, yet all the characters have a wide variety of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and excellent as always. I always thought that it was worth the fun outing. The debut of former Twin Peaks as a dead woman is not a roulette option, even though it is a small television phenomenon. However, this film is very enjoyable and you do not have to read the book to understand the movie. In reality, given the current geopolitical reality, the premise of the novel can be revealed, and young audiences who have little knowledge of history will be confused about the events that happened (I'm talking to you, your fellow Americans and the least students, geography, history and the world of the lord The industrialized knows what other issues!).
