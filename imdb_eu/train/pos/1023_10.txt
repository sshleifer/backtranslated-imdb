The show has been a reality in the last ten years. I'll miss you unfortunately. Atlantis has hit a small hole, though. <br /> <br /> The last episodes of the SG1 (even though television) got stained. Robert wrote something he felt about reality. As he explained in the way he was in the exhibition. (All those who work together for a long time are up and down but have become a family for years). I thought it was a wonderful way for others to criticize. <br /> <br /> SG1 was something special, and it took me over and over again between credibility and surprise sections. Character, stories, directors, wonderful writers. From one step on, I was a fan. Action, science, drama and, above all, comedy mixes worked so well, I would like more. <br /> <br /> There is no word for this to say what this concept means to me. I only appreciate those who keep so much the show so fresh and funny every year. I think it was impossible to do a lot of things I thought. <br /> <br /> I expect the movies I expect this year and I hope there will be many of them. Never will the show die. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
