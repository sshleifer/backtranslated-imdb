I watched "Brother's Shadow" at the Tribeca Festival and two days later I continued to think about it. The story of a surprised woman (Scott Cohen), returning to personal furniture business furniture of his family, after being imprisoned, offers all the necessary features of a drama - memorable characters; a sharp and intelligent conversation; The visual use of the camera through a vision-flicker filmmaker. <br /> <br /> But there is more than one thing that is rare in multiplexed days: a compelling vision of mature sensitivity. It seems that Todd S. Yellin is the director and screenwriter talent, but we have the sense that he has paid his fees (as his main character). He knows how real people live in this world, and knows how to see or, at least, have a successful experience. However, Yellin is too adept at seeing our backs happy to infect. In the end, Jake's victory is not a commissue, nor is his family appreciation, but "at work" can not be ignored. <br /> <br /> This is a key theme that can not be raised above the "bottom line" of the world (and especially the film industry). He deserves a great public movie.
