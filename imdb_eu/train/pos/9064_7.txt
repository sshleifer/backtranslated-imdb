I sat down with my children when we saw the movie. We've all found a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> When Billy goes to a new school, fifth-degree harassment begins with one thing, and that's what it's like to eat worms. <br /> <br /> A bet is made and Billy has so much time to eat 10 eggs or not. From that moment, the bully and his friends try to create bad ways to cook, fry or worms. Billy will try to get sick and he will lose his bet. <br /> <br /> Billy keeps strong and will eat. He likes his way, he likes more and more, as well as bullies friends. <br /> <br /> I do not say he has won the bet or not ... you should see it, but if you want good family movies, you'll like it. <br /> <br /> PS Leave me this movie, not only for boys but also for my daughters, and they liked it a lot.
