When I saw the Birthday Girl, I could see all that Nicole Kidman liked so much, just in comparison to finding them all against them. While the presence of a certain star guarantees a certain level of quality, I am theorizing, for artistic control, and the impact that Nicole Kidman has on film is a delight to the delight of IMHO. Thus, for example, Dogville prevents anything spectacular from the viewer that prevents the existence of the idea of ​​the home, or removes the license from other films worthy of other people's attention or other reasons. <br /> <br /> She is a natural woman and she works very well. I do not know how or who could not stop him, but he apparently worked. The film shows its openness, although its resistance becomes a woman. And, as a result, the hopes of human beings do not get any. <br /> <br /> Of course, the male leader becomes the Milktoast secretary in a macho man, in the space of a movie, it seems to be a fantasy of male fantasy, but the transformation is compelling. He's not guessed as he's going to be in a movie designed to bolster men's males. Instead, it records the necessary growth of the unique circumstances of the films. <br /> <br /> Likewise, it is very pleasing that the criminals portray human perfection, apart from their criminal mission. He aims to bring his gang into a foreign American culture. And while they are their opponents, they are never really their enemy. In particular, they teach to compete competing. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by Kidman's ability to physically appear in Russian. She asked me whether she was a Russian girl or not, but there was no suggestion that I did not even photograph. Maybe it's just makeup, but it's amazing. <br /> <br /> I hope only to soon get rid of another big movie. Despite the hand of Mrs. Kidman, the message is that it's all over the movies and probably for a lifetime.
