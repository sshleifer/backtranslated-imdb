In some cases, the mind has the power to expand the mind, to warm the heart and touch the soul itself. This is the "LOU" movie. "LOU" I got my wife to be a resident of a movie business. He watched me for the second time. We were both fascinated. For the first time as if it were again. <br /> <br /> "LOU" is a magical piece designed to send you all your drama at any time. It does, however, it's boring. He plays as a director of Bret Carr and walks away from the screen. With a Bugs bunny that disarms a character, such as stuttering innocence, but a warmlyer forgetfulness such as underplayed with honesty you're forgetting that you're forgetting that you are forgetting. When Epiphany hits the climax, my wife's tears I saw for the second time. <br /> <br /> As a life coach, I am facilitating individual growth and transformation, and this film must be "seen". Looking for life coaches and personal growth and transformation. It's an excellent and creative masterpiece with life-changing power!
