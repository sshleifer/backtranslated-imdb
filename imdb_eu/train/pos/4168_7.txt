This movie does not feature a great movie title; In the 70's, Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards are the third in the children's show. I remember this film, which was aired at the 78th edition of Halloween, that is stranging to Linda Blair Stranger's House. For the first time, I missed watching other movies. Later, after repeating it, I saw that I made the right choice. The movie is not really bad, but it's really no frost or surprise. Although Richard Crenna liked the scene that won the family dog.
