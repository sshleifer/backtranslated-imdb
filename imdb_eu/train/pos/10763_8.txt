I must admit that I am very skeptical about this documentary. I hope that all propaganda in the United States is what we like. I was wrong. This is NOT propaganda, in fact, it's hardly a political one. <br /> <br /> It describes events of 9/11 when aviation failed in the eyes of firefighters called firefighters. This documentary is a huge coin that has been filmed! This film was presented as a document about "a man" of an initial firefighter. We would like to thank our filmmakers that they continue their work during their great previous session. <br /> <br /> A great job. Amazing material It is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Okay,
