When I got the N64 for the first time I was five or six, I fell in love with it, and my first game was Super Mario 64. I RETRIEVED! Graphics were great times, good plots, excellent courses and highspeed. All the best music I've ever heard in a Nintendo game. <br /> <br /> I do not fully remember the plot, but I think that Peach Princess Bowser kidnapped her and Mario must rescue her. The game is about to get 120 stars from the castle curse. He has either had six giants to get the stars. There are secrets of the castle, where you can get more stars. But of course you won Bowser. * I think that Bowser has three levels to overcome: * Let's start with characters. Most people are the most important and helpful Toad tips, so it's basically one of your alliances. I play Luigi and Yoshi in the game. to the end. The bad one is Bowser, and there are other characters like Boo and Goomba. The characters are very exquisite. <br /> <br /> Next, how are Graphics? The behavior of people is a key element in graphics, and I totally agree. But with great plot, there are excellent graphics. Especially the time is. The other game like Nintendo is like Nintendo 007 compared to Super Mario. Light colors, great effects and wonderful sound effects. I have found very good graphics for water courses. Next to the Bowser world, it has the best graphics for the game. <br /> <br /> Now, music. This is my favorite part of my game. At birth, when I played it at a young age, I was happy that I could sleep the whole night the whole night. Jolly Roger Bay, very peaceful and wonderful. There are other great ones, especially those with Bowser, which I like most and my favorite ones. <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite past time as a developer and I love it. This game gets 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) GO PLAY THE GAME!
