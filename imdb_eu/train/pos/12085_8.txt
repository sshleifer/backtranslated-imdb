Shirley MacLaine in a custom made role. As a single-mom aunt of a Chicago neighborhood in 1962, the veteran actor pulls out another work, as a woman who does not lose any spirit of success as a woman to retreat. Children, adolescents and a young girl are attracted to the aunt Zoe, although they learn the same magic tricks and jokes and apply them in all the wrong choices, they are eliminated from school. <br /> </ br> The Earth is clear in Cuba's Cuban crisis, with all social implications. Men built bombs for refuge, a single TV show, dinner, and fear and fear in the air, as a whole, were seen by television only. When a miracle "harmless" is thrown out of proportion, however, the effect of the climate feels the viewer. Yes, Virginia, the sun will come tomorrow! Clearly there is a small budget production, which is still a sweet little movie, which was filled with magical magic made on Sunday Matinees. With the "Oldies" option that is thrown into an effective soundtrack, the whole family can enjoy this. ****
