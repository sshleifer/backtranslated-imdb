Whoopi was the only reason I saw the Oscars of that year. It's horny Of course, it was a serious side of the show. It was wonderful because it was not only fun, but it was said that there were certain things to be said in a public forum. White people should be reminded of the ceremonies, jobs and representation of the Hollywood awards, leaving them out of balance. The awards are not "black". White bread, Milk Squad and judges must see the sun and the excellent material to be seen are limited to "whites", directors, producers, actors, etc. Woody Allen was in the depths of delight in the air. There was no business. In fact, this is the first Oscar presentation I saw since I was awarded "The Color Purple". Invalid voting events in 2002 when they saw shows. Undo what other presenters unlinked. Billy Crystal is a rebellion.
