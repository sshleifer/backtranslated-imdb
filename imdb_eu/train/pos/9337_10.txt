This series is "something different". Sometimes the European series are less accurate than the US, but this time the authors have come up with the right purpose, creating a mix of lightweight work. Edel & Starck is great, it has everything: an excellent plot, smart lines, incredible, always well-distributed, amazing theater time, all the best Berlin stars and photos, one of the most interesting cities in the world. Playing is how justice works in other areas of the United States, and once you "feel" the old way of dealing with Europe. Guess all the young people and all the groups that are looking for a good comedy that will come for years to come. The German series looks super.
