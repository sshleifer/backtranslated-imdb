All Radiofrequency is a movie, our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our dependencies, our fears. It's a great movie, where a group of friends like you all live in a small town that lives through life through the difficulties of one of the most significant of the last decade. The movie does not take things happy or sad, it tells us a story, everything we all lived. Happiness and enthusiasm, sadness and pain. The power of this story is when we love the characters, it is one of the films you can watch again and again, feeling a little closer to Emilia Romagna. One day, we intend to walk along the streets with Freccia and his friends, the radio that changed the world, through an old Radio Raptus International radio, playing dreams and dreams. Radiofrequency will make you laugh, sometimes it will make you cry, it will shock you and bring you, it will give you and take you. Personally, I think they have played an important role in my life and my friends, and I suggest that you see everything and become yours.
