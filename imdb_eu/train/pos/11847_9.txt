The horse is a beautiful animal. The picturesque representations of wild horses and their grace could never have been in an animated film. <br /> <br /> Animation is just amazing. Beautiful animations make up the backdrop of horse-dancing. However, when the scaffold crosses the vast terrain, it crosses the cliffs and the braves. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very impressive. You are grateful for the wonderful instrumental music movie. <br /> <br /> "They say the western story is written from a horse's horse". Well, the story of a fine horse was written from the western horse. <br /> <br /> Finally, the best movie is clear. I have one of the best animated films. I've seen them. In a solitary night it would be a great choice. 9/10 easy.
