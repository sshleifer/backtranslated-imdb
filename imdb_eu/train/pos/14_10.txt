This film has a special place in my heart, for the first time, I was teaching adult literacy. It was very true to me and I was also an excellent student at that time. Suddenly, there are scenes that thrill you with emotion and smile on your face, through the identification and situation of the characters. <br /> <br /> The great performances of Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro with their best works, a wonderful atmosphere of a young Martha Plimpton, inspiring story line and amazing musical score offer a pleasant and rewarding experience. .
