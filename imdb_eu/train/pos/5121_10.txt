I'm a fan of the movie, not for usual reasons. I think that Travolta and Winger were higher than the average rates, I think the groups are representative of the location and time, they liked the soundtrack and Charlie Daniels Band. However, I think photography was amazing! The inner scenes were shot at the current club, and Gilley had low ceilings - perhaps 10-12 feet high and smoke filled with smoke was used to smoke 2-4 feet below the ceiling. The camera got smoke and the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dance, the dance, the low level of attention. What to do Surely, there was a lighting assistant, but to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it was clear. Ray Villalobos (camera operator) was outstanding! He got some shots that did not hope to get it and their influence brought the reality to the movie. Thank you, Ray - Great job!
