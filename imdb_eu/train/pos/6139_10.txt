Excellent movie Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, songs are wonderful, dances are special mentions of "Portobello Ballet". Regarding the animation section, the game between animals has become an instant classic; The supremacy of the army's attack is horrible and brilliant. I recommend viewing a 134 minute retrieved or at least 112 minute video. Here, in Italy, we only have a 98-minute version, although the movie was presented in a 117-minute version. If possible, check out the German video box at the same time: it's 98 minutes since the beginning, but it's about World War II, and all the English and Nazi invaders!
