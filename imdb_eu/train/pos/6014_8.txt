Here are ZP's plots, plays, wood, the scene of the orchestra makes no sense, and so on. Here's the main point here. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest. It is a movie made in Los Angeles at the end of the 1960s and early 1970s. It is a movie seen while your H-I-G-H puts you in psychedelic substance. <br /> <br /> Find out how much grass and smoke or have a mild acid. Seriously, ZP's straightforward review and Xelok lose that. You can not move this movie out directly. <br /> <br /> While the movie was seen on the big screen (until I saw the fortune I made in the nineties), ZP was very strange to escape, you do not know what this movie is about. <br /> <br /> It is not poisoned so you can continue to see it, when at the bottom it sounds bad, at least you appreciate it. A wonderful work called "Careful With That Ax, Eugene" by Pink Floyd, "Come to number 51, it's time for you."
