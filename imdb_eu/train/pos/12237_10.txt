It's a fascinating and fascinating movie-like movie game. Hollywood has to examine the charming version of this movie. I would see my wife and I. <br /> <br /> This is a great romantic comedy when we watched my wife and I met at AMC. <br /> <br /> This movie has Tony Randall's best. Debbie Reynolds is great, as always. <br /> <br /> I love it. We want to request a DVD to add larger film cycles. <br /> <br /> Very bad Hollywood does not put such films anymore. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood ... write some of these types of script from old security, update it a bit (without spoiling the first movie and other scripts with other remakes) and ask for a questionnaire. <br /> <br /> A remake would be a great success on the silver screen, the DVD and the cable / SATTV. <br /> <br /> SN Austin, TX
