With all television violence and local news, having a non-violent or adult-language show is refreshing, but it's still fun. My kids can see it with the weekend. Each one of us has our favorite cooks and judges. We all like Elton Brown. The main ingredient is the background of the special vegetable and seasoning season. We play at home to guess who will be the winner. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent time to entertain, as well as information. Just in the life of our population, an hour goes by with the family.
