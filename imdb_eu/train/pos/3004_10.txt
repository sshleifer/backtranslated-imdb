Philo Vance (William Powell) helps fix many murdered people after a dog show. <br /> <br /> Usually, I mix mysteries too (like this) but I love this movie. Moving very fast (just 72 minutes), Michael Curtiza directs it (with a lot of narrative speeds that use a lot of camera scams), he has a very simple story line (just like the solution of an immortal murder). ) and it is very good. <br /> <br /> Powell is very enjoyable and magnificent as Vance: it does not play acting - it's Vance IS! Mary Astor does not do much, but she adds class and beauty to production. All others are very good, but it's best for Eugene Pallette Heath as a detective. He is a very good actor, with a distinctive voice and some of his lines were ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Basically, a brilliant mysterious Hollywood murder in the 1930s. It's worth seeing. <br /> <br />
