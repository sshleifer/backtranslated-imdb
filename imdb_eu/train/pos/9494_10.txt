I recommended the owner of WHITE FIRE in two new DVD releases and VHS. He said he is one of the fun and entertaining low-budget entertainers. Overall, I did not know that movies would be bad, but I made an exception for this ... and I was very happy I did that. <br /> <br /> My father fills up with an act (much surprisingly, gracefully gory), sleaze (with a highly insulated female character key, but it's not so hilarious in one scene) and a daring darling is all that laughter adds it to induce the tone of the film. Ginty, THE EXTERMINATOR (and a multidisciplinary action series) has an unusual strange star, funny, and best performing performance. Williamson is better than usual, clearly undeniable (and not half way). The rest of the castes is also very fun to watch, especially the evil ones, one of them is a sixth sadist, with an accent that seems confused with Spanish and Italian. He does not precious. <br /> <br /> <br /> Once again, I can not stress it was quite horrible. It is not so bloody that it is nauseating, but it is very rare for some parts of violence to start a shoot-off with some mines, and soon nobody will forget the serious torture sequence. Likewise, when Ginty loves bad drives, he drives a short chainsaw, and the different moments that follow are encouraged by all his enthusiasts and throws their beers. <br /> <br /> Don WHITE FIRE is missing you. It's a classic action without a stalked head.
