When I heard about the title, I thought of "The Simpsons", like many other reviewers, but I was completely surprised when I saw it in the cast, they would be so great a character! First, we have Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction), a character named McBain. He has rescued his friends from POW-Camp in Vietnam, one of whom is Santos (Chick Vennera, Yanks), who splits HONDU DOLAR BILL with McBain (the Vietnamese soldier will be charged with money) and tells him he'll be able to make it reputable again, never trouble if it has <br /> <br /> Then, 18 years later, Santos and his sister Christina (Maria Conchita Alonso, Runner, Predator 2) join the rebels. In Colombia, trying to get rid of his evil dictator, El Presidente (Victor Argo, Taxi Driver, King of New York), and when Santos misses the mission, he goes to Christina McBain for help. <br /> <br /> McBain, then, the good friend of Vietnam asks you to help him. First of all, Eastland was the director of the film "The Exterminator" by James Glickenhaus, director of the film "American Ninja" Steve James, where he was the real name of the destroyers Eastland. I do not think so. On the other hand, there are many other references to The Exterminator, such as that McBain will wear a solder mask, when Christina sees it for the first time when it is working on the soldiers. a bridge! <br /> <br /> Other Vietnamese packages include: Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers), who can afford all kinds of equipment. , Dalton, (it looks like Jay Patterson does not look like a boy with the IMDb, and I have not seen it in other movies, so who knows), and in the end there is no police officer, Gill. Undoubtedly, Thomas G. Waites, many of us The one who recalls The Warriors and The Thing has had enough work. <br /> <br /> And in other important roles, we also find Luis Guzman (Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way) as a small drug that can not be decent at work. He is also a driller who cleans himself on a roof of Dick Boccelli McBain, just like John Eastland's meat mill. exterminator-movie! I have not yet seen Glickenhaus "Shakedown / Blue Jean Cop", but I am almost ready to bid for half the bill of this movie! <br /> <br /> Well, come back to the plot of this movie ... They will go to Colombia and save it for the day! However, who is responsible for the plot, it's a great cast, and the action scenes are very well done and you never get bored watching this movie! It's highly recommended for all lovers of action!
