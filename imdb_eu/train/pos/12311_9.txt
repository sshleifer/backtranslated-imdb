"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of Hong Kong's most amazing films ever seen. Fantasy, comedy, love affair, horror and martial arts is an excellent mix. He has wonderful movies and awesome battles. I especially love the fight. The scene between the Wu Ma and the tree daemon language.Truly cool movie and original and another Embalmer's fine recommendation.
