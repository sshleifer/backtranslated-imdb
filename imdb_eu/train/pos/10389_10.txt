When I saw this movie childhood. I was expelled. It was before the television days, so that a movie of magnitude could send a young man into orbit. I was so astonished that I saw this movie twelve days in a row. The special effects used at this time were very far away. Sabu was a real pleasure, as Rex Ingram Genie. "I want to be a sailor" after singing the movie for months. I would recommend all of this movie. I forgot to tell Conrad Veidt, who never wanted to be a character like you ever wanted. Likewise, June Duprez was more beloved than ever in this photo. The color was outstanding. Give this movie AAA!
