This movie has some of the most important conversations of comedic movies and has memorable comic strips in one single movie! Plots are missing, but they are nice enough to complete the difference. This is a timeless movie for all ages that want to be sure. Cinematographic art is very funny; and great stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... how are you wrong? <br /> <br /> This is a comic book dialog, and since that time it is underestimated and imitation is very difficult. An excellent example is the 1986 hit of the movie: The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talents and physical comedy of these stars, the film received comments and little comment. Obtaining a true dialogical conversation is art.
