The Simpsons section contains a new template on a Killbot Factory training base. Here's just a comment on part of a joking joke, but it shows us what the documentary by Patricia Foulkrod does, far from being true. After the Second World War, the US military decided to face the problem that they faced throughout the war; Many soldiers fought and could not completely kill another man, unless they were "myself or not". Since then, the US military training process has been eliminating all scurries and have killed machines that do not think of combatants as combat personnel. In the non-natural state of development: "Sustainable desire to kill". <br /> <br /> First of all, this is not an anti-war film. Although painted in war, despite the fact that badly, Foulkrod deals with a legal aspect of the mind or a party that discusses the success or fiscal failure. The effect of the process of transforming man into a soldier refers to this person as a human being. It is paradoxical to prepare someone to defend society as someone who is fit to live as part of that society and most of the examples and interviewees come from the Middle East conflict. Foulkrod connects with past conflicts. especially Vietnam, clearly. This is not about a particular war, in general, about war problems. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film divides into three sections; how are recruits the army and how they receive training, how to deal with them, and what happens after leaving the army. Once you have reached the point, you realize that the main objective of this film is the policies that are forced by soldiers, but the policies established by the soldiers to force them into an affective fight, which removes humanity from all individuals. The interviewees say how they choose the processes of recruitment that are clear and simple and talk about words such as "democracy" and "freedom", but when they start training they "become" "enemies" and "kill them" and "destroy them". Once every action action soldier does not care what to do, they rooted the idea that they carry out the idea as soon as they make an order, regardless of whether they go one step home. They do not want to fight for political or social ideals, but as they have trained training to fight and kill. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But the main goal of Earth's Truth is to emphasize the U.S. Army in a junkier manner. When they returned home, they fought in their country. There is no real rehabilitation to the military return, and many of them are forced to face and see what they can go home with, and most of the forces do not have legal responsibility for their psychological effects. They get soldiers. It's the last indignity until it's used once. <br /> <br /> If there is a mistake in the movie, Foulkrod does not try to show the other side of the argument. Every soldier who is in war seems to come up with Post Traumatic Stress syndrome. Would it be interesting to see one of them? It gives less education to the opinion of how the army manages training and policies. There is never a chance to discover the other side of the plot. <br /> <br /> But not just another, that is, a handmade craft documentary, and the use of Foulkrod footage and music is perfectly used. A side of the war that is often discussed in war.
