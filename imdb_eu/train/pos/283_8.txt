"The Days" is a typical drama of the family, which captures a bit. You need to relate the character emotions in every possible way to be able to truly appreciate the show. <br /> <br /> [Waiting for the unknown show] <br /> <br /> For people who have seen this story, of course, the story of Cooper Day is a middle-aged child. He records his days with his family and becomes a rich and famous writer for his observations. His family has a mother, father, perfect sister and little brother-in-law. The first episode, by John Scott Shepard, will gradually stifle this situation, both sisters and mothers. The writer is the first situation that happens for the first time. Then his father left the office of work. The youngest son gets an assault. The middle child fights his sister's boyfriend. This is a day job. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoilers] <br /> <br /> I admire this show. I do not know. It's a bit crappy, but I like it. First of all, I thought camera work was a revelation, but then I used it and I liked it. The conversation under the dark lens liked me. I liked the intimate feeling of the exhibition. I liked the low budget style. I liked the operation. I admire the story. Then I found myself a second season. I became a fan of that, because I finished the episodes of ABC's 6 episodes. It's a good show and nothing like OC. They both do nothing in common. So I hope to stop comparing these fans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And you can also connect with Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or Nate.
