That's what the film has peeling or the plot does not look for "Jean de Florrette". Hello This film was created to be a random act of comedy, and in no case would it have any kind of form or shape. That's why I would like to remind you that if you're getting rid of those roaches that you would like to remind me of that movie, This movie is clearly made for people who are called "American humor" which is not clearly visible. The point is that everyone has an opinion and you should be a little bit older that people could match the humor before you turn off your mouth. <br /> <br /> Thanksgiving
