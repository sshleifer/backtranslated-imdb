I've watched this film and finished it. There have also been two South Africans around the time set for this film. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it's tough and open scenes are set to 'scene'. The sluggish but steady increase in rhythm barely rests, and there are few moments without a doubt. <br /> <br /> We can never see Nigel Hawthorne himself. He found himself as a very twisted person, and every time he appeared he did not like to find it anymore. <br /> <br /> I totally agree with Steve-thompen comment and well thought out.
