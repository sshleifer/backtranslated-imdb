Fox, you're a fan of Indiana Jones, or in general, it's essential. He heads the band William Witney and John English of the Republic and is the star of Don Diego / Fox as Reed Hadley. I do not get bored with the plot (who speaks less, more fighting); The most important thing is Hadley's character / interpretation and Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt's work. <br /> <br /> *** PURCHASE SEARCH FOR *** *** / / <br /> <br /> You can see the influence of the movies on Lucas and Spielberg. Fox has captured the original version of Star Wars. In a chapter on a trash, another on a rope bridge, another Temple of Doom, raiders a horse trainer and even escapes from a tunnel while the wicked knock on a large water tank and tunnel flooding. As with Mola Ram as Indy does in Temple Doom. All of this, too, is a Comprehensive Action because it disassemble the bad guys, swings for safety, etc. Most swords have no reason, except in the first chapter, which appears in the battle of the sword, in the choreographed Ralph Faulkner, a choreographed sword-law song that looks like an ordinary wicked Rodríguez. I have never seen the first series in Matinée, Bijou, since I was a girl and since then I am passionate about it. <br /> <br /> Zorro's fight legion offers "Z" merchandise!
