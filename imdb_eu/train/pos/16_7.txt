This is a similar drama or love drama that is endless and generally enjoyable. It's not a Hallmark Hall of Fame family movie that tells the "normal" behavior that sleep-before-marriage, but taking into account Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I expected much less filthy, at least a wise language. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the movie is the difficulty in learning to read and write. The main theme of the film and some of the scene are touching, but, honestly, the movie is not memorable. <br /> <br /> The story I'd still recommend is pretty enjoyable and enjoyable. .
