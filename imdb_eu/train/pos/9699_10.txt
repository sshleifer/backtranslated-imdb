"Paulie" touched me with hearts in a few hearts. It's a fun and emotional film. I have arrived late to be a fan of this movie. I did not see "Paulie" until May 2004 and has asked for a broadband DVD for eBay's seller. <br /> <br /> Paulie Words are excellent effects. My son asked me that the bird knew so many phrases. Perhaps my favorite part of my film is Paulie Gena Rowlands (Ivy), followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) has an excellent part as a good-hearted man. You are challenging the movie. <br /> <br /> You can not rent or buy this movie!
