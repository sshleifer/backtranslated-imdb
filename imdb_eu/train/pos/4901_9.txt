There are no messages. No symbolism. It is not soon dark. Music, nostalgia and a wonderful melody, of course, is a wonderful melody with people. The study is a refreshing antidote in front of waste litter. Judi Dench is definitely worth the money. And Cleo Laine's great jazz singing is a bonus. This lady is in the same league as Ella. This is when my movie is ready to get it ready again, I feel the need for a warm experience and feel overwhelmed. Just a wonderful movie!
