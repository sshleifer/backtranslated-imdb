In Holland, Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) writes a gay talk. She spent a night with Christine, a beautiful woman (Renee Soutendijk) and sex with her (thinking she's a boy). She wants to go on the next day, but she will look at a picture of Herman (Thom Hoffman) Christine's boyfriend and try to stay there. Then you get strange things. <br /> <br /> A large X-rated art house was in the United States in 1983. Why did they rate X? Let's see ... it's not surprising, the whole face of men and women's nudity, castration, boy, simulated sex, a church scene, a cross that hits most people and a gay sex crypt ... and all this comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeven did this after "Spetters". Critics of "Spetters" attacked them for extreme sex sequences and reportedly been junk. So, Verhoeven's film clearly symbolized the belief that critics think it was art and that they praise it. It was correct! Critics loved the movie without realizing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke. However, it's an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> Jan de Bontek (now the director herself) is beautifully shot and in the conversation you never get bored, there are obvious "hidden" symbolisms and layers. Operation is great - Krabbe plays a very contemptuous character, but (in some way) it encourages you; Soutendijk is amazing to look and perfect his part. Gerard is a small, thin smile that comes with the consensus of staying there; Hoffman is very good with a beautiful body - it's worth it to do the church sequence and do it in the Krabbe crypt. <br /> <br /> This is not easy for people or is your heart weak, but you like ultra-intrusive movies that you like. All 10 ways.
