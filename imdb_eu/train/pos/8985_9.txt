Though DiG! It meant that the music industry was very similar to that of the highly-manufactured music industry. The director deceived the audience when Brian Jonestown Massacre believed he was extinct in front of the ground in 1998. And Dandy Warholsen and Jonestown have taken the lead. The truth of the subject is not in this film. <br /> <br /> This film has a constant focus and is an interesting watch, if you look at the team of two great musicians who create their talent. One of the best things about this movie is the unique indie music scene and the corporate framework. <br /> <br /> Especially for musicians and two fantasy groups.
