Gere and Danes are 2 employees in the public safety section that monitor many public safety delinquencies. Gere, who binds Babbage, refers to her as her flock. Gere is a watchdog who is watching over. Training is being done, New Comer Allison, to take his job. Ger's sees his flock very ill and ill. He does not ask questions on the list, he acts as a policeman and fixes crimes. He has warned against this behavior, so that he is substituting. In the last days of work, a young girl is missing out and Babbage is confident she is confused. Both Bison and Allison reduce the list and some delinquents have gone to AWOL. Therefore, the disappeared girl decides that she needs help from the police. This part is far away. <br /> <br /> This movie shows some illnesses and twists. I like Babbage and Allison to go to this building, because the sicknesses make the worst things with each other. There are also people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the movie, we'll see what freaks are sick. However, I would not call this movie too much, because it does not show much in the movie. RISKS EVOLUTION: If you like movies and movies that follow the series killers and movie killers, you'll like it.
