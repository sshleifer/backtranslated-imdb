I had to sleep when I watched this movie tonight. This, in itself, proved that the film was a Deliverance. I think Boorman made a wonderful job to correct this movie. The first scene of folk folk and duel dance was performed in detail. It was so early and early that the people around him were very reserved and simple. Reason: "The boy at the end of the duel was smiling" (he loved his banjo), but when Drew shook his hand at the "duel," the boy was booked. You would not get bored of the trip to the valley, surely. The rape scene was violent, but the team was required to show a backing in Georgia in this region. I think Beatty made a traumatic shock. Some people have said that suffering is relatively low. I do not agree. Really attentive, he immediately did not answer, when Reynolds put it by the arrow's aggressor and he was behind the teeth. The other boy was dead when he Ed died at the top of the cliff. It seems that when they shot the arrows he appeared to be waiting for Ed to die, but before he shot the arrow he finally realized that the arrow had an effect. <br /> <br /> Either way, an excellent movie, and I myself was 8 to 9 years old, but I gave it to "1" after voting for a skeptic sin, giving it to "10". The reasoning of this person was based on personal aspects, rather than an objective vision, and his vote, of course, did not correspond to an attempt to correspond to lowering the value.
