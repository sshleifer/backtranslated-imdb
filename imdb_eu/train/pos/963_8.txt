Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I was worried about making a movie for the kids, I loved it because I'd like to go out of his film: Q Visitor, Gozu, Izo, Ichi Killer and Black Socioty Trilogy. Finally, I'm considering a new territory and I think it's a success. However, I saw that the direction I saw was the first movie, so I was nervous. I saw it without buying and I was happy. <br /> <br /> Great Yokai War is a perfect movie for kids and adults would also like it. All movies reminded me of many movies I loved a baby: a constant story, a labyrinth, an Ozera, and so on. They enjoyed me with these films because they were not stupid for children, and that's not it. . There are underlying moral accents, but also stupid as children should be films. Personally I did not worry about CGI and prostheses. I feel good and I do not think the kids will realize it. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Takashi Miike, you may not like this. But I recommend giving a shot. As evidenced by this, it proves that it is said by Miike. Likewise, his signature is what makes Miike out of these films, which is very relaxing. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are new to Takashi Miiki and want something clear and dramatic, I suggest this. Miike's other films: 'Zebraman' 'Katakuris's happiness' 'Sabu' and 'Chinese birds.' <br /> <br /> Good job Good Takashi Miike! Star 8/10
