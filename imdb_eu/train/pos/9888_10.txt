Although this piece of art uses part of the surrealism cinematic dictionary, this is not something like that. It is a political and cultural allegory about the Colombian odyssey in Mexico, also a look at Mexican history. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Chocolate water like", Waiting for "Erendira", at least half way through the audience, so that understanding takes a lot of work. (It is a good starting point to see the nature of the grandmother in Spain: proud, distant, dull and, above all, in history). <br /> <br /> The last action of the hero is dark. The "result" (that is, nowadays) of history is always dark, because it is close to being honest. If you do not want to leave it freely, the director is the only right choice with the intention of the film. <br /> <br /> "Erendira" is beautiful. It would be a good screen experience to capture the local art house or university projection. Otherwise, VHS is better than ever before.
