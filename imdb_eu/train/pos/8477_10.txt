in the usual sense of the word. <br /> <br /> This movie was my favorite with the child, and I recently remembered it, and I thought to look for it. Although I do not see clearly many details, the feeling that the film gave me was with me throughout the years. <br /> <br /> Parents feel they can manage their children to adults and sometimes abusive issues. then this movie is highly recommended. He taught me a lot about life and death and brought me a lot of emotion. Today, one of my favorite movies remains.
