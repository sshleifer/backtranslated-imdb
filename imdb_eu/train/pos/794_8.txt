I was very impressed how much I had this movie. I thought it was fun, sexy, painful and warm. Andie MacDowell's interpretation was nuances and vulnerable. At the same time, the director of MacDowell did not make the character of the film any other beauty. The love between Kate and her boyfriend is beautiful and she plays very well. His relationship with his friends is thorny and closes in his life. Imelda Stalinson, who has been an MVP in many British films, has a great job. This is a tragedy but the film is finally preserved with superb performance, clear direction and slim writing. The quality of the film is excellent and there is also good music, although it is not available in the soundtrack.
