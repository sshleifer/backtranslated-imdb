New Japanese directors attempt to redefine the chambara genre again. It has been a success, and not at different levels. <br /> <br /> The dying mythical demon (and very active) dies at the Buddhist monk to get light on the Gojoe bridge. Not at the forefront, Buddhist thought is at the heart of this movie, like the "Ran" of Kurosaw. Without a doubt, the movie has become more interesting to me, although the "Ran's" league is close. <br /> <br /> Elegant vision and excellent photography is a very interesting two hour and seventeen minute. The main actors are very exquisite. Music is very good. Both weaknesses are the story and battle scenes. It is dragged in the middle of the movie so that some cautious edictions can be solved. And the battle scenes are mostly blurred. Most movies work, but the end is like a scam. A recent film like this is "Seven Swords" by Tsui Hark, but the superb movie but the battle scenes are depressing. Asano really is not moving like a sword that uses the devil; His performance is excellent, but chambara fighting would be an extra traditional scene. <br /> <br /> A good movie, it's probably interesting to expect you're not expecting traditional sword fighting.
