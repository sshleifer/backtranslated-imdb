Approximately, D.W. Griffith's Intolerance, The Three Ages, was the first long-running comedy feature of Buster Keaton. The "book" of opening the single similarities of intolerance is similar to that of similar stories together in a feature film. Keaton's reasoning for adjusting to this style was that if the feature film was not successful, three rows would be reduced. Fortunately, The Three Ages is a great example of comedy and includes some of the funniest routine I've ever seen in the Keaton movies. There is no single or courageous story about it. They are a simple boy, a boy's trousers, boyfriends, but the melodies of that time are mixed and Mel Brooks and all the genres of this genre make up the standard for future works. However, I do not think anybody has done this comedy. Nobody can not miss the beautiful love like Keaton and the accreditation of this film is one of its best. In addition, Wallace Beery looks like Keaton's rival has been adding an appeal to this film. Modern audiences think that it does not have comedy with modern audiences.
