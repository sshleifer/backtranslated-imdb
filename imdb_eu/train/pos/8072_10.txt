Excellent and unforgettable, totally atmospheric, and absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> I can not understand what kind of masterpiece they do and 8 (and nine!) Voting is the key. > <br /> This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is John Ford's biggest movie. I would say Long Voyage Home is the next line, even if it's back. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 out of 10.
