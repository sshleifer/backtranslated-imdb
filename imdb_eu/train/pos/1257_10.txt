I have read reviews about this film and I have to say "What are you doing?!?" It was a great movie! I thought the film was an excellent start to the beginning and the story was very well-known. I'm sure I did not pay much attention to the people who did not like the movie. There are very important scenes, if you do not pay attention, you will be confused and the following scenes will not make sense. I wanted anyone to like this movie, I did not like to watch it again and watch it, to really pay attention. The story was sensible for me and, as I said, it was very well-known. Each movie scene has a point and the whole movie is over. <br /> <br /> All the actors made a great job! Sean Connery was very good as usual. Laurence Fishburne was superb with Tanny Brown, a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw also had a pleasant touch and it looked great. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise, I did not really expect him, but he did a great deal of performance. Ed Harris was the real treasure of the movie. He really plays the individual of the patient and you see what he really disturbed his character. Look her eyes on her scenes, just super! In addition, Scarlett Johansson is very young (as a Kate) in one of his first roles ... it is not a bad place to start. Great throw for this movie! <br /> <br /> Anyone who likes movies or just likes it, I would recommend anyone who likes this movie. It's a big movie and it's got to be seen. Do not listen to all those people's opinions, go see the movie and come up with your own conclusions. I hope that you will see the movie and I hope you enjoy what I expect. Thank you for reading, <br /> -Chris
