The current performance of Noni Hazlehurst (who won the AFI Prize), at least three years later, has made the effort of FRAN. Colin Friels is also good, and for those who are interested, Alice Garner is a child of Noni, and Michael Caton (THE most famous of the CASTLE) is a bearded painter. (Also interesting is that now the Hazlehurst lifestyle program hosts BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS, and Caton is a type of property type program including HOT PROPERTIES, HOT SUBSCRIPTIONS, etc.). This film reaffirmed the popular belief that Noni was. Undoubtedly, at the beginning of the 80's, Australia was the central actor. Rating: 79/100.
