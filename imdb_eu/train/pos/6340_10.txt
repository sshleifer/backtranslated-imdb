First of all, an explanation for a short film for me. I'll enjoy the movie for the first time I'm excited about knowing what's going to happen (see in point: Twister). There are other things, too, good humor (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), a good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), an imaginary story (all Star Wars episodes-George Lucas). HUMAN), and good music (all Star Wars episodes, Ozoko Magos, Sound Music). What is a movie theater to see at least six times and buy a DVD or VHS tape? Characters That's why I present Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch. Excellent screening by Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast was very good, especially Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Ryan Evans. But with each one of Cindy and The Grinch-together each scene is very good, it is very funny and / or very funny. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this movie, and the movie is a compelling reason for better cartoons. Grinch has a solid plot, good conflicts, and a very good subject (I can not start it, I do not want to ruin it). Jim Carrey was very funny with Grinch, especially when he interacted with Cindy. And music! Wow! Excellent music by James Horner. I love the selection and composition of its instruments. Jim Carrey is a great job. I did not know how to sing. Taylor Momsen! Pull it! Your voice to watch the movie at least once is enough reason. Your solitaire - Where Are You Christmas - Is your voice as high as it sounds? Sounds like a # f? That is, a 7-year-old extreme range is obscene (which is best understood in the best way). Great job This is the best performance of the child I heard in a movie (Taylor beat Von Trapp Children is not bad!). And now to the actors. Jim Carrey was brilliant, funny and very surprisingly sensitive (shown in Taylor Moms's scenes). Taylor Momsen's unknown statements (one of the secret to interpreting a good performance) are very powerful - Cindy Lou Who really becomes. And when he talks he is stronger. <br /> <br /> ****************************** Risk: spoiler alert ******** ************ *************************** *********** ****************************************************************** Examples: When Expression was first seen by Grinch. It's a classic quote ("You are yourself" and then with the Grinch line "After GRINCH'S DA, then he gets back into the ring at Grinch." "Thank you for saving me." The quote and The Grinch's following answer is also very It's good. <br /> <br /> The favorite part of the movie invites Cindyk Grinch to be the Holiday Cheermeister, which has two great actors at their best interaction, and Taylor Moms's little one has been in this place with Jim Carrey. , really, in many of Taylor Moms's films. Everything was wonderful about this movie (except feet and nose).
