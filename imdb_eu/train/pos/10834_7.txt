I did not approach "Still Crazy" with real forecasts. Rock'n'roll is just another picture, I thought ... good nostalgia for children's boomers. This movie is partially but much more. The director Brian Gibson directed a biography of Tina Turner and achieved great success in her style. I think it was appropriate for her last movie. <br /> <br /> Cast has been successfully chosen. It is a perfect role for Bill Nighy. Actor director Bruce Robinson appears as a clever guitarist. He works well, although he did not appear in the film at the end of the 70s. If you are looking for fun and fun movies (with great songs), you've found it. <br /> <br /> 7.4
