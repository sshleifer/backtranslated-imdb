I love Satan Pit !!! David Tennant is an excellent actor and Billie Piper! Who loves Will Thorp fragments ??? It's so nice, right? I hated the bishops that devised him, and there he was called "to go to hell," as Rose said. Note that it was very funny, he said: "Rose, make us go, do you want? Shut down!". Mr. Jefferson was so brave, right? To die for the salvation of others. I really felt that when Toby was there (Will Thorp) he was so frightened when he was leaving for the second time. "Oh my god, I was Rose, I was so afraid I was like him". And when he embraced, "Grrrrrr, it's mine! I've been hands!" but I thought it was really sweet. And the doctor ... well, he told me that Ida would say "Rose for love it" but he did not. Okay
