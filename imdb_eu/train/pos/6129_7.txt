Note that I did not say it's better ... nice. There is no social comment and realism that helps move things. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised that Troma was not a movie, because it has all the Troma brands, as well as acidic liquid. The descendants of all murders, a riot bathtub, a rape scene (which is hard to get harder to get, it's a snowman like a rapist) and a silent deputy. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of love: <br /> <br /> 1. A snowman, noticing that they have no legs or feet, drives a police boat around town. <br /> <br /> 2. Although it is supposed to be near or below freezing, no-one shows breath and there is no sign of car exhaust when the cars are running. <br /> <br /> 3. Snow reminds you to feed it to feed over real snow or silent. <br /> <br /> 4. A young girl gets her husband just a few hours to kill her children. He talks to sit in the seat of the house, in every place, to get him. But first of all, he tells him he should build a nice fire, and he will open the fireplace. <br /> <br /> 5. When Jake's head comes, after a sled runner has cut off, his father argues with Tommy that the son of Sheriff is related to the serifo. Sheriff says Tommy would not fight with Jake, Jake "is at least two meters taller than Tommy." At that moment, someone in the background has entered "No more!" <br /> <br /> 6. When the evil snowman begins to melt at the end, the sheriff strikes it with a snowman, something like a piece of fabric for a long time. This is a much better fight than Crocodile or Gladiator Tarzan fighting in lions. If it were an actor, I would not be able to save the correct face at this time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a fun movie. There is not too much blood.
