Warning: light spoilers. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith's story is an amazing part of American history and world religious history. This film depicts Joseph Smith's life events that recover Mormons in the territory of God's Recovery of the Church of Jesus Christ. I have watched the movie so far in the first month of the public exhibitions. <br /> <br /> First, Joseph Smith is the youngest brother (Alvin, Hyrum and Joseph) the youngest trio. very young, he needed an operation. The operation made without our modern comforts was bloody and difficult. This scene has shown the consistency of the Smith family and the brothers and their connections between Joseph and her parents. <br /> <br /> Joseph's religious confusion and subsequent prayers are considered fun for those who call Mormon the First Vision. . Jesus does not show his face, but you see his hands nails distinctive. Religious leaders and many small New York communities have denied that Joseph at least marries his wife's marriage. scenes scene This is not a critique - just a note on style. <br /> <br /> Tarring and feathering is shown in practice, especially dramatic and movement, giving the sermon with a frightened face to the love of the Savior. After recently attacked. <br /> <br /> The film depicts the joy and growth of Mormonism as a child church, and at the same time a deep opposition to the rise of local governments. <br /> The film shows a number of scenes from Joseph's life, including some beautiful moments depicting Emma's relationship. Jose strives to show the depth and complexity of his life, including the hard love of his wife, including an endless love for children, his spirit, his courage with his rough and dangerous faces, his religious feelings and his compassion. <br /> <br /> While Joseph and Hyrum Carthage walk around, home-grown characters, Josephe's life, will be shown on the way, helping to strengthen what is going on. already seen but configuring the latest scene. <br /> <br /> In the end, Joseph and Hyrum's martyrdom are portrayed, and the filmmakers leave nothing but witness to the events. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first movie, I thought the Churches presented themselves to Joseph Smith. I do not think so anymore, although I can do that. As a criterion, the film is a celebration of Joseph, and we know very well the good things about him. I am worried that the outsiders will see the movie as a propaganda, the story of a American religious man or something else. , moving and fortunately something good for everyone. The events that occurred in the United States were thought to be interesting according to the many aspects of our culture - in accordance with the religious freedom of expression and the respect of the law (in general).
