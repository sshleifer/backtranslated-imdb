The Intruder (L'Intrus), a film directed by French director Clair Denis, is the release of the movie. Time crosses his spirit and space through nature. There may be a plot, but I understood that from the description of the Netflix DVD sleeve. True, it's probably better to know something about the movie before, so the audience can ignore all expectations. The film asks the viewer to think, but also questions that he will not get the full understanding. <br /> <br /> The human heart is a riddle of the movie. Each image questions its role, its nature and its form. The heart is strangers between the viewer and Louis. Louis's character plays Michel Subor, such as the peace and mystery that a character demands. Honestly, anyone could play Louis's character, if he has a innocent, pleasing and comfortable heart. However, Subor appears here; It turns the movie, its identity is inseparable. The images of many of my films that remain in my mind will be based on their statements, especially physical. <br /> <br /> A poetic intrusion is the ability to silence and achieve fullness of movement, but fluid in any literature. the way you do not want to take it. "Surrealist" has been a term used to describe this film, but it may be a "realistic" term. There is nothing in the film that exists outside of the reality choices; The universe confirms a simple score in the music depicting the relationship between the heart and the dark light. <br /> <br /> See if the trailer attracts you to a number of visual images several times; Watch the movie and see the effects of the verse combo and bet on freedom.
