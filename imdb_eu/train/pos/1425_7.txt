Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield, as well as the movie document presented at Al Gore, have shaken us down as "Uncomfortable Truth", remind us that our way of life is the time to save our beautiful planet. "Planet Earth" will wake up to the global warming of our planet with all the living effects of all the people around the world. Al Gore shows us the horrors of the planet Earth's future, documented examples presented in documented examples through long and always interesting monologues. The creators of this documentary choose a different and powerful way to achieve this. In the future, there is no representation of what might happen to our planet, if we do not change things, but the planet of the Earth shows us the glorious glory of beauty. We saw places we knew, but we thought they would never be so beautiful. In this movie, we can see one of the most spectacular places, such as pure deserts, giant forests and numerous wildlife and frozen landscapes, as it sees the eyes. And we see the most beautiful animals survive in all these amazing environments. <br /> <br /> This is exactly the film to be done, together with Al Gore, to realize our planet too much. Patrick Stewart's voice always shifts and so it's very well done, though, at first, it seems like I was watching a X-Men movie! Cinematography is surely the most important thing in this documentary. Sometimes, what you see is not so unreal, that a man with a camera needs to forget that this beautiful film should be filmed. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is undoubtedly essential for every single person in this beautiful planet! It's true: I never thought that our planet was so beautiful!
