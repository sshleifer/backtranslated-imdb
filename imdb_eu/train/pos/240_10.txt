Fantastic movie 5 senses nervous. It is not a true historical report, and all the information must be taken as a factual information. Hollywood real conventions were used, such as A list and very attractive actors, such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right hand). and non-pleasing actors (Geoffrey Rush) act as drunk and drunk by the Victorian Police. This also creates an unbelievable love story in the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts), to attract all the romances, especially for women to be sensitive. It is also the first scene, the young Ned kept them overwhelmed and his father called him "the sun" and "he looked bright for me, my hand for me," he is very romanticized and convincing. the audience with Ned Kelly, with the under sentence. Besides, do not all Australians love?
