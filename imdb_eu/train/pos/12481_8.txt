Ok, so I do not see horror movies too. That's why movies like 'Dark Remains' are. I caught this (with surprisingly functionality) on the DVD, and I'm stupid. Specifically, I thought that an additional extra that I needed for a DVD was a new road. <br /> <br /> However, the next day I told someone about it when I noticed it when I noticed it when I only saw about 10%. was it For the rest, I was watching pizza at my coffee table, when I covered my girlfriend with eyes I was very nervous. I thought it was hard to see when I saw the screen when I decided to do it again. <br /> <br /> The movies are strong and the character of the characters has been really compelling. The simplicity of the movie really hit my jump button: it's just a forest, a booth and an unknown prison, and it has a lot of darkness. It was most surprising to me, clearly, that this was not a million dollar production; Because the make-up effects really seemed! It is also obvious that a film made by someone who has a great love for making movies. The sound design and music that Hollywood really used in the environment had never been made. I found out that this movie had won LA Shriekfest - really a great achievement, and I think the festival has seen the talents of the filmmakers - and I'm sure I got much better than this movie. <br /> <br /> Activate the sound, turn off the lights, and if you want to keep your girlfriend ask for a pizza.
