Meryl Streep is a genius. Well, at least as an actor. I know he's got mad at playing accents with a lot of roles, but he always includes all the accents. The interpretation made with Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, described here, was not very pleased or intelligent. However, Streep's work is even more noticeable. I think it's worth 10 worthy of all my Oscar nominations. About the movie, well, there were some interesting things. I do not know much about Australia, but the general public's wickedness has a lot of issues in the story. When I saw the movie in the long run I largely failed, but it came out light and light yesterday. And it seems Australian press gets in the way of the indiscretion and misery of its American colleagues. Pretty good movie A little different Grade: B
