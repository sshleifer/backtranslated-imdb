Finally I wanted to see it in a movie. A few years ago I saw the video of Fritz Lang. I expected the good conditions of the project to be magic. <br /> <br /> The conditions of Ontario were the best in Cinematheque Ontario. Longer sun. Intertitles, original script in German, simultaneously translated in English, literally without specific. Live piano assistant. Ideal <br /> <br /> He threw a bit of the magic of the movie, but eventually failed to catch it, at least for me. This film does not really match the Wagner ring cycle. I knew but some might not. Wagner XIII. Niebelungenlied for his own purposes. The first part of Fritz Lang's "Siegfried" book is known to Wagner's listeners. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Kriemhild's Revenge" Siegfried's wife is Kriemhild. (Attila) Hun and Hieg and Gunther, the desire to revenge themselves against the Nibelun rebels against Siegfried's murder. The spectacular conflagration of this film was supposedly altered and expanded into Wagner's myth with his Götterdämmerung, Twilight of the Gods and Valhalla. This movie is a land. <br /> <br /> Most of the movies are spectacular. Awesome sets of "Cabiria" (1914), against Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916). Their decor sets a new benchmark in the Barbarian shine. Huns and Art Deco are sketches from Burgundians. And fights. Actually, never-ending battles. <br /> <br /> Kriemhild is very successful in the revenge plan. He gets destroyed around him. Siegfried's loyalty to his martyrdom does not seem so much love or devotion, but that which approaches psychosis. Lady Macbeth cried: "Let me here." He learned that he was emotionally prepared. But Kriemhild does not show normal human emotions, and no doubt no one joins the feminine principle. Shakespeare's phrase, from the outset, is "full of direct cruelty" already. Margarethe Schön and her manager clearly know this. I do not want to abuse, but Kriemhild's face is the only expression to "cheer up". It's the one-time solo show. Clearly, however, it is a deliberate deed of the mere act. <br /> <br /> Then, the one dedicated to it, is a single-sided draft of an angry revenge. Some may see Kriemhild as a powerful heroine. I see it as a misogynist movie.
