"Cut" is a complete mix of the slasher genre and, in general, what it does. There are a lot of topical Slasher standards; An incredibly old house, forests, a series of unknown anonymous killer, gore cubes, and, of course, killer while the pair is interrupted (it's almost not a spoiler). <br /> <br /> The set-up is just the same simplicity: the end-of-term "masterpiece" finished by the teens of film schools ended up being murdered by a couple of cast cast unfinished. This too well - well, messily - Kylie Minogue removes the first coil. Molly Ringwald's movie has survived the movie because they get the best movies. The rest of the works work well, especially the beautiful Jessica Napier, who plays the sleeve and noise around her. <br /> <br /> There are lying moments in countless red-blooded herrings, and there's little time now because the murderer moves in one's fast pace. It also has a low budget look, including some misleading edits surely. Good soundtrack too. If there are any difficulties with this movie, it will decide whether or not to pay tribute to the slasher genre. Probably both.
