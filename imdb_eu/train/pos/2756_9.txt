I received this movie based on the summary of the plot and the critics' quotes, in the back of the box. I'm not into foreign films and I do not know what to expect. I do not even take the subtitles. But I absolutely loved it! It's a simple and loving quality that feels good about life. I found myself laughing several times. I would recommend this photo to anyone, even if they are strangers to foreign films. This is worth the effort.
