This movie is a real curious. The arches of the plot are defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are well-liked and clear, their reasons are absolutely credible. The conversation is fresh and oh authentic. The situations are similar to the characters and are not topical or conflicting. It's up to that, that's it. Then the movie is like a little bit out of the rails and a bit abominable and compelling. But I do not want people to watch this movie. The first 3/4 is really outstanding. I have given 8. There are notable concerts here. Check out this movie.
