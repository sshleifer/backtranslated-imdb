This is a trio called "Shakti," "Devi," and "Kali," about an experimental toilet of the Taylor-Eriksson group (ie, the Taylor-Eriksson team), who has traveled to travel in the unknown, I would say. A lot of years later, some of these damages still lurking and the moment is waiting to show themselves. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband died with a mysterious dead, in fact, was torn apart and a suspect might not have existed as a man. This woman seems to be able to project an inner devil, or, thus, finds the sister of the man who killed her, while she is the woman as a reporter. Devi tells the story of a man who wants to "jump his skin". It's a skinhead, it's a madness of speed, and it's sent to see a psychiatrist who is a former member of this toilet, which helps the young doctor to realize their desire. This is probably the best three segments. It tells the story of a Kali healer, that is, trying to cure a part of that community, and releases a type of demon that has lived in this woman, but has come to grips with it or has made a lie if it has been released. he could not survive her. These three stories are terribly terrifying, and they are never sure what to expect, and the premises and settings are similar to that of the most horrifying movie horror. It looks like a small budget, but it also creates a great atmosphere that is very popular. I saw this in my mouth for a long time, and when it came to true fears (and gore), it was quite hard. I found this movie very interesting and disturbing and I really liked it. I'll give you a good find, which is 10 to 10.
