It is the star of Vertigo Stewart (last round, as a romantic lead) and Novak raises another movie from Stewart's "Christmas movie", above the central entertainment scene. The chemistry of the two stars makes a pretty moving experience and the revelation can be taken as a film if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor of private pain that hinders many people's relationships. In the end, pleasant fun with mythical stars, 7/10.
