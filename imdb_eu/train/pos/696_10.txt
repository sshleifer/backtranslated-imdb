For an unfortunate independent film, Insomniac's Nightmare paints an amazing image that can withstand insomnia. Being very well written and correct, it creates the atmosphere of a dream that the viewer makes during a night in the life of an insomnia. <br /> <br /> Dominic Monaghan stars Jack, we see what he sees. They drag long hours of a lonely night. The story is almost hypnotized and it is impossible to move away from the starting lines. Dazzling and a little disturbing, it shows that somebody slept as it lacks, balancing it according to the balance between insanity and insanity. <br /> <br /> On every corner, Insomniac's Nightmare is provocative and passionate. It is highly recommended.
