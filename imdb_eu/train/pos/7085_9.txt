I bought a DVD and I have to say it (seeing it in Brazil and being afraid of Las Vegas) Terry makes it back. As a fan of Monty Python, Terry Gilliam's genius follows Bruce Couch's stunning role by James Cole, and Brad Pitt (perhaps my favorite character), Brad Pitt. Jefferey Goines. It's really necessary for fans of science or for any type of enthusiast, suspense, theater, action, etc. Because it contains them <br /> <br /> On the plot, in the future, 1% of the world's population survived an illness to eradicate the human race, and "in the past twelve monkeys army" has been in the past. James Cole (Bruce Willis) will be sent in 1996 (ie when the virus is released) to find out about the illness, scientists of his time may find a cure. Before going further, James Cole lives in an underground society, and animals are being ruled out by the disease that will kill humans on the surface. However, it will be sent back in time, but when it returns to 1990, it is sent to a mental institution from the words given to the virus people. During his stay he meets Jefferey Goins (Brad Pitt). Later, he is responsible for eliminating the human race. He also knows his psychiatrist (Madelein Stowe), who eventually rescinds the world with his teammate Bruce (who sees himself as correct in his own words), sends him back to his past, and has finally sent him in 1996, where he questions his own tenderness, but Later on the film will show up at the end of the suspensful quarter and then build up with a stunning little charm, where the virus (not really Brad Pitt really) and instead of firing a man tries to try. While the police escapes the killer.
