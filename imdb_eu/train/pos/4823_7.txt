It's a difficult thing to go to the queen. On the one hand, he must be an elegant and imperial actress, and on the other, he must show vulnerability in a difficult situation, as well as the courage and resolution to overcome his courage, the queen almost all have almost all the films. This basic plot. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is just as bright as Victory, but not the whole performance, as I would like, was not blameworthy. I can not feel that this is an adaptation of the novel Mills & Boon, compared to a darker and more dramatic movie about a young queen Elizabeth. That's why Blunt does not run the range of queen's emotions, at least as a whole, because Victoria is young. To see old Victoria, check out Mrs. Brown. <br /> <br /> The selection of director Jean-Marc Vallee is interesting. At last, C.R.A.Z.Y. was brilliant and promoted fame. It was another movie, but I remember a gorgeous look and that is probably the closest similarity between the two films. While writing Vallee by C.R.A.Z.Y., this was made by Julian Fellowes and I really enjoyed Gosford Park, although the story of this movie was much more interesting. I soon lost all government policies. Perhaps the possible less monarchy of the lesser driver could not be cuts. I'm just saying it.
