One of the nihilistic and brutal films I have ever seen, but also one of the most tragic and mobile. As the world has never seen, it is an action melodrama. Sometimes, the plot closed me with tears, and at the same time they gave me shocking revelations. Edison Chen's reaction is awesome. While HK-Cop and the Cambodian killer are attacking each other, while humanity is losing a bit, it is very powerful. "Dog bite Dog" to show unrelated images and gruesome cameramen, HK-Bloodshed is purely without Heroism.
