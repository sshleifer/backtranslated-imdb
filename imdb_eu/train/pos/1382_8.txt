Not everything is in this brilliant first work of Céline Sciamma. Friendship, "desire to get in touch", first sexual feelings ... All this and much more sublimates through the underwater pool. <br /> <br /> Three girls in this movie are trying to find and seek. expressing his personality very differently. Adolescent's understanding is much less, such as "Thirteen", but it's still a trip worthwhile. <br /> <br /> You must see it and please leave all the ideas before cinematography in the United States. door The soundtrack is A + video. <br /> <br /> Bon cinéma!
