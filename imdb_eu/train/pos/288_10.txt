The movie was so big! I am a teenager, and I and my friends love the series, so it's just a matter of paying attention to people of all ages. I recommend for everyone. The favorite line of this movie was Logan Bartholomew saying: "pink cheeks" when talking about her daughter's daughter. He is a great actor, as well as Erin Cottrell. They are so matched and have a great chemistry! I really hope to work together again. They are so attractive and they are very good actors. I've finally found movies that are good to watch. Lately it has been difficult to find good movies for me and show good morals and Christian values. But at the same time, these films are not young.
