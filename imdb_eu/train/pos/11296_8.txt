I had a personal interest in this movie. When I was 17 years old and I got out of high school I got a 20th Century Fox job as a member of the Laboratories and Hod Carriers Union. When they finished my first day (immersed in the cover of the car's chariot) the next day they told me to bring a suitcase next week, with enough clothes and so on. The next morning I was waiting for a bus and about 20 we went south towards San Diego. Shortly afterwards, we stopped at Camp Callan or an army of Camp Hahn. Once we were bunked a few kilometers northward, he entered Camp Pendleton, a large base of marine life. On the beach, we began to build a Japanese island island of Pacific Island. We needed a week or ten days to complete the installation, including a water tank, gun repairs, sand bins and living rooms. All this was a very high salary, sometimes "golden time", which was a triple hourly wage. Our food was first class = lunch, etc. It was amazing during the war and it was very difficult to get good meat at home. After finishing his work, he was eagerly awaiting the departure movie, about twenty-eight months later. Then I waited eagerly for two hours at the movies before my handicrafts arrived at the end of the screen. Then, three or four minutes later (perhaps less) they immerse themselves in the heroes of films and bombardment bombardment. A little enjoyable, but still fun. <br /> <br /> While I was offset, I enjoyed the movie and I did not see it. Later, I learned that this film was written by the government and Fox paid for the cost basis, perhaps, but our wages and extravagant lifestyles. Bob Weverka
