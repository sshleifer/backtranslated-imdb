Like many people in this site, I only saw this movie once, when it was on TV in 1971. Several scenes are in my memory and I remember that I am generally concerned. I'd gladly see again, if it were available for home videos. <br /> <br /> Possible hell: I wonder if someone could agree on the basic plot setup and characters. The 1960 British film, originally titled "The City of the Dead," confirmed the "Horror Hotel" for the American premiere? The British film The Wicker Man is becoming increasingly similar. <br /> <br /> I have a bit of detail after watching movies with me. It is a small but significant moment near the beginning of the film. As I recall, a minister and a woman stopped by the side of the road to help people, somewhere in the West, in 1870. Ray Milland presents herself and her (daughter?) Yvette Mimieux, a handsome and beautiful woman. While preacher Ray Milland helps with the cart, a lunge image is threatened and threatened, because he has not even seen a character, except for Yvette Mimieux. He's not afraid, but he's looking at the snake with silent concentration until he's gone. With this curious little bit, it seems that something that is already apparently normal is very unusual, although the minister and his wife continue to suffer from long and uncertain risks. <br /> <br /> This little scene is very much alive with me in these years, along with many others. The film has an amazing quality, it does not allow, and it is not surprising that people remember so strongly. Someone should be in your home video!
