This is a stupid man who thinks this. If you do not expect Star Wars and enjoy British humor, you can become a classic cult with my wife and myself, as Cary Grant and Jack Nicholson's "voice" as the most fun people Tuesday. You can sleep this bean movie or watch it carefully and you can enjoy it in a way. <br /> <br /> It is not for everyone, but if you have a simple and enjoyable intelligence to see the joke. While it slips, you'll enjoy this movie.
