Guys and Dolls is the only game based on these characters. Sky Masterson <br /> <br /> (Marlon Brando) is a senior playground with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) who takes a bet on a thousand dollars. Nathan needs money, he can do his usual crap game and he can do it. Bet Sky was only willing to take any Havana girl and she was chosen by the Cuban "doll" Sarah <br /> <br /> Brown (Jean Simmons) a missionary. The sky is finally evil <br /> <br /> <br /> That it is enough to go with Havana. They fall in love with each other, but later he accused him of not participating. Mr. Nathan played at the head of a missionary tonight. Nathan's 14-year-old friend Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) fights against Nathan's side and does not stop him doing it. However, when the movie is over, it ends with a happy ending <br /> <br /> with a wedding. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are wonderful and beautifully sung. Marlon <br /> <br /> Brando has no voice singing, and it's true he could double it but he did not care. He made a great play (of course Brando is watching) and he played a very good character. I've seen some movies with Jean Simmons and thought that this movie was the weakest, but he could not sing. However, the song consists of Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye. The original Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye <br /> <br /> also featured on Broadway for guys and dolls. Vivien Blaine had a wonderful voice and Adelaide was the perfect one. If you like music, even if you do not have it, I suggest you watch this.
