She is Lisa's hotel manager or owner and she makes a flight to Miami. He is sitting next to a murderer named Jackson, says he needs to change the room of a family or kill his father. The room had to change because Jackson wants to blow up. <br /> <br /> This is a very suspicious movie, because Lisa is trying to escape from this effort that Jackson has made. The whole story is very good and I thought the plane might have gone a long way. He could have more plans but, instead, the entire movie was pretty good. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the end, because it was paralyzing. I did not know what would happen and I was surprised. For me, this movie has been cast.
