During the first season I began to see the show, and at first I was quite skeptical of it. The original movie was a baby and I was looking for a science fiction show waiting for the new BSG season. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes I became a fan. I love characters - Jack-O'Neill, non-intelligent solo Samantha Carter, Glorious Teal'c, women and kids love the most favorite and the best of my characters. Dr. Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Of course, sometimes the story is not serious, sometimes hilarious, but above all it is not a technology or space fight - it helps your friend, even if he threatened your life. "No one is leaving behind". End up fighting until you lose all hope. On all the good features of free will and a human being - Human. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
