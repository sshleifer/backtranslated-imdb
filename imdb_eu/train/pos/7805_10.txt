I published the first film in 1987 and I was emotionally damaged by a combination of guilt for my white human beings to innocent people and the nonsense of the outside world through the study of human beings. /> <br /> In particular, the funeral of Steve Biko was moving, at that time the South African hymn was even more intense and hard. For some time, I have convinced that this film did not get anyone to open the eyes of the world in South Africa. In my opinion, I am a person of normal right thinking and I can condemn this movie as a whole in thinking about South Africa, but how do we perceive black people. I have never seen any difference between people who believe in color or belief, but after seeing this movie, I changed my life physically and in the last 17 years I live in a mostly black nation and I help many people to overcome their lives and I think they did not think that's it I can say honestly that I have received the highest honors, I can say that I can help to adjust and correct a little balance in my way. But if they had thought about more people and did not seek rewards for black people, then the black population of this planet would be a little better. Freedom from the beginning to the end and not feel that emotion in our heart beat witnesses, Sharpville killed 700 people, wounded, murdered by Steve Biko, who died for a murder of his people's rights. After all, this is not just a movie but it's wonderful, but everything happened really well for less than 30 years ago. <br /> <br /> Yes, my friends, watch this movie and then see if you leave and have a tough party. I could not I was tired of knowing the truth. This is the main feature of a great movie. Sir Richard Attenboroughe was planning to get this message about South Africa, of course. Obviously he got it. If you do not protect Apartheid. God will help you.
