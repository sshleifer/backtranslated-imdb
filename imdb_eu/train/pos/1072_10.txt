I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. Despite some improvements, the story is quite likely. In Season 1, however, the season became a horrible show that lost its original charm. One line of a season was more interesting, while Jam Pony's lightweight aspect was while the X-series continued to run down on the manticore lands. I expected the new season, in fact, still. I hope that FOX and DA production teams realize that it is still time for the authorities to wait a long delay. After 2 years of being suspended, DA can be done if you need to work well, and I think that a name like James Cameron should take this challenge.
