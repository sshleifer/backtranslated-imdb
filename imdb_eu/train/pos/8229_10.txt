This is a very slow pace, slowly building a tale that begins with a stranger who begins with a new family life. The viewer slowly feels that something is wrong ... <br /> <br /> I really loved the movie, although it eventually leaves bitter taste. Light, well-ritualized and very well-behaved. Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner have their characters deep. <br /> <br /> The little boy "Pierrot" is also very moving. <br /> <br /> It does not seem like a thriller. You can feel a very unusual movie, a very atmospheric one, throughout the whole movie, although it can sometimes make you feel bad with a couple of scenes. <br /> <br /> I will give it 8/10 !!
