North Africa in the 1930s. A pretty Arab woman on the shores of the Sahara seeks a beautiful woman looking for a sense of her life and a beautiful Trappist monk runs away from the crisis of her faith. They will be reunited and their passions will be awakened, but even more so, Sand Sandar does not know how fortunate or pain they will find ALLAHKO GARDEN here. <br /> <br /> The plot is pure hokum, but the movie is still very fun and beautiful to look at. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer are great screensavers. Simply to make it beautiful, Boyer gives it the simplest and most brilliant performance, since the sensitive face is a great deal for himself. <br /> <br /> The good actors are excellent: Basil Rathbone, playing a Count who loves the desert. Joseph Schildkraut is a pleasurable guide and speaker (in the movie "all other Arabs", "gibberish"), Lucile Watson, a nice mother, Alan Marshal, a young French officer, as Tilly Losch, a dangerous dancer, as Henry Brandon's comic keeper; As a mysterious John Carradine Sand; and Sir C. Aubrey Smith as an old priest priest. <br /> <br /> The film will be known as Helen Jerome Eddy boy, Marcia Mae Jones and Bonita Granville (looking at her boyfriend) as a convent girl ; Professor Gauntxo Nigel De Brulier, and as the secretary of the hotel, Ferdinand Gottschalk, are not all credited. <br /> <br /> The 1930s-colored films are rare and beautiful, and this film is no exception, just as color for the cinematography desert It was the first Technicolor film filmed in THE GARDEN OF ALLAH, Yuma, Arizona, gave the sand dunes unwanted, but contaminated with drinking water The heat of 135 degrees and the heat of the company soon rebelled. Every day, Boyer's face smoked a bright red tomato, producer David O. Selznick finally came up. The rest of the film was shot in a Hollywood sound stage.
