"All of you, Ed?" "You are playing in the game now." When my father left his mother, he took me to the movie to see her new girlfriend on the day of opening the Hollywood Cinerama Dome door. I was fourteen years old. I did not know what I saw, but I will never forget it, especially Ned Beatty's scene. <br /> <br /> I see today, thirty-six years later, still gives me a whistle. <br /> <br /> My father was a fan of Burt Reynolds, and that's why almost one hour online was the reason to think it was "an action movie." I saw the first two films, Dome: "Grand Prix" and "The Song of Norway". Well, there was Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was surprised. <br /> <br /> But at that age I also considered the art ... and after seeing it again, I was surprised that it was still very well witnessed. Films worrying but well-worked. <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that it was a traumatic experience of kissing his first girlfriend at the age of fourteen. I do not blame my father for taking me, but a little boy witnessed. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I still find it very disturbing, but I am still very impressed with the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . The quality of the sound is not worth the effort, the birds that echo to watch the clocks. Photography, filmography ... all the technical aspects of this excellent film are first class. <br /> <br /> Moral questions continue with the questions posed as a result of the sexual assailants of killing man. deep as today's innovative film was released. The classic attempts to survive in the desert after tackling this kind of brutality are changing lives. These four men, the men of the city, suddenly confronting the unexpected situation, are rising from the inside out of fear of an action. <br /> <br /> Surely a classic. And the phrase "nice mouth" has been mentioned without endless comments on Saturday Night Live without the water-cooler, the movie is definitely a huge part of our social pop culture ... "Make my day" or "I came back" they were much more than ever. <br /> <br /> So what would you do if you attacked your friends below the trees below your life in the city, bed, wife and children? And if you took the measures taken by Burt Reynolds (and I would like to do it), would you bury the body you would hear soon, or take the trials and make your choices? The bottom line is Deliverance. You can carry it with the bank. If this movie is not on your skin, you are not human. <br /> <br /> Even before seeing this, rent again and ask this question. <br /> <br /> The favorite part of the movie remains the same: Eda deer dies ... if you change. Life and unforeseeable circumstance can change the man. And I think this movie is about Jon Voight, especially Ed, who gives it here. She is one of the greatest actors in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy, to performing with Pearl Harbor's performance with Franklin D. Roosevelt. It is necessary to believe that it is reasonably upset, horrified and determined to be in the corner of the rocks. I guarantee that the pace of your heart will rise to a new level. <br /> <br /> Inserted in the base, tense, squeezed and drawn like a banjo string, is a morality game that makes some current questions. There are changes in the times, but there are no chances for humans. <br /> <br /> Ten to ten stars.
