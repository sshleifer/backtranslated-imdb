In New York, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a family member of the dentist collects his friend and colleague Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) casually in the street. Charlie became a lonely and shameless man when he lost his wife and three daughters in a tragic September 11th. Alank had trouble discussing his inner feelings in front of his wife. Alan talks about Charlie's reconciliation and they approach each other. Alank Charlie tries to fix his life, which is sent to psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but has an aggressive reaction to Charlie treatment and has been sent to court. loss, friendship, drama about family and loneliness. September 11th, unimportant plot; It could be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as Donna Roots also harassing sexual harassment, which plays Alan Saffron Burrows. But we make family drama works, accompanied by excellent performances by Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is impossible to admit, I do not know whether he uses excessive make-up or not to be older, but his face is strange. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")
