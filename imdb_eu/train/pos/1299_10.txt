I watched this concert in public television a bit and I knew that I needed to have it. The boys have given everyone of Royal Albert a great performance, often exciting. Even pure - no synthesizers, no laser gesture coating, no stinking (and dirty, serious and delightful spectators, all of which left their bottle home clocks). <br /> <br /> You are a fan of Cream (or if you have reported it); you're a blues fan; you're a fan of rock 'n' roll; You are not disappointed to see and hear this DVD. You do not even lose this DVD, you will never give it to anyone. (This DVD justifies the selfishness! Tell them on their own!) Poor and repetitive. you will easily reach it.
