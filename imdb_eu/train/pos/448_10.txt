I think this movie is very beautiful. And I'm not talking about a unique landscape. It's about two wonderful unfortunate housewives who decide to rent an English castle to take a break from home life. In the end, four women are renting everything, so that there are several people and there they are. All those who find peace in these beautiful magical places have enough and interesting that peace arises from internal reflection and resolution, without more than that. Also, I think it's wonderful for relationships that develop kindness and understanding. He is the joy he sees himself. I love Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker) especially.
