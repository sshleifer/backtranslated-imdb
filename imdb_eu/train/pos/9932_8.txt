If you do not expect something in this movie, it will be disappointed, just like any movie. This movie has been described by Hemmingway as "iceberg effect". On the cover, it's just a random cue movie clip made together for a movie. If it's written in a book, it would be a short story, because the movie is a very fast action and if you're not trying to catch it, the reason behind the plot (something that presupposes it) can be reasonably justified. have fun Without a doubt, you can watch the movie twice. Experimental Cinematography is hardly describing this film. The camera's work and post-production are added to the general flavor of cinema, at some time it is artistic and sometimes open-ended (something that American film has recently wanted). In some parts, though it may be penetrating for some audiences, to be terrifying and cumbersome, the movie never becomes realistic. The only part of the films to write for "improve it" is the selection of the soundtrack. There is never a good movie without a good soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite adequate, the opening is longer, and the other songs in the movie can be really better (hard rock, grungy or psychedelic). This electronic film could make a real journey. The flood of dynamic palette of images and colors adds an "artistic" aspect to the movie, but it is not lost and still understood. However, to see this much more desirable film, you do not have to get bored quickly. 8.5 / 10
