"Opening Night", published in 1977, aims to be an ambitious production. Only Gena Rowlands gets real performance. The character of the actor Myrtle's theater is not necessarily someone we love in real life. He dissipates himself, he is often an evil and does a wonderful life of his neighbors, that is, unlike some actors. Myrtle is a woman at the edge of the collapse. We are not sure if the demons fight real or imagined, although we will leave the secret at the beginning. Rowlands, of course, directs the actress and director John Cassavettes, with his elegant wife, with the love of the film. This movie is not a mistake, it's too long, and the last part of the movie, while Myrtle drank on stage, is very drunk. In some interviews, "improvisation" is longer. Some assistants give good performances, especially by Ben Gazarra, playing with myrtle's starring producer. Joan Blondell's character never fully developed, and I never understood why the movie was in Myrtle. See Rowlands only this film - it's very wonderful - and it's hard to remove your eyes, even if you want it sometimes.
