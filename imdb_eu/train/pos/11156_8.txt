I do not usually like reality shows, especially the success of "American Idol". I could live that. <br /> <br /> Comics around the world make a short habit of cycling habits and, if they like it, send the audience a routine audience. . Then, ten or twelve comics are chosen to live in a house and make "Survive" style competitions using comedy tactics. Next, it will be defined as the "Last Static Comic". I like the comedy stand up, so this is my keen interests show. Usually, some funny comics are selected. Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May and Josh Blue started their careers. <br /> <br /> My negative criticism is that there are many of these comics that have come up with reality. show drama At first they lived together in a house like "Big Brother", but now they have ended, thank God. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < race, ethnicity, attitude, sex, etc. But, in general, it is a true reality show, and I thought that until now, there are two terms, there is an oximoron.
