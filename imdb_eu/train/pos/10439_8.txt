When I saw this movie in the theater, it was opened in 1995 with an advanced free projection, I was completely enchanted and I would be glad to see it. When I was sorry, I also saw that when I talked with many people, he was totally disappointed and how it ended. On the other hand, I felt the opposite. I was totally happy with the result and everything else. People talked about saying that they were saying! Also, the end of the two fate of the two characters felt that they were unhappy. I realized that these observations were meaningless and that the appearance of the majority of American public filmmakers seems to make it easy for them to easily understand the stories they want to get in the conversations that are not complex and intelligent. mix. Likewise, they like to finish spoon nutrition - happy NOT DOUBT. I am sick of this. Nobody wants to question more ??? And in the end (and I do not want to be a spoiler), I am completely content, I know that these two characters will see each other with one another. It's about your faith about love and destiny. It is a very personal film that does not speak to all people. But he certainly talked to me. Give a chance! Be patient! Richard Linklater has made a beautiful movie with a beautiful story in the backdrop of the city of Vienna. In addition to looking at it, you can also feel comfortable with the city streets. As if you were passing through Euraila all over Europe. It's very intimate. In addition, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy perform a great job to live a complex script. They need to be improvised in some parts and work well. They have great chemistry in their roles. When you begin to know the unknown at first you feel incredibly incredible and you feel love and bond between the movies. I feel like a very personal work for Mr. Linklater and I respect him to do this. It definitely touched me and I expect others too. Bravo for romance for !!!
