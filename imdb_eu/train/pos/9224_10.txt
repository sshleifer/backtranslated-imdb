This movie is amazingly visually appealing. Who cares or does not act. Each scene is an artwork created and captured by John Derek. Locations, designs and costumes work perfectly in a love story that is beautiful, youthful and rich. In some ways, I'd like to pay tribute to John and Bo Derek's story. And ... this comment would not have been completed by Anthony Quinn's father, guardian, lover, and male portrait, since men of that time were male. There are some that add value to trust, trust and confidence that fits in strength and direction. Yes, they do not make such a man! But then how many times you will find women like Bo Derek.
