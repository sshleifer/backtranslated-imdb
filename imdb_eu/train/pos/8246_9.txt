Okay, I did not know what I expected when I saw the cover in Fido, when I came across honestly at the video store, I was tempted to rent this movie, but I did not catch anything about it. But when I was looking at Netflix, I was not scampering with publicity, I'd like to see the scary movie "goofy", so I thought I'd shoot it. I'm glad I saw it, it was a great movie, it was really fun and so enjoyable. As I said, Pleasantville knows the dead Night of the Living, it's just an excellent concept, what happens after a mega-zombie attack? In Shaun of the Dead, as we can see in a zombie comedy, they are fun for zombies who are "useful" citizens. Horror / comedy is very unknown. I think so many people with the movie Shaun of the Dead. But the story is unique and the cast was perfect and that was really fun. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s the space radius on the alternate universe turned the dead into zombies. This radiation continues to be human epidemic, all those who die after their original contamination go to search for the dead. To continue being a normal life, communities are endorsed by the help of a corporation called Zomcon. Zomcon offers neck collars to use zombies as "slaves to control hunger" as slaves or servants. In Willard's town, Helen's housewife buys a zombie despite her husband Bill's zombie phobia. Their son, Timmy, goes to the zombies, naming "Fido". One day, Fido's necklace works and turns his zombie to death next to his neighbor. Timmy "dying" zombified neighbor. When local bullies are blamed for missing neighbors, they catch Fido and Timmy. Helen saves Timmy and Fido from the running of the bulls and tries to forget everything. A few days later, the body of the neighbor is found, and the murder is Fido, who leads to Zomcon. In it, people will be told that it will be destroyed. Timmy learns from a friend that Fido works at a Zomcon plant. Timmy wants to save his neighbor with an assistant with a zombie girl, hoping to return to Fido. <br /> <br /> I really recommend you to watch this movie, if it's so absurd. but very funny. Billy Connelly did a wonderful job as Fido, and he really did not punish the character for the whole life. In most of the times I laughed when Timmy Fido was forced to bury the old woman who was killed and killed, his last words were so funny: "You were not really nice, but did you like flowers?" And bury it in the garden. Neighbor to mention zombie girlfriend, ill, disturbing, wrong but classic laughter. I still love how It's Beaver-esquire left, although there is still a lot in the gore movie. So, if you can see Fido, take it, I give you good luck. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10
