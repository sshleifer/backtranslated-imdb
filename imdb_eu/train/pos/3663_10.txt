Perhaps the latest movie that came from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (that is, a film-based novel). It's real neorealistic fantasy, an oximoron. An elderly woman finds a baby in her cabbage and raises it as her son. After a few years, the baby is a boy (with the name of Toto) and the adoptive mother is dying. He goes to an orphanage and leaves at the age of 18 at the end. He immediately finds that he does not have a home. Toto is optimistic and will not leave anything. A man robs his championship, and instead of being angry, he becomes a friend of Toto and goes to a small town that is left with him. Toto takes some initiatives and organizes a large number of neighbors around it, and builds the best country. Soon, the landlord is trying to sell this land area and they must protect the town's inhabitants. After many attempts, the owner assembles the police force to eliminate homeless people. At this time, the movie has become a complete fantasy (before this, comedy / fantasy melody in Charlie Chaplin). This is a very strange and moving thing, surely others are the best way to see them. It is very amazing and very funny. Thousands of Miracle's plot will undoubtedly be a reflection. Fellini and Visconti were greatly criticized when they started moving away from Neo-realism. I think that I have published that when it was widely criticized. At this time, however, it's very nice - I love it. Perhaps it may be a favorite of Vittorio de Sicaria, although Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves are very close. 10/10.
