"Panic" is a crime comedy drama, with William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neve Campbell. Alex (Macy plays) is a guy who kills people. But for the time being, it is in front of a depression and that is why the therapist sees it. She knows Sarah (Neve Campbell) and falls in love with her. He also has another problem: he wants to leave the family business (murders), but now he has not told how to tell this father. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a story. midlife-crisis, dealing with ordinary problems: in love with a beautiful young girl and all that. <br /> <br /> Pretty performances of play. Macy is brilliant as depressed Alex. I had great hope for this and the movie was good but it was not delivered completely. The story was quite flat and topical. <br /> <br /> 7/10
