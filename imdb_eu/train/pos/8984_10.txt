When I saw the movie in video clips when I saw the direction of my parents. Sundance was in the gutter and started. I love music, especially at the end of the 60's and this is the BJM (Dandys well). Everything about Brian Jonestown's massacre from music, Anton and Joel's personalities were intrigued for illegal drug use. It was fun when I was watching the first party scene, because everyone was doing the lines, my parents walked and wanted to see (their faces were not priceless). However, this is undoubtedly one of my favorite films, Brian Brianstown Massacre, today's favorite band of all time. <br /> <br /> You just saw ... seriously
