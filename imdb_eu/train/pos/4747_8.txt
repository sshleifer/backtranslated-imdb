Anyone who has not seen the Matrix fight has never seen the movie. Fight scenes were choreographed by Yuen Woo Ping's stage actor, including Matrix battles. And battle scenes happen. <br /> <br /> She is overwhelmed and does not feel pain, currently living as a librettist pacifist (I got it). When other evil supersolders begin to attack the drug slaughterers with local drug dealers, Li gets in touch with a friend of the group to stop them. <br /> <br /> There are completely crazy things that happen in this movie (one). Badguy leaves the glass panel and almost warns. The scene of the fight is filled with foot and stitches; body counting is up there. She has seldom been improved and surrounded by beautiful women costars (Yip throws a serious ass like a donkey). Anthony Wong also teaches drugs (there is not so much wit, HK makes a cameo in all movies). It's a shame not to make such films in the US; I would not have to sit down among all these duplicate works to see the action I like so much. Recommended.
