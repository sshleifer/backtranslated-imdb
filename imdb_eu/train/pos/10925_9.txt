I really like the movie. I can see it periodically, and it's not so. I think it's a critique of a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. 6 character introduces us; Each one is a unique kung fu style, very secretive and very deadly. Each of these characters trains the same masters, but their identities are kept secret from each other. The dead master sends his sixth vein to his last student to try to direct his suspicion that some of his students have committed. <br /> <br /> How does the final student find her weeds? How do you know what's wrong? The answer to these questions is a part of this great movie. <br /> <br /> We also see the spectators struggle with each other. It's fun to see how to combine their own styles. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Kung Fu movies, it's a good movie to start. It's better than that.
