My comments are mostly limited to the first season from 1959-60. <br /> <br /> This brilliant series was the first color television and it was a great influence on the Americans to buy what they needed to convince. Color television channels, which is approximately $ 800 in 1959. Currently, they cost more than $ 3,000. How much would we pay for the privilege of seeing a show of 17-inch screen transmitted through a cathodic plaster? I started when I was eleven years old and I saw it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Now, looking at them fifty years later, I find a lot of things in my head. First and foremost, many of the stories are included at the time of Comstock Lode and the silver mining of 1859. 1859 Arms and clothing are largely unrealistic. (Haircuts are out of the debate.) It's basically a nitpick. <br /> <br /> And it would not be possible for Ben to reach the Lake Tahoe area in 1839, and stack up to 100. square kilometer cattle for the next twenty years. The pioneers still tried to solve the Sierra Nevada problem since 1847, and the Gold Rush was not started two years later. <br /> <br /> The Indians did not play Indian American actresses. John Ford was used by American actors in the 1920s. Bonanza producers could easily make it thirty years later. This is my main nitpick for me. <br /> <br /> There are other issues of time. In Season 1, Mark Twain appears and is depicted as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. The stories from 1859 to 1860 (the previous civil war) and most distasteful were the 1880s. There are constantly constant problems. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, so much the first season is dying for nothing. Over time, the murder has been diminished. <br /> <br /> Many episodes take on a liberal society, it is hard to believe that it is time-consuming, but the credits given to writers to prevent seismic changes. National attitudes began in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Taking this into account, the performance is good, and in recent years, I conclude that they are better suited to Adamen than any other. I do not think Pernell Roberts has earned the credits he deserves. Also, Season 1 confirmed that Dan Blocker (Hoss) was a good actor. <br /> <br /> Many stories draw historical historical events. Star guests were interesting. <br /> <br /> It was a great entertainment for the family, and the series made every measure very well.
