In my opinion, Superman continues to be one of the best television shows, as well as one of the most beloved of comic books. <br /> <br /> This series has paid homage to Superman's two films. In the 80s and 80s Superman comics "restarted" in 1986 ("Man of Steel", "Superman Vol 2", "Action Comics," "Superman Adventures"), etc. Inauguration scores and titles were won, according to John Williams based on the film, for a series of Saturday morning series. Marv Wolfman, one of the leading comic restarters ("Adventures of Superman"), was a great opportunity to participate in this animated series. In general, the series had a greater maturity with the full respect of the child. <br /> <br /> Superman was compelling, strong and iconic. His current nematic was Lex Luthor's megalomania / directorate general. The Daily Planet characters were portrayed by Lois, Jimmy and Perry. Wonder Woman is one of my favorite appearances, and the story was Themyscira ("Paradise Island") island home. His design and his mother, Hippolyte, coincided with the series of comic series Wonder Woman during the restart. However, the animated series was developed very well. > <br /> The only thing that is hard to believe is that it has not been released on DVD / Blu-ray! It's worth it.
