Located in the Philadelphia neighborhoods and very interested in local history, Philadelphia offers superb vintage views of the 1940s. There are scenes from the city center, there is an existing non-existent railway station, which still exists, 30. Street Street and North East scenes. The good shots of the old row houses had already appeared. Sometimes the movie is "astonishing" because it's a bit of interest to the audience ... but the general storyline is very good and very moving. Those who enjoyed this movie can see the movie "Bright Victory," Phoenix Valley (PA) - Local Valley footage of the Valley Forge Army and scenes from downtown Phoenixville. The Navy Hospital has become a university campus. None of these films are in any format and I can not imagine why. I record both VHS at home, as shown in TCM in recent years. I recommend to other fans of my area around here!
