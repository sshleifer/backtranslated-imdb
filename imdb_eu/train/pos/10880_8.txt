It's never been the worst movie, the actors are not apalking and the script and the director are not completely inept. <br /> <br /> The best movie ever was, the actors are not great and the script and director are not absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> It falls somewhere in the middle. Somewhere funny Nice place and well built somewhere. <br /> <br /> There's no need to say "do not take seriously" or "good or bad". One of the comments is also not important. <br /> <br /> It has a cut-out atmosphere. Actually, it is a very special atmosphere and an original party with a real movie. Personally, the movie is for me.
