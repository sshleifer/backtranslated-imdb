In the Appalachian, the impact of the four bad cities in the crisis has become synonymous with rural damage. Every four businessmen have to face their darkest fears to face a giant white water, which will replace a dam in the river. Along the way, the locals decide to "kill" their co-workers with many deaths and traumas for those who are alive. Every traveler has a remarkable role, but Voight has the strongest and most powerful. Rural landscape and culture are well trapped, so it is a unique sequence of duel twins. I saw that, when a date came out, not exactly the date of the movie (even if we enjoyed it). I remember this as a dramatic play of Burt, Voight was already established. Every week he was not like a movie but he has a strong punch and is shot in a beautiful way.
