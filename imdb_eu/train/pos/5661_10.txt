People like me a lot in AG, AG would be on the DVD. Well, I bought it on the DVD. (From the borders, not less!) This wonderful show is very beautiful in DVD boxes, but I am very pleased to add a very "very extra" (a comment by Shaun Cassidy's director Pilot pilot episode) and episodes on TV appear in the same order They are. The missing sections that were never shown before in the Sci Fi channel are in a series of squares, but they are linked to the last DVD. If you buy a DVD set, watch it in order, and you'll be happier. (You will need to change your DVD players to see the order, but you'll be happy.) <br /> <br /> S
