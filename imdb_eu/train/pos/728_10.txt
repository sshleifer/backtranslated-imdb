The Ramones, who are the creators of modern punk rock, give their soundless sounds to a horrible movie about a fan of a rock fan (PJ Soles), right in front of Mary Woronov. rock <br /> <br /> An incredible soundtrack with music, RRHS is a great concept in execution and execution. With the wickedness of the audience (like the mouse experiment), the spirit of adolescents (probably my favorite opening), and strange moments, the exterior walls (the hands of the costumes). It seems that if you are looking for a movie that is made in a molecular level, look no further. But if you look for a beautiful, dignified and dramatic epic, you might want to look a little bit further. <br /> <br /> "Hello everyone, I'm Riff Randell and this is Rock & Roll High School!"
