The first movie in a proposed series gets a good balance. Style and class in the early days of Modestus is shown as a refugee and the rise of world power in criminal proceedings. I think it's a very sincere and true portrait of Peter O'Donnell. Modestly, Alexandra Staden is a very beautiful and an excellent choice. It is a very clear way for a hard-living, intelligent / innocent person to survive. And when choosing a brand name from Tarantino, an unknown actor, it will be much more credible to create a face that creates a face. I look forward to the next movie.
