And my children love now! Yes, I can see now and I realize that this animation is not very good, and it is clear in the plot. Hey, if all the villians were to present "DAAAARRRKK HEEEAAARRT ammmmmmm", I think that they can laugh, but it's a moral story that is hard for small children. <br /> <br /> So hard to keep in mind that I've memorized the words I had not seen in this movie for thirty years. Certainly I would recommend this to the youngest children.
