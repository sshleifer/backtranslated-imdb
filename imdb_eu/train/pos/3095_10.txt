So what is the reason? Is there any sale against this beautiful show or someone involved in it? Why would the show I've seen over the years? I'm addicted. I saw this show randomly in the autumn and I loved it immediately and I saw it once a week. Then he left, and I tried Tivo, but he was not sent. So I was a little forgotten until I found sections of the ABC website. Now I want MORE I agree with everyone else, with the rest of the TV's other trash, it's been nice to see something like that rounded up and developed. I'm with Boston Legal for my strange comedy solution and House about my mysterious intellectual. My wife loves Gray's Anatomy because of his "realism" and I love the show / I hate it, but it can not be real for me. Drama too much. It does everything that can go wrong. But once, the real drama really is. True people, real problems. Of course, there are some extremists like an old gangster, fairies, etc. But these people (especially in NYC) are really and relate to them all. It seems I do not get enough. I hope ABC will release copper from its beans and continue this show. Get a QUALITY drama to be respectful. It can be one of the best shows of all time. If someone left.
