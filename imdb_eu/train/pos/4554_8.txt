There are no stories similar to that of Christy Brown. In the 1930s when he was born with a paralysis in Dublin, his parents thought he was mentally and physically handicapped. Although well diagnosed, Brown had almost 20 children in a lower family of working, he had to bet on his family. Using his sole left leg, he learned to write and paint, he trained both skills. <br /> <br /> But "My Left Foot", Brown's autobiography, is a humbleness of what the film version recalls. Jim Sheridan's directors and writers and star Daniel Day-Lewis have no intention of telling this story and do not cry out for melodrama. Cheesy battles and frustration scenes, as well as moments of glorious triumph victory over the story are the wonderful wonders, but "My Left Foot" is real and inspired by itself. <br /> <br /> Day-Lewis is the easiest to highlight. Playing such serious physical problems has to be a daunting task. Day-Lewis does not only give Christy the whole picture, but also chronicles the growth, improvement and internal change of the character in different stages of his life. Christy played at age 17 when she had a limited language ability and was emotionally volatile, Christy learned in the intellect, because she struggles to face why non-platonic love can not be found. The latest movie is the most powerful movie, and it would be nice to get this really out of Sheridan and Shane Connaughton's adapter. However, Day-Lewis understands and sympathizes with all those elements, often giving a compelling performance, you often do not think "wow, so great is the actor." These are among the best performances. <br /> <br /> It is also more important, but it is a work on Sheridan films, which is a subtle way. This story is based on everyday life and rage. Although Christy has been in the state of his life, his struggles are not like ours, and Sheridan takes this concept completely. Christy relates to love, parenting, self-esteem and ability. His fights are physically expressed (literally and figuratively) for us. <br /> <br /> Sheridan gives us moments that capture Sheridan's spirit. The theater evolves naturally when voltages are the greatest and when humor is the same. Christy will find out that her medical / teacher, the woman she loved, is the scene that will marry her brother Peter, the best example of the Day-Lewis and Sheridan efforts. We're ready to do what Sheridan is doing so well, and Day-Lewis goes with her great job. <br /> <br /> Another strong feature of the film is Brenda Fricker. Brown. I did not know that he won an Oscar, but it was something about his performances, the loving and wise mother of Christ, as Oscar called out. Christ's love and his struggle against him seem to be always simple, and he gets much sympathy before his own situation. The rumor of the story is surprisingly small. Perhaps, it was part of the attempt to create a film that is organically human feeling. Both should be compatible, but I imagine the challenge to tell a story that is true, and our emotions give us a dramatic moment in a roller coaster. This was a side effect called "My Left Foot". Brown's situation speaks for itself: they do not have to be tightened by dramatic effects. Steven C <br /> <br /> <br /> Visit my site to get more moviemusereviews.com
