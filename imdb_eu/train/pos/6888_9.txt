I watch movies to live, select enough to distribute ... Excluding those who do not cut. I do not say that I know that I start from that foundation, I'm taking it as I saw "Lou Gospel", in any case ... So many bad films at the table and I'm sitting on all of them. I do not see everything, I usually watch TV on occasion as I am studying the value of production, performance, and story. If something catches the eye, I will take it to see it. "Lou" brought me the first few minutes when my laptop was closed and I moved my chair to the TV so it could be fully tuned. It has been said that I was fascinated with the whole movie. The story is very well-known, the characters are very pleasing and it is repulsive (of course, according to the intention of the actors and directors) and very well-behaved. Sometimes, in camera work and editing, I have occasionally taken on amateur mistakes, but the emotional nature of the story makes these mistakes easy. I have heard other people's comments, sometimes the movies have brought tears to their eyes, sometimes others have an extreme mourning ... I laughed a minute and then wept crying. Unfortunately, I could not get it, as I said - one week late and the dollar was short. Sometimes it goes ... but at least I had a nice time to see it and I can not wait to see what kind of response. Good luck and great luck Bret Carr (if you're reading this), you're definitely a talented man.
