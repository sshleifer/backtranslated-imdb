Another comment on this film felt bad. The photos provided were so new, I guess they were good guides and theater. Davis was so young and fresh. He still did not expect to find his own style. However, it is very good to see this way: it continues to study craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> So many topical films have come up and it seems that this film has made some trajectories in the next 70 years. I see my vote and I remember that this type of film was young. Keep it open and then you can be surprised when the characters were worried, being in 1934 and how we see it as sharp as the beginning of the first century. I love it and I think that you will not affect yourself. negative comments of others and a note.
