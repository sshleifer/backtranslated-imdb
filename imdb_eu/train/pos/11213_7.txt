This second movie is as interesting as the previous one, because there is no suspense. We know what he will do and what will happen before the screen suggests. Then pleasure comes in as many tricks happen and only their sequence comes. We know that there will be a dynamite in the car, it will lose the wheel and damage the car to talk about the car. And this happens. Now you can find details and details for yourself. A woman who could offer him a mute, is obvious and must come, but know that he has already seen and is aware that he is dragging in a trap. Now, how will it come out? That's what you need to know for yourself. And do not worry that he will get the main driver, but how is another story. A speed boat is not busy on our river. We also know that he will be injured. They did not know what these days were the jacket against them. It is true recently that certain IEs did not find such equipment in Iraq. But what's the meaning of that movie? The banning of traffickers and the prohibition that this problem causes is not blindness. But the movie is a perfect and continuous illustration, that there is nothing worthwhile for the moralist crusade against the forces of evil. Why not just look and care for legalization of these goods? If something is not illegal or farther, it's a lot fun to use. Forbidden or restricted is attractive. <br /> <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and Versailles Saint Quentin in Yvelines
