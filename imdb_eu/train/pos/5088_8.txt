I never saw any ideas that I saw when I saw the movie that was designed for that movie. I always thought that it was a success for the end of the 90s. When I saw it on the Internet for television, I was amazed at a TV movie, it was absolutely wonderful! <br /> <br /> The longest thing that was worried about was the most. I felt that a battle scene had to be removed because it was not absolutely necessary. He also started to drag himself to the end as if the adventure had never ended. <br /> <br /> In a positive sense, it has an extraordinary plot, very interesting and attractive to everyone. Patrik Frayze seemed to me to be quite unfamiliar. On the other hand, Gogool, being dementational, became a fool in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I was delighted with the African landscape. Also, in the first half of the film I would give this movie 9. But it's an excellent television movie. From 10 to 8
