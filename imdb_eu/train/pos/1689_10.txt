This movie goes to Halloween for Christmas Christmas horny: small budgets, stars of stars without stars ... and both are the best and most fun absolute movies, both seasonal. CLASSICS !!! "Spaced Invaders" is angry with the warmth and humor and great character ... all five great martyrs, Klembecker Realtor, Russell deputy, Vern's "fuel distribution depot" and many others! You only have to watch this movie to believe and, like "Christmas Story", it's always better and better every look, and you get little and fun every time! DEFINITIONS MORE!
