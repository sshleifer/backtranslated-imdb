This movie is a good one. <br /> <br /> People trapped in a school born. They start to die, they are stalked, so what they do? A girl decides to make a bath, another one decides to make a husband (who is there) with her husband, in a way that is, to find a bed (in an abandoned old school?) And to go there. <br /> <br /> And Gore and T & Arekin. <br /> <br /> And it is also interesting in the historical / sociological perspective. The typical slasher of the 80's is how we see ourselves or how adults see how young people see it, or as Hollywood sees the rest of the country, it has a unique perspective. This is a movie made for an American slasher. It's funny to be British actors trying to speak "American" to be accused of accents in the UK. <br /> <br /> If you like chorizines in the 80s (like Pieces), you'll like this. .
