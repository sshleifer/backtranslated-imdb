To pay attention to Chuck Davis and Emefy: Many years ago I saw PHANTOM LADY, I was still not a crazy jazz. Le SIECLE DU JAZZ, a Paris-based exhibition entitled MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY, will be exhibiting until the end of June. It is a must-have for fun with NINE jazz films, including NINE fragments. I've seen Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr. in almost all screenings, and I can confirm that: 1. Elisha Cook Jr was DUBBED. This was an advance, because most of his appearances are KILLED (especially in THE BIG SLEEP of Howard Hawks). 2. Krupa PL probably doubled. I was familiar with his style at the beginning of his career (and abuse) from tom-tom's graduation - in the SING, SING, SING sequence of the Hollywood Hotel in 1937 - and at the end he got everything he could achieve. call French "la caisse claire". 3. The PL sequence, at least as shown in the Museum, has not been censored
