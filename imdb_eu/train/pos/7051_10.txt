To start, "War, Inc" is not saying everyone's cup of tea. However, it is very nice (and you think "Oh, crap"). The movie does not involve any kind of comedy: it's a bit of a commercial (Tamerlan tanks, dry cleaning service, etc.), and the plot changes alternately and alternately. <br /> <br /> It might be the only one, but I do not compare this to "Grosse Point Blank", because it's different. John Cusack - I would not say it was "amazing" or "excellent" - but it was good. On the other hand, his sister (Joan Cusack) was incredible for the timing of comics and timing - although he was not in the movie (I was talking about Ben Kingsley). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei plays a convincing journalist and escapes her. Hilary Duff is highly recommended as middle-class Asian pop star Yonica Babyyeah. His development as Duff's actor is very prominent in the film, and he works very well (although his accent is not unreal). <br /> <br /> In general, I would call the movie "funny". . It does not have a particular storyline, and sometimes it's pretty strange, but it has a subtle message. I would like the clock to deserve it.
