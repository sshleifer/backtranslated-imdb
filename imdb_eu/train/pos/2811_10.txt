Silverlake Life, from now on, focuses on the AIDS movie and a gay-affair relationship. Some images are really laborious, especially when they are afraid of gay or AIDS, and they surely see the most sensitive person. It's not easy, for example, to make a movie about a terrible illness, and not just its consequences, but the life of two people. This film teaches hard times to get in touch with each other, but never gets rid of excesses, it still shows life at any time, if it reminds us of the theater or your room, it can be people who follow life. While the character is very pleasing, we see privacy in a plane that goes beyond strict limits, without opening any private or offensive. The children have definitely not seen the movie, but the adults should face these situations or not, and they will not regret the tears that they release.
