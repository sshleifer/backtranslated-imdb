Michelle Rodrigez performed for this movie when I watched Fast and the Furious. She could say it was a tough woman. With this movie, he has demonstrated his work, but he is not afraid to show it and this film should be hard. The girl is bad and I like that. This movie is about a troubled girl, lives as a boy and she is constantly in school and in the family. As his brother is interested in being a boxer, he decides to fight for his love and he asks his coach to coach his brothers. Although they do not know they think they're potential, they prove to be wrong. <br /> <br /> I think that this movie was a bit slow at the end, but it was well made. This shows that people can do something, even though they do not think they have a potential. I recommend to see it.
