Sleepwalkers are creatures that totally eradicate the life force of humans ... but they only use virgins (no explanation why). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is a group that needs to feed her mother, Mary (Alice Krige). Tanya likes (Madchen Amick) continues. Will he escape? <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it's a great horror movie. Fast pace, plenty of blood and gore and pleasant and twisted humor. There are lots of jokes for horror fans (Castle Rock is once mentioned). It's also a great Krause (like the "Blue Lagoon" that would be played back afterwards) like Kirge and Amick. But this movie seems annoying to me. <br /> <br /> He wrote for the screen written by Stephen King, and madness is wonderful. Sleepwalks are never fully explained. Where are they from? Why are they called? Why do children need to feed their mothers? Why hate cats and kill them? What are their powers ultimately (Krause suddenly vanishes a car and changes color and style!) Why do they have to nurture the strength of people's lives? Why should virgins only? Why is the son being with his mother? None of them is disturbing the story. It's very bad, aside from these questions, it's an excellent horror movie. Excellent makeup and special effects too. <br /> <br /> Fast, often and fun. If the script is only better. Additionally, a pretty explicit sex scene between Krause and Krige has been edited (you can say) to get R grade. I can not give it 7
