Personally, I despise Jerry Springer Show, however, I think "Ringmaster" is a fun movie this year. The endless satire of "guests" by Jerry Springer began to laugh at the opening scene. Even though Jerry Springer's short essay is a bad attempt to justify his existence, I recommend that this movie be the entertainment value.
