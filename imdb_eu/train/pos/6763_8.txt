Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind, when people (at least, who can do the same thing) and talk about black cinema. <br /> <br /> However, "Out of the past", "The Killers", "In A Lonely Place," "One Night of the Night" is one of the best genres of the genre, with a sophistication. This raises Moody's sentence and beyond his connotations of shadows of belief, fears and femme-fatales. <br /> <br /> "Where there are sidewalks," it's hard to find the movie - maybe the best video game vendor in Manhattan was the only rugged departure from the AMC cable channel - it's one category. With these classics <br /> <br /> Since the passing of the black cloud of openings credits, a television is destroying Marc Dixon's giant detective world, and as time goes by, he will be closer, threatening. <br /> <br /> Of course, a policeman with a "dark past" is known, but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a terrifying and intense look, as it seems uncomfortable. Yes, it's too long about the suspects, and recently warned bosses (Karl Malden, usually normal and strong outsider), "warns him last time." <br /> <br /> However, Dixon hates these wickednesses. And the boy had not come? <br /> <br /> "Caps, washers, mugs, nickel-rats" flutter, shaking off a tough egg of a boss and throwing off complaints from the right-hander at Dixon. This advice is for your benefit. Instead, things are in their hands. <br /> <br /> And what is the problem that is encountered in the world of problems based on instincts, and falls into the nature that would have passed before or after a generation. <br /> <br /> Immediately deepened with the police, the union, and his partner. Dixon's "investigation" questioning the assassination of his crime threatens his work, questioning whether he is the foundation that has justified him or her. As in Bogart's "Lonely Place", "can he escape?" <br /> <br /> When he does not have to turn it off, he realizes that he has condemned an almost unexpected relationship with a serious beauty (the wonderful Gene Tierney), as it seems to deserve to return home to his old bachelor's degree. to do it <br /> <br /> This great movie is a long and stiff pause. The writers who helped make production sharpened the brilliant script: it is a wonderful conversation, that is, if it was fed into a similar parody, without turning into a passionate and melodramatic. <br /> <br /> And play and performance is not very demanding or scary to release the emotional emotion of the movie. The great beauty of the gentle focus of Gene Tierney is used. He shows off as a great actress, and his gentle and pleasant nature is unlimited here, because his psychosis is "Let heaven". The scenes between Tierney and Andrews's Dixon are getting faster and more self-destructing. <br /> <br /> At the end of his rope, he cut, wounded and exhausted Dixon summarizes his part: "Innocent people can also jelly ..." he says. "You are a fake and overhead man." <br /> <br /> Perhaps this film is so absolutely compelling that it has a sense that things have been almost wrong for almost anyone to be able to direct - especially for those who are trying to do it well - with a slight wind change, an incorrect or perforated decision or even more fearful , due to factors that are uncontrollable. Noirek has always reflected the darkest fears, he has taken them to the surface. "Where are the pavements" in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> (Excluding one: otherwise, this mysterious film is a mysterious mysterious, mysterious theater play that would not appear. It's not so funny). /> <br /> Noir fans - heck, any movie fans - those who have not seen this is wonderful.
