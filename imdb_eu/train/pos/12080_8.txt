Julia Ross (Nina Foch) will take an agreement with the wealthy Hughes family as secretary to overcome her boyfriend. Almost immediately he is taking drugs and takes him to the family home in Cornwall. When he wakes up, when they say that he is Marion Hughes, he has a mental illness and he keeps it closed ... but why? You'll probably think why, but you're not worried because this is fun. <br /> <br /> "The Narrow Margin" and "Face Behind the Mask" is one of the best B photos ever. (B images were low budget photos with low budgets and no big stars). It is always necessary (it's only 65 minutes), it is well-aimed, fast and exciting. I find a little I do not want to buy, it's only for the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Foch (a good actress) is well-aimed but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is superb (and awesome) as a criminal. Well worth the catch. A great example of how to make a great movie on a small budget.
