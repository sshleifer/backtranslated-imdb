First of all, it's not as good as the book, especially when you are the author of Tolkien's masterpiece. Adaptations admire the Tolkien universe in the 1970s, psychedelic, aesthetic and liberal culture. Yes - the animation and backdrop sometimes is a bit "rough" in its technical execution, but it is beautiful and it is very suggestive to give a single "place" for each scene. Beyond the peculiarities of the images, there is a dramatic representation of the voice - act out in new direct action films at the upper FAR. And while cell animation may not be the most "technically proficient", it captures expressive gestures of body and face, while ignoring subtle and nuances. Background paintings vary according to the type of traditional fantasy, but the passage of abstraction settings is always motivated by narration and helps the film's themes a lot. If you have a person with a great computer rendering feature in a movie, if you can see everything you like, you can see how you like this movie, but if you enjoy transcendental theater and theater, then JRR Tolkien's film is to be seen.
