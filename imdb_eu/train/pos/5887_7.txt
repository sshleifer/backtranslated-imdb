So Mary and Rhoda have grown old - who does not? I was a teenager when Maria was released, and when a "young adult" left the air. Yes, it was wonderful to see Mary and Rho together, and maybe the movies did not suffer from the comedy of the original series, but it was enough to recall the spirit they had in some series to accommodate this tribute. For example: She tells the producer who has hired Mary and the idea of ​​a new series about "elderly people". Is not the mindset of today's Hollywood and television "bean counters"? This may not be THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW its best - but quite a damned good look grew back in the seventies in one of the best shows.
