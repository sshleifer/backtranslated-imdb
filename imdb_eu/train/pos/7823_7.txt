A long, but compelling, recap of the friendship between Steve Biko and Donald Woods, civil rights director. The strongest part of the film is the relationship between two men, and how we help each other, but the second half is not so strong because of the elimination of the two characters. However, Klin and Washington have a compelling movie with a great performance, in the movie on the map by the latter. Washington was also the best-placed actor. Generally, a good movie that can be cut short. 7/10 .____________________________________
