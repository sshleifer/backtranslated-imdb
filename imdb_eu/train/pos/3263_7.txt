I enjoy movies that I usually like, such as "Options", but I was not happy with it for some reason. It was quite well done in the first half, when Alex Finch died and he re-entered a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and friend (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who is now grown up. The scenes that come with them again and Downey was once again rediscovered, and there is a good emotion and happiness when Shepherd finally believes that her husband is really revived, but that's where the movies go down. I have completely diverted several scenes related to sex, especially if they want to rejoin Downey and Shepherd, despite being inequality. After that, the film ends in the most delightful way, considering the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I did not make the film so immobile for the end. This story has a great potential and the scenes of the sky are fine. There is a good song by Peter Cetera and Cherk, but in the end the movie is not great. To get a similar movie, try "Heaven Can Wait". It's decent, but I really would like to see it for the scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> *** outside ****
