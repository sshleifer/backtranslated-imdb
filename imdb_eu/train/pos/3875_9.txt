This film has made one of the most absurd Canadian singers, Yves P. Pelletier. For the second time, I was surprised that ROMANTIK made a comedy, but knowing that he was a heavy zinephile when I saw it at every local festival and in local cinema, I had a positive feeling about this movie. Hell, I was right. On the one hand, Pelletier's scenario becomes a bit tricky and it is difficult to monitor, but in the form of Pelletier, it is the only 90-minute toy type. <br /> <br /> Spell-linking (Laclos) inspired and transformed quotations are the notes of "Les Aimants" in the fridge. You're the one who writes for whoever is writing about the whole movie, and that's where an interesting love will appear. <br /> <br /> Storyline, great picture, great mentions of other films. Should we ask for the first movie?
