Also known as "Water Lilies", this film tells the story of two girls' girls to enter into the world of love and sex. This story is told in slow pace and works well. It offers plenty of time and space to discover different characters and to grow something that is attached to them. <br /> <br /> Using a small piece makes a pressure structure as it has more time on screen while playing. Normally, people who are playing this movie are well-managed. Everyone is incredible. Visual adjustment is great, especially underwater diving that adds a pleasant effect to the underwater pool. <br /> <br /> There has been a lot of films on this subject, but this is not one of them. It produces some "standard" pressure methods on the top of the hat and on which it works. It's not a bad thing, in any case, but it's probably not very good, and I think it would do better if it does something that is not explored. <br /> <br /> 10 to 10 swimmers
