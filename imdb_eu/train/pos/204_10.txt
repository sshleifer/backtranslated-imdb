First, I like almost every movie Neil Simon. However, there is something special, that is, it draws me, and I would say that it is one of the most entertaining comedies I've seen. I saw the second time, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet Grandmothers? <br /> <br /> Ah, fear that they might sue them, so he changed men. And if only the housewives, the faster stars could be more fun. Well, it's a personal review, and at the age of 97, my grandmother still lives (even though Walter Matthau has overcome her superb impression), but some people should find resonance in these characters. <br /> <br /> Secondly, George Burns did not give me any tolerance, but he made it one of the best promotions I remember somehow (and he also enjoyed my grandmother's mother, even though she does not know the great resemblances shared by the character of the film). br /> <br /> Very ethnic taste, and at the top, you both laugh or laughter or deactivate it. For me, it's nice.
