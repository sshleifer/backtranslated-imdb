I have seen the last five or ten minutes of this film when I went to bed one night in 1999 or 1999, and I really liked what I saw. Since then, when I watch TV shows, I turn DVD / VHS parking lots into stores, but I have not found a copy recently when I found it in some of the stores that were sold on the Internet. Then, being a world procrastinator, I have not yet promised. In the end, I found a copy of the DVD Circuit in the city of Portland, OR, while I visited it. Then, he came back home and only took me a month before seeing it. <br /> <br /> So what do I think about the movie? It's ok I did not remember and I was just as good as I expected, but I was still worth 9.99 dollars. After watching the whole movie for the first time, I value it as a 7/10, so it's 8/10. So I have to be asleep, and I'm going to have a better sound system to avoid catching some conversations.
