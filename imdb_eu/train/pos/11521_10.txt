The magician is a wonderful career from start to finish, mostly thanks to the magic of the stars. Alan Arkin is fantastic in his decades in one of his best roles. It is really like a beautiful movie, the result of the depreciation that travels the subject and the dreams. I can not believe it, I'd buy it on DVD but I still have not found any outlet.
