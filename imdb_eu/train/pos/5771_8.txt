This is one of those films that you take during a surfing on a Saturday afternoon and you will enter and end up seeing the whole thing. I thought they worked well and I really felt in the characters. It's a bit sluggish, but considering Bonnie and Clyde and their relatives, it's never boring. We really do not see all the robberies that are so legendary, and most shooters take control of the police. Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, thought I had a good job. Nice country to go to a cold killer girl is a challenge to portray, and I liked it with great functionality. <br /> <br /> In general, the average effort was exceeded, especially considering TV.
