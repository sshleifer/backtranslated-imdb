A worldwide premiere on September 9, 2006, at the Isabel Bader Theater, at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). <br /> <br /> This was an interesting premise but it still has too many shots that are still too long. eWaste batteries (recycled computers, keyboards, etc., are sent to China and then sold and upgraded for new products) and other disaster. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers wanted to get more. People interviewed to promote the human element but were often prevented by China's censorship. However, what was interesting. It was particularly striking to be hanging and resembling a senior real estate agent in Shanghai and a luxury garden. The tracking of a 480-meter factory floor was also pretty good. The three scenes of the Three Gorges Dam project on TIFF (Still Life / Sanxia Hao and Dong documentary) were complemented by the Jia Khang-je film, which was built around this theme. <br /> <br /> The director of Jennifer Baichwal, producer Nick de Pencier, the filmmaker Peter Mettler and director Edward Burtynsky, starred in a Q & A after the premiere of the world. Producer Noah Weinzweig entered the audience and thanked China as a contributor to the ground.
