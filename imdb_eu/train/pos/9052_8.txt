The drama is beautiful and it's a pleasant change in today's loud and loud films. It is a solid store based on another, which still means a lot for dramatic purposes. To be honest, I do not know but I liked the story. <br /> <br /> The story is about a young man of the fifties, that is, he is interested in the rocket and wants to enter this area instead of working in charcoal mines. The rest, including his father, are in West Virginia. The main problem is the conflict that arises between the boy and his father, I think it was excessive. I'd like to have a little tension between two. <br /> <br /> A young boy, still a boy, plays Jake Gyllenhaal, I think one of the first tasks. It's honest, it's here as well as school mates. It's a great day to see beautiful children in a current movie. The other two key actors in the film are Chris Cooper (dad) and Laura Dern (all the time encouraging). <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is a fun soundtrack in the 1950's. Once again: I want more types of films made today.
