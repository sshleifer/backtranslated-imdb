James Dean et., When we arrived too late, when we arrived for children for Baby Boomers. Al., Martin Sheen's Way showed us this excellent feature. <br /> <br /> The premise is simple enough: the hot hood small town Sheriff and All-Hell will arrive, but this movie captures nuts and screws. in every car nut <br /> <br /> No, this is not Casablanca, nor great literature, but a car, riot, and Martin Sheen's genius is a serious movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> Enjoy this and appreciate what you are and what it will be for Martin. I was growing up as a teenager of the 70s I love this movie and you too will be.
