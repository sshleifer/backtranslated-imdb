This is a great movie. When I first saw it, Scottish accents were hard for me to understand and ruined their visual experience. I canceled it there, but then I bought the DVD, when I used subtitles in English, and I really entered into this movie, knowing how good it is. It's great. <br /> <br /> The splendid part of the panoramic photo has a stunning scenery, and it reminds me of the story with Braveheart, the story of an evil disorder. Here, Liam Neeson (good) vs. Tim Roth (evil). Both do their job well. <br /> <br /> A few actors are just as well known as Roth. Man, you really want to swind that boy in his courageous and irritating joke. (It's so bad and wicked that the patient's critics love them more than others). Neeson is a male man, and the hero is a strong figure, as it was in Gibson Braveheart. Jessica Lange is a strong female leader. The film is completely supportive and totally implies you, ready to be seen to be an emotional experience.
