well, I have said everything in the summary, simply adore the movie and cast ... I have an Oscar for every actor ... great, great movie ... I'm 25 times now and 4 times, and I always think I do not cry and always do I have about 2 or 3 times ...;) meryl s. It was totally brilliant, jeremy irons ... just brilliant ... I would like to receive more awards for the movie ... I do not really know who he saw and did not love to love ... Also, Glenn was fantastic. ... the story was beautiful and dull at the same time ... although everything I loved was clear and love loving each other, and how pale it was next to their parents ...
