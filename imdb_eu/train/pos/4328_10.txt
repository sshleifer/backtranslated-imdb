I bought this DVD for this version to compare it to today's BBC 2005 (which is great). In 1985, Arthur Hopcraft adapted it to the Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for television and died this year (2005). I recall the great performance, especially Rigg and Elliott, and from mobile music. (Music is much less in the 2005 version, but it is very significant). Other comments to collect in a couple of points: Richard Carstone is Ada Claire's boy, not Esther. Esther was not a uncle. Charlie Drake never played in version Krook, nor did Toby Esterhase also play TTSS! Krook plays the comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Bernard Hepton played Toby. <br /> <br /> They are excellent adaptations of the great novel by Dickens. Now read the book! It's not perfect, and feeling feelings can sometimes surprise you, but you're not crying, and laughed!
