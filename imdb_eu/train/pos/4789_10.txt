But it's worth it, because Rose story can not help the movie as it progresses. <br /> <br /> This movie is a story of a journey. As with all trips, it is a journey in the geographic and human sense. At the beginning of the film, we begin to understand that it is an adventure journey, that an elderly man from Alvin should not reasonably do it. <br /> <br /> But on the way we learn slowly how Alvin has so many titles. which is difficult to achieve. Its purpose is very simple and correct. His brother is ill and is likely to die and he wants to visit. Many years ago he has fallen into it, and they have not talked for a long time. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin meets people. The essence of this film is the way in which the attitude and knowledge of them is benefited. We want to know who Alvin Straight is Alvin. And at the end of the movie, we know who we are ... better.
