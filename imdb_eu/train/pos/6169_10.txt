Rohinton Mistry's multifaceted novel seemed impossible to fit on the screen, but the film is filled with passion, emotion, humor and patience. The story is pretty slow, but there's always something to fascinate the audience. The film captures a specific time and place with a specific accuracy. All actors are from India - they know the "Western" viewers, but they are delighted, above all, in a convincing way. Do not delete the title and language summary - a movie that can be viewed on the big screen. We learn a lot.
