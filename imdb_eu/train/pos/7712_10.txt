First Level, Fear. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this movie 10 times, I know they will give me nightmares. He did that. As surprisingly, as I recall, it was just as sane as watching the monster that caused the sound. <br /> <br /> Two levels, the psychoanalytic theory. <br /> <br /> Later, as an adult, I saw the story what it was: if all of us, the wild and unintentional instincts we repress would be revealed. <br /> <br /> Level 3, pure science fiction. <br /> <br /> The best way to realize it. "What If" match achieved through the science fiction genre. This is a pure science fiction, not the "Cowboys space" that passes through today's genre. <br /> <br /> After 43 years, the Restoration Plan remains the greatest of all science fiction films. If you organize a remake, SKG or Lucas, be careful!
