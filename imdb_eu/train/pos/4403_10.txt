Ride with the Devil, like Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain, is a film with aesthetic and historical significance. Film lovers should see at least twice their artistic nuance. <br /> <br /> The perfect artwork, the amazing depth of humanity. I do not really remember a war movie, it will catch you, it will change your spirit of history and politics, it will restore humanity's belief. After seeing so much murder, so much suffering, you do not feel numb, instead you will raise the connection between humans. Actors' performances break your heart, turn your music on your head. Some buds are not just a few photos, they overcome themselves, making them soulful. That's the fact that the film is a genre of real meaning. <br /> <br /> A movie like this does not require a lot of opinions or opinions, everything he says. That's why Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, filmmaker and composer of beautiful and lyrical music, have to work!
