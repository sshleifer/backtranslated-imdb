"Flag against Flag" is a bit classic. All the elements that an enthusiast of adventure can expect, and more in the following: the girl is in trouble, well, it's not really a problem. As Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is his best sport, his enemies defiance of social norms of that time. Anthony Quinn has billed three actors in the role of captain Roc Brasiliano, and Brian Hawke (Flynn) is an evil nationality. It's essential to watch "Anti-flag" for classic adventure enthusiast. Although Errol Flynn's first work, such as Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk, is still very funny.
