This is the movie that takes the time to take your head once. The interviews are perfect because a play has been adapted. The actors give their best, the story is easy and attractive. Happy 88-minute happiness! <br /> <br /> Yvan Attal is quite credible in his role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still a pretty blonde (but not so muted) that pleases her eyes, Jean. Paul Rouve offers a great approach to the whole approach (and proud), and Marina Fois is a little friend of age as a joke. When you expect the least expected. To adapt this excellent play and to make the best of the best production partners! <br /> <br /> I would like to have more of these current productions. If you prefer, you will probably enjoy: "Un air de famille" and "Cuisine et dependances". Both were written and performed by both Bacri / Jaoui couples.
