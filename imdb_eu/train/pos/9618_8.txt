I recently bought the movie and I do not regret it, I am very pleased to add this movie to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, film directors, took less than a month to make the movie and spent about 1 million euros to produce a great movie. This proves that great productions are not only good films. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie is perfectly suited. The computer language in BUG means that the computer function is an error that causes reactions. Our reaction can cause negative side effects, but also great moments of beauty. The wonderful events of this movie begin with the death of a BUG. A man witnesses the "crime" on the other side of the road ... From there everything becomes more complicated ... <br /> <br /> I explain to John Carrol Lynch ("Fargo"), Wallece. who can not do everything well.
