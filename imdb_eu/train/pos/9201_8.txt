Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice) are siblings of one single parent family. Jasbir (sister) is growing in a prosperous environment, but this is not enough to exclude her life and eventually join a hippie movement that will take her to the drug. On the other hand, Prashant (brother) grows in a relatively poor environment, but has become increasingly mature. The story is that Prashant strives to save his little sister (constantly in a trance) from a hippie environment. This movie is a check on time, instead of warnings and hardships that are a place for those who leave life, when they should unfortunately face them and, unfortunately, they should be counted. In this film, great music compositions, different situations and different things in different people, and the director gives him a strange feeling.
