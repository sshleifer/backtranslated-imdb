After seeing some of the comments that we have placed here, I have the main complaint with this presentation. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are very attractive: the "excellent" and beautiful, very "off-center" character of the victim, (if only they are totally "disappointed") "- each other who plays it against it, like a kind of Caucasian Kabuki scene. <br /> <br /> This is fine, and this is, of course, a "rotary table" above all. But the complaint I mentioned is that the director attributes Farrah's attribute He had the desire to demonstrate well-known and obvious physics, starting with a thin dress with exquisite dresses, as well as showing dramatic effects on more than one scene, it is very pleasing to the eyes, but diverting the level of joy of the drama. <br />> Its I give a few written and directed concerts, but they are skeptical and joking and tired, they are not true - according to previous experience with Farrah, the only worst-case scenario, and that he did not have there is reason to be overly abused. <br /> <br /> But this is a movie and a story, although so credible, the director's work.
