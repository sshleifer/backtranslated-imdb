Industry has dropped the ball. The trailer did not make the film's justice and when it opened, there was a hand full of screens. If he had seen the people, the mouthpiece would be very successful. Each of the 2 commercial actors gives you great emotional performances, especially those that draw on the story, especially the characters. I saw Richard Roeper or Ebert and Roeper in the book's good recommendation. Except for a few screens, an example that has never been released. This did not allow them to see. In some movies the video goes live, because they are not good. This is worth the Oscar and at many levels it is a tragedy, most of whom will never hear. Maybe by mouth you will get this on DVD or cable. If you do not see this movie, you should do it. This movie is made up of two of the best actors of the main actors. It's just another formula for a special formula of the school, but it's especially good for other great movies. The girl finds herself paused. If you like this you would like it. <br /> <br /> Both girls are in a great emotional scene, one after another. Although Alicia is angry, Deanna is crying over most of the movies, so stereotypical or melodramatic characters are not real. The movie will move you to many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor, use this real theater as your school. Erica is better than Traffic. I hope these actors get both roles that use great talents and shine. Watch this movie and if you want, recommend that your friends do not get lost among all the crap blockers that come out every year. This movie was engraved on Spiderman 2 tops. What words do we live? AGHhh. So recommend the world again.
