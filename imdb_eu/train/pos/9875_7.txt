Introducing Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a nice movie, but I think it might be better. Judy Garland is as great as ever, but some of the movie scenes have no place and Van Heflin and love relationships are rapidly developing. <br /> <br /> I mean, for a moment, he is ready to attack himself. But he falls in love with the next. I think this production, movie editing and script (although it was excellent photography, although it could be a nice landscape and the costumes could be very nice) could be a little better. Production seems to be very fast. <br /> <br /> The good actors were good, especially Janet Chapman, the youngest daughter of Rosie. At the age of 11, she looks very nice and it is shameful not to become a comedian teenager. In this movie, it is much better in its previous films in the 1930s at Warner Brothers (except Broadway Musketeers in 1938), it is much better to enter a hybrid Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason. In general, the movie could have been better, but eventually Judy gave everything.
