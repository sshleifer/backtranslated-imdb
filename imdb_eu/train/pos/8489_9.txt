I study online at a secondary school and include cultural activities so that students learn about the country and their language. And seeing "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. Students can buy or rent the movie. Stereotyping or not, this helps students to see others regardless of the world and their lives. Many of my students were told they liked me so much, they will get a copy of them. It is really interesting that what we value in this culture and what culture values ​​is interesting. I can get rid of the TV version. I am in a gross language that I do not use at all times for self-employed workers.
