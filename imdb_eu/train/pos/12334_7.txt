Is there someone knowing that this film shot? The abyss scene is a beautiful aviation. It seems to be England. However, Ivy's apartment building definitely looks like the Brill building with its magnificent lifts. <br /> <br /> Charles Mendl is playing "Sir Charles Gage". Maybe I'm blinking, but I've never seen it. Maybe it was her husband's lawyer, but again, I do not remember that character being a movie, except as a phone call. Maybe there was the aviation scene? Or in the room scene? Has anyone found it? <br /> <br /> When Herbert Marshall filmed this movie for 57 years.
