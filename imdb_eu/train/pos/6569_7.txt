"Jake Speed" is a wonderful movie with a wonderful message. It's obviously a mistake. Sometimes it's slow. His story is very far from his evildoer. The action is done at the pace of the crab heart. He fired the Z-grade (I've always admired Karen Kopins's work, which looks good on Sandra Bullock). <br /> <br /> But with all of this, "Jake Speed" is truly inspiring thanks to a brilliant script by Wayne Crawford (title role) and Andrew Lane. <br /> <br /> Why do I find it so inspiring? He told me, "Hey, why not try to be a good person" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < everything The bad things are in the real world that happens to people. Jake Boy Scout is more than one. It is more than a knight of shining armor. Jake Speed ​​Optimism is careful in a dirty, wicked world. <br /> <br /> That's why "Jake Speed" really had to be successful. It has a wonderful message to Hollywood and then all over the world. <br /> <br /> Imagine the honest people and the good movie industry. I do not say that we were watching every theater in Walton's cinemas, but it would be nice to have more movies like "Jake Speed". ("Due South", a television about a Mountie in Canada, is a good comparison to make American shows bright.) <br /> <br /> Surely "Jake Speed" has violence, blood and guns. But the general message is that if you try hard enough to become a good person, you will frustrate the forces of evil. 10/14/99
