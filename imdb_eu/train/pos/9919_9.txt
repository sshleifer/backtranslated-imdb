A wonderful movie that is wonderful, wonderful and horrible, without the "Apocalypse Now" fiction. Slow pace, silent, gives good looks to the poisonous patches on the Earth, which might be signs of an imperative condition. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt in my mind - it is full of nature and we are sick. The essence of humanity that encourages greed, evolution and progress, we have become something like cancer, to consume the host and kill him ... <br /> <br /> The manufactured landscape is unforgettable. experience - at least I never get my toaster and iron again.
