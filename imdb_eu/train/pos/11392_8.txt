Paris is the place to enjoy art and music, and fall in love, as in this film. The boy knows the girls, they are in love, but something is eternal happiness, a classic story. <br /> <br /> The wonderful music of George Gerschwin completes the excellent dance of Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. "The American in Paris" movie is humorous, clear and honest and it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
