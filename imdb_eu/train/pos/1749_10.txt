Steve Carrel proves that having a good head is a wonderful fresh air, original and passionate. I had a touch on myself. <br /> <br /> Basically the title of the film says everything: Andy Stitzer, a 40-year-old man who works at Electronics Store. He is a nerd who loves video games and comics and has the largest collection. Her partner with her shop is a conversation between the Virgin Mary during a full-length poker game, and then Andy has to take a very funny look at sexual damselfly, but she'll always take her. He's not lost his virginity, but at last she got lucky. <br /> <br /> Leave the smallest at home, but take the whole family, a romantic comedy for adults. You can start and crack from the beginning, and when you're done, you want to wear your xenobs with very thick absorbents. One other thing that can be said about it is also bad for Steve Carrel who was not outgoing as he was known 20 years ago. Without a doubt, the next MTV movie Awards will get the best prize. You can bet your earned dollar to the people! <br /> <br /> I give it a perfect 10!
