When I found the Christmas calendar, I did not know its title because I did not read the novel and I did not listen to the movie. In any case, after reading the content, I decided to spend the Christmas night watching the movie. The effect has totally impressed me: I do not remember the film that I saw every time I saw it last time. I LOOK AT OUR, definitely, is one of the films that make up the real surprise I have received from cinema. Here are some arguments, I think, this film is a very small piece of good cinema. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, all the content is especially instructive. He must offer something to the modern public: a direct response to faith and universal questions. Does Christ need in our time? Does love still matter? What is faith? What is the burden and suffering of life? Is it really true that someone can trust me? The film gives content answers to what happens to the characters, because it will happen to all of us. <br /> <br /> Second, the movie is exceptionally human. The main characters have internal struggles and they face tough decisions. Is Kyle David Denman better) and Teri (Megan Paul) to keep his life and forget about the family or the values ​​they teach at home? Is John (Ken Howard) better able to leave Ellen (Barbara Babcock), his wife, and a lover of Julia (Donna Bullock) to start a happy new life? Indeed, Ellen never recognized him ... However, THEIR EDITEDER decides to eternal fidelity. John's brother rebel, Phil (David David Morin), would be better to have his life easy, but he does not have enough satisfaction or to start thinking more than once. Phil's prayer to God is a psychological masterpiece of universal aspect of humanity in the park. These words can all say where everyone does not, when or how they live. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film is a great portrait of the family, nowadays it is not known: there are still problems, these people are always more powerful than ever. "Something" is love and trust. I know it's a bit of an idealist. All families can not trust in fidelity and this will not be easy. However, education is very educational and realistic. <br /> <br /> Fourthly, all the films focus on people's attention. If we want to live a happy life in our society, we need to understand one thing: we must help each other. Alexander (Ossie Davis) is an example of this position. At the beginning of the movie, John talks about praying. Later, he helps his brother. Alexander is the "angel" sent to "John" and his family. Can not angels become one another? <br /> <br /> Fifthly, artistic features are also worth the attention. ADVANTAGES: Barbara Babcock has a real performance with Ellen and, although difficult, she works well. Let's say, for example, when it appeared at school and taught again badly. Ken Howard is also a faithful husband, memorable. PHOTOGRAPHY: The most memorable for me was the scenes of John and Ellen in the park that fell in the autumn, while the sun (love) spreads everywhere. I interpreted it as a symbol: although it is sad, it can always be light and joy ... <br /> <br /> A REAL FILM is a wonderful movie. to love, to what fidelity, again he proved to me how beautiful it is to live and to believe. In the end, I would like to mention the deep words in the movie that I liked very well and I hope you can do that too <br /> <br /> Kyle's uncle Phil: Yes, (John Brighton) lives the Bible. But no one is forced to do so. However, what regulations do you live in?
