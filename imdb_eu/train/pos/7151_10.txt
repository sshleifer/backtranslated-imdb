I read holes in Level 5, so I was listening to a movie. Of course, as I was busy, I did not have the opportunity to watch the movie in the theater. The holes were outside the city but, unfortunately, they were busy. I was surprised to see all my friends and nobody invited me! They all said that it was good, but I read the great read books, so I was worried, so I was worried. <br /> <br /> It was a great opportunity to see it suddenly. That was the end of that week and my parents went to a cruise and stayed at the nursery school. My sister, who is 9 years old, and I saw it and I loved it! Then I took the nursery home to others, and their children, 9 and 4, liked it. My parents also love it and the movie critics are deffinately. In general, I recommend this film to anyone who understands family morality, and it's fun! This movie should be in your 5 "watch" list!
