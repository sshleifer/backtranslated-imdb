Excellent and well-produced Classic 40s. There are very dramatic scenes in the film John Garfield (Al Schmid), "Force of Evil", 48 and Dane Clark (Lee Diamond), "Last Rites", with a total of 88 fighting against World War II. and with a machine gun. After being injured by a massive injury that Schmid was able to go home, his troubles began with his family and a friendly maid. Dane Clark had a prominent assistant, named Lee Diamond, to help his friend Al again with her. The victory of the war is never and will not be forgotten, not forgetting the military soldiers wounded in the Veterans Hospital of all Wants and now in Iraq Vets!
