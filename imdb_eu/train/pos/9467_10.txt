I liked DAN IN REAL LIFE from outstanding reviews and well-written dramas - thank you when Peter Hedges and Steve Carell are in the movies, you will see that LITTLE MISS is a viewer. SUNSHINE, very entertaining and rewarding. DAN IN REAL LIFE ruled. <br /> <br /> The movie is a real life for many of the people around the world, they lost a partner and they still have a long life to look for something to return to magic. before losing With Steve Carell and the wonderful Juliette Binoche, since their relationship was so beautiful and written, their scenes are so real characters and their travels. Plays, sets and stories DAN IN REAL LIFE has been remembered as the holidays go by.
