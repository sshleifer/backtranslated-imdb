The amazing work British "The Divorce of Lady X (1938)" was a small effort. It marks the first pair of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, nineteen. Before that little film about uncontrollable passion for Males in the Middle Ages. And Olivier and Oberon are not particularly well-versed with comedy tightness, everything goes well. Oberon Leslie is a young woman who ends up in Logan's (Olivier) divorce lawyer. He makes it possible without any head to make it intoxicating him, but as he goes mad, he falls for him. And he falls. But there is a serious case of identity in Oberon's "Lady X" (that's all Oliver's notice) Olivier thinks she is married. Worse and more entertaining, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivine to think that his wife, Larry, is dear Oberon. There are some conversations and conversations about sex politics. You see, Olivier is not very confident about comedy, but Olivier is a real professional and gives it. And it handles screws and turns, maybe not easily, but at ease. Oberon was not a great actor, but usually had enough power, and although he was known on his supposed screen, he worked well with Olivier. This was the first Technicolor filmed at the beginning, which looks really like today (all of us are whiter than Michael Jackson), but maybe it's got to be printed.
