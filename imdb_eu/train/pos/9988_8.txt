What I love about the adaptation of the Stone Angel's screen is that the novel is so true! Great movie As an avid reader, the worst thing about film adaptation is that the book has been lost in some way. The Stone Angel team should be careful with caution so that this movie does not happen. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn was a great opportunity for Hagar's function. However, I think that a great work that guarantees a great deal of praise for the likes of a Canadian actor (Christine Horne) in her younger years of playing Hagar. I have not seen a previous work by Horne, but I will definitely lose sight of his Stone Angel performance. <br /> <br /> I heard the release of The Stone Angel's Canadian theater in the spring or summer. 2008. I can not wait to see it again on the big screen!
