This is one of the films that made me aware of the importance of making movies. In general, I am a fan of movies based on real-life stories. And this is GREAT! He has won many awards and praises of Meryl, which is the most important feature of the film. It is a shame story of a couple who has suffered a horrible emotional pain in the face of unexpected and brutal deaths of children's children, which really shows human inhumanity, and explains his barbarity. a very fine and faithful society. It's interesting that people who are intelligent and intelligent people (for example, the emotional movie mothers) feel true of themselves, for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices, to decide to wait for themselves. and to find their opinions in the light of all the facts that clearly emphasize. The other face of the civilized society that exposes the film is the apathy of human suffering (to say, it is very general, even if this particular story is in Australia). to be a true cruelty. You need to see something you're serious about and maybe thinking about it.
