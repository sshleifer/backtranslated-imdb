I have seen several times on the Sundance channel several years ago and I received a nice movie noise from the system. It's a semi-fictional but hard-fought, modern-day culture of today's media (or lack of it) that goes far beyond the unhappy road of Hollywood residents. Early stage play by Mark Ruffalo and a memorable film by DP Polish Movies. There was a passionate commitment of humor and there was a strange original feeling to be definitively separated. This movie wrote all the classic worship, and I'm surprised I'm still not on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Fortunately soon.
