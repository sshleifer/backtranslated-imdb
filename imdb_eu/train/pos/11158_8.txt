An amazing and well-done chiller is a tale that tells of stories of murder and malignancy. <br /> <br /> He attempts to test how much the doctors are doing with violent sex murderers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Incubus is a mystery that has a horrible sequence of murders that builds off-beat and mysterious climate movements. The murder scene is lively and gory, so this is not a fun movie! John Hough's management, along with strange music scores, creates a dark atmosphere with fear over the film. It also makes the Gothic atmosphere. Beautiful shooting and excellent camera work are also worthy of note. <br /> <br /> Cast is not bad either. John Cassavetes makes a good performance as a new medical community. On the other hand, local Kerrie Keane reporter, historian of Helen Hughes, and Duncan McIntosh are considered as psyches. <br /> <br /> All about Incubus is a horror movie that has been forgotten. Discover and re-evaluate. **** outside ****
