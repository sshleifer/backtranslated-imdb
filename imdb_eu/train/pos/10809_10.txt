Russell, my fav, is gorgeous in this movie. However, the film takes on a huge range of human passion and pain. Married and homosexuality responds. The film realizes that the viewer sees the tolerance of human beings as a way of saving humanity. A wonderful love story between Lachlin and Lil. I repeat their scenes repeatedly. Everyone who has been in love will be aware of the people. All the characters are brilliantly presented.
