A very curious and compelling film. The man who tries to sell as a collection of extracted revenue is very bad and wounded. The director was very disturbing when he was well served. Original and disturbing, at the same time, the pain that accompanies the whole life is very humorous. It really stood out in a rehearsal installation and laughed aloud, something that was not often done. One of the most memorable films I've seen for a long time. I do not think about it, and I look forward to future efforts with Bronstein. Wonderful shows around. Simple line "I really appreciate it". Now it's an icon for me.
