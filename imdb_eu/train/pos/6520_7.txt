The original DeMille was made in 1938 by Frederic Marche. A very good movie. With the love of Hollywood remakes, Yul Brynner brings us a very interesting movie. Certainly it was brilliant, it seemed almost always in every movie. Andrew Jackson was Charlton Heston's stroke of the genius. However, the film went on long. It does not move to the pace of the 1938 version. However, the movie must be seen at least once.
