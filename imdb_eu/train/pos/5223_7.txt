It seems like this movie likes a lot of people. First of all, it does not seem to have seen a lot first (I accidentally knocked it unexpectedly), and then, according to reviews and rating, they did not like much among those who liked it. <br /> <br /> Well, I did. In general, Gerek admits his appearance and charm and, although I have not been the best actor, I know he can do senseless things (I liked Jones). The performance is different. This is not nice, and it's not charming. His character seemed to be quite different from him --- old, ugly, broken, determined. And Gere, to me, so far, has yielded his best performance. I think that the actor shows how he works, if he does not imagine what he does, he thinks Hopkins Hannibal Lecter or Washington's Alonzo workout day. That's how good Gere was. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast were also good. I think I would not be doing it by the Dana, especially, that's why I think it looks good. He really does a great job, like what he holds with Ger, that's not bad. Strickland provides the best action he can easily support, because he needs a large part. I really think the main scene with Gere and Danes, and this is a great achievement. <br /> <br /> So what about the rest of the movie, as well as the great performance? The story, perhaps, is not surprising, to some 8mm aspects, but adding the story of veteran veterans "rookie" to nor-dunnit, and trying to add a sense of need (Silence of the Lambs). little girl and retirement of Gerer's character. This is the backdrop for the development of both protagonists, as they help each other in the new stations that live in each other. It must be reached within 100 minutes, but it is well done and we take care of the characters and what happens. <br /> <br /> Direction and photos were appropriate. I could do without the modern movement of the music video cameraman, but I am an old boy, and it's really not so bad that it helped me to shoot the movie. It may well have been invented, in general, it's not a happy one. <br /> <br /> What should I see?
