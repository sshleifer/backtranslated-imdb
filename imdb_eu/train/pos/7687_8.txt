As with Jeffersons, the British Good Times was one of the classic American sitcoms that never came up in the 1970s, although I was still born, without mentioning a decade ago. <br /> <br /> But like most of the fans of the show, I saw several episodes in You Tube ... and then I loved it. <br /> <br /> Evans's family are headed by James and Florida. Fill out, and despite the lack of qualifications, cheer up their children, in their life of desire to fulfill them and take their choices. James was a strict but loving father, who did not question the discipline of J.J, Michael and Thelma, to overcome the line. Florida, however, was an honest and kind mother and woman, though James was very similar to parents and family values ​​from an Afro-American perspective. <br /> <br /> Parents who were just as intense and entertaining as the kids: JJ was an aspiring artist with a nasty character and a nonsense mood, often wearing multi-colored costumes and this "DY-NO-MITE" phrase in Arnold Jackson's "Whatchoo speaking "with Willis? From Diff'rent Strokes Michael Strogoff was a lawyer's dream, while Thelma's sister had her dreams and hopes. The verbal words that were combined with JJ were mostly ridiculous, as well as the love / hatred between brother and sister, played by Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanisis very well. <br /> <br /> Over the years, it was one of the Kameo appearances, especially Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen and Gary Coleman. I'd rather like to say in Good Times today, because the Cosby Show was showing in the 80s a) I preferred the Evans family above Huxtables, either a) characterization, or b) because of serious and difficult social problems. they resonated with many audiences. It was a comedy, but it was also a social comment to highlight the lives of the African American women in the 1970s. Cosby Show tried to respond to the main audience as "covered in candy", as they overwhelmed the portraits of black people, who would like to join the whites in a high-level United States culture, while Good Times contrasted. 'Edgier' and he was not afraid of dealing with child abuse and drugs like realists. I really found that seeing Cosby Show at some moments could be very fun, because it was lacking in the "Good Relaxation" of the Good Times and how cool and cool it was. <br /> <br /> The show jumped In the last seasons shark, after the appearance of John Amos, a terrible James accident (that is to say, it was well-known at that time well-known John Good Times, because of the death of his character the show was written). Without John, the show suffered and weak, he lost many of his charms. <br /> <br /> Still, for a sitcom, Good Times marked all the boxes in the right place. If they had shown this in the UK in the 80's. Undoubtedly, as JJ says, "DY-NO-MITE !!" <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 and a half
