It was a good time movie. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and, above all, Christopher Lloyed cast in this wonderful real angel's Angels baseball team. You never know, it might happen. I loved Lloyd's role there. He was ridiculous The story is to turn your life, because the child has helped Angels. Glover has become an angry, hard-working and angry manager who sees the crowd better. The movie was well done and it was not only the best of the people, but also dreams. It was fun, charming, moving and sad, well done. Liked (or loved). I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> *** outside ****
