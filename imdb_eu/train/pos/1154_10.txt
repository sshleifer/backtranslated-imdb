I think that the movie I've ever seen is fun. Robert Harlingen script is close, check the "quotes" section; Think twice about it, rent a DVD, it's a delivery that really sells lines. <br /> <br /> Sally Field comics, as it has never been before. , and Kevin Kline is effortlessly horny. Robert Downey, Jr. They are superb, and in a very small role, Kathy Najimy is as disturbed as the suit. I have never had a great passion for Elisabeth Shue, but it's wonderful here as a "true" person who is surrounded by a cartoon character in "The Sun Sets Set". in his grave. Or that, or it's really hard to laugh. <br /> <br /> Five stars. Fun, funny, fun
