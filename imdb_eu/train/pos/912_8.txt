This movie includes a lot of memories of ancient classical cinema, where the actors did not have to remove their clothes so they could watch the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think the main point of this movie is that it is a great chemistry between Shahden and Amrita, definitely making a movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen a lot of comments because the movies are a bit sick and very bad. That is why, to a certain extent, I think it is a correct analysis. Given Barjatya's film, I think that the MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH have decreased much. HSSH was almost in a place that was unbearable in some places. <br /> <br /> In this movie, when moments of feeling occur, you will find yourself smiling, if you want to be the most brilliant couple, and they will do something bad. . <br /> <br /> Another important point is Shahid and Amrita shows. Both have acted very well, especially the excellent appearance of the Shahid film. Amrita is amazing and must be considered as an important star of the future. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is very pleasing, it seems too long. Some Central Americans could have been cut off and could have a greater impact. I also think music, even if they were watching the old ways in the movies and if the movie was more beneficial, even though the daily soundtrack was more available. Although the representation of Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Finally, I definitely recommend a romantic movie, its amazing look and a dramatic comedy. in details, if you have not seen it, please. <br /> <br /> PS. If you go crying, take a hundred!
