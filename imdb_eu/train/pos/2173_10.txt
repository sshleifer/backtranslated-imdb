Over the years, we look back and see the stars that are really stars. The French film critic, as he fled his name, said: "Garbo is not. Dietrich is not. Louise Brooks is alone." and there, thanks to God! Louise Brooks! It is Europe's third masterpiece. Following a script written by renowned artist Ren√© Clair, a script written by Georg Pabst is a great screenplay written by Georg Pabst, but he is not the first French speaker. Edith Piaf was known before! He works so much talent and in a movie, how could he not be a masterpiece? And this is the film. It's pity that Louise Brooks made Hollywood come back to the United States - he threw so much talent into the driveway so forcefully! In addition to the movie, with Louise Brooks, it's great to see Paris photos. 1930 and hear Piaf's voice. I'm never tired of this movie!
