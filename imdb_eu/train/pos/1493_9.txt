I thought Mukhsin wrote very well. Not only for entertainment. Yasmin seems to be trying to find a ton of fine messages. Yes, it might be confusing to you (especially if you did not see Sepet and / or Gubra 76 times). <br /> <br /> I did not even know when I used the two characters of the movies? It's really ironic how they connect the characters. He is a prostitute of Gubra, who is bigger than a neighbor. In the pocket of Bilbao, in the future, he is a religious and feminine wife of the honest man. <br /> <br /> And I love the voices. Her raw still is shocked. Like, when Rumah Tumpangan received a shot at the Gamin signal, when Mukhsin's voice came up saying "Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim .." (the tree climbing scene). <br /> <br /> He captured the attitude of Malaysian (and portrayed in a pathetic way, in a somewhat stingy way, for example, children may also have sharp tones (composed of voiceless voices) and only a bad voice with all feature films. You can talk about such works and ppl, when someone does not decide their life. <br /> <br /> I can all say that the movie has been completely waiting, unless it is over. <br /> <br /> Stuck in the screen He kept me, I could not take his eyes off. He did not even film. Ha ha.
