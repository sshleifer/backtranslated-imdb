In general, I would say I liked the movie. Some combat scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. A point that was really worried was that it was used to play a black Asian man. I really mean it. Talk about bad likes. During a fight scene, you see that you're laughing at a ground fighter. Otherwise, Sammo makes Bruce Lee's fight better. 5 out of 10 stars.
