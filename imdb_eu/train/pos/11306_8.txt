A happy state of society brings about the disaster: Giovanna has depleted the end of the marble, but still has a manga: beauty and youth. Bragana, a gasoline-fed fatty gasoline that runs for many years, outsells her bed and house together with her clumsy love. But Giovanna is now in contact with his own self-feelings and, as a result, he does not see a benefactor, but rather a torturer who needs to get rid of him. <br /> <br /> Gino's arrival. A young migrant worker eventually offers a great deal of opportunity. And you do not have to ask twice: the first encounter feels physically desirable and will seduce you a little later without any resistance. <br /> <br /> Development Partnership must follow rigorous rules by Giovannia. Gino's desire for freedom is suppressed, he hopes to leave his place with Giovanna, and his desire to move away from life far away. Giovanna is another goal: to kill Bragana, to obtain legacy and, moreover, to receive insurance premiums. He turned Gino into an instrument that he turned away from in the hands of Gino. Being completely pity of this woman turns into a cold killer. <br /> <br /> But before the face of Giovanna, the compromise questions the crime in moral level. Bragana's place, a place where sleeping in a dead sleeper, causes a deep condemnation of himself. And later, after finding out about paying for the insurance money, and the invented plan of Giovanna, he also runs physical separation with his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But the final sequences collide with the construction of ideas very carefully. In the end, Giovanna feels himself doing what he has done, and because of his keen revelation of his feelings, he sparkles Gino's new love. As a result of an absurd accident at that time, violent death is not only inevitable. It also causes us to realize that none of the actors are responsible for their disaster. The aggressor is just the state of the individual, from the beginning to the beginning as it is unalterable. <br /> <br /> <br />
