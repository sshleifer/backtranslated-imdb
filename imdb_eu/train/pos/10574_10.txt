Film is wonderful. A stop announcement takes on a variety of shows, which is totally appreciative. Busby Berkeley's music productions will never be doubled. I think that this film easily exceeds all its efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are incredible together. Some moods would almost certainly boost the limits of today's films. Put a rational explanation on how to make it apart and enjoy it because of the show.
