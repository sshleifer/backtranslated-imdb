Wow, since I've seen the movie since last years. Viewing in 2008 was not much different than in 1986. I think I would not go through the movie at first. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so repulsive, aspiring and respectful, it was difficult to see it. He collected negative stereotypes from American Americans. It was not bad enough, after showing the best employees of American small towns, the image is worse. According to the reverse spectrum, Japanese types of work were untrustworthy and sensitive. The movie was not fun, it was only hanging from its nostalgic value. And I'm glad that I keep the clock. <br /> <br /> As a boxer, judges allow you to finish the championship. This movie lasted from about three to seven, I finished it. The end was excellent. You always want a harmonious ending and that's just it. It was very good for the people to maintain their jobs and maintain the factory, but the most special were the Japanese customs and values ​​and the marriage between customs and values ​​in America. It was a basic short film.
