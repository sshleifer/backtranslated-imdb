I found myself sixes and sevens when I saw this. They were in front of the expanses and extras of Altman, and I expected these devices to comment on the characters and situations. Unfortunately, as far as I can see, sometimes they were free, sometimes spiritual, often sterile, and had no connection or ironic connection. Specifically, only two zoom-outs in the Savannah dome are mixed. In order to be reasonable, however, some outbursts of Branagh (outs and ins) increased the confusion of his character in La Pudgy McCabe or Philip Marlow. In general, the zooming was good, incoherent, and sometimes even triturated. <br /> <br /> Almanese other devices, such as camera and theme, included multi-glazed panels, sollipsism or narcissism or opaque characters.

Some drunken outlets, especially for commercial TV commercials, reminded me of the sardonic effect of CUTS CUTS in the short-term use. The impulse of the Grisham genre failed me. In this director, in the 70's, the masterpiece revised and revealed some classic genres; Among them, it was somehow similar; This time, the director did not believe that there was a significant blow to false analytical lies under this genre beast.

And except for Chicago, from Chicago in Georgia, Daryl Hannah from Chicago, there were probably many southern accords. viewers The immersion of the pre-hurricane barometer of the coast was wonderful, it was rendered attentively. I felt the user when I was starting to swell faster. <br /> <br /> In the end, I judged 7. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
