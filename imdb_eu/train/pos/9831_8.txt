With this we have a lot of hope. . . Because he is the official sequel to Zombi 3 Zombi 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci. . . However. . . Directed by Bruno Mattei (Zombies of Night) and Dardino Sachetti did not write, but played by Claudio Fagrasso (Zombies of the Night) and Phillimines in the Night of the Zombies and Night of the Zombies There's a lot of (Hell of the Zombies) Living Dead). As a result, Hell of the Living Dead is similar to the friend of Zombi 2. Fabriko DeAngelis gave Zombi 2 and Tomassi (?) And gossip from the producer Rossi, efx gianetto. . . Zombi 3 is not magical. . . Without peanut butter and jelly sandwiches like peanut butter. Over the years, I accepted Zombi 3. A soldier watched a bunch of arms and swore to the hotel room. . . Fulci was absurd and Mattei / Fulci cut DVD.
