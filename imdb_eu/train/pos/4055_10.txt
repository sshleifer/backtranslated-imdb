This movie is amazing and I would recommend for myself and adults. Animation is beautiful, characters are rich and interesting, and the story is brilliant; At that time, American studies produced better than anything else. However, this statement is a couple. Pena is buying Disney Studio Ghibli's catalog and then started killing her butcher. My main point, the Disney movie has doubled again, although the original English version is very impressive. The news from Van Der Beek was ruined and many of the characters' attractions were removed, for example. Paza and Sheeta went with adventurous youngsters. Original music score is much better than Disney's remix. Why did Disney change these changes? It seems Van Der Beek and others have to be thrown out, Disney may get more money, this is quite reasonable, but they shot it in the process. The movie is still beautiful and I still would recommend it to anyone. My main cow was that Disney shot me in childhood, I loved it and I still love it. I'm lucky to have an original Japanese import of the original English dub, now I will protect my life!
