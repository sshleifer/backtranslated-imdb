In Royersford, Pa, I grew up. Jerry's market was the town. I remember watching my whole family shoot. I remember "Blob" in a bucket that shows me and my brothers in a bucket. Also, I would like to share my mother's movie. Her hair style was identical to Aneta Corsaut and she was sick for one night and my mom watched and sat down in the car with Steve McQueen for some background shots. He paid $ 25.00 and told him a story until he died last August. My mother did not have a teenager and she had a few months off from the birth of my little sister.
