First of all, I loved Bruce Broughton's music score, very lyrical, and that was only added to the charm of the movie. The best part of the film were three animals: Michael J. Fox, Sally Field and Don Ameche. Fox has the most entertaining lines, Amele plays only one other character (the reason's voice), and Field always allows him to tell Chance in a character. Humans were not very enthusiastic, and sometimes movies were dragged, but that's my only complaint. This is a great movie with beautiful shots in Canada, I think. Although the film is a long one, it's never a terrifying moment, and the voice and script is an advantage. In the end, a charming and perhaps the best movie, with me 9/10. Bethany Cox.
