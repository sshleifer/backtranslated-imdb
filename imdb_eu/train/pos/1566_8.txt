Simon Templar ("Saint") was brought up in a series of series of Leslie Charteris' novels in the late 1930's, George Sanders, as a temple, in the coming days. It was a good choice - Sanders would usually play "delightful role-playing" roles ("FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE, UNCLE HARRY'S REVOLUTION hero", best friend of Robert Montgomery, RAGE IN HEAVEN's "best friend") . Here, his willingness to curb his rule and to break the law, his "hefty character" briefly adjusts his good looks and gentle behavior, while the Templar moved Chester Morris "Boston Blackie" and (partly) Peter Lorre's stunning heroes " Mr. Moto. " <br /> <br /> Movies are not the best series of the mysterious films series - but they are useful. As with series Holmes in Rathbone or in Holland's Chan series, shows often played on roles or played on others (the movie antine heroine Wendy Barrie, which appeared in a series in a second movie). This, and the well-known film sets make the series a comfortable experience for the audience, who listens to the conversation box (always keeping Sanders's head forward), without noticing the obvious bugs on the plot. All these mysteries are mistakes, since the best writers of the genre can not be repeated once again once again. <br /> <br /> The moment happened here in Cast. He confessed the love of Barrie. Soon he tries to protect the police. But the film that explored the identity of the dominant movie was clearly revealed as he deserved to be a mysterious mysterious man (that is, the script was concealed as the least suspect). <br /> <br /> Barrie is a proof after his father (who died in prison) after stealing the real criminals gang. He gives his support to several people - mugs like William Gargan - and he gets advice from the mentally handicapped looting planners. D.A. His convicted father (Jerome Cowan) has decided to get Barrie and his gang. The only solution to solve the case is the only detective Jonathan Hale, which Sanders reflects, but works with him involuntarily. <br /> <br /> Cast has a nice moment written - Hale (now a special diet) Sandys wants to eat Sanders' lobster made by Willie Best. As a result, Sanders and Barrie get a stomach problem to avoid escaping the Sanders apartment. The other one should remember Sanders to go for a moment to go (when it feels better). <br /> <br /> Gilbert Emery's role is also interesting. He usually plays decent people (like a husband who faces TWO WORLDS's wife) plays a socially obvious weakness here. The disappearance of this is evoked by a character from Bogart. <br /> <br /> Full film shot in the second half of the second half of the year 1939. It will also entertain you if you do not stay in your memory.
