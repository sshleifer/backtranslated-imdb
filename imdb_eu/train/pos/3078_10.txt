I loved this exhibition ... intelligent action, intelligent conversation, excellent line with real people ... bring them back or get it online ... really lost ... Hope Davis really fascinates this show. I like the idea of ​​SEXU PRAYERS ... It's really sensible in this insane world. Release stupid reality for these shows and give this a second chance. Please bring it. When I got out of the air, I saw it online and I liked how I could see it with the least breaks, which is why online ABC allows you to enjoy easy shows, if you do not lose time ... it's a never-ending recording. . Every time you want to bring it back, I'm ready.
