I saw the trailer for this movie in the 70's, while I was almost 16 in the movie. Oh !!!! How much excitement I had with my best friend. We could not wait until the month. That same year I watched the movie 17 times in the theater. I love, love, I love it. Kris is a very good movie. It's a bit annoying and enjoyable, but it's also shameless and uncertain with Babs, and it's so nice to watch again. When the studio is singing perennial leaves, and when he hears his voice, his voice differs slightly, but in his opinion it is different from the notes that are perfect, but I always thought it was one of the best scenes in the movie. He looks at it and is proud. I could watch the movie every day. We tried to dress as a dress, even if it was a sweater and a long cap like a dress. This was for a moment on television and I saw the daughters that were young and loved. Perhaps, when they caught me, I did not know the extreme. In the end today I am still tired.
