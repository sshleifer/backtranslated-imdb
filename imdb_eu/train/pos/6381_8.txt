"Atlantis" is a new and direct step towards a Disney function. It's a good idea to make a mysterious mystery like "Atlantis". I did not have any hope for this movie, but after seeing it, I do not understand why this film was so bad. Not even reviewers in my country were positive. <br /> <br /> "Atlantis" is not the perfect movie, but it's the biggest Disney, though I'm not sure that this movie will get a "classic Disney" reputation. Well, it's another case. It's funny that this science-fiction movie was directed by the director himself "Beauty and the Beast" and "Hunchback" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to escape their monster movies, he's just a joke). <br /> <br /> Well, enough nonsense. The movie "Atlantis" is on display, it's been very enjoyable. Although this movie is a PGP-rated action function, it's also a good thing for kids (I think parents who do not want to kill me when writing it). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The comic-inspired animation of books is a must-have for the movie and is the starting point for the usual Disney style. Colorful, dark and detailed. Deep Canvas sequences are quite spectacular. Sometimes the movie is fun, I make more laugh than making a movie laugh. (SPOILERS) The characters in this movie are also very enjoyable, but unfortunately there is not enough screen time to meet everyone, so some characters are left behind (SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> James is a great Newton Howard score. It's brave and exotic. (SPOILER) This film is more noticeable when the Atlantic language is becoming very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's really wonderful (SPOILERS OVER) <br /> <br /> The script is very tight and written, but there are still some questions that are unanswered in the story. But, fortunately, there are not many of them. <br /> <br /> So you have to leave yourself, do not listen to the reviewers and watch "Atlantis" because it is waiting for you ...
