In Brazil, in 1594, the Tupinambas Indians are French friends and their enemies are Tupiniquins, Portuguese friends. A Frenchman (Arduíno Colassanti) has been captured by Tupinambas, and although he thinks he is French, he thinks it is Portuguese. French becomes his slave, and his daughters live with Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalhães). Later, he used powders to leave behind the Tupinians in a fight to defeat them. To celebrate the victory, the Indians decide to eat it. <br /> <br /> "Como Era Gostoso o Mi Francos", Nelfson Pereira dos Santos is a small budget Brazilian supermaster. The script is very original and the story is spoken in Tupin. The film shoots a natural light for most of the time and is very realistic. Actresses and actors are naked and Ana Maria Magalhães is a great figure, showing a wonderful body and a wonderful performance. The sound is Zé Rodrix, a Brazilian musician. This film shows the beginning of the exploitation of my country in Europe, focusing on portuges and French at that time, our natural resources for trade with the Indians and combs and mirrors. He has been featured at national film festivals, such as Brazil's Brazilian Film Festival 1971 (Brazil's Brazilian Film Festival) with Best Screenplay (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), Best Interview (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Humberto Mauro) and Best Cynograph. (Régis Monteiro); Association of São Paulo Art Critics Association (Paulista dos Críticos Associação), with the best Annual Revelation (Ana Maria Magalhães) and other awards.
