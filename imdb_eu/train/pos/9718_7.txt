SPOILER POSSIBILA - Somehow "How to Alienate Friends ...." "It starts to learn to fit the loser, it turns out to be a success and finds something else that matters more" in a story celebrated by business celebrities. - END OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not know the original book, but this comedy gives good moments. Even though the end seems to be a mistake. She felt fast and abusive, just like something was missing. Also, I can say that the movie is not high level. In addition, you will find a sweet selection of actors and actors, sometimes with controversial interpretative abilities. I have never seen Pegg until now. It's still a very special type, although it may seem boring on the screen. Fox proved that he was able to play a hot star on the head in the clouds. I do not know if it was a difficult thing, but its performance was hot and better than "Transformers" (okay ... it's probably not that difficult). Kirsten Dunst is a Kirsten Dunst (again) and I'd like it (as I do) or it seems annoying to me. On the other hand, Anderson has proved his acting capabilities and Jeff Bridges will see (well, but maybe even stronger). Everyone adapts their character accordingly. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think that a pleasant celebrity comedy is a bit of a few episodes, and some are fun, sweet, but suddenly ending.
