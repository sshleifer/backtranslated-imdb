This film was released 12 years ago and it was a revelation for people who knew something about the New York-dragged scene. Dragging textbooks are nothing to say. Anthony Slide's 'Great Pretenders' says nothing. Julian Fleisher's "Drag Drag The New York Dragons: The Illustrated Field Guide," draws on influential diagrams, Julian Eltinge, Minette, Warhol's queens, and the 90s, and films, completely rejects the house. Even though Laurence Senelick's "The Changing Room" - the closest thing to the definitive book on the drag goes out of the film and does not provide information about her. <br /> <br /> <br /> I understand that the same movies and web pages I have found that this system of houses is operating for decades. The performance of a member of a house prior to 1990 appears in "The Queen" (1968), Chrystal La Beija. The historical context is Paris's Burning. <br /> <br /> The film is valuable, because it does not focus on a scene considered. Life photo is valuable in 1989. When Venus Xtravaganza was filmed, it is very dramatic, but this is not the only film of the transgender killed in real life. As we know it now, Dorian Corey had a literal stroke of deadly embodiment, but that's not three years later. <br /> <br /> We need historical books but also a book or someone else. Documentary that offers more context.
