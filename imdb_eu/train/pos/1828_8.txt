Robert Louis Stevensonen St. Based on the film Ives, a French story by a young Hussar Captain (Jean Marc Barr) is told during Napoleon's war. Trapped in the battle, the main Farchar (Richard E Grant) is sent to a prisoner of war in the Highland Highlands prisoner. In a short time he falls in love with a local girl (Anna Friel); and discovers that his grandmother, when he fled France during the revolution, lives on the road! Huge spectacles of all pieces and memorable lines offer above average.
