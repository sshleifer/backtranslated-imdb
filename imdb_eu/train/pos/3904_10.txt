In my opinion, it is the best stand I have ever seen. Eddie became an instant fan when I saw Dress to Kill, but I think that's his best job. I would say, though, if you can see it permanently live. It's worth it! <br /> <br /> Most often after watching the stand-up routine a couple of times, most are aging. But I must say, I have seen this show so much that I have literally taught the things that I have (so I realize that I am sad), but I still joke laugh. This is really a good show. <br /> <br /> Dying to dress will never get old for me. I am the owner and I see each time I laugh.
