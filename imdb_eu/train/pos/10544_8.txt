Well, "Cube" (1997), Vincenz's first film, was one of the most interesting and interesting ideas I saw when I talked about films. They had only one landscape, a bunch of actors and a plot. Therefore, the peculiar condition of treating such an effective way, excellent conversations and character rats as a maze is so special. His second movie, "Cypher" (2002), was his story, but it was not as good as "Cube", but here are the characters that have been tested as mice again. <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is something very interesting and Vincente returns to his "Cuban days", again blocks the characters in a very different place, playing with characters again playing with rats in a room like experience. Instead of a science-fiction thriller (although some of the unexpected promotions seemed like this), the "Nothing" is a modern and intolerant satire about the whole world of our society. we live Vicenzo once again impresses with a wonderful idea in such a small thing. A scene with 2 actors and a white one, that's the biggest part of the time and you do not need it anymore. "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience and "Cypher" is confusing, "Nothing" is quite the opposite, but at the same time desperate. <br /> <br /> This film once again proves that it means much more than just a smart idea. It's just a budget quote. Sometimes the movie fails, of course, but its main idea is that it corrects any errors. There's nothing more to say about this movie, because the "experience in the surprise" and the "Cube" movies are completely different.
