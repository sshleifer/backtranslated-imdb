It's a lot in the College Girl Murders. A mad scientist creates a virtually noxious gas. Before getting the benefits of his discovery, the scientist is to kill a monk of butterflies soldiers. After killing a church in a church in Vitoria, it is called to investigate Scotland Yard, but it continues to die. Who can stop the crazy murderer who can go to college and outdoors? <br /> <br /> What works: <br /> - The assassin. What he did not like, a KKK with a red-hot murderer, with red gloves. The white backs that you wear and use are very effective against the shiny red dress. The girl in a school that looks out over a red school, though the murderer's ideas are quite scarce, is one of the most worn outfits I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> - Music in the 60s. I would really like to download title music in The College Girl Murders. I love jazz, hip, in the 60s I love it. <br /> <br /> - Bizarre Touches. Beyond the murderer's red dress and hood, the film has a slippery fireplace, neighboring jungle, cage delivered, a poisonous sprayer, a strategic dummy, mini skirt, boots and a high mileage. I would describe it as a cross between a 60-minute Batman series and an Italian giallo. College Girl Murders is very pleasing to the eye. <br /> <br /> - End. Let's say there are more bends than a mountain path. When you reveal the murderer, there will be a tour ... and another ... and another and another. <br /> <br /> What's not working: <br /> <br> /> Sir John's main inspector. I know the guy was like a comedian, but his bumpy character has too much time on the screen. <br /> <br /> - Why are you hacking? Previously, I mentioned the words in my words. And despite their pleasant touch, they serve very little purpose. Why use the problem and do not use it? <br /> <br /> - Plodding Plot. Some of The College Girl Murders do not rhythm or flow. There are too many hours during the film when things are incomprehensible. Better adaptation would make this film much more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I do not see many of these German crimes, but I've seen a few (Soho ghost, Blackmoor Castle storm, Eyes dead) London. This may be my favorite. I feel that this is really funky. If they had made a lot of land better, College Girl Murders would easily give it to 7/10.
