I love it and it was so broken that there is another season !!! I want! the best show ever !!!!!! It's probably not possible to decide to cancel the show! I want them! So I would be so excited! I really want to! I missed it! and it was particularly broken to find out what happened to Jason! I think they should do something else ... I also think that this idiot should write ten lines to post a comment ... drag your comment ... and no one read! I want to know what will happen between Jason and Nicole ... maybe they can spin it out!
