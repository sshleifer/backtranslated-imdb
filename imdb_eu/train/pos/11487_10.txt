As always, such controversial films have mixed opinions. You love or hate it, and no one likes the movie. This shows the assassin's view, that is, I personally feel something important to consider. You can hate them, if you feel like them and feel like relationships, but think about this school's thinking about this movie from a different perspective. <br /> <br /> The movie is completely shot by the camera, because I think it works quite well as something realistic. From the point of view of the murderers, the "missions" from the family exit, with the "Zero Day" day, are being slaughtered at their school. Zero Day offers no response, but offers a look at the life of two troubled young boys and allows them to decide on the audience. The feelings for the boys are blended between sympathy and hatred, but we are still confused by the reason why the two younger boys were doing it. They're surprisingly normal. The kids are ordinary people who have ordinary life, and what they planned did not expect we would not expect (no one knows their movie. Plan) <br /> <br /> The operation is very good for both unknown actors. In the future we will have the opportunity to see more work. Although this film is fictional, Columbine's remarkable resemblance can not be helped. Calvin and Andre are similar to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold (not so much in appearance, but in a way). As Columbine has investigated a lot of research, I've seen similarities and almost certainly rely on it. <br /> <br /> The real massacre is a real massacre, one of the most important things I've ever seen, through the school surveillance camera. When I saw it, I was completely disturbed, and there is a feeling that is a little bit around. It is very realistic and well done, and it is very difficult to see. <br /> <br /> Everything Zero day is a great movie, and I think everyone should check at least. In the past, we have always just marked the killers as "psychopaths," and we thought that the disaster was biologically wired or had an impact on the media, but Zero Egun sometimes shows that it is deeper and we can never understand why there are tragedies. When the school shooter takes place from the point of view of murderers.
