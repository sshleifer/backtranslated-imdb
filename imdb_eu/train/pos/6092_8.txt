Classical classics is almost impossible to predict. Who can guess Vision Quest, Fight Club and 2001: Space Oddysey, the critics and audiences who made the films very popular? Like many IMDB, I think a film expert. Unlike the majority of those who hated Invidia (showing a limited amount of 4.4 points), it seemed to me that Invidia was one of the funniest movies in the last decade. <br /> <br /> The movie argument is ridiculous. The interview is not clear, the scene has little continuity, and it appears that writing has been written by a fourth student. But that's why it's so funny a movie. You will see, to see the unexpected genius of Invidi, you have to enjoy the movie, from the ironically attached point of view. <br /> <br /> Why do I love Invidia? Because the movie is wrong, it becomes good. This is a recipe for a classic worship, and Envy bill adapts.
