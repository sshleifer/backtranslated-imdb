It's very interesting that Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy's sister and cousin of these women, turned Maysle into "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" movies. In the family wardrobe could be "skeletons". Additional DVD features include some contemporary fashion designers giving their ideas to curious women. Anyone interested in fashion would find such a brilliant talk of these designers. (that is, "are nuts or something missing?"). This movie is difficult. Netflix does not. However, there are parties.
