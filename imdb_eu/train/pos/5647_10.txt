I do not confirm everyone who has already bored everything, but it is never one of the best. It was a great pity when I canceled it and I hope that someone will be upset and will have to start the series again. The good news is OUT ON DVD! I jumped down to the store and got a copy and I'm glad to say it's as good as I remember. Gary Cole is a wonderful and dark character, and all the actors were very good. The pity is that the network does not continue. Shaun Cassidy, masterpiece. People who enjoy gender and those who have not seen it should do so. You are not disappointed. When I was watching TV, my daughter was very young (20 years old), she is very interested, and she will soon be a fan. He finds "very twisted" and has seen the incidents. I can not wait to see the episodes that remained. <br /> <br /> This shows the rocks !!!!
