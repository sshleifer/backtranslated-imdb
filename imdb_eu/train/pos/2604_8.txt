"Amazing Grace" has a calm feeling, because it tells the story of a life story in an apartment. Language is verbal in Hebrew, but the drama can be done in any modern city. It meets family values, romantic relationships and age group characteristics. He does not judge the characters, he directly presents them directly, when they want to practice their own problems in this modern world. The quality of the performance is very good, and the observations made in the characters are heavy and sharp. I'm very pleased with this generous movie.
