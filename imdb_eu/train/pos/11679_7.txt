Clara Bow's beauty and fantastic appeal is the main reason to see this movie. "Hula" is not the best Clara film, but it's still nice. he walks, walks his horse, and seeks his love. This film lasts for about an hour and is directed by Fleming winner Oscar (along with the wind). The movie moves quickly and there is a lot of time on the clear bow screen. If you like Clara, I'd recommend it "hula".
