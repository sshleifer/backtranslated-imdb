I enjoy all the versions of this story, but this is my favorite time. George C.Scott gives depth to what Scrooge's nature does not give to others. The movie shows how bitter this movie becomes. The scrooge changes gradually appear when different ghosts and events they show themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best Little Timer. Age is adequate, rather than someone who plays as a teenager. Anthony Walters still has most of her children's teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is wonderful in Bob Cratchit mode. It's a versatile actor. He portrays a man who loves a family. He plays the role with dignity, like a man who is gored under Scrooges'tumb, but he is a man who is brilliantly pleased, because he supplies the family. Susannah York and the other actors make a great job of bringing character life. Edward Woodward is the best Christmas Fantasy Slide Show ever. In most cases, Santa is a wonderful character. This annoys Scrooge's attitudes and Scrooge reverses it. <br /> <br /> Wardrobe and sets can live with Dickens in London all the time. Wonderful movie
