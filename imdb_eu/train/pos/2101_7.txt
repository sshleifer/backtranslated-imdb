Forget Neo and Bourne and all the half-baked were made up of modern heroes. They look like a 12-year-old girl who just wants to be her hero who wants to be a fan of geeks. Because Rambo or McClane can not be, as well as Indiana Jones, Hollywood has accepted a bunch of non-bearded scams that have been adopted by boys and girls who still want to see something like a teenager. Watching "action groups" is painful and any girl can question her masculinity. This explains the appearance of oldies over the past few years on our silver screens. Better (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClane was the key to you ... he did not have a beard!) <br /> <br /> I said I had a new hero for a long time and they finished their reign . This movie, "Largo Winch", is far from present and maybe predictable at times, but at least Tomer Sisley is a very promising future as an action hero. And the only time that was weakened was when MÃ©lanie Thierry shaved her shave! I rested my case. <br /> <br /> I did not know when I got into the theater room, but maybe a decade might be a movie I'm waiting for. From Belmondo to France, for the first time, the film can be well-rooted and buzzed in the genre of B without overcoming its performance. In the meantime, everything we ought to discard or was a huge pile, or something that was limited to reaching a broader audience ... In other words, "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Dobermann" (I like Dobermann, I'm mindful of you). ) ... I think that "Largo Winch" requires a well-known and quality film production. <br /> <br /> In the theater room I was very happy and I was hungry.
