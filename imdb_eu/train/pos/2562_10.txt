This is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Yes, I agree that some parts seem dated, but that does not stop the movie. It's time to try to see, criticize and enjoy the perspective of the past. Clearly, the rules in "Sex in the City", Charlie Chaplin was terribly boring. However, when judging by the future of America in 1925, it was wonderful. Also, Sayonara is a new film in the racial mix, the American "apparent destiny" arrogance and prejudices and the complexity of different cultures. It's the next natural step for the movie like Gentleman's Agreement. However, his goal was not just social commentary, but rather entertaining and enjoyable, it should not be forgotten that he has many lines. It's wonderful. While some are attacking Brando's accent, it's best to get nuances and characterization. Buttons and Umeki (Oscars were won) and the rest of the rest of the group adds much to the movie. <br /> <br /> Taka, a true star, makes an excellent job to feel the passion of Brando. while breaking the sense of duty and loyalty. When talking to and talking to Brando, his talk is classical and it's hardly ever something like cinema. The conversation between Tokio and Brando, the Tokyo camera, at the end of the film, is very good. Of course, it does not have an absorbent mouth, unchanged and worse, which shows love in today's movies, but that makes it much better. It shows true love and passion, not just "hot". If you do not touch this movie, you're too old, cynical or dead.
