It's the most beautiful film. Colorful photography is beautiful, because it shows the bright colors of the Metropolitan Opera House. Other scenes in different homes are also excellent. Regarding music, what else can be said of Lanza's voice as it was in his time, he sang many well-known theater plays in the world. Dorothy Kirsten is also delighted to blend her soprano with her voice with a beautiful harmony with Lanza. Hollywood, of course, took up customary freedoms with the story of Caruso's life. There is little story about current events. For example, events about his death are completely manufactured and have no relationship with truth. The websites that tell Caruso's true story are very good and they also have some pictures. These websites may be based on good search engines. There are also many books on the history of his life. But the fictional story line does not mark this beautiful film. Lanza, Kirsten and the choir's voices are the real protagonists of this movie. Enjoy, I know I'm sure.
