Interesting, fast and fun. <br /> <br /> I'm not the people who watch television and charge. One day I was sick with a bad case of illness in the face of this show, and immediately he binded me. I made a great condemnation of John Burke. Both Claire and her were a great job of organizing the show. We can really say that they love two jobs. <br /> <br /> Super-harvesting segments were great. I was interested in things I had never thought before. <br /> <br /> I'd really like to know: What happened to Jack's dog? Was it one of the hosts?
