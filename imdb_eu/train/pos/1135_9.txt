For the first time I saw when I got out of the movie theater, and the movie really got into a movie that really made people more. This is a great set of characters, many names, some of which were not now recognized as they were. I think it's a very good idea if you follow one of these actors or if you love other movies, you'll add them to your list. Some scenes remind me of well-done comedy, such as The Birdcage or even The Clue, a spontaneous comedy strange, with the full professional work of these beloved actors. The film made a great effort to enter the culture of a day soap, perhaps even realistic.
