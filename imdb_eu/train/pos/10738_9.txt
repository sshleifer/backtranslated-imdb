SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and very good document about WTC2 attacks. NYFD filmmakers in New York, who are currently in New York, have to deal with this event and get the most out of it. / 11 is not much, because the movie is more like a scenario. On the day of the attacks is like a sad day of work, but it will soon change. The roadmaps that filmmakers take on the road that shoot the first firefighters on the road, this is the first footage that impacts on them. He walks firefighter into the WTC building and enters the building. When the second plane crashes, people understand that there is no accident. The next time we see firefighters to save as many people as possible. Meanwhile, the sounds we hear blows, we hear the sound of people falling down the tower and falling to the ground. This is the momentary documentary moment. Then the tower falls and our French friend needs to run into his life. Listen to him mad while he is mad while he leaves the building. Then there is a huge storm of sand that turns black on it, survives and can now shoot empty streets of the Downtown New York. Because this documentary has had so much historical footage and this documentary that has become quite different from the film, this is probably the most memorable. The attack was in the evening I lived home, so it made it even more realistic. see 10/10
