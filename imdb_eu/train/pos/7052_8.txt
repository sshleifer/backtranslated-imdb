Joshua Seftel's first film - a satire of memorable proportions - is what the title suggests: Corporations in War. <br /> <br /> The movie is a mercenary that travels to Turaqistan (John Cusack). country, fyi) to help the United States government "send message" to Turaqist leaders. He knows the storyteller (Marisa Tomei) and we all know what a lonely man will do with a warm reporter. Everywhere in the mix, a pop star named Yonica Babyyeah is cast. As one of the most important people in Yonica Turaquista (the son of the president) marries, the mercenary is born in a place where he oversees that star. The film begins at a Cusack lone bar; fifteen seconds later, the movie connects you. With funny and interesting knowledge about terrorism and politics, the movie is awakened for you. The film was much more than I expected, from time to time with a war scene, with choreographed fights and some slaughter scenes. Although the story is not very deep, its simplicity is a perfect film for the classic man and movie critics. <br /> <br /> In the last act of the film, it becomes its simplicity. very hostile and confused. I thought it was very well run, but others did not know and why I understood it. The twist after twist is the end of what it is like, and like most movies, it's a real hit / miss situation. In any case, the three writers of the film (Mark Leyner, Jeremy Pikser and John Cusack) made a wonderful job creating a realistic and entertaining satire today. <br /> <br /> Joshua Seftel makes a great job under the care of the film. to support the whole; reducing material to restrictive films (I would have feared it would have happened to me). Seftel's work was perfectly shot: he created a rich atmosphere, both analyzing fake realities and fake cartoons; - Firstly, compare and watch the movie as a whole. Seftel takes part in all the actions and pays for it. I missed here. Fortunately, he takes more managerial work, being the director.
