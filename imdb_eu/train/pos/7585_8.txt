It is a curious, brain, surrealistic and esoteric film. If there is something like "horror intellectual" movie, this is the movie. I was afraid and began to see someone else with me and just have a plot! I have to see it again before understanding this movie several times. If you are a person who likes "My dinner with Andre" and Godard's films, or if you worry about medication, you will probably enjoy this movie. Wow
