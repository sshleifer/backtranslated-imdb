My Take: THE LION KING's fun challenge as a sequel. It's amazing. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the "Lion King 1 1/2" video is a fun live video that deserves theater treatment. I do not know why Disney has released the video directly, and releases theatrical movies "Chicken Little" and "Return to Neverland". These films are better viewed on video stores ("newer versions") than seen on the outside of theatrical posters. <br /> <br /> This is a simple mistake in the first film (although events in "Simba's Pride" have not yet happened), Timon's voice (Nathan Lane's voices) and Pumbaa's (Ernie Sabella's) voices). The first episodes of the movie will be fun. The original voices of the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to the roles of the first film shoot; Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give Timon's mother and uncle grumpy a hilarious relief of comedy. /> <br /> So it's not a funny sound. Maybe not now, but see yourself. It's not so serious in his plot. It's like MST3000 with Timon and Pumba. <br /> <br /> Video movie rating: *** 1/2 outside.
