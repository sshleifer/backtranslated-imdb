In central Manhattan, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant), with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two teenage daughters living with four bedrooms and a rented apartment with a bathroom. Jim works in an advertising agency of $ 15,000.00 per year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment for lack of space. When selling an ad for a great home for sale in Connecticut, at a low price, he drives it with his wife and real estate agent and decides without giving technical advice to buy the old house. Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) sends an acquaintance engineer to his house and lawyer to inspect the house and says the man sets the house down and builds another. Jim verifies the information of other engineers and everyone condemns the place and finds sooner rather than buying a "hole in money" instead of the dream house. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings builds his house" with a very funny comedy, curious lines and exquisite script. Cary Grant is ridiculous as the horny role of a man who manages to have an affair with an angry dream, while touching his job and feeling jealous of his friend. In 1986, Tom Hanks made a very entertaining movie inspired by this beautiful classic "The Money Pit". My vote is zortziko <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Lar, Me Tormento" ("House, My torment")
