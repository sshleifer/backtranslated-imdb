Until now, one of my favorite films is the adventure of the wild side of a group of four of Atlántida. The idea of ​​living the Chulawasse River before returning to the lake is the one of Lewis's Burt Reynold, who throws his palate into his worst burner. But if the first semester of the film appears as an action movie, in the second the second part takes the viewer into another story; Our men must make a decision (they know) they will change their lives forever. In very bad way. At the end of the film, every person should face the dirt on the river during the weekend, but the fight for survival will be silent. The movie (with some obvious goofas) is very directed and is shot in a paradise of nature that robs breathing. The photography is excellent too. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are very exquisite with the same mistake that a single event can destroy four different lives.
