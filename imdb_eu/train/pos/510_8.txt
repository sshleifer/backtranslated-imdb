I saw it for a long time for the first time; I forgot how imaginative they were and what a productive film. However, I do not forget the opening scenes of the Waterloo Bridge Candlelight Club, amongst the most romantic movies ever shot. <br /> <br /> People interested in politics or history love the references of the film - those who are interested in love will make the movement of Hunter-Niven, and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the representation of the world. <br /> <br /> What's the favorite movie of my time? this is excellent. <br /> <br />
