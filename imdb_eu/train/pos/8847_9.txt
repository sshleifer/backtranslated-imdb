If I see a movie and I do not see once more how long my watch or clock will last, or I hope that the last scene is not finished, it should be pretty good. I'm not a filmmaker insulator or a movie theologian. I see the movie and are interested until the end, it's quite good because some of the most renowned movie critics are dead (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Atonement, Crash, interested in this movie and absorbed me. It started at the end: play is excellent, story very It's original, because the retreat is very emotional. Kane of the public has appeared a bit when Hoffman throws his apartment into the trash, I'm sorry for leaving Tome, more than a tribute to Orson.
