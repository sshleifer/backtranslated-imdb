If you are an enthusiast of great Altman fans, you will be amazed by HealtH, such as M.A.S.H., Nashville, Gosford Park, and the most unfamiliar films like A Wedding. Focused on a Healthcare Convention, two women are working on the presidency, HealtH has a large number of 70-year-old Altman Paul Dooley (who has contributed to writing films), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson. In addition, it also includes the most important Lauren Bacall stars. James Garner and Glenda Jackson. Like many films in the Altman group, there are many films, but it's not as richly focused on films like Nashville or A Wedding, but rather M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. The whole thing is a satirical movement on the health movement that complies with the highest, extravagant and contradictory characters, such as guest stars like Dick Cavett, who generally suggest a remarkable comment on all things. By emphasizing the entire electoral process, Altman highlights the pessimism about politics and public interest attractiveness, but this film is more attractive to most people if they enjoy it. This is one of the latest films in Altman, a little!
