It's been the best movie I ever found. Not only was Ben Coccio (director) shooting his best film of this kind (school shooting) excellent. He filmed a teenage actress who still attends high school. He filmed in the cast of the cast and real parents used actors in their parents movie. Similarly, the actors also filmed their camera cameras that looked more like a video logger. It's almost artful (indeed, if it's a word) There are some tracking, such as Cal called brads (?) Land rover bundles for a rover (or vice versa, since I've seen some time ago)
