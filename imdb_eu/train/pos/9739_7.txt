I was happy to see this movie, with Simon Pegg, especially for the comedy movie season. <br /> <br /> Big shot NYC media mogul hired Jeff Bridges as one of his most famous outfits. <br /> <br /> After paying the fees, the hackdom (the seventh room) that writes the celebrity enters into high-level writings, it's a little talk ... The story is very funny and Gillian Anderson puts it as a huge piece of advertising Agent. <br /> <br /> The way to success finds the true meaning of love. <br /> </ div> </ div> <div align = "justify"> Inverted formula drawing, the movie was very funny, especially Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges and Gillian Anderson Kirsten Dunst It was good for the interest of love. The rest of the cast has done its job well. <br /> <br /> It was a good comedy and it was worth watching at theaters.
