Cat Soup seems to be a very random animated film at the beginning. The best way to explain is that it is quite acidic. Although it is not entirely random. The story is about Nyatta, the cat boy boy and his sister, Nyaa. Nyaako is very ill and dies, however, that Nyata can recover his soul from death and he can recover half. The story is about the search for Nyaaka's life as a whole. <br /> <br /> The content of this movie seems to be quite random, but it's not. Most are life symbolism, death and resurrection. You can also see references to other stories like Hansel and Gretal. A strange and beautiful short film, it has an interesting story full of interesting stories that is seen on the screen cover.
