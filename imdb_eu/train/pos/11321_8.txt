When I started watching the show, I said, "Oh, no! Elfen Lied is just as crispy and not bloody!" And, in fact, the configuration is almost identical, only one young boy lives in a large house, and suddenly he will enter into a wonderful adventure while he lives with sexy young girls. <br /> <br /> But that's just how similar it stays. This love story is as subtle and intense as the Inuyasha, with little observations and behaviors of children. The magical configuration is a bit crisp, because there are about seven people, seven civil servants, fighting for the Holy Grail, having all the servants a celebrity, half of all masters of the same school, rules of commitment, etc. drawing and fading and fading from the beauty of the script. <br /> <br /> I really saw all 24 episodes in one day, and I liked the more I encouraged with the animations, but compared with other genres. I was very happy to say
