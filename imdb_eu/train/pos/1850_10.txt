This is my favorite EVER movie. I have seen at least 10 times and I cry every time. My family asked me not to see it, I did not cry. I think that the true story written by Antwone himself loves the movie as I love it. The performance is high and the actors have been essential for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is the favorite movie that I have done so far. I was also responsible for the baby born in the prison. I was the smallest boy I ever met. He has taken a wonderful family who has struggled for almost two years. I watched this movie while I was struggling and I was sure of the future and I am very happy and confident. And I'm very happy, Antwone is happy and has found her family. <br /> <br /> I would love to know more about it and have found his family. I just said good things!
