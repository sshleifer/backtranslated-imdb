I am surprised that no-one thinks of such a movie. Fear is the most effective when it uses unpleasant real life. And no one (except in The Little Shop of Horrors Store) seeks a dentist. Tooth torture has been done before (see Marathon Man for example), but this brings fear to the neighborhoods. <br /> <br /> Land by Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) goes around a dentist. insanity Now, our dear doctor did not play with all the decks at the beginning, but when he was jealous and obsessive-compulsive imbalance he began to ruin his surroundings. The doctor has a great relationship with the abusive mental condition down below with the character of Micheal Douglas, but with a horror edge. <br /> <br /> Writing and direction of horror writers Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna, their spirits have a great flow. The police are also considered, it is always welcome Ken Foree. <br /> <br /> Now, I think this film would not work without Corbin Bernsen's superb performance. When I only saw LA Law before, I was frustrated by its activity. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Segizioa Dentista 2 is also worth watching, but slightly compared to the original. <br /> TTKK's Bottomline - Short films by Bernsen's superb performance.
