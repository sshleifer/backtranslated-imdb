I came across the fascinating I Curious (Yellow) and the assistant piece is a great ornament. I read a lot of reports about her talk and explicit sex. I did not think that was not that, but a thoughtful and thought-provoking thought like any other movie. I truly believe that the "curly" or "boring" movie was said to have approached the movie as if it were pornography. Maybe it's pornography, assuming that pornography is a bit of a desire to make the senses, but it is intentionally non-erotic. Lena, the protagonist, throws everything into his own performance, because he has only the persuasiveness and perseverance of realism and humanity. Her breasts may be heavy, her breasts are not very large, her legs are fat and her face is polite. But when the movie is over, the audience identifies with it and assumes its faults as human. This touch makes you more credible. If the director had put a Bombet Bardot bomb on, the effect would not have been valid. I can not recommend this piece of thought. Prepare a lot of thought to invest in this sensible movie. Patients and mere audiences will reward other films as they dream.
