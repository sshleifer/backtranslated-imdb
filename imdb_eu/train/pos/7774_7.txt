"Written wind" was a huge success of the universe. Only Douglas Sirk could give it, he saw the opportunities in the material provided. Based on the famous Robert Wilder novel and the adaptation of George Zuckerman, he had all the elements that made up a melodrama: nymphomania, great oil wealth, alcoholism, incest, and touch of homosexuality. After Sirk, he set the path that would continue in the genre of the series "Dallas" and "Dynasty". They are just two cited. <br /> <br /> This film was completely shot inside. a studio Most decorations are fake. Like many of the 1950s, "Written on the Wind" was shot in a studio. Look at the scene that takes place in Manhattan (or Miami), or even if there is a lake, we can see how the backdrop landscape landscape is seen. Mr. Sirk did not care about realism, could tell through the least story. <br /> <br /> We recently caught the screening, because Mr. Sirk's work was recovered, where people laughed. In some of the most dramatic moments, they appear, above all, the rock Hudson, the scenes that sound good Mitch Wayne. As Robert Keith, as Jasper Hadley calls patriarch, and later, his daughter, Marylee's wicked man, who decorates the old man's table, likewise represents a sort of phallic art object. . <br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk probably wished to perform his performances on stage, that is, it makes sense to portray Dorothy Malone as Marylee nymphomaniac, and, to a certain extent, to Robert Stack, the painful story of Kyle. This would be an easy explanation that would probably appear on the screen. Only Lauren Bacall seems to be normal, because she did not appear to have appeared in Lucy Moore's character, because she was not based on a person trapped by an evil crowd. <br /> <br /> Together with his other Hollywood movies, "Written wind" shows the genius of a talented director, people wanted to see what they wanted to see: bigger stories to watch on the big screen alone.
