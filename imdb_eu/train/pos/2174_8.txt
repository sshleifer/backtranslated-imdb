I really love this movie. "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent film, but later dubbed in French in 1930. Although someone else's voice has doubled, Louis Brooks is a great tour. With the mythical Edith Piaf dubbing the voice of his song, the purists condemn us with the deception of duplication. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Lulu and we first see in his establishment his friend, mazama Andre (Georges Charlia) and his friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). She enters the Lulu frame like a couple of legs: in her car we see her become a bathing suit. Lulu is very free to show his body, which does not sit well with Andre Pains. When Lulu's "Miss Europe" title is claimed, at the end of the day, Happy Street will not be happy. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film plays a great deal of men who lift beautiful women. We see many beauty baths and men's reactions to men. In her midst, Louise Brooks is magnificent. <br /> <br /> If you did not watch old movies, consider looking at this. Louise Brooks is not the name that most prestigious filmmakers can easily find, but as soon as you see, you'll be fascinated and know more. You can also look at 'Pandora's Box'. <br /> <br /> Be careful with the release of the Kino DVD in the United States. I do not know if the projection speed is correct. Many scenes show up at fast speeds. They might have shot the way. I do not know. But since it is the only way to see this film, it is necessary to swallow the bitter little pepper.
