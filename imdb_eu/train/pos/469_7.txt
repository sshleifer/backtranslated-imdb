The story was quite interesting, but the characters were pretty flat and sometimes excessive in their thoughts / behaviors. Extreme than necessary I also think that something has been wrong in the questionnaire. John Turtillo does not get bored when I play a huge chess. Motivations were not highly posed. <br /> <br />
