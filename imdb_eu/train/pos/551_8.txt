Western West by Anthony Mann, along with James Stewart, who plays a hard-hitting rugged young man named Jeff Webster, who takes a path from Wyoming to Alaska. It connects with Seattle to those who send him to the preparation for a trip to Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) (Jay C. Flippen). <br /> <br /> But, first of all, he has to face the hands of the devil, he thinks he must deceive the captain and the charm of the rooster, and he thinks that Ronda's manipulative castle (Ruth Roman) may be a valuable ally in the future. That's why he hid while aboard while the captain seeks to kill the first (and justifiable) enemy of a track. <br /> <br /> Also, Jeff has a misfortune to meet Gannon (John McIntire). ) Directed by Skagway (Alaska). Gannon blocks Jeff from suspending his public hanging because of his cattle running around the country. Jeff gives his cattle property and Jeff needs to eat herbs now. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Jeff commits to go to Ronda Dawson to provide supplies. But that's just a ruse, so Jeff, Ben and Rube Skagway can go back and steal their cows. Of course, the judge Gannon reports, and he is behind him, but Jeff goes on with a rifle, while Ben runs away from the Canadian border that expels from Gannon's hand. Other Skagway men eventually arrive at Dawson, where Jeff sells his cattle to the vendor, which simply creates a new Ronda Dawson game. Jeff then takes the money and buys himself a claim and starts a gold balance. <br /> <br /> But Gannon's referee will come to Dawson to get into his gold action and Jeff tells him he's bored with Skagway and he wants to try his luck on Klondike. . This will lead to a contracted gun and robbing other claims of minerals. As Jeff and Ben now feel that the time to go is good, Rube refuses to accept Gannon and his most effective counterpart. <br /> <br /> They're looking for the back way, only Gannon's men are upset, because Ben's mistake was opening his mouth. Ben dies and Jeff is a serious injury, but Gannon has no exception. The shootout that ended at night was hanging on the Dawson Street. First, Jeff kills two of Gannon's best guns (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). Then, as Ronda Jeff comes out, Gannon is trying to get behind him, Gannon pulls him back and dying at Jeff's arms. Then Jeff dies at Gannon, hiding under a wooden pavement. This revenge has been spoken. <br /> <br /> This is another mountain western fence with THE NAKED SPUR and LARAMIE MAN. Universal DVD uses why it uses a pan-scanning print, if it does not use TCM's on a large screen. William Daniels is in the midst of a glorious Alberta cinematography. So if you want good works of the fifties, then this is the A-list. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 8
