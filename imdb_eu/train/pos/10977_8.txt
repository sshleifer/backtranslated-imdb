Tomorrow night, I freed myself from the library from the library, not worshiping the film, influencing it or currently staging it as a musician. (!) Most of the comments here are intended, moving, fun. sad, and yes, though the strange exploiters are the best intentions of filmmakers. The created Chriterion edition is essential for anyone who has made it. <br /> <br /> I think that even in a small Edie, you can see the fall of a missing class, you can also hear Jackie Oren's old movies; People do not speak that way. As a documentary I think, it would be interesting to know how to get rid of home information, Old Edie seems to be at least something that happens; could he undo the spectacular house he saw? <br /> <br /> However, the subject of the film is the life of two women who built themselves, a real lifestyle, Tennesse Williams. Well, it's worth your time.
