This movie liked me. It was very nice. It has everything: cars, gun shooters, fights and even a token. It does not have such excellent things except cars. Some filming, a bit of fighting, a bit smoothing around and a lot of cars, with great persecution at the end. Jump, you can say, it's not practical, but it's possible for our best friends on IMDB, so the movie is not bad as people paint. He has little quality and I've seen. I loved the movie. And I did not see myself having to turn off. I did not always think "Is this possible?" or so. 10 in 10
