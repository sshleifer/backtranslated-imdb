I was in France around March 05 and I like to go to the movie festivals. I learned about this Latin American Cin√©mas in Toulouse, but I have never gone. I decided to go, and then I caught Cero y van 4. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing. I do not have the same effect as with Mexican users, because they were in French subtitles, but it's still moving. <br /> <br /> This film is a satire of urban violence, kidnapping and killing streets. In Mexico It's a dirty portrayal of the city. From one metropolitan area Kidnapping Express, with the amazing Mia Master, was a kidnapping satire almost, but with a shorter tone, and I think it's a good connection to Cero y van 4. A, depreciation story and that. how much is it too much? Man on Fire was also stunningly powerful, not a satire, but a gross portrait of the Mexican streets. Or it's like The Brave One. An exciting movie and the courage makes you harder. This is like Usual Suspects, it has drawings and turns, but that's also more credible. Judgment: Shocks a movie and belief that you are no longer in the street. Wonderful conversation, horrible directions and amazing performances. Cero y van 4 movies will not be forgotten soon. He leaves you trembling.
