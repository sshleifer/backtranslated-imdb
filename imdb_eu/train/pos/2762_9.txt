This movie will be a favorite piece of celluloid. I really do not need or I would like to say here. See "See this movie" and "Enjoy Daniel and Pascal's great work", which makes the story entertaining on your eighth day and twists it. <br /> <br /> When he saw this movie, on the eighth day = he thought he would pass my life. It seems that some of us are losing the precious time we're doing with what we're doing. Whether it's a nice career or just a TV show and ball games. What we usually miss is the satisfaction of being a different person: change. Spontaneous and direct space and time - NOW! (On the eighth day) ... At least I did that on the eighth day.
