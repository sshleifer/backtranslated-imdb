At the beginning, it's from England, so of course, I had a 98% chance of being a smart and very good cinema. I have never heard this movie. Since I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I said: O! Here's the version of My Left Foot. I was right, but I was wrong too. Wrong because the two films are very different. My Left Foot was a movie similar to John Ford and this is a movie Chaplin (not because it's funny, but in Chaplin's tone of tearing eyes). Lewis turns ugly on a crippled person and made a great deal of reality. Here, Bonham-Carter did very much the same thing, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and very intelligent. For me, Mrs. Bonham-Carter is one of the biggest women in the 1990s, along with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves. Gee! And looking at your eyes! The most eye-catching film looks at Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! It's also a real talent, as seen in many other films. See this, you will not regret it! And Branagh's great job too!
