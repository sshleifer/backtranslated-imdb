If you adapt a book written in the 1950's to the 1950s, set it into bloody decade in the 1950s and not in the 90s. See, 40-year-old customs and values ​​do not play at least on the road, or are true. Hollywood rule is a simple rule that continues to break. And that's a problem with this movie. You should set it when it was required to write. It would be thought that this would not be hope, but not. I would study it, but bmacv's comments were pretty good. I will limit my comments with Rachel Ward. To this day, the donkey seems to have completely ruled out. As a result, it attacks the chemotherapist, and is as simple as a skinned sofa on the couch. "I can die at any moment" seemed to be very confusing, and I felt that it was a lot of damage that I wanted to create "hotness" and "sexual tension". In addition, the movie was pretty good; 7 + 10 one.
