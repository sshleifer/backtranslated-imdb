Fido is a tale of zombies trained to serve human race. Timmy's young Fido fails to eat the family's neighbor. Since then, disaster occurs (perhaps not ruin, but somehow chaos). Most people put their zombies correctly, and one of the characters slept with their zone (a very fun part of the movie, though not too disturbing). And we can find whatever Fido loves we find. This movie is very funny and unique, especially for the zombie genre. It is probably one of the least violent zombies films (in this statement, no negativity). I highly recommend it for something fun and different for the people. I value this 8/10. R rated zombie-related violence
