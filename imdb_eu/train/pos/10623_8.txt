Michael Kallio gives a solid and conventional performance by Eric Seaver, a boy, abuse and alcohol abuse Barry, when Gunner Hansen was a terrific portrait. Eric has a compassionate fianc√©e (Tracee Newberry, beautifully interpreted) and a transcript of autopsy reports on a local morgue. His disgraceful dark past, Jack Devil (a really awful Michael Robert Brandon) who burns off his head, and who has been sent to death after his mother's death comes out of Eric and dies brutally. spree Kallio corrected it correctly (also wrote tight and sharp scripts), with an even play of soundtrack sounds (Jeff Steiger was very helpful to Eric as patron saint of the guardian angel), George's cinematography was pretty smooth but generally. Lieber, credible real characters, gross, shocking and calm, horrible violence, a horrible fall of Dan Kolton, an endless ending, Detroit, Michigan locations, a serious and tender tone. A passionate narrative that stays over a wonderful victory, this horrible and horrible psychological thriller is often terrifying and disturbing. Real tie
