Sniper war movie gives a new meaning. I remember movies about Vietnam or World War II, they're shooting a lot, everybody dies, bam bam. "Sniper" turns the war into a new level or improvement. The Festival certainly offers all the emotions: the harshness of human beings in the jungle, the hatred and trust in Beckett and Miller, and the momentum of the reminder at that moment. A low-budget film consists of each mistake filled with actions, instincts, and emotions, for it is just a shot to kill one.
