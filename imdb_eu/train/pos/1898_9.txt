Keith Moon was the father of the drummer, named Arthur. In this movie I found similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon. Liza Minelli, usually OVERACTS, did a great job, and was able to turn the cheek into Dudley Moore every turn. Yes, I admit, Sir John completely stole every scene. The very movie was "different", so the audience could see another life. We often try to restart the satellite of this movie. God rests Dudley Moore; This was a nice movie. Many satira and small thumbs rich and snobby / rich down. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is lovable.
