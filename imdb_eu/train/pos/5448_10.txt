This movie is probably my favorite movie of my time. Miriam Flynn is just as Bunny Packard. Zores Buzby Delores is a comic genius. The rest is an amazing cast, and the movie is really fun. A detailed satire for horror movies with no hassle. If you enjoy fun and entertaining afternoon, go classic selling. You will laugh at the way!
