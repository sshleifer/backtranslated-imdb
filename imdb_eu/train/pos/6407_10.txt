I went to this movie and my friend, the producer of this film, showed me the team, invited me. Forget what you've seen in ads, listen to what you've heard, watch yourself this movie. I was surprised. The Grinch, Charlies Angels, The 6th Day world, Unbreakable, here comes a movie that deserves your hard earned dollars! Wonderful scenes, a wonderful cast of cinema and a heart that you want to eat with your heart. I think it has been the most motivated and most motivated movie of these years. Robert Deniro deserves a head of Oscar. If you can give an Oscar as a participant in a package, this is the movie.
