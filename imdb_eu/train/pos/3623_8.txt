Disney may do something here. First, they had the "Remember the Titans" with Denzel, the truth based on sports and a small town in a small town. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie ... based on the truth of another sporting story. <br /> <br /> The two movies take you tears from time to time, and you both smile and feel warm. We took my wife and I to The Rookie and we were expecting a good movie. We did not condemn it when we asked if we wanted to buy this DVD when we came out. Exactly.
