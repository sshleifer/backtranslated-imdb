The first national hit of Peter Weir, THE LAST WAVE, is the most effective ability, with a wonderful story based on aboriginal myths. Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer, and his life situation is increasingly dissolving, in which case the case of the murder of aboriginal tribe competition is deepened. David Gulpilil plays one suspect, that is, Chamberlin will follow the reality of "Dreamtime", an alternative reality of Australian history and tribal traditions. Heavy atmospheres, deliberately ambiguous in the drawing, make the film an inadequate ending because it causes bad effects, probably due to budget constraints. However, as a mysterious film and hidden under the skin that we perceive as 'reality', an interesting film will continue with you.
