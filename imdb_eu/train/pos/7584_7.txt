This directing production is a bullet just enough, as John Woo says: "It's enough!" Of course, it's just as beautiful as Woo can not deliver, but he gets explicit work done in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret police in the near future. When his wife wants to kill a group using a cyborg to kill the governors, Eric must clear his name. Wilson takes Van Damme's duty while Wilson plays the lead and wins his cyborg dubelganger. I think the reason why I did not realize why the Academy is. Being the first production, there are a lot of self-trips, auto explosion (4 first 5 minutes!) And shooter. I liked the van all-rounder, before reaching a truck that explodes before reaching the touch. Another favorite of my side came to a neighborhood girl to give Don in his simulator the character of Karate to his perfection. It's only a chance to show some effects on LAWNMOWER MAN in 1995.
