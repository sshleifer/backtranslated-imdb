There is a great history in the film's genre. It has all the usual Columbo components; Columbo Lieutenant approaches and the way he relates to his suspicion, the mystery itself, the way Columbo's dog, cat and mouse play, this is a wonderful and fortunate way to relieve it, especially with the character Columbo. It is totally written, although it does not really have an original concept. Columbo went on to work on several occasions in a Columbo film writer for a murderer / murderer. <br /> <br /> James Frawley is also a well-directed film, that is, after directing five more films in Columbo. In the 70s and 80s. He gave him a movie style and some excellent and memorable sequences. <br /> <br /> Columbo is one of the most mobile movies, although they do not run for a long time. This style and approach does not always work well for a Columbo movie, but this movie does not work at least for the interpretation of the movie. <br /> <br /> Columbo was one of the stars of the first days of filmmaking, a star or star, as a killer movie. This movie is known for 81-year-old Ruth Gordon. During his career, he did not feature many films, but it is still known to some, especially when he won the role of "Rosemary's Baby" for Oscar. There was a realistic and unusual performance, but some might not like it. Throughout his career he has nominated 4 Oscars in his career before winning "Rosemary's Baby" in 1969. Peter Falk has a great interaction with her. <br /> <br /> The movie GD Spradlin still makes a young star. I am young, because I only know from his new career from his latest productions, although he was 57 years old during the production of this Columbo. He is still alive, but since 1999 he has retired. <br /> <br /> Better than a better entry into the regular movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
