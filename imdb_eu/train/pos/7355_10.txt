For a low-budget project, the movie was successful. The story is interesting and the actors were persuaded. Eva Longoria, the star of the TV show "Dragnet", is more sexy than ever. The locations were perfect for the land of the Ganster, and the director shows his talent by taking on the role of his project. This low-budget movie can make better transition to editing and special effects for gunsets, of course, but music maintains this script. Even if this film is a problem, for example, I would like to continue with the next movie of the director. If you are a film student, you will learn some of the comments from the director.
