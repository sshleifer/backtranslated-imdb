He was shocked . According to the information and resolution, this film was automatically reactivated by people and situations. The most alive caused the anger of emotion. A way of reacting to a broken baby does not get her way. . ! It was the most absurd absurd among all those I thought was hiding from others. What did it cost to me? Soooo a lot of love. . .sooo many blessings. I am now feeling charming and having a constant gratitude for life. . . What is happening in this moment, without a savage hope of life, I think, in a certain way, that life or people would be "what I would need." This film has contributed to the freedom I feel nowadays to connect with others, without limits and without hope. . . and connect with true love. . . loss without fear . To love first, accept what love is.
