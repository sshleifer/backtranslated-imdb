"Someone at the door". OHHH, how have I missed this show so bad ... but we are lucky "Invasion". Thank you, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic, everything was there. If choosing one thing that best suits the show, it must be "unforeseeable". His favorite actress was Lucas Black. I love that Southern accent. I bought the DVD ASAP and my children are also fans. There are some sour scenes. Some devilish too. So, if you see kiddos, you can edit it (fastforward / skip). He has humor, at Joss Wheedon, showing so much. Adults and adults' adulthood, financed by Finns. The DVD has some extra items, but I want a lot more. If you want to enjoy a great show of emotion and show, see "American Gothic"!
