You should be very pleased to be caught up in the treasure of this movie (and I've also seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies). The actors, beautiful settings, locations and surroundings, deep emotional portraits, sweet songs (especially, Udit Narayan's song, my favorite), was just beautiful. The human (imperfect) item was also woven to create some drama and drive the plot, even allowing a sensible resolution. Alok Nath is a horrible actress, so open to the emotions of the characters she portrays, the young star almost stole the show. I really recommend this movie to anyone who loves real love - those who overcome their superficial beauty with true love - one of these films, Hindi or otherwise!
