Zentropa is something like The Third Man, a movie set between post-war European rubble. Like TTM, there is a lot of camera inventors. An innocent American woman who does not understand emotionally, and whose naivety is even more striking among locals. <br /> <br /> But I should say, The The Third man has a well-crafted story. Centrum is disconnected in that sense. Perhaps this is mandatory: it is presented as a dream / nightmare, and being consistent would undermine the effect. <br /> <br /> This movie is somewhat rude: in a single sense, "noir"; There is never a shining sun. Excited, but interesting and terrifying.
