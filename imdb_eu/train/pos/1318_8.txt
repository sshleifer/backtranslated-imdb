I had to write the review of Space Cobra, because it received a good score of 7.3, but some of the reviews that I was writing were very positive. A strange situation and I expect that my positive reviews will be people who will direct people to the old and forgotten anime movie. Space is a story of a smuggler and an evil wreck, with the evil power of the three sisters of an old and dead planet and the powers of the planet. It shows old cinema and animation, but modern sophistication does not do with many charms. Space Cobra is targeted at a Western audience and is very easy to see. There are few references to the specific Japanese culture, although anime is very good for beginners. Space Cobra is both fun and enjoyable. I can not say how much this is about the English dub or the author's intention, but that's a little Japanese comedy that seems to me funny. The style is in the sixties, Barbarellish, with the wonderful soundtrack of Yello. It is a colorful and imaginative style and there is a constant action to carry out the story. The most curious aspects of this film begin as a comedy and dramatic note is very low. I can not make another anime or other movie in the same way and in a convincing way. You hardly realize that it is happening, but it is very firm and it seems very natural. Likewise, you feel that the characters have traveled on a journey, and the whole life experience has changed. If you can check it out.
