In the afternoon, I caught the cable in the movie. I must admit I've never been a fan of baseball, but sometimes I go into a good sports-related movie. It seemed to me that I was more interested in representing the family recipient's system. As a therapist who has seen good and bad health and mental health in the community, although I was quite refreshing, I had to watch a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system: jumping family and biological. parents do not always take active involvement, and heart-wrenching and bending only. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchors of this movie, and they both bring incredible performances. Maybe my emotional situation was, but I found that I threw a tear at the end of the movie.
