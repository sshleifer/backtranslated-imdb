I did not expect them to be as well-done as Gackt and Hyde's performances, nor did I expect a well-developed artistic movie to keep their original interest and enough diversity. This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and I will look like this next movie. I particularly like being a vampire movie, but it was not an individual cheat, and it was not improved in more than that. All characters have human characteristics. It shows the growth of the characters as very tasty and you feel full of life. This movie has been given two fingers so far. Undoubtedly, the best movie I have ever seen in the last five years.
