This is one of the funniest movies I've watched. I saw it on the DVD, and the disk has no special features, nor a menu, but that's not what I care about. <br /> <br /> I judge films according to each case, such as the production of major studios or a smaller film. The movie is smaller and I forgive little things. That said, I think that he has one of the most inventive and original sequential titles I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the performance of all the most important players. Especially Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has the most fun lines. Some of the characters presented by Claire Forlan might be realistic, but personally I've had real people with emotional issues, because life's decisions look very much on their characters. This helped me pick up the nuances that made her coats of touch. <br /> <br /> This is not a children's movie, of course, but it does not make sexual and nudity free. However, adult language is quite, but sometimes it can be very fun. (Especially Alan Arkin's character, he can not swear correctly). <br /> <br /> Also, see the cameo actors of well-known characters.
