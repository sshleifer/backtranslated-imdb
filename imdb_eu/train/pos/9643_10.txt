This movie has everything. Emotion, power, love, Stephane Rideau's nude beach dance ... He has shown the inner communion and external communication. The pair of Cedric and Mathieu is a non-gay pair, which nowhere has a useful perspective. I would probably classify it as a gay movie, but heterosexual and homosexual and bisexual love and love. Mathieu's impotence to manage his emotions encourages us to act in a different way with our society, and that is what creates the disagreement between himself and Cedric. This is definitely imperative!
