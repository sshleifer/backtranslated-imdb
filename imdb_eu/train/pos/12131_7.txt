The movie Philip (Leslie Howard) is worried, the medical student is evil but vulnerable. Mildred (Bette Davis) falls into a boring and abominable server. He leaves it with others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny). Meanwhile, he has been interviewed with other siblings (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee), but goes back to destroying each other. <br /> <br /> The best and first-ever versions of Somerset Maugham's movie. Bette Davis earned a superb performance as a cruel cockney servant, with a stunning and glittering performance, with hypnotizing about slavery from the beginning to the end. David had a tremendous impact on his performance. The dominant women will repeat themselves more than once in the theater. Leslie Howard's very good and decent learning, as it is destroying, gives an excellent and melancholy performance. He was a great actor (with the wind), a producer and a writer, and also a dead plane on the plane. Both will play again ¨Pétrified forest¨ (1936). The rookie movie RKO (Radio Picture Inc) is closely researched at the studio. Edmund Goulding renewed in 1946 with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and Ken Hughes in 1964, with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. They would like the classic movie image. Rating: Very good but a bit dated.
