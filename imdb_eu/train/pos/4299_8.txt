In your video store, you will find this treasure. <br /> <br /> The state of man at LA time. There is not much drama, only the fall of events that will happen to a group of people over time. <br /> <br /> You can help understand the joy and despair of city life. <br /> <br /> Direction and direction and cutting is a higher class. Cinematography and music continue with much mood and status. And CAST! <br /> <br /> Excellent shot and great performance. Nobody is outside of any place or outside. <br /> <br /> And you're not as small as expected. I gave it to 7/10. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, do it!
