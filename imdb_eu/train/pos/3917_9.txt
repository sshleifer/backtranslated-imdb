I first watched this movie when it was released in the United States. I have seen many in 1984 The essence of the essay that hears me about the film is the inclusion of the characters' lives, and the vice versa. They are linked together throughout the film and sometimes nobody is sure to see the scene of a life or rehearsal for the characters. This continues until the end of the movie. Over the years, my friends and I still like discussing whether or not the end of "Carmen" is really involved. From the reaction of other characters, in the face of stylized assassination, there is controversy. The passion of dance, the quality of acting, the love of art, and the splendor of the performances all combine with the excellent mixing and revitalization of the line of life and art.
