With Arthur Matthews and Ted Line's next generation, the name of "Hippies", a BBC-inspired babe, was written by Arthur Schats, only by Arthur Matthews. <br /> <br /> It was established in London in 1969. Ray Purbs, a hippie, is an editor of anarchist magazine. His friend is a fixed friend, very dismissed and burning cannabis by Alex, his "girlfriend" is feminist Jill and no one is shiny Hugo. <br /> <br /> Simon Pegg Ray was brilliant, but it was brilliant. enter everything. This Sitcom had the feeling of "Citizen Smith". He was like Ray Wolfie Smith, who was trying to attack society, but unfortunately he failed. In the end this sitcom will be released on DVD in March, I can not wait to buy it. As it began in 1999, it has been repeated on terrestrial television. My memories are not good for the sitcom; However, I remember clearly the two episodes, first of all, I was "Protesting Hippies" open. - Ray protests against satirical paper and another episode is "Hippy Dippy Hippies" and I think it's Chapter 4, the police report is quite clear. Unfortunately, the series has received a negative reaction from the audience (I can not think why). The BBC asked for other series, but Arthur Matthews decided to react adversely. Well, I can not wait for the DVD. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies- Series 1 Episode 4.
