In the final part of the action thriller franchise, it is probably the greatest difficulty between these three films. He goes on to go on to fight against Bond. Bourne does not like what he is doing and he wants to know about his vexed past. Everything about this film hangs from cinematography to interpreting the choreography / premiere script. It seems that the story remains in the first movie. Or is it? It's been a bit mixed up here, but Bourne remembers things. When he was trying to clear himself immediately, he suddenly fell back almost trapped, but he did it and did not kill anyone. There are no goals. From there, we will get more intrigue from his past with a new player from Noah Vein, and he seems to know everything about Bourne and protect it at all costs. Pamela Landy is back, as well as Nicky Parsons, because Bourne seems to be past. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is pretty close to your face almost everything. Motor harassment is even more pronounced than the first two provinces. And Bourne's veteran is full of nice part of Albert Finney. Similarly, it has minor political flaws in relation to interpretation and other government policies, but this is small and well integrated into the plot. In short, it is one of the best effects of this year's trilogy, if it's never the best trilogy.
