This film is the 1950's version of Ettore Scola's Brutti sporchi e cattivi. There is less sex and less realism, but a story of humanism and warmth. I would not call this realistic picture. It is very sensitive and it is like a fairy tale, and it should be named as a comedy, although it's about serious matters (like Chaplin or 1930-comedy). Italian is a typical, very emotional and tough one to deal with except with a cold stone. The feeling is unknown, although this photo was not a realistic drama. It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or Bicycle Ladder. But the comedy is pleasant and hilarious with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
