Just Cause extracts three of the best films, Cape Fear, A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs, and mixes them together to create a good thriller for a movie. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is a Liberal Law teacher, married to Kate Capshaw, a former court attorney and sentenced her to a crusade. Blair Underwood's grandmother Ruby Dee persuaded the left button to handle a conference in Connery and her grandchildren's appeals. She is seated by a young girl's death. <br /> <br /> When Connery landed in rural Florida, she is battling a hard sheriff that plays Laurence Fishburne, as credible as Orson Welles's resolution of crime. It was Touch of Evil. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, when Connery finds the verdict she reveals, she feels pretty good about herself. At that moment the movie will be decided by Touch of Evil in Cape Fear. <br /> <br /> It seems that not everything seems to be weak. The play plays good performances. A special mention must be made by Ed Harris as Hannibal Lecter with Underwood in the death row as a series killer. It will crawl your skin and start thinking of some of these beautiful liberals based on Connery's beliefs. Many new liberals I know have come to think of crime as a victim. <br /> <br /> Of course, conversely, it's true. The laws and conservative order that many of the implications of a criminal justice system make sure they are sure will be guaranteed by all their rights. <br /> <br /> Criminal justice is not an end, but a process. and never ends the whole society. Just Cause, I think it might be a moral one.
