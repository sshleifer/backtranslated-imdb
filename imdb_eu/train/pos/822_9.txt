Lucas's latest film is a spectacular and spectacular production. The ugly duckling's trilogy is originally considered, but I think IV. Above the passage (and under III and V passages). Actually, in 6th, I think the saga is the third best movie. As I worry, it's still a fun movie. It's not the beginning, climax and the final movie; The film's mechanism works solely for one purpose: close the Lucas universe. There is a length of time attached to the whole thing, which makes the film feel overly emotional, but emotionally rewarding. It's also very funny. New characters have entered and the old ones are new and unexpected. C3PO and R2D2 provide a great relief for comics (as usual). Leia and Solo are a romantic couple, and Luke is still an excellent character to identify. Again, Luke's (and Vader's) conflict is the saga backbone. Lucas's aggressive imagination is still apparent, and the film's loyalty, hope and amortization are strongly accepted. Luke VII, VIII and IX rejoice to me. He decided to make some episodes, because this film is a great, long, fascinated and fascinable book of saga. It's not a perfect movie, but a fun matinee style.
