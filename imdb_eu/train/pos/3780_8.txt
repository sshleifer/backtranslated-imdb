When I saw the second time, a few years later, I noticed two things about this movie: 1) I liked it very much, and 2) because its execution is more evident than justifying the same premise. I laughed at the movie when I ventured to renew my initial protests - the leaves and loogies and airheadedness of the valley (although it might be good for the air) are not fun, especially for length. But when it starts to push the end of the movie, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr., in an unforgettable scene) show the sharp rhythm of the comic book, as well as false fake jokes (for example, Ted). If they do not recognize some of the Hellenic inhabitants, they work hard without any effort (such as challenges). And the team of Winter and Reeves is so fast that Bill and Ted's team (who distinguish only one scene from the movie, if they do not meet the disaster), seems to have a total sensation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Fortunately funny
