The only reason I gave him 10 to 10 on this movie is that there is little film that seems to me to be perfect. This small B picture is a tough story, well-said. Alexander Knox has always seduced me, but I've seen very few films. Here, Wilhelm Grimm plays a small monster who becomes a monster. It's all betrayal, and everyone does not have remorse. The show is a show that I've never seen. Since the beginning of the Second World War, the actors who played the Nazis or other evildoers were occasionally nominated for an Academy Award. Since the time of the war, I think that the Academy would like to pay such a tribute to the evil one. But Knox puts this kind of performance: a man who feels guilty and consumes others, who does not suffer from others. I can not pass yet. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who usually plays filbert gibbet or social butterfly, has thrown the opposite of the best performance I've ever heard. Maybe Oscar is not worth it, but the best of his career. Nothing against him; I've enjoyed these little role playing often. But he shows the heaviest drama he plays here. <br /> <br /> If you like stories about human theater stories or the fates of the Nazis, it is highly recommended that this be so beautiful. film
