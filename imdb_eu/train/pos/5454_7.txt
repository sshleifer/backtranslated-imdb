In the 1930s, one of Hollywood's most popular and pre-eminent "Pre-Code" films, made in Hollywood. Like some previous codes, some of the songs that had not been recorded since 1934 were immersed in a very entertaining and entertaining plot, from the beginning to the end. At the end of the 30s and the usual moral decades of the 40s, this film is NOT particularly obvious, and of course, the movie is about a concientious woman who comes to the top and without forgiveness. Both were used for all men who were sexually rich and enjoyable. You would never have seen films that were made two or three years later. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is starting to work with her father. In addition to being his boss, he is also his suitcase and encourages him to sleep with a local government officer, allowing him to operate without any unlawful bar. It is not clear here, but it seems that the father has long been "leasing" the daughter's body. <br /> <br /> However, after almost being raped and attacked by this man, having broken a beer bottle, Burezurra, Barbara, has been enough and she starts off to the big city. It is not bad that he has still been killed and his father died, but he felt that he felt himself sucked and encouraged to show anything that he needed to show. <br /> <br /> Despite depression, Barbara uses sex to get a job in a large mega bank. It works as a secretary of the file secretly, but in a place where it looks like a few weeks, it sleeps from one job to another, until it is sleeping with the head of the bench. and his future suhia !!! All this ends with tragedy, but it seems that Babs does not shake too much from the death of these two men. Actually, later, he is able to bring himself into the life of the new director and is again up (perhaps more than one). <br /> <br /> So far, this is a wonderful movie because it was so gritty and unrepentant. Barbara played a 100% partner: a woman without moral conscience and conscience. The only desire to stretch out of life was anything else that could hurt the process. However, bold writers and producers were "expelled" and believed it was of great importance. Given that this woman was so evil and convinced, in the end her heart change was a great despair and she drew a lot of the movie. In many ways, this reminded me of the end of JEZEBEL - once again, a bad person somehow "sees the light" and changes are not so convincing. <br /> <br /> My advice is to try RED-HEADED WOMAN and DOWNSTAIRS. RED-HEADED WOMAN is like BABY FACE, but in the end it's not a magical transformation. On the contrary, the main lady is nasty! In DOWNSTAIRS, a movie like RED-HEADED WOMAN, the roles are reversed and a man (John Gilbert) has a similar composing nature. Both are classics and are a bit better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a curious short of a bustling Hollywood movie, which is why it's worth watching at Cinephiles. Duke fans have also noticed - John Wayne has a small part in the movie, and Wayne is very common to play a very ordinary role.
