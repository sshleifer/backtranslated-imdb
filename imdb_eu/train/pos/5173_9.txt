I rarely see a movie that is totally inserted; It was one of them. Good play, dialogue, drawing and beautiful scenery. I laughed several times, especially the scene against cooking. Lunkhead has been a hand-made comedy slapstick for me on the floor, but I accept it for a slapstick sauce. Fifty years ago they went to the summer camps with people who had returned to the summer camps. It was the camping farewell week, the place was definitely closed at the end of the season. The adult was different from the outside, and around him and the others did not feel. Everybody is a great fun movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
