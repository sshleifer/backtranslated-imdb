This game is amazing. You really do not need to get it. It's been in the old days, though it was amazing when it came out. I believe that this game will always be classical. Super Mario World is as good. When I was young, my friends and I sat and played this game for a few hours trying to overcome it. It's not as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a fan of Mario, it's crucial. Funny and fun challenge. Everything you want from a fantasy game, except for good graphics (it was released in 1996). ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
