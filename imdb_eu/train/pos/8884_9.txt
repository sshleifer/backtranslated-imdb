I like the 60's It's not that generation (I'm waiting for the "80s)") it was interesting to see a single four-hour capsule for that time. <br /> <br /> An important problem in the movie, however, was unbalanced. The film was a portrait of families. According to promotions in the NBC movie, it was a story about two families who faced America's 60s issues. Now, maybe I miss something, but we learned more about the white family than the family of Afro-Americans. <br /> <br /> I really think the 60s use music to describe the scenes that describe the scenes. Get out of the actors' mouths (all are very talented.) This is very visible at the end of the first minus series (about two hours) in the least series. <br /> <br /> The movie is very good!
