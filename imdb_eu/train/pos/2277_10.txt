While the movie feels sometimes too long, it's worth it. Gordon directs the style that Vonneguts style to write. Merciful, thoughtful, ironic, curious and gloomy, this is the movie that will remain with you for a long time, asking for unanswered answers. Somehow, Goodman and Arkin are incredible. Sheryl Lee also loves Lynch's role in reminding us of his / her Laura / Maddy days. Do not miss this!
