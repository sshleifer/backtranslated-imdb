I captured this movie in my local movie channel and I would like to watch the movie. It has all the elements of a good teenage film, and more - This film deals with the relationship between boys and girls and sex and the like and also addresses the use of young steroid. <br /> <br /> The film has a sense of real life - it's not a loud music, no special effects, and no scene scene - it was a good idea for this movie. This feeling makes it easy to relate to the characters in the movie, some of which we know from where we know them. <br /> <br /> In general, a good movie, watch it funny. <br /> <br />> 10/10
