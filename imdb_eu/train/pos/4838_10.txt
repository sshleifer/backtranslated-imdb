This movie reminded me that black and white films are definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> At first, I made reservations, but I was fascinated by the beginning of the film until the end. I was very impressed with the mix of drama, suspense and comedy. <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is HILARIOUS and I've had it all the time. <br /> <br /> Add this definitely to the movie in some of today's movie nights, to make it so lightweight as "depressing and" too "powerful or too" fun ".
