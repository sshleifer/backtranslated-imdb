David Burton (Richard Chamberlain, fairly good) is a lawyer who manages taxation on corporations (and the unusual man who sees this male lawyer who is hidden in this dark man). Among their aborigines, called Billy, their origins ... we can see that rituals strive to steal paint stones, and the chief of a tribe of Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula) uses "death bone". to stop his heart. In the meantime, around David, Sydney is causing a weird weather pattern, which causes heavy rainfall and drowsiness infected by rain, in a glittering blue sky (such as the unforgettable cloud that goes to Central Australian school). , a "deformed" rainbow (!) is divided into groups. According to David, he finds that it is closer to some of the most curious facts. An aboriginal Chris (David Gulpilil) reveals in a dream that a stone is clothed in blood and that man thinks he is one of those to be considered in the trial. He found it very possible that with some strange encounters with Charlie and conversations with Chris, it might well have been linked to a spirit called Mulkurul and that his dreams are frightening of future fears. <br /> <br /> The apocalyptic drama is built methodically in a story that is completely original and surprising. As Peter Weir is in charge, we will see the best possible trial of the film as a genius, but David's trip to David's film is definitely a credible angle, while Charlie and Chris are asking. first of all, to help escape from crimes not committed by his men and, finally, to find out what is happening or what may happen later.
