This music is very confusing and does not fit in any way, but it's somehow nice. On the plot there are some elements of Wodehouse's novel, but it's not from its virtues, although it's written in the script. Songs, even charming, do not relate to this movie, and they are rarely included, even though they are Oklahoma's previous standards. Burns and Allen make their usual splinters quite well, but the rest of the film is about fifty IQ points. <br /> <br /> There are several points. Reginald Gardiner does a good job that he remembers that this debate is like a silent actress. There are some writings written by Wodehouse, though most of the movies resemble the production of parodies made by Hollywood.
