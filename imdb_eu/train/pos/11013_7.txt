Many of our films featured in the Hollywood War over the years helped our troops to support the public. Today, some can be dismissed as propaganda or technically, but in a positive way and in order to unify the nation. The movie genre is a fairly effective and entertaining example: realistic guides and good production values. Pat O'Brien plays the same character in other films (you know, a tough, hardcore but "wrinkled" speaker). Randolph Scott, as always, are competent and entertaining and the other extras are excellent (look at Ryan Robert as a young training bomber). While the story reminds us of other movies about our other riders and crews, the film is well-developed, interesting and not too scarce. That, perhaps, except for the end, where the movie is a bit too high but very well. About serious negatives, that is, especially nitpickers, is that the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated into the film and "nuts" are just like me, both history teachers and aircraft lovers probably realize this - all the others will probably not realize you.
