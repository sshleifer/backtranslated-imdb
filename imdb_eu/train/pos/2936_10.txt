Eddie Murphy only 10 years after he was born. Then we would remember it. But I was just 4 years old when I left. If you have not seen yet, rent Dr. Dolittle, Showtime, I spy, Pluto Nash and Eddie's all-comedy movie. Then watch this. Hands down, 90% of time will make you laugh. Another 10% will erase tears for your eyes. <br /> <br /> It is really necessary to see more than once to understand all the jokes. A fun joke for kids! (If you laugh at this), you love things. If you can (or a great fan) try to download the photos of Eddie's pictures. One of the shows is different as you would imagine and jokes are also more fun. <br /> <br /> But this is the best "Eddie Murphy" if it's "X-rated". > <br /> And I can say that if you do not see comedy, you will not have a mood or you will not be pleasant. You will only put this great classic Eddie Murphy and maybe someone will miss you. <br /> <br /> If you want to know how Eddie Beverly Hills Cop has achieved, that's why it's famous ... It's Delirious.
