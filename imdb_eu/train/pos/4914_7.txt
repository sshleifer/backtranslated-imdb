In life, a small pleasure store is down the street in the corridors of the store, and I do not see things together. It's a great pleasure to occasionally take this movie home and find a similar treasure on my screen. <br /> <br /> Before Elia Kazan made the brand name of many (not good) brands. This was better than the average drama. By looking, you realize how many good or good scenes have been accumulated. Contrast the following movies when large plays are written ... if possible, large and simple and scandalous. Kazan was eventually a calculator promoter than a director. (um, no, thank you) <br /> <br /> Future abuses are explained here only on the plot. The plague has arrived! But here is Richard Widmark playing an atypical family man in 1951, and avoiding most of the abuses of this troop; Here is Barabra bel Geddes, almost invisible, with his bath (well, for him); They are a couple and they share good writing about the biggest and smallest crises. Here is a comic-directed comic quiz with a boat crew manned; It is a beautiful moment, as it begins at an angle of harassment, and the bird group shoots a momentum this year. These are the small scales that the movie can offer, the audience can know their life; Something that Hollywood avoids what it avoids now, its greed. These are the moments that allow you to go and enjoy movies. It is a personal and invaluable film that will not grotesque and unstoppable production (he and David Lean) will later popularize, whose heritage still feels like shame between the Pirate of the Caribbean and the Moulin Rouge. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < This reminds me of No Way Out Poitier noir, as a villain as Widmark, and Naked City, you really need your hands.
