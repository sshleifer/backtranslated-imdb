I love Sabrina! One of my fave shows! They are my favorite passages; What makes Libby the first episode becomes the true love episode and most of the rest of the first series. I believe that the parts of the university were not as good as high school, but it was better than the final series. Valerie was a good character as Jenny was rounded out, but Jenny had great passages. Hilda and Zelda were amazing, and there was no explanation where they went. Libby was also a good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy. They were just as good as other friends.
