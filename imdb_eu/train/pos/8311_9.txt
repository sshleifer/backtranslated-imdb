I really liked the movie, it was good, and great actors! When Richard Robinson, Richard and many other classic singers played, his work is good, when you watch a movie, you know it's good! I would like to see the movies that are heated, dull and unique, if they want to know more about Richardi! Excellent! Fresh!
