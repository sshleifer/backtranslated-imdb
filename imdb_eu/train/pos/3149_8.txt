The Simpsons debut was a sitcom in 2 minutes since I made the debut. Of course, Simpsons has killed the sitcom. This is not it. <br /> <br /> When the first season came to an end, young people did not come later later. Sometimes they went to school. In the following seasons he appeared on the character. Eric, sarcastic, Donna, his adorable girlfriend, Kelso, the evening bomb, Hyde, the theoretical conspiracy and anti-slave punk, Fez, the interchange student and eventually Jackie, a wealthy man. Eric's mother, as in the case of an adult, thinks that "the neighbor's mother is so absurd", Eric's father, the right arrow, of course, was not so stupid, Donna's father, goofy and her dumb blonde. loves Everyone has the truth in the characters, but Kurtwood Smith owes it to find the perfect balance between hardness, and in its Red Form still generates a pleasant one without losing it with unexpected drunkenness. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace, of course, is the main reason for this show. It's a tough character to play, the actors are similar to Kelso's character, played by Ashton Kutcher skillfully. I have seen two characters interacting because they are very different. <br /> <br /> Hyde's character is much more complicated, because it's realistic and we must first see the story orphaned. In recent seasons, I can say that writers have brought a wonderful story. <br /> <br /> The voice of the Family Guy is played by Mila Kunis, who is ridiculous and nails. The voice really adapts to its nature. The sad part is that we have not seen more scenes with him or Eric, because they were ridiculous. There was a lot of unreasonable story in his relationship problems, as we already had with Spades and Donna. <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, I will say that the casting of invited actors is always good. Favorite: The girlfriend of Fez in mid-January, Leo is a totally fascinated Leo, charming Leo Chong, a fez girlfriend, who is absolutely convinient and looks like a teenage girl. a nasty Catholic girl. <br /> <br /> Next time Fox goes up.
