At that time, as a young teenager, Airwolf was a generational generation that wanted "Cowboys and Indians" stunning explosions and explosions. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the show was basically Skywalker Knight: a similar comic technology, the main character, a lonely solitaire, and the echo of a man's difference. <br /> <br /> But in other important ways, it was very much a matter of different themes from Knight Rider, Street Hawk, A-Team and other shows of the past. On the one hand, the premise of the series is not a desire to help the poor, but Stringfellow Hawke is owned by Airwolf, who is basically self-sufficient (MIA, his brother, St John). Afterwards, the 80s are a dark edge that firmly consolidates in the context of the Cold War, which is made up of dictators of the Soviet of Spain and the Central American, without mentioning the enemy. Surely, A-Team referred to Vietnam as a hostile state of the group, but in general it was made with a slight touch and rarely on the plot. With Airwolf, the intrigue was the tone and direction of the show - although the (poorly) series tracking was diluted. <br /> <br /> From now on, the Cold War series shows clearly the series. , many of the stories are crisp and thought to be, and Airwolf does not have much to do with today's technology. But that's not it. Airwolf was fun, he tried to tell stories of interest without relying solely on the great sequential actions, and he did not do anything to make a layer of sugar, one that no one miraculously guaranteed. Sometimes he failed, but he often achieved great success - and set it up on television quotes. <br /> <br /> For readers in the UK, DMAX (Sky channel 155) has begun in its new year (2008). Set your Sky + box for this explosion in the past - we can get it back in the fourth season, throw it out (and unfortunately it's too much lower), I've never seen it before in the UK.
