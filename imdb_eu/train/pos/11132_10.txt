Jon Voight Joe plays a man. Joe has shaken a bitter childhood. He has fear and hatred for religion because of his traumatic baptism. He worked as a dishwasher and became a star for the rich. Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) fills in with an evil and two relationships. They go out and work together to help each other. They become robbers. They grow two very close and soon they can not live together. However, it is very important that Ratso does not say Joe, and he can destroy the hope that can destroy the city. It's one of the biggest films ever. It is a strange portrait of lonely and rare men, nothing lost. Their story is very impressive, but it is essential to see people. The characters that appear on the street are like crazy people. The difference is that this film comes from their perspective. They show us their lives and it is devastating to treat pedestrians as soil in this film, especially if we were one of these people. However, the movie has not traveled from you. Instead, he shows the rough life of his life. It is not a pleasant and pleasant life represented by many Hollywood films, such as MILK Money and PRETTY WOMAN. The life of being a murderer is a dirty, noisy, ugly life, and it's sad that people have had their degradation in Joe. What surprised me most about this movie was born in 1969, and it was a great test of time. Today's audience will still have a great deal of meaning in this film and they will still love it and critics and audiences will perform everywhere in 1969. a more sincere, realistic and effective way. Everyone who has sex before will know how humorous, difficult, and terrifying, and this film is not ashamed. Sex in this movie may not be as graphic as ever. X films, such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, COMPUTERS, SPECIAL SCHEDULES, LASTEST TABLE in Paris, and FRITZ THE CAT, seem to be very comfortable in comparison to what people can do now with the R score. MIDNIGHT COWBOY's sex scenes seem pretty robust, but they're definitely not sexy. They are not graphics, but they are realistic, and people have to keep in mind when they watch this movie. The language used in the film, especially the word "fag", is effectively used and is not free. Violence is too heavy to see today, but again it is necessary to imagine the world of a plot. I'm very pleased that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not dated and it still affects what happened in 1969. I can not recommend this classic enough and I hope that they continue to look for audiences, an unforgettable and very unique experience, which will soon be forgotten. <br /> <br /> PROS: <br /> <br /> -Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are amazing and amazing. They never play or play similar roles and they are completely unusual. You will forget to play it for a few minutes! <br /> <br /> -Good beauty <br /> <br /> -They have no antique or similar films of eight years <br/> <br /> <br /> -Fastastic and fast edition <br / > <br /> TIPS: <br /> <br /> -for adult viewers <br /> <br /> -The scenes of the scenes are just fine, but they can be a bit more powerful.
