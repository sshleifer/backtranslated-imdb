There's no way to describe 'Zabriskie Point' by describing using rational attitudes or other movies that you use for descriptions. This is not because it's a movie. An idea and filmmakers think that it has become an everyday object as a film. What we see is not a development of a plot, we will see the sequences of events that we do not see in movies every day, but we will become a background that we will be giving ourselves to when we talk about tragic events or from friends. We are aware of the imagination of the people of our abstraction, we know, but we have heard it in a book or on television or elsewhere. So what do we see? Events We see people arguing, driving and inevitably escaping. The only escape is something intangible; The collective state and cruelty is that the mass of a civilization is laziness or ... that the human nature exists. In Los Angeles, at the end of the 1960s, our players respond to misery against modern life. These beings are clearly empty clues, if we want to show any of the features that we imagine. While actions are considered criminal or irresponsible, characters are not criminals themselves. Man is the man who seeks to return to the knowledge of normalization that goes beyond everyday life. He is never happy or sad, but they get an update on themselves when they commit suicide for modern life. They achieve real life in the natural world, although it is the next victim of modern existence. In the end, 'Zabriski Point' is the fascination with the natural world of humanity. As the inappropriate piece of land overcomes our ideas of progress, we lose our souls towards the death of the human spirit.
