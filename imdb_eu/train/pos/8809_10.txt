This document was actually seen by people outside of the United States as they thought about attacks on September 11. This film was widely collected and this catastrophe presents more than one US soil attack. The consequences of this disaster are seen from different countries and perspectives. I think that this film should extend this point further. It also helps in the healing process, in the end, seeing terrorist attacks rather than news reports. And some pieces are really fun, but they are not abusive. This movie was highly recommended, and I surpassed the same feeling.
