I mean, by Dane Youssef, modern day, 1975). Paramount fell like a potato that spreads the flame. <br /> <br /> But this is a movie about Bakshi, controversial, exciting and essential only by definition. A randomized "shock jock" that does not match the movie for a shock. It's Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that something big has been said about a movie ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < in the film's main white film or in any movie available. "Coonskin" wants to be more. The goal is higher and fry some bigger fish. <br /> <br /> The movie does not have fun around the genre. On the other hand, it only condemns blacks, but it seems that love, beauty and heart appear in the most unusual places. <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" tells the story of some prisoners awaiting a pause. "Coonskin" is also possible to get out of a prison in the world. <br /> <br /> A prisoner tells a story about a trio of a black brother named Harlem. Bear, Brother Rabbit, Predator Fox, you want a bit of respect and action and are ready to get the necessary means to achieve this. In the It√°lion Mafia it has all the real actions. <br /> <br /> Top-notch black stars are Barry White and Scatman Crothers, as well as Charles Gordone, the first black dramatist to take Pulitzer home. Of course, something great happens here. <br /> <br /> The movie goes down to this world, this part of race division. Black men angry, deep and deep, heart-hated and guns in their hand. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bakshi films do not know the meaning of word "sublety". This seems to never be heard. But maybe things like this need extreme. Real satire Some subjects can not be worked out gently. <br /> <br /> Bakshi is a godless compassion. Here, the scene of Harlem is not a member or a minor. <br /> <br /> Here the characters are "real" "real", depending on the mood and status. Animated characters and humans have the same reality and should be literally taken away. <br /> <br /> Bakshi never shows ugly cartoons. He must always say it. Black face is not free. Here, unlike the "Bamboozled" of Spike Lee, it seems to try to use something. <br /> <br /> Like the 99.9% of Bakshi's films, that is, animation and live action. Usually, at the same time. Bakshki is not just gimmick here. All of this technique is intertwined, while they are tightening up while saying something. <br /> <br /> In a way, that is, it is inevitably dated. Many of these types of films (including Bakshi) have a great deal of news, for a moment it's very fast. They reflect the exact trend of that day, but a few years later, nostalgia is unmistakable (as well as private time). <br /> <br /> Even though the light, attitude, spirit and heart that seem like music, costumes, slogans and the City's time in a capsule seem to remain the same, what is in the ear. Those who have really watched the movie, the state of things and the people who have been the company I know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> Although some black characters are bunny (junglebunny), a large bear and fox. After the death of a policeman, Harlem is a policeman who is involved in the "dirty bag of dirty bag" Harlem, but for him, he is not a business, he is not a shield, but a sadistic racist, who is black. /> <br /> The father and his wife's sequence are one of the most moving pieces in the whole film, many of which play an opera or ballet. <br /> <br /> Promotion line: NOTE: "This movie is all damaged They can not! "This is not a hype. Be careful. <br /> <br /> Dane Youssef warns you ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
