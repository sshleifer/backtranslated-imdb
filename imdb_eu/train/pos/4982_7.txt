I love the movie "Diaper Baby"! Today you can not do such a movie and it is a richly cinematic story. It's Goofy and the movie was made to make it laugh, that is, it's done. How never did the kids ever "act" never know. I think they are precious and the kids laugh, but others who did this film, who showed up at the beginning of the decade. It should be remembered that the film industry was very young, the stock market was broken, the whole world began to depression, and these films were taken for the rest of the real world. Watching the five-centime movies exceed my understanding, but it's also a 25-cents dinner. It's been a different time in a different way.
