Robert Stack never won the best Oscar because Oscar missed Kyle's "Written on the Wind" for Anthony Quinn's 12-minute "Voice for Life" film. The stack is a deep alcoholic son of an oil manger. Mitch lived with her life, when he played with her in the shadow of her friend, when played by Rock Hudson. They love two women, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken slut who is in love with Mitch. Their story works in a bright color, under the direction of Douglas Sirk, the incredible film that really mastered the melodrama field, such as "Imitated Life," "All Heaven," "Beautiful Obsession, and many others." <br /> Do not make any mistakes - this is a potboiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone make the most of their most important role, winning the Best Actress Malone Oscar. There is a stunning scene that is mentioned in other comments, where his father falls and dies on the stairs dancing with loud music. We think that Maryle, with all the gas pumped, sleeps. Because Mitch is in love. Mitche has nothing to do with it. Lucy is so passionate about Kyle's loyalty as to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation. Certainly, I would doubt that I would like to get there today. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hudson and Bacall have lesser roles here. Hudson's Mitch is Kyle's Cleaner. It is due to life, and Bacall Mitchen is a woman who is in a nightmare, because her husband drinks again for a year. Sirk focuses on protective players. <br /> <br /> In the hands of Sirken "Written on the Wind" is an effective film, and the great scene at the end of the house is especially exciting. The director had a gift for this type of film, and despite many imitations, it was never the same.
