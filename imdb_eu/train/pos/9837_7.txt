Zombi 3 has an interesting story. First of all, Fulci's Zombi 2 is a succession, as Zombi 2 is itself a marketer. The band was followed by the follow-up of Zombi, George A. Romero's Dawn. Pretty confusing Basically, one of the movies does not have anything to do with others, but who cares for money. I think that Fulci is not responsible for production when he decides to fall into the middle of Zombi. Bruno Mattei brought on the table a long stretch of extras for extras. <br /> <br /> The plot of Zombi 3 is your usual zombie rate. Scientists develop a serum on a Philippine island, and theft of the terrorist robbery, and pests are zombies. Scientists want to create an antidote while preventing the military from going unnoticed. There is also a small predicate of a DJ on the radio on how one is treated. <br /> <br /> In general, I really liked the movie. I've heard a lot of things, but I like the conversation quite enjoyable. The film seems to be a sensation of pollution, a broken military man, a man who is God, and so on. I feel like it was a serious movie at some point, but it was in a strange direction, surely when Mattei was packed. <br /> <br /> In addition to removing attacks by other zombies, Romero recalled The Crazies. You hear a good new Radio DJ: "When you see men and gas masks when you see men, run these help." This is, of course, white zombies that face white figures. Later, they steal a scene from Crazies directly, where an untidy regular person dies. <br /> <br /> Still, the gore factor is pretty good in every corner of the zombie corner. How cool Let me count on ways 1? Zombie Birth 2. Zombie Head Flying 3. Zombie Birds. 4. Zombies swim in the pool with wings. My favorite area was the Manicha manned by gas station. It was a bad butt and almost ruined the whole building trying to kill a girl. <br /> <br /> Favorite mention ?? When a subscriber asks for a zombie to be burned, scientists ask: "Do you think that ashes get into the air once it falls to the ground and it will infect it?" Sargeant boldly replied: "Now you're talking about science fiction." Scientists also said "science fiction", when they all died. <br /> <br /> Additionally: He emphasized the Gallery, Trailers and Interviews, especially with Mattei, where he directed. 40% of the scenes, but they do not remember which details or any other important details. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: See for zombies and Fulci lovers. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
