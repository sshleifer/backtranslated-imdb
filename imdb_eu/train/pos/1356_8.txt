I started to watch The Apprentice about 4 years ago (perhaps 5) and I really liked it. The first thing that you like about is a refreshing format, although it's similar to other realities, it's still fun. Donald Trump is also the chief judge of the host and show. The coup d'Ã©tat coupled with smart people chosen as a competitor is also appreciated. But the best part of the show is New York City. Mark Burnett may have shaken his time, but the brilliant management of cinema is that NYC looks like a character. With a brilliant camera, they combine jazz tunes with the stunning New York look. <br /> <br /> I always have students in almost 3 realities of my time (however, it's the Amazing Race number 1). But in stunning race, this show can be seen with moderation. If you continue a bit of the show, the originality of the show will be faster (in the same case as in the case of the TAR) .Star World, the television in this country, worked hard to present the show. The first three seasons were shown successively and, after 2 years, they showed the next two seasons, that is, they kept the concept fresh. <br /> <br /> In the end, you love this show, especially during the first two seasons. However, if you keep following the show, its charm will be growing faster.
