Tintin was one of my favorite heroes. I borrowed books from the school library. My favorite was "The Red Sea Sharks" - so much action and humor. <br /> <br /> This documentary was a great explanation of the development of Herge and his Tintin. He was a very filmmaker, interviewing Herge, and the personal experience of Chan's personal inspiration for his relationship with the artist. <br /> <br /> A documentary of an extremely talented and very beloved artist. . An excellent example of what has become internationally known, and millions of children worldwide (and young hearts) have brought joy throughout the world.
