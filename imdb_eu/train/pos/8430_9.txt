It's always nice to see Angela Bassett's ability to sink his teeth directly. Sometimes lively, fun, and sexy is forced by Lena, a Cape Town destroyed Cape Town, forced to leave South Africa outside. Danny Glover plays Boesman's role as a partner. Willie Jonah gives a wonderful offer to a stranger who knows the new home of Boesman and Lena. It's not often a chance to see a smart movie about adult issues. Although performed in the theater, the director John Berry (also directed by Claudine) will open the film filmed in Zinemascopen format. Things also keep an eye on the actors' creative lock and show things just like the theater. Like Diahann Carroll Claudine, maybe John Berry directed Angela Bassett for an Oscar nomination. This is definitely the movie to be searched for.
