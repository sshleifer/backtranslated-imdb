Rookie relies on the true story of a teacher at Big Lake (over 40 years old). Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a small, high school teacher and baseball coach. His team is losing ground when the team has played in league games and has doubled to 98 mph. <br /> <br /> After a sudden practice and a bet, if Jim gets his team to the region, he will try for the Major League. The movie tells Jimmy's story, which is playing in the first game. It's a great storyline and a very familiar movie. Dennis Quaid is worthy of a movie, giving an emotional performance and with the help of a great support, such as Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> The story takes a while to develop and some scenes are slow, but all work well at the end. A fun, well-shot and brilliant baseball scene. The movie is not really about the baseball, but he is looking for a man to achieve his dream. It's inspirational, it's emotional, and it's fun. I really liked it. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Rookie. Protagonists: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. 4 out of 5 stars.
