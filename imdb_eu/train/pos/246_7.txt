How can I visit Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I could not, so I rented this movie mess. <br /> <br /> I never heard about Ned Kelly and I was surprised to find out about the legend about this young man. Also, I was shocked at how this movie was. Perhaps, very late, and a four-hour movie that happened at the end of a marathon, or perhaps too slow, this story was difficult. It's not a story because it's hard but slow. Despite the slow story, Ledger and Bloom created interesting characters. <br /> <br /> It's enough to recommend it, but it's a great story about Australian history (considering how much the young country is, it's very strange and it's worth it) and the movie has some good sequences. <br /> <br /> 6/10 for historical value ... (both right ... and the only reason to see it ...))
