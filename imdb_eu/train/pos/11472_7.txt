If you look at the phenomenon that is taking place in the shooting schools, this film gave an interesting and different view of the idea. Video presented by two-man videos (I can not mention the dying people for boys or teens), the day-to-day preparation of the month (the key to the day they will attack) is trying. to present the situation to the opposite track. He seems to describe the pain they suffer, but is literally getting ready. The problem is that little emotion is given directly. Emotions were the only end to the end was expected, as expected. But until this point is reached, it's not really clear why they're planning. It's a violent story that's been reported, but it seems to contradict the film. Without damaging the movie, it was very easy to say that it was a great deal, and it was a great idea, but it's short, it's short. All directorates are amateurs to promote the concept of home video, but the story and continuity is weak. The film seems like the audience wants to decide a lot, but it does not even provide information about this event. The end is violent and not all the movies started.
