I expected to not like that. It seemed incredibly deserved and serious to me, and it would be pretty dull and sad. <br /> <br /> That's a lot better than it really is, and I found myself really enjoying myself. I do not know, as well as what I know too much about Queen Victoria, the young man married Albert, and he saddened. The sight of infuriated circumstances was brilliant; In fact, I wanted to see more of the story, and I think we can see a sequel sometime. <br /> <br /> The sight is amazing. The sets and outfits are very expensive, without being under the top and top. The play is a top note for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it was very good!
