I thought that this movie was made very well, Heath Leger was very credible and his Irish accent was perfect. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were very good and compelling. I have no idea of ​​what happened really, but sometimes it makes people what they do. Perhaps the authorities have always been corrupt and I find it interesting to say that more than 30,000 signatures had to be hanged by Ned Kelly, and maybe maybe this movie was more truthful than the first truth? In many ways he reminded me of another great Cold Mountain historical film. After all, I would highly recommend this movie and I feel very well why there is no better place in the cinema halls.
