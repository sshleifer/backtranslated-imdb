Stephane Rideau was the star of "Wild Reeds", and is one of the biggest indie stars in France. In this film, Mathieu plays with Cedric (reached with Jamie Elkaim), in a beautiful and hysterical beach. Mathieu has a close relationship with her ill mother, with her aunt and sister, with whom she has a compete relationship. Soon, both are in love. <br /> <br /> The fragmented narrative of the film - that is, today's long, splendor, and real-world glances -. - It's small. Sebastien Lifshitz does not point out the season, and the line tracking may be difficult. But paste it: the last 45-minute movies are so appealing as you can not get your eyes on the screen. Being heart-shaped and exemplary, this film plays with the movie "Beautiful Thing" as a film to be seen.
