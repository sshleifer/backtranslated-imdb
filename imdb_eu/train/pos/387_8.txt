This movie is good. It's not the best CG kung fu game, but it's pretty good. First of all, the story is really good. The whole idea of ​​the Gods is pretty cool to deal with the fallen gods with super super powers. My problem is too many characters! It was very confusing when the scene changed! Special effects were INCREDIBLE! The fighting scenes were very fast and complex. This movie creates almost all computers. The play is excellent, as expected by top players players. Ekin Cheng is a great character, a lonely character. Zhang Ziyi did nothing in my film. I thought he would have a greater part, but he fought a scene and he fled a lot. The guy, the whole army of the skull and the whole blood cloud is a very scary thing. Music is excellent. The story is for me a minimum of a series and a worthy ONE movie. There are too many stories in 2 hours. Perhaps if there was a book or something, I would continue with all the characters and details. This movie offers a whole story story. Every day I recommend Storm Riders.
