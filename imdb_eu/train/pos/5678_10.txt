Still we can still use Black Adder. Imagine the role of Rowan Atkinson's role in recovering the role of prime minister Hugh Laurie. Hughe is as brilliant as George George and Edmund Prince. Kenneth Connor loves the British star. Edmund says Macbeth every time. Both spies make a little action to repel evil spies. They are the most fun things to see. Of course, this brilliance and genius of comedies are not without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, but also Love Actually, the movies behind The Thin Blue Line, Four Weddings and A funeral. Black Adder is fun and almost overwhelming for television. The humor may be smart, sexy and fun. I expected Saturday Night Live last night that Hugh Laurie was a homage to British humor. If the SNL squad does some research, Hugh Laurie should know what treasures he was on his stage.
