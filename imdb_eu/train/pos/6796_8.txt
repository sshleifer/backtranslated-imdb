Zodiac Killer (2005) was an interesting German film director, Ulli Lommel. He has been directing, producing and collaborating in the latest production. In addition to creating an interesting movie, it's cheap. However, he achieved footage for Lommel's almost complete catalog of films. I have seen clips of Boogeyman I and II, War Birds, Wolf Tenderness, Brain Waves and Cocaine Cowboys (although Andy Warhol has done much more than this film). Although it uses a lot of ancient footage, it works well (and I would add it very creatively). The movie continues with a young man who copies the original Zodiac Killer. He also tells the writer (Ulli Lommel) who wrote about the murderer of the series in the early sixties and early 1970s. Writer's friend (David Hess) has helped to find this zodiac. Can not stop this killer? Will the writer put two or both together to claim his former glory? Is David Hess still a man? You must see the zombie killer. <br /> <br /> This film is not about the original Zodiac killer. I've also heard people crying about this movie being filmed on videos. So what. The director's former school artistic style shot a video. My only complaint was the use of material from the first film by Herr Lommel (but I understand why "wink" "wink"). Do not believe hype. It's a street horror movie. As a starter responsibility, this film does not glorify the murder. You liked this statement. <br /> <br /> Recommend for fans of Ulli Lommel.
