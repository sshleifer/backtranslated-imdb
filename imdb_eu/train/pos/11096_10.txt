Based on Elmore Leonard, the action movie is violent and intelligent. The story: a businessman crosses three criminals. Roy Schieder has done a great job with John Glover, a leading character and a credit special, who plays like a psychopathic naughty. I must admit that the characters of the evil are very complex and interesting - something very rare for the action of the film. Some beautiful and sexy women are also featured - it's more pronounced for young Kelly Preston Schieder's character. Vanity gives a very good look and appearance to the three blackmailers. I'm glad Ann-Margaret has not missed saying ... this lady is true. Do not look at the rate of this film. I really do not know that people and some critics fight against this film, but I can not ignore my suggestion and watch the movie really vibrant and humble. You can enjoy it, that's the promise. Recommended A +.
