This is what I call the breeding film. At the end of each character is different and better, and because a woman knows the place they choose, it is a "love chain". Josie Lawrence, the most popular comedy, really is a woman who brings these changes all the time. The men in this movie also go to the more self-centered men. The book has been a very true novel since, as I am in the book, it is a plus in my book. A breath of landscapes and a message of love that is authentic.
