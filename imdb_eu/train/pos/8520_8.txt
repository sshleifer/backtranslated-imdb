I thought the movie was pretty good. I enjoyed the play and it was a good move. The director seemed to really mean the story. I have to see a great budget today, it's obviously much more money, but it's been a very good watch. When you watch a movie like this, you need to consider a small budget when you are watching. Some things may be better, but most are linked to the budget. The performance was pretty good with F / X and stunts well done. It was a fancy guy who played two different cameras. And the boy played the boy. This kind of film has continued to work on LA, and that has been a success.
