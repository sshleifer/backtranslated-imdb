In murder in Mesopotamia, I have always been one of the best books of Poirot, which is very terrible and has a simple ending. Without a doubt, the adaptation of television is strikingly visually appealing, with beautiful photos and musical scores. As always, Suchet is as sharp as David Hercule Poirot. In this episode, Poirot fought a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser Hastings was pretty naive. The rest of the episodes activates the decent performances, but to make two dark beats unattended, Christie is in some danger. Some of the episodes were terribly terrifying, just like the section of Five Little Pigs as a tragic episode, I enjoyed it much more than this. Especially incredible music aside, Louise Leidner saw her face as she saw it from the window. On adaptation, he was faithful to the book, but I would not say that I did not like three things. The main problem was to slow down, it was slow, and there were some very few scenes. I did not like it for Joseph Mercato to become a killer. In the book, I only saw nervousness, but the intervention of the idea of ​​being a murderer, and under development, became a more attractive character, although I'm glad I did not lose his drug addiction. . (I noticed that writers also suspected that the killer will be the next victim when the Market Market came out of the story). This was not so amazing that it was another thing that I felt was more. If the adaptation was effective in the face of Amy Leatheran, Amy thought it was more sensitive in the book. In general, despite the wrong resolutions on behalf of the writers, I hate Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
