This is about a mad scientist who creates a half-shark, who writes half-man to a crypt on an island, then collects all his old and academic businesses to see his birth (an evil laugh) but he really wants to kill his sharks. ! Bad GCI, bad items on the plot, and children who sweat tight shirts. <br /> <br /> All the monster films follow in a similar formula, but this is what makes things humorous (I guarantee). People who did this had some tongue-in-cheeked cheeks, without mentioning the sexy kids. But mention these fake protections, hot babes, in tight t-shirt, sweaty. The initial one is on top of the other, at the end another. Thank you, thank you, the makers of the film! The plot has a curious thing to do, one guy drives on a jeep, he gets into a tree on his right and offers flying from all the islands in a helicopter. Yes, yes, how we thought about it; we'll come back for you. The shark is the horny one - a comedian with a scary CGI or a rubber band. The mad scientist gives a fairly good performance; He is evil, that is his motivation, he does not pardon. <br /> <br /> Generally, stupid, if you want a movie FUN B, that should be done.
