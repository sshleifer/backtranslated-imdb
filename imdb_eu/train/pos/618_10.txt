This movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> "I was enchanted", I should say, and I was surprised how it was done. Cast, sequencing, effects ... everything! Great! I mean, it was a love story, but it was a remarkable way of saying that it was a fun and healthy way. <br /> <br /> For me, it's a representation of modern fairy tales. . It's like Peter Pan modern ... just amazing. <br /> <br /> I'd probably buy a copy of it at the time it was put on the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is really double. one...!!!! For these 10 stars!
