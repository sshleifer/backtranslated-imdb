A year ago, I was watching television news when I was told a story about a zombie movie recorded around me. Since then I have paid special attention to the production of 'Fido' at the end of production and at festivals. Two weeks ago Fido started playing in my theater place. Yesterday, I read a newspaper article that Fido does not restrict publicly to a limited edition, except our local theater. In fact, here are all the other shows of Paramount Theat, including 300. Of course, this is meaningless, because many people on the screen want to see the city or make a zombie make-up. And all the other citizens that have not seen Fido, but if they take it into account, I can say that there are many images on the screen, from school to park and until prohibited area. Actually, the Okanagan Valley looks great. That's a beautiful landscape in a zombie movie! However, Fido himself is a very good movie. Yes, in spite of errors, it's better to play in other 20 movies in my local market. Fido is best described as a section of Lassie, where he replaced a member of the collie killed. The premise is clear. And the film continues even further with the advantage of the 1950s, playing McCarthism as a paranoid cold war. In addition, George Romero is built on the basis of the zombies that he had introduced on the day of the dead. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> He wants a zombie officer like every other home in his block. However, his father (Dylan Baker) is against this idea as he once had to kill his 'zombie father'. In the end, the family has acquired a "Fido" zombie (it plays Billy Connolly) and lives with the undead. Billy Connolly was an inspirational source. Fido's confusion, longing, hatred, and loyalty have only been transmitted by the eyes, only heavy and bumpy bodies. Connolly shows that they interpret better than smaller characters than commercial people. This is his best Mrs. Roland Brown. <br /> <br /> Fido continues with Shawn Of The Dead and Zombie Honeymoon, such as Shawn Of The Dead and others. Bruce Campbell and Misty Mundae are not only those who value more than those of Eli Roth and Jigsaw, but I also like humor for my fear. However, I understand Fido's criticism of horror fans who do not have enough 'dead killing'. However, I am sure that the viewers of the patient will be rewarded with humorous films. <br /> <br /> The film divides it into the third act. As writers seemed to have picked up a nice premises in the 1950s, the arch of the story was forgotten. However, I'm interested in horror comedy and I watch it on my neighbor's screen, and I value Fido from 9th to 10pm.
