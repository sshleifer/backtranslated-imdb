I enjoyed this movie in general, but there are four things that really stand out: Sam Raim's perfect comic by timing and performance (?) Man, Alan Arkin's wonderful character and, above all, cinematography. The outer scene, the beautiful shades of gold that fit into the film as the sunset of the lake's lake, I enter into my summer memories. <br /> <br /> Conversation and a very natural and compelling mood. Some reviewers criticize the "deepest" script. For me, this movie is working. Characters and their problems seem real and that's why I take care of it. <br /> <br /> In the end, they think that all the parts are felt correctly.
