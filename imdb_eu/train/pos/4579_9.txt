I think this movie was reasonable. Oddly enough, now, Olsen's twins are 13 and all boys and girls have. When they were little children at home they liked it a lot. However, it was good casting and the movie was a little bit fun. I shuffled between the places of change and names. It's Take Two is an older version.
