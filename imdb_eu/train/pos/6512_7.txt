My baby was a fan of fans, so I've seen a lot of episodes growing. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo, so I do not know why I left this TV show this year. It seemed to me a delight for my surprise. Shaggy and Scooby, the only interesting character for me, * rejects tomatoes for the fans of others *. So I like only two likes. However, fans of original shows may hate it. I like voice theater, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I liked Jeff Bennett before I even heard him. And Jim Meskimen Robi feels to me that he really enjoys me as an actor. I also get some tricks with their little autistic personalities, play Dungeons and Dragons or perform the Star Wars scene (of course, these names do not call them the show).
