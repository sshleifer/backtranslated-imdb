As someone else has commented, this is the most responsive. It's a great landscape and Luciano's voices! I've seen this movie often and I saw it again in the afternoon. I've forgotten how much I missed the song by Pavarotti Nessun Dorma and I need to get the CD! It's a wonderful movie, in the afternoon, having fun and fun. Eddie Albert is great as an agent and a bit higher, but all of the agents are still there. The Italian landscape is beautiful, but there is nothing to climb up from the dump to get a perfect view. If you need to make Olivier a proportion, the movie is not for you. If you want a fantastic flight and great music, watch this movie. Enjoy!
