About My Folks The thing is excellent relationships. First of all, the adult son and his father, but also with his wife, sisters and his mother. He has written a semi-autobiographical film about Paul Reiser's relationship with his father. The movie is funny, energetic and thoughtful. My husband and my adult son reviewed my relationship. Peter Falk is the father of Paul. The mission could not be better thrown. I hope that Falk and Reiser are recognized for the next year's film awards. Falk his screenplay and Reiser for his screenplay.
