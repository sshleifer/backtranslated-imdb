First and foremost, I would like to point out that people who have criticized this film have made mistakes. The lower score below 6/10 is nonsense. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie with amazing movies. The actors are very credible, the creative narrative of thought and the fear and graphic content are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of mysticism in this movie. There are many questions that arise in view of the strange and horrible creature that inhabits the dark rocks in dark tunnels. How was 'Craig' created and what happened? <br /> <br /> An awesome fantasy movie. An unanswered question and a movie, 28 Days Later, The Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch movie to be considered. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to these fantastic movies!
