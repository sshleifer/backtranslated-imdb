DIG! fun, funny, fun, interesting, elegant and very well made. For more than 7 years, knowing how to make a subtle budget, it is amazing that this story can be told, especially with this style and substance. If you are a fan of music or a documentary, you have to watch it. <br /> <br /> It's a great way to show the contrast between Brian Jonestown Masssacre and The Dandy Warhols in a decent band. Moderate success, sustainability and commitment, and rich megalomaniable skills, a collection of many characters that have sabotaged through their own success through drugs, alcohol and insanity. I do not know it's a footage of real people, I swore it was very well written and imaginative. The story is compelling, short and simply amazing.
