Eight simple rules began as an entertaining series. I love John Ritter and Paul Hennessey, and his relationship with children was the best part of the show. <br /> <br /> Always Kerry likes Bridget, before doing Bridget, quite enough Kerry and I can relate it in many ways, although I'm not sure his characters like the series more like the direction. <br /> <br /> The first episodes were fun, disciplining the good teenagers of Paul and Cate. However, I think children seem to have lost their show when John Ritter died. I wanted to follow the series and I admired the group, but when I died, I felt the program. For me, the show's point was based on the simple 8-letter guide for teenage girls. A real man, whose teenage daughters wrote and changed the importance and angle of the show without Hennessey father. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I think that my grandfather is fun (especially if he is watching a great flight) but I think that C.J is not a show. The piece is fun, but the lines of that time arrived seemed similar to other American comedies. More than just the most recent ones are not bad exceptions, and someone finds it angry that Cate works in school and C.J and his grandfather are always there? I would always recommend this show to my friends, because it was very strong at the beginning and it was well worth it for Paul and Kerry, but later they were mostly average.
