Robert Mitchum is the star of Clint Tollinger, a short but hardcore West: Man With The Gun. Tollinger is a popular professional country, when a country needs to keep itself; they are to be done. Tollinger's latest concert is an accident: entering the city, looking for an ancient flight, a western gangster falls into a town that plays as a puppet. However, many people start to hire Tollinger the day they start, because the way people clean themselves (they suddenly seem like the original High Plains Drifter). <br /> <br /> Man With the Gun begins as a fabulous western movie, but it is increasingly surprised as the movie progresses. The unforgettable and winding mill is over, the dark character and the centered character. The entire film is very well shot and cast is very nice. Mitchum is his usual excellence here at Man with The Gun - it's not one of his best performances, Mitchum still has its classical and effective heavy-type display presence in high gear and action-packed, meaningful, and amazing blows on scenes. movie out of the park Man With The Gun Mitchum is a pretty western and is easily worth it.
