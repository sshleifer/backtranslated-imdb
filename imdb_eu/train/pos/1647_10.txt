Excellent. The pioneer of the Western plains is the real and true life of the ranch, emphasizing women's role and place. A mobile film, made with love, based on real people and their real experiences. Low budget independent film; never made any money. Without a doubt, Hollywood's pioneering life is a romantic and realistic version.
