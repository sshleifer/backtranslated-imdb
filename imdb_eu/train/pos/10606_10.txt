I watched this film and ended it very enjoyable. It's a quiet and small film that will not give you any special or "great" impact. You only have the lives of people living in a small farm in the North Carolina forest. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas gives a good performance to Raymond Toker, a solitary young man who finds himself alone in an abandoned baby. Toker will find the parents of the child, which will have a great impact throughout his life. David Srathairn plays with Truman Lester. David plays the perfection. <br /> <br /> This movie adds a lot more to the first eye. Located north of North Carolina and filmed with the wonderful soundtrack of traditional music.
