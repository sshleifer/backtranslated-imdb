As wild as some of Takashi Miika's subsequent films are not a crime drama. <br /> <br /> The basic story is the story of a police Japanese police, trying to get a Chinese mafia out of Chinese parents. Relative things play a younger brother as a lawyer for the wicked and his gang. The movie is really much more complicated, it has many complications, which keep things interesting and also warns about the central narrative. This is a complication and loss of about an hour this film is less than a short film (very good). That is definitely worth it, especially if you do not mind a sharp rhythm. /> <br /> The warning word, the violence that occurs is an explosive and evil. They are also graphic representations of gay sex. If this is not your cup of tea, follow carefully. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 out of 10.
