Stargate SG-1 is part of the 1994 "Stargate" movie. I'm glad I decided to extend this topic. Shows progress from the first section. A retired Jack O'Neill must cross the door to meet his old friend Daniel Jackson. Among the first two episodes, we will discover that Samantha Carter is no one over herself, and it is Teal'c, who joins the calm and team-mate who defies his false god. <br /> <br /> The main bad guys are called Gouald, they are parasites that can be inserted into one's brain, thus controlling and doing evil acts. With a great deal of power, Goualde is often considered a "System Lord". The guards behind the Goualda are called Jaffa, as the Gouald parasites retain themselves in their body, until Goualde is involved in a person's brain. <br /> <br /> During episodes, we see SG-1, above all. The exploration group, composed by Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam, immediately crosses worms (they are transferred to other devices (this device is called Stargate) and new or bad cultures appear. This is what Stargate does not go through in the section, and deals with issues on Earth issues. <br /> <br /> Over the course of the year, the decline of SG begins. -1 group is a close link and the character construction story, which, at the same time, It also understands bigger episodes around the world, which is completely understandable. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- While there is some of the best part of this show, there are some examples of story lines. Gathering and paying less attention to travel the door in recent years. But still, higher science fiction!
