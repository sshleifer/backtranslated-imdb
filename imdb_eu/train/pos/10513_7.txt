If you have any idea about the production of Jane Austen, she will now repeat on her every novel: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion, all the films in his novels are boring, but I like the characters of Austen, who all have some personalities and phrases, as well as repeating them as Emma. Emma is doing well with Gwyneth Paltrow, who is very good at staking. Also, each character in the movie does not seem to be able to think anything about it, so that the couple does not get married and get married, the movie is fun.
