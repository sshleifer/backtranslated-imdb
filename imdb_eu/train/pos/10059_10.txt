This movie is the best movie ever. I can not remember the movie that tears me last time. Tearing my eyes, I admire this movie. A good movie has all the elements that it contains: Excellent Interviews, Music, Seminar, Story / Plot. A story about friendship, bravery, kindness and loyalty, the girl who sold out the street with the famous King of Masks and sold him as a boy to a serf bazaar. Little girl liked being her grandson and the king of Mascara liked her a grandson. They were not really usual. All the scenes that were together were not worth it. Camera work is perfect and you're injured. The play is inspired. Xu Zhu Bikain was the King of Mask. Zhou's "Doggie" looks pretty much like his character has played very well. Zhigang Zhao Liang Sao Lang was great. He played a very nice and friendly character. If you do not have this movie, try once, see.
