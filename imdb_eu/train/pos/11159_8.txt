It's a wonderful movie ... The first impressions of cynicism and severity soon vanish most of the deepest motivations of men and women through an entertaining fun (Vive la difference!) <br /> <br /> You can love people and sometimes their weaknesses. Humans are really rough, but we have great hearts and we try, despite the temptation. It is not our fault that occasionally temptation can not be tackled, that's just who we are. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end it is elegant; Crispy photography and sharp composition, when you see that it is very pleasing to content, a good music and scripts. <br /> <br /> Be careful with the young "wise voice" ... excellent; wisdom balancing on a human comedy by innocence.
