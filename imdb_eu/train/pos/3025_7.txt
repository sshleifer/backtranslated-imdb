Bacale does well, especially considering his second movie. This is often included among the biggest hits: "To Have and To Have Not" (1944) and "The Big Sleep" (1945), both with Humphrey Bogart. This one is not matched with other films, but I think it's because of its fault. I think there was some discomfort when I was portraying a British woman with a high-crust woman. There's no accent. I think that all strange accents are being forgotten - Boyer was not a Spaniard. It was difficult to find out where the people in the country were. <br /> <br /> I really liked black and white cinematography. Mood's great effect is used - especially like the mood scene. Lighting also works to add intrigue and stress. <br /> <br /> Bakall is beautiful. Boyer does not adapt to the romantic behavior he has with me, so he and Bacall together were strangely. There is no great chemistry, and certainly no Bogie and Bacall magic. But I still liked this picture. There is a lot of voltage and good movement. I have to say that for a casual movie I found a pretty courageous little girl murder. <br /> <br /> <br /> Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre are cast. The manager of the hotel, Paxinou, is very bad and bad at his portrayal. One of his scenes, maniacly laughed by Mr. Muckerji as he showed off the child's killer, after appearing as the child's killer, is very disturbing. Lorre performs quite well in the Conteras snake portrait, a cowardly coward. Wanda Bendrix does well for the portrait of her child, especially when she was 16 at the age of 16, although she is much younger. It turns out later he married Auie Murphy, which proved a short, tempestuous marriage to life.
