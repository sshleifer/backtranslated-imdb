It's the best comedy I've ever seen! But everyone does not understand that you have to be Georgia to understand this amazing movie! :) the best movie I've seen in general ......... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all the supporting actors who play very well, but with the performance of Kote Daoshvili (Germogel's father), I think it's best to work on paper. historical film :)) Many American films include the Xvichia, Zakariadze, Sofiko chiaureli, Verkoan Djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, Dodo Abashidze, ... in this movie. All of them are stars of the Georgian stars :) Evgeni Leonov, a great Russian star, and the director of the film Georgy Danelia, of course, is the director of this film, I recommend this movie for everyone, but you must remember a good Russian language to watch this movie.
