I rented this movie from the video tape and I really liked it. I can buy DVDs a few weeks ago and have watched them several times since then. I should be in agreement with other municipalities, saying that the Indian Summer was a nostalgic film. When I see it again I would be 10-14. I think that's why I like the movie somehow. Sometimes, we want to live our children as the wisdom and knowledge of minors. Should not all your friends and parents be young? Do not have to worry about your job, have a parent, etc.? I know I'd like to get into De Lorean and I'd like to go back in time. While I enjoyed the movie, my favorite film of my time camp, they are meatballs with Bill Murray. I want to make an Indian Summer version.
