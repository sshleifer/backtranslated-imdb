Terry Gilliam offers a wonderful movie. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and even the small look of Christover Plummer, the movie is absolutely excellent! I've seen Terry Gilliam the only movie, and Twelve Monkeys is definitely the top 10. In my opinion, this is Bruce Willis's four best films; and the best Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt offers a great performance. Perhaps one of the ten best actors I have ever seen. His role (Geoffrey) was played very clearly. The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was quite credible. Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt played incredibly well. Great storytelling with great performances. and thus, excellent management of Terry Gilliamen.
