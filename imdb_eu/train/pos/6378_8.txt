Atlantis: The best and most animated animation of any of the Disney movies I've ever seen in the Lost Empire. And I think in the first 15 minutes. I especially like Don Novello's voices about Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris with Joshua Strongbear Sweet. It is very bad that the movie seems to be appropriate for a double rhythm, at least in the first stage. An important part of any movie in Disney, Atlantis is an unpleasant antagonist. It is usually the average. The film is half-way round. That's all. Anyway, it's an excellent movie. Everyone should check.
