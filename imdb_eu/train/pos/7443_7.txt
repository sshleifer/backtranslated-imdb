An old word says, "If you have problems, visit the hospital." Over the last few years, it has been updated "If you have problems, a TV show ... especially for Jerry Springer!" The movie is so bad, it's good! That's why I gave it to seven, it's okay, but not great. It's a great way to lose it in 95 minutes, the daily talk show "You will never return an hour of your life!" As it is predicted. The topics we know here are ... husbands / friends, wildest television audiences, Flashing Jerry, etc. The blow at Molly Hagan, usually considered to be a sweet character ("Seinfeld" and "Herman's Head"). trailer-trash mom and Jaime Pressly ("My Name Is Earl") as her daughter, as well as trashy, makes her sexual favors with almost any contact with her. Men (including the worker's producer) were presented as essential lunkhead, what they got. I do not want to ruin or show everything, but the movie is like a show on a daily basis. In Phoenix, it is shown in the morning and two hours, and then everything seems to be pale. Once again, I give this movie seven ... it's good but not great. The best Jerry Springer must be taken at an average dose of one hour.
