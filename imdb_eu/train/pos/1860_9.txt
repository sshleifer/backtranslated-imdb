I saw Antone Fisher unexpectedly, and was pleasantly surprised. Derek Luke's plays were outstanding and the story was brilliant. Of course, Denzel Washington directs his good work and correct habit. You realize that you can help people in mental minds and this movie is an excellent example. Do not miss this.
