There's no point, 12 points, decision points. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn is a bench banker in the bank that has filmed about world heavyweight. Flynn adapts to Corbett's soft but surprising thoughts. However, his rival John Sullivan continues the murmur of old school by Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film is a man who favors his great opportunity. Corbett leaves his daily life and builds a new character by Gentleman Jim. Jim is capable of adapting to any social environment. It's a lie and a lie. Sullivan's heavyweight boxing champion is a simple brute mode, but contrasts his honesty and sport with the main character. <br /> <br /> There are many activities and enthusiasm and a great recovery for all. And Errol Flynn gets the girl.
