This is one of the best films I have ever seen. It takes me on a rolling coffin of emotions. I laughed and weeping and happy and in love! All this in two hours! <br /> <br /> The cast are excellent! Michael Nyquist is the main actor. It works great! Also, I admire the actress Tore, who plays so strongly in a mentally challenged young man! Gilbert Grape's Leonardo di Caprios reminded me! And then there's the most beautiful song in the world: Gabriella's s√•ng. <br /> <br /> I recommend all of this to see and enjoy!
