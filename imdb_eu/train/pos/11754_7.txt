Robin Williams does his best to combine comedy and patheticism, but it's a little bit out. Donald Moffat has forgotten his father-in-law. Jeff Bridges is brilliant, however, as a quarterback, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are wonderful, bringing the movie through the most rude spots. It's a good time, but much more than that.
