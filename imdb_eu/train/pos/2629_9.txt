I did not know how it was coming out of it. I was thinking of how Disney was getting it. I was wrong. It seemed very good to me. I mean, it's not the Lion King, but it's good to see it from one point to another. It was very fun. One of those rigid disney sequels that sucked the animation was like Lion King's animation. The only thing that gave me the whole movie theater movie. I do not want to give anything, but you know what I'm talking about. It was also fun to return the cool cast of the original. It was a very good movie.
