Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Friels, Alice Garner, Chrissie Amphlett and Michael Caton ... what else can you ask for? Based on the novel by Monkey Grip, Nora (Hazlehurst, Jobe (Friels), a heroine who falls for an addict) explores the Monorja Grip. A simple story is great (especially Noni Hazlehurst) and the use of a small budget. It's the only mistake (if you can receive it) that the story is set in Melbourne, even for budgets, because the movies shot mostly in Sydney, so in a few scenes. tram (Melbourne scenes) and then a Carlton office (Sydney scenes). Among other things, "Monkey Grip" must be seen inevitably (unforgettable, but) the "Play" School and "Better Homes & Gardens" presenter at Noni Hazlehurst at least the former play "theater play". <br /> <br /> 10/10
