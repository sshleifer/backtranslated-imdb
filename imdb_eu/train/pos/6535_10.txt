The movie was great! I was there only about 15 people, I was there, but it was great! My friend and I laughed. My mother also enjoyed it. There were two middle-aged women in the middle of the 20-year-old who seemed to enjoy it. I like the part that likes Corky and Ned Nancy, and they fill it with beautiful lol. And he gets his roadster and Ned is there. Yes, it was a great movie, even though the people unexpectedly underestimated it. Go Let's see what you like !! I really enjoyed it and my friends too. <br /> <br /> This was a very hard person in this movie and they did not see it. The next movie will be given a chance for the movie and actors. I think they did a great job. If young children are still good. I'll probably take my 7-year-old nephew.
