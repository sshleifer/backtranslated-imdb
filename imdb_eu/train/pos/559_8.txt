A short film, at that time, an intense, widespread, quite obscure story, just like John Ford's "The Searchers". The story begins quickly and does not leave scenes with good conversations (Stewart) between Jeff Webster, Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This movie, in other words, remembers "Bend of the River" (1952), a Mann-Stewart work, but much less sensitive and more interesting. There are several warnings: the end of the fastest (and rather the end of the feeling); 24-year-old Corrine Calvert is not very French and does not convince a naughty teenager, and of course, the film is in the Western myth, because fable and national laws are not applicable. But they are mere concerns. James Stewart is surprisingly good, he thinks he's not as good as a dark man and a disappointment, and the mountain landscape can not be beat. Elegant Western Costume
