The movie was great! It was an excellent interpretation of an ancient myth. The animation was pretty curious, but Disney has nothing new. Certainly, a Disney movie was better than the song unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> The back animation was magical. Disney's work level was different. Some of the characters were a small picture, but they joined the landscapes and beauty of the landscape. Music was largely instrumental, but this was a great movie. Without a doubt, this was not a movie that needed characters to be. <br /> <br /> Perfect. 10 to 10
