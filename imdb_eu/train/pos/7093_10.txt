You have to pay attention to Twelve Monkeys, but if you do that, you will find it. I know The story is interesting and time travels. A virus killed many people in 1997, and a man named Cole (Bruce Willis) has returned to the healing of the virus from 1990 to 1996. He was arrested in 1990 and entered into a mental hospital. He knows Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), something related to the virus. In 1990, Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) did not even have a psychiatrist. However, when Cole goes to the mental hospital, she is chained and locked in the room and Kathryn begins to believe in Cole's stories. br /> <br /> The movie is playing all the time. Cole makes a phone call and in 1996 sends a message, he receives it in the future and sends it "someone". Cole someone only appears after a phone call. Such things happen during the film, so you have to keep in mind. You can ask questions, but you can not answer yourself, in other words, accept the movie. <br /> <br /> 'Twelve Monkey works as a science fiction, with excellent images and a dark atmosphere. It works as a thriller. You are never sure what will happen and what helps the movie. It may have some mistakes in the story, but it's about fictional things, because it's like to travel in time, and you just have to enjoy what the movie is saying. That has been easy for me.
