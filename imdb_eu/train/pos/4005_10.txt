Although I thought it would be gradually becoming a graduate, I have to do a great job of explaining the sexual desires of a older woman. <br /> <br /> I'm glad this is a British film, which Hollywood never got, and if it were, they would not break their time of developing characters. <br /> <br /> The story is slowly and truly revealed. The play is excellent, the characters are in error and the conversation is sensitive. Several times I tried to predict what would happen, and I was always wrong, so I was very captivated by the story. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. And I have to admit, I look for my mother forever in a different light!
