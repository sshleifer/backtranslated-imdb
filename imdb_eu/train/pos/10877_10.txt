I watched this movie with some friends, and only two, even though we were going to film ourselves, they thought about cinema, others laughed and commented how stupid it was. Well, this is not so serious that it is basically a film that removes horror films and works well. It seems that another movie also emerges, such as ... Scary Movie ?? Well, that is, Aussie, and the original !!! Jessica Napier overloaded and Sarah Kants has a bright future among the cast! I hope to see more of them. Molly Ringwald was a good move, and Kylie moved better. The princess was impossible to be the queen of the screen! I recommend watching this flick, with Raffy, Hilary, and the movie that had not finished 20 years ago until the end.
