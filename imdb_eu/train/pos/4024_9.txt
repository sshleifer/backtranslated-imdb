I liked this movie very much. He invented me before he guessed it. One of the best films I've watched. Urmila Matondkar is also beautiful. It's one of the most personal and mobile movies I've ever seen on partition. It's much smaller than Gadar, and you start a rolling coaster with a mountainous opinion, and on the other hand you get completely out. This is not a typical bollywood dish, but an art-house movie. The best part of this movie is not part of the partition conflict to dehumanize the story of another. It does not blame or punish you, but it allows you to take things out of your own.
