Audiard, with Read My Lips, is a strange and lonely thriller, curious and curious. Vincent Cassel's charisma is a generosity that is generous and has a wonderful performance by Emanuelle Devos. Devos is a recurring feature of Audiard, with Jean-Pierre Jeunet as KArin Viard explains: necessarily beautiful (which is very popular in this film), versatile and subordinate profile. <br /> </ br> This is the definition of Carla, almost the definition of her function, the colleagues who exploited her deceitry was astonished by the office dogs. However, he finds an euputation, if you like, with the old Paul of Cassel. Each one exploits the unusual habits of others (reading robbery and lips) that fight through their situations and create a romantic habit. Devos / Audiard manages the delicacy of Carla and her bright inner world, elegant and majestic elegance. <br /> <br /> In this film (2001), Audiard is already clearly under control of his voltage, action and his frame. Experience really ashes, which will become a success - Prophet A - nine years later. 7/10
