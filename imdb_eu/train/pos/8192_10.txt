This two parter was great - since the series came back. From the previous film, there were good bits in history, but television programs do not do those days. Here's a good science fiction story. A great (truly awesome) monster arrested at the foot of a deep pit, emerging from The Ood's exquisite aliens, has emerged as the newest "new" series of resurrected aliens, basically sympathetic and credible human (whole set) "Trained" unnamed names Star Trek mode), some great philosophical issues (love, loyalty, faith, etc.) and special high-relief drawings of special effects. <br /> <br /> I loved each minute.
