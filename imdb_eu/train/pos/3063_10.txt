The first director (Bromell) has assembled a small but powerful theater that combats with middle age, middle class, depression, and his father. In less than 90 minutes this film contrasts with human nature is very interesting. David Dorfman, William H. Macy's 6-year-old son, is a little actress I've seen for a while. Macy is considered to be the only one who has been tortured to break the roots of his father and his business. It's always wonderful to see Donald Sutherland and here's the father of Macy's father. Pel√≠culle deserves an alternative audio track to inform the director of what he has shot in the locations and the film. The basic dolby 2 channel sound is suitable for this film and is well engraved. Cinematography is a very subtle musical mood. Any filmmaker with a human nature will enjoy it, especially if he is a fan of contradiction.
