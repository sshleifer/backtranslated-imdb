As I have noticed much of the commentary on the IMDb, some reviewers seem to see that all the films that watch out for those who do not have intelligent plots boost their wisdom. I'm not one of them. If I see an action movie, I want to see explosions, shooters and heroes. If I see a comedy, laughter seems to be tears in my eyes. You get an idea. So I'm afraid of watching a horror movie. Grudge is a very horrifying movie, both well-executed and awesome images. For several years I have been a fan of horror fans and I'm talking about masters like Dario Argento, but rather some of the most brilliant horror films that are dancing these days. If you want to be afraid, watch this movie. Japan's 'Ring' is more meaningful than the original ones (I think it's an excellent movie too).
