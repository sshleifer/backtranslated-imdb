The flock is "as a bit" a detrimental sign. There's really no reason to compare them, except perhaps with a similar landscape with the last occurrence. <br /> <br /> Now, that is why, Flock is very interesting in some ways. Most often, it's a drama sound, more than one thriller about a social worker guardian, who keeps track of sex offenders. At first, you can clearly see that its work has improved. You will see that in both stories he talks with the first aggressor and when he tries to pick up the woman in the second and think everything about her questionnaire's standard questions. <br /> <br /> Very good is Errol Babbage, the mentioned social worker. His work is not similar to a police officer, he has a gun and newspapers and law enforcement officials constantly check if one of his "flock" information is responsible for a sexual offense. Life is also a person that has lost happiness, and its only relief seems to justify justifying its care under the responsibility. Two times you see the smile, forgiving his partner, and apologizing for his apology after losing one of his flock. <br /> <br /> As Floss does not seem to succeed. Slightly confusing and with some sharp plots, but with striking pieces. <br /> <br /> In general, Flock is a work on a man who makes drama unfeasible and eventually has to work hard. To not swallow the precipice in the vicinity. The world in which we live is a poor place and the farther a fellow is far happier. This defeat takes a good look.
