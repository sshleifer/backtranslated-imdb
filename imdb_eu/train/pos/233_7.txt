I really found this film "interesting"; At last, it's worth the time to see and rent. It's true ... some scenes are emotional, cries, etc. They were, but what the movie does not point to its agenda, genre or "ax to grind"? Hello nobody! Another reviewer from South Korea was surprised I read a review review from another review site, but his negative reviews found a more detailed description of the movie review; it's not in the movie Anyone who views this movie realizes that it is recommended for family and friends; There's no self-escape! I belong to the "family" of the Italian family, totally relating it to the environment that is on the screen. The film also includes tears. Real life is what can be in this environment. Nice movie.
