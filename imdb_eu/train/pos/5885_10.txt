This movie really surprised me. I did not have much hope, but I was wrong. Mary & Rhoda was very funny and written. They did not spend too much time past attitudes, so the success of the old, successful television movie was trustworthy. In general, it was very fun. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly weekly and I think that I agree with him.
