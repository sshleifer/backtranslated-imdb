Since I've read it, a lot of people are disappointed with this movie. Part 1. I could first understand it, but I think they are going to be wrong. Soderbergh continues to report Che's life, starting in part 1. Part 1 began telling the story of a revolution that was a successful success from the initial proposals from the beginning. In the second part, it tells a story about the revolution that flatters from the beginning to an endless conclusion. Soderbergh does not blame Che's two-life aspects that were completely different. He chose both courageously fairly straightforwardly. The viewer leaves a lot of film behind Part 2 behind Part 2, but this is the reality of Che's life and I do not think the director's guilt. The movie is not perfect. It's probably too long. In part 1, at least, we saw different aspects of the war as the hostages succeeded. In part 2 we can not rest and their numbers are constantly reducing death and catches. Che's capture and death are well treated. The movie interview in Spanish has improved a lot. Benicio Del Toro is an excellent charismatic Argentinian again. If you have seen section 1, in Part 2 you will find out about a very similar story.
