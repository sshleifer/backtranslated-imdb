California is a movie about lost ideals. Travel always in the darkest way. Do not return the way. The plan is about a couple who planned to be a better life in California. Men (David Duchovny, at his best job) have written a book about celebrity crimes in America, and his girlfriend photographer takes photographs. That's why they went on the route of famous murders, without knowing what was waiting for on the way. He decides to find another couple to travel expenses and place an ad. But the pair that responds to it is not the only pair. It's one of the rarest couples ever. The girl has a lot of loves and loves cactus. Men are the opposite. Unbelievers cruel killer We learn at the beginning of the film and we continue on a California trip (not unlike Cre, but K, supposedly a killer), betrayal, murder and eventually defeat. All presentations, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes give good performances, and it should be taken into account that when they shot the movie they did not have one of them being a star. The photography is amazing, it covers the most part of the darkness, and music adjusts the dark nature of the film. In general, this movie is very good.
