They watched this night and saw the story line, the development of a great character and the good atmospheres created by all theatrical and film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < By the way, various characters and classmates who like to dance soft on the floor learn about others and themselves. <br /> <br /> The story is a preface to the symbolizing dance in Japan, so it's not so easy to learn to dance in Japan, like in the United States <br /> <br /> It is a bold movie; You will see that you will laugh at some gags in sight. However, it is a difficult way to describe it. All the characters of the film are taken seriously, however, and no one is "mistaken". <br /> <br /> I started thinking about some social dance lessons with some friends. The same thing happened when a friend gave me a video to dance. Is this synchronous? I think, that's why I really try to try it. <br /> <br /> See this wonderful family movie (little children may not get it, but definitely teenagers), and they smile at the care they show themselves again and again. <br /> <br /> Why Shall We Dance is a mystery as they would create a remake, because it's perfect.
