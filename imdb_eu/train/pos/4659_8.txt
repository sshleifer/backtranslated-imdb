Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, this can be a turkey easily. But they are great. Ustinov has the best of it, and for Maggie fans, it is very good to see her first days, with the help of Ustinov and the time. In the 1950s English (and I am in that parenthesis), it's always entertaining to watch and listen to the sounds of Swinging Sixties, and although this film often runs through the offices, it has a nostalgia of the seventies. Red buses, Carnaby Street, a song of Lulu and a micro-skirt of a sweet waiter, places that have never been seen in England in public places. I.T. Engineer, I know computer hacking tricks are sloppy, but they should not be taken seriously. There are also wonderful Italian, French and German stereotypes.
