This film animated me as a project that had the right ingredients, but on the way they did not meet together. I do not know who he did, but he feels a bit disliked by Disney. Due to the unfavorable parts of it (as the previous youths run a public office) and avoiding the seriousness of the story, there is a healthy dose of normalization (whatever) to balance things and maintain their perspective. Play is ok Curiously enough, Frankie and her grandmother are persuasive, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie a bit ... off. It is interesting how to work hard to keep the balance between his grandmother and grandmother and two passions: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player, it was very painful to try to keep a group of Frankie boys, but it does well to show off their faces. I read somewhere that he was not really a dancer, but the editing of this film was very good for the dance to look natural and beautiful. In general, he was a good movie about honesty and ambition, but his star Mischa Barton did not get a realistic level of realism in the "Lawn Dogs", "Lost and Delirious" performances, and a slight but amazing performance against him. Haley Joel Osment "The 6th Sense".
