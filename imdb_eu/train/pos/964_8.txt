"Yokai Daisenso" is Takashi Miiki's children's film, but, as you can expect, it is very dark and horrible for younger people. However, elderly children can eat well, that is, if you play in duplicate in English. <br /> <br /> The story is a young boy, who goes to live with his mother to live with the country. divorced after his grandfather In the popular festival, the boy chooses "Kirin rider" a great honor, but with that honor he has a lot of dangers and adventure. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, evil acts are women as women. White mini skirts, go boots and beehive hairs, a nasty team that joins the evil Yokai to resent people and eliminate their opposing elements. And this wickedness has emerged as a flying city as Rage City itself as the head of the Tokyo headquarters. A very entertaining scene with two derelicts watching the monsters that are flying over the city ... says: "Oh, it's only Gamera." <br /> <br /> The young boy has been helping Yokai, especially the monsters that are beneficial, away from humans, and all Yokai of Japan come together to fight evil. <br /> <br /> In many ways, Miike and the crew make their way to the Yokai movies at the end of the 60s / 70s and transform them into modern-action adventure movies ("older"), which combines some strange mechanical monster that they think of Transformers. The look of the movie is very good, the effects are entertaining, and some of the moods will navigate more than the kids' heads, but they can enjoy the older ones. For adults, you do not like it much, you're a fan of Japanese monster movies you're happy. <br /> <br /> <br /> The funny and dark thing, sometimes the darkness but maybe that's just Miike ... and what a wild ride.
