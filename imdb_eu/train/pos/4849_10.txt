In Ghost Train, it's nice for those who like the usual humor of 1940. It enters the plot of World War II, but it's not as bad as it was at the beginning, and the characters mix their roles pretty well. Askey, who plays Tommy Gander's story is bored, boring or "dragging" in pieces. <br /> <br /> The story of the Crusader's station is still wicked today. It's unique and the ways of communicating the characters are incredibly fantastic for the mystery of the Fantasy Railroad. Gander is basically annoying to all the other members, and the rest do it quite well. It is always the main attention and can be "annoyed", but they are not allowed by 1940. His humor is innocent and childhood. It's like watching. <br /> <br /> If it were not for Askey / Gander, this movie would be less action, delight and result would not be so effective. my opinion.
