After watching the movie, I saw the DVD, and I think that anyone who has seen the movie before will be very surprised and maybe disappointed. The filmmaker was one of the "Cube director" and was a horror movie, which is a quintessential comedy (IMDB's correct spelling does not seem to be a word of absurdity, but that's it), Rosencrantz and Guildernstern remind us of the dead. At first I love the story as it is slowly built, and then gradually increases. Also, I do not like the explanation of what happens in the movie. Only this and that's just the story, this movie is similar to Cube. I recommend it.
