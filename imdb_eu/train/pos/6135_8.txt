Bedknobs & Broomsticks is one of the most masterpieces of Disney. Animation and animation interact with actors and actors. (The concept similar to Mary Poppin is used when children and Mary disappear with the art of the pavement). I value this film, above all, through the eyes of the child, I have not seen it for years. Then it was my favorite movie. It was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (the conflict that began when the ghostly battle started when the army was) were my favorites. They also stopped using a lot of animations (for example, people who turn rabbits), which may be a bit stupid today. (Also, I think the movie starts to slowly start) With the eyes of the child, the movie is fun and it's easy for kids to put their children in the movie. It is an imaginary movie that is unfortunately forgotten today.
