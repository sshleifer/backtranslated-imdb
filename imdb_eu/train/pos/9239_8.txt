As mentioned in the comment in the first part: These two films are better than most of science fiction fans. <br /> <br /> The scenario on the second film does not move, as we can see, we were not the movement of human civilization, but the descendants of thousands of refugees, small cans, escaped escape from a strong, powerful space. <br /> <br /> But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story is heated, fighting Cylon to bring the planets. . Well, because Mad Max has a bit of space, the spacecraft is a fuel that travels to a far-reaching Earth, but works for me. Exciting entertainment of science fiction is good for good actors and special effects (although they are repeated, at least, say :-)). <br /> <br /> I followed the board with Starbuck and Apollo monitoring. Instead, we got a second non-secured sequence, especially since the story worked first, because the characters were so well-chosen ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So It was a small drop in 1980's production, but more than two films since 1978.
