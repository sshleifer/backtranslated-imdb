This movie was one of the classic slasher genres in the 80s, that is, the genre of all my favorite. So, when I saw that it was a Free Demand, I had to see it! Phineas Phine (his wife died!), Dracula AD 1972, the Golden Voyage of Sinbad, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, Spy, he loved me, Maniac, and it's unknown. /> <br /> People who open you behind you, thinking about here ... <br /> <br /> April Fools Day opens. You speak of the escort nervous and tell you clearly, giving a shower sex and public humiliation and giving your face in the toilet (all naked!). The coach stops, but both parties will revenge. But fresh kids smoke a living nerdy. <br /> <br /> They cut off to the future, and their high school meeting, or do they think (bwahahha?). The invitations were made up of gangs that burned children, and the day of the April stupid days (or actually the day before the April bugs, but the fun begins midnight), however, they did not see chance and did not face them. until school night. Then they go into school and start at the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> Inside you will find food and drink and a small chapel for each one, as well as cabinets and things, together with the Marty (nerds) locker room. and yearbook He also finds a black guard, "Oooh Yesser! Yesser!" I do not want any problems, sir! "and then he dies instantly.It's pure characters, but it's still my favorite. <br /> <br /> The movie takes Alien's book to the page, you just see it properly! That's why everyone realizes that they are dying and Except for Shirley, he decides that it would be better if he decided to make a bath in the old school showers at such a time, of course, it flows blood and acid and his face melts (it's very nice, it matters to you). The rest of the night goes like usual, Sex, medication and all Marty kill them while they are wearing a jester mask. What is their plan? "All we have to do is wait awhile and wait until noon. Marty will not die on the day! "Seriously, what did he say? It seems that you can not only die at night, but will it survive tonight? Who lives and who will die? And why do all bodies disappear? Rent, buy or steal the movie To find out, this is a very good movie with topicals (cars will not start, DAMMIT!) and slasher games, all you have to mention, such as Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend you all! And, Spin Off! 1989 is a spin-off of this cutting-edge Cutting Class slasher, and the movie begins with Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell's career. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene: 2 people with sex, wants to end the guy but not a girl. "Dirty talk with me, Frank !!" shouts "Oh ... tits!" "Greater!" "Uh ... tits. F * ck. Tits Boobs F * ck. "It seems to be working for himself and at his peak, the killer has two electrons!
