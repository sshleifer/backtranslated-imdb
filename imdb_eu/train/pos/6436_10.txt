Ingrid Bergman is a relative of a former Parisian police station in Paris in 1900, with the most widely known French general and a glamorous number. That is why it is dedicated to a shoemaker. One such premise is the premise that introduces one of the most pleasant emotions of cinema history. There are political arrests of general detainees, as a result of the renunciation of the peloton and the numerous slots of the day of the Bastille, but the film's photography heart is underlying the upper floors, only cheerful and only sluggish aristocrats. Yes, the rules of the game redux. It's over, even though Gaston Modot's rules make Gamekeeper look jealous - like Gypsy Capo, no less! Things are very thick and fast at the end, creating confusion with non-French speakers, but what about hell - Elena and Her Men are another Renoir masterpiece.
