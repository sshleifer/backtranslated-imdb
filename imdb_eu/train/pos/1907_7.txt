8 Simple Rules is a fun show, but it also has some life lessons, especially an adult lesson, the first episode of Paul's death episode, the first episode that saw ABC's show. Hennessy clans - mother Cate (Katey Sagal), daughter of Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson), and Rory son (Martin Spanjers) - look at Paul's (John Ritter) guide and help each other. ), patriarchal family. Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) get in touch. I'm delighted that, during the second season of this show, David Spade decided to put on this show in the NBC series, Just Shoot Me! But all this show and everything is pretty good. This exhibition reminds me a lot of classic family sitcoms of the 80s and 90s, they used to be ABC.
