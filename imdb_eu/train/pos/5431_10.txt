I've watched this movie several times and I can not help each time I see it. Gunga Din is one of the classic films of the Golden Years of Hollywood, when the actors needed to draw their attention to a movie, to rely on the fantastic features of the effects and to bring the human "monsters" scene. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglenek and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. It's very funny to see the proven charisma and suberb on the screen. The language and cheeks played by three actors play their role. Some may think that it's a "corner", but I think it's a "classical" and I work best. It should be remembered that watching this movie was taking part in a war with Europe in Germany and they had to flee from the horrors of the war in the filmmakers, and to move them and take them to life and heroic places. good would always conquer the evil ones. Gunga Din is unavoidable for the audience to laugh and laugh at the actors during their flight. In short, his classic film is not serious and does not want the audience too.
