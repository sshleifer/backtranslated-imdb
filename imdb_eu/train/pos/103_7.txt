When I read other comments, I decided to watch this movie ... <br /> <br /> First of all throw Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; enough ... <br /> <br /> In the film, because it is very intelligent and interesting, cast has an international actress and actress with many actors from Turkey and Russia ... <br /> <br /> Second, The story is basic and you can guess it, but I think it would be a good play for a fun act ... <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the final chapter is not special or interesting. . <br /> <br /> In the end, I recommend watching this movie ... And I'd like to enjoy your liking: D
