This, together with "Hare Tonic", is one of the best cartoon Bugs, one of Bugs. In these cartoons, there are comments of "basic" Bugs, I think that the meaning has not yet been fully developed. This "basic" version of the mid-40s (the best version of Chuck Jones) was actually a long-legged rabbit size and much more fun than Yosemite Sam and Daffy Ducken. These last Bugs were very tender and sophisticated to my liking. Check out the "Hair Raising Hare" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) classic examples of classic Bugs and classic Chuck Jones.
