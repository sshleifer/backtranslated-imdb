I loved this movie completely! It was very good! This movie, from Paul's perspective, is a movie. She is given as a gift to Paulie Marie's girlfriend. Paul is helping Marie talk and become the best friends. But Paul says that when he says he flies to Marie, he falls, and that bird goes away. The adventure started then. Paulie will spend so much going back to Marie. This movie is very sweet, funny, moving, dull and more. When I first saw this movie, he cried. The courage and desire of the birds to go looking for her Marie all over the time was so shocking. I must say that the end is so sweet and sad, but you should see how it happens. In the end, the janitor tries to help her listen to her story. Lost or Missed Marie? Find out when you see this sweet heart savor. It will touch your heart. Rating: 10
