Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler's hard-tailed detective have been adapted to cinemas like fox like chickens, thus creating a definitive American genre and style in that process. any impression The problem of books such as Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers or SS Van Dine (the work of this film): they are low in action or variety - they move along the streets of Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe LA. In the workplace, bars, offices, wealth centers and all kinds of dangers of violence and violence, overall Gold fiction is set in the location, in general, the scene of the murder, usually an elegant country house, and continues to investigate. Clues and suspicious conversations. This is a very static procedure, drawing plot. <br /> <br /> This is, of course, any other ideology, storytelling related to the change of stories of the Golden Age and the movement of enemy society. The harsh novels are being recorded as a reality of the city (center, authority and city) away in enemy, uncontrolled and illegal camps. Golden Age is another important problem of fiction: we can not know until the end of the crime response, because we can not the motivations and emotions of the characters, defining only the need for murder Detective, faced with private faces, worried, it's just a fascinating face. Maybe it's not a bit of curiosity. <br /> <br /> It's time to try the problem of most of the Golden Age movies. -Boli / Jane Austen's re-enactment of the school, and its final appearance, such as Ellery Queen and others by Claude Chabrol's radical reactivation, have been two real worlds in the English-speaking world: the classic Alistair Sim, Green For Danger ", because it encourages parody form, the integrity of the mystery or the betrayal of interest because he has <br /> <br /> Michael Curtiz's 'The Kennel Murder' came before. Almost '. The narration is a golden age. There is an evil person who thinks he is the cause of killing the bad guys. She is dying of seemingly innocent, suicide, in a locked room. The police cartoonists completely fall ill. Philo Vance, gentleman and amateur detective, does not care about the elderly, read more arguments, open the room inside, and eventually solve the case, more than just a corpus excuse. intellectual stimulation <br /> <br /> This detective plot is not interesting, and that's never been fulfilled, as far as all the solutions are, but rarely entertaining and less than full of comic business. There is no attempt at ever changing the image of the perfect detective - a disturbing scene threatens a wild sergeant to threaten a suspect, without a Vance protest, but about it. <br /> <br /> Its modernity marks the classic "Kennel". Curtiz, in general, is not considered a great author, because he does not have coherent coherence or issues of artistic importance. But Hollywood was the greatest craftsman, and it's amazing here. If the story of the Golden Age detective is a mere puzzle, Curtiz takes this idea to an extreme logic that creates an abstract variation of its source, narrative, character, and location geometry, a series of lines, magnificent cameras, fine art decoys, break from static compositions , and alternating from one angle to another, they accelerate the deceased decoration. <br /> <br /> This treatment corresponds to a story that denies undeniable realism. A model that transforms the detective plot into a mirror room, like two older brothers, or as the original crime, borrowing from the 'untoward mysteries' book. This fantastic world of evil wretched men, which are relics of the Eastern relics ("The Moonstone" shadows?), Shocking Chinese officials, turned coins, dog-loving police, runyonian police, is the ideal habitat for Vance. It would not be possible to drop a cruise in Europe, a fantasy hunch that knows the social world of the people, and yet it would not be the pollution of the crime or the police, or a thinking machine, William. Powell, America's greatest comedian comedy, emphasizing his humanity's idiosyncrasy. <br /> <br /> But when the treatment is rarefied, the brutal brutal, evil dog and murder attempt is terrible. Police and detectives, who are guilty of crime, will be guilty.
