Most people who follow Audrey Tautou's films do not understand that Amelie was a character - it's not really Audrey Tautou's real life. That is why each of the participating films is not part 2 of Amelie, part 3 ... <br /> <br /> Now, as I said, I also got a movie because Audrey was there. Yes, it's true, there is a huge gap between seeing the first scene and a total of 45 minutes, but I did not miss it, along with the other characters I had so much fun. Everyone on the go is a fun little man who justifies the people that run out of the cafe and makes a jump to the coupon to find the coupons and, however, it balances the loss, really ... I've had some time to get into all the characters here, but I've seen some of the best films is one. <br /> <br /> Irene Audrey Tautour's character is not the girl that was Amelie. Actually, Irene was caught up in the care of nonsense absurdity, which was called for change. In this movie, Irene is a good-looking girl, but in a very (very horrible) day her character becomes increasingly pessimistic. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely wonderful to build all those really interesting stories and plots ... to see the entertaining, landscape and great shots, very colorful and never too slow, and all the characters really act. The best part of the movie is about 20 minutes away ... all of the sites start together and start the route and connect everything and make sense and the full butterfly effect will flourish. I swear the 20-minute movie that I have seen for a long time, and at the end ... I thought "I have damn found it really lucky to find this movie". The end of this film is on top. Everyone who writes this script is superb because there are not all other subplots happening, but to somehow connect them (and in a sensible way, what is happening here), but to make every character feel like man and life, an obsolete character that is like a machete, to build a butterfly effect ... very impressive. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie because it's a wonderful movie to watch at any time. any mood, with any company or alone.
