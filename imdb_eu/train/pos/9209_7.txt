STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Mark the Misses *** Bit ** Behind Behind * Pits <br /> <br /> Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) is making peace in his Western West When a woman suffers from abuse by a woman. Being a knight, he naturally goes through and stays there, and thus kills the son of an executive. This is just the only winner that will be the beginning of the start of the track. <br /> <br /> M Dudikoff does not start a star action with me. Maybe I found it too late and I just added another list of The Human Shield, Dud (ha ha), which I saw last Monday after another. But I have something to do with Westerns, movies that take me to different times and places and give real-life entertainment to fugitives, and with this Dudikoff has received one of his best films, although his films have gone by. <br /> </ br> The film hits a few bumps that look like a malignant midfielder, like Marlon Brando, and sometimes, sometimes, like ropey theater plays. But for some strange reason, your life was watching Dudikoff, this is your best option. ***
