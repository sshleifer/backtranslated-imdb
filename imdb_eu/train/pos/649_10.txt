We do not have to miss the movie, this is the greatest I've ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is amazing (more than usual) and the new movie is one of the most unforgettable vogue. Jean Eustache is not in this region, we have black and white images to remember one of the best and most considered French directors. You love this masterpiece. I will never forget. <br /> <br /> P.S .: Sorry about English ...
