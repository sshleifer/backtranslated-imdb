I waited a bit for the review of this documentary, since I saw it more than 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> From a documentary perspective I found it a good documentary. He did what he wanted to do, he showed me something I did not know and I was interested in this world he explored. I did not know about the world of Drag and know about them and "Balls" was impressive to me. These people were so talented as they did and how they do it for competition. Loving people, complaints (although I was angry that someone dressed in a court dress that did not wear a coat of men!), They are jealous, like every other competition. WE ARE OVERSEAS. I felt a point I had. <br /> <br /> Older queen rocks The balls used balls to "change" the balls and compare more categories of competition with the new drag queens. Those who could know more changes that would be changed when the balls were moving towards the future. It was interesting to hear that some competitors lived on the street two minutes before the street, but when they were competing, it was important for them! Then the story was sad, the story of the "house" and "housewife" came up with the best and brightest competition. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> Now, after 10 years of viewing this movie, I call "Madonna" craze. I have seen some famous faces of this documentary during the "Vogue" stage of Madonna and, as a result, directly. If only, Madonna would not be the "Vogue" phase, I know now. Credit credits must be provided. I wonder if the main American would see this documentary, they will learn that they are not "mastery" as they think.
