Salva and his friend have been at the border of Bigardo throughout their lives. We see seeing in a submarine car, where no donation is given! Salva, he's a little punished person, even though he does not receive abuse, which is what he's going to have to do until he finds a reality show on TV. Religion and shows seem to be a winning combination, Salva is beneficial. <br /> <br /> He and Bigardo were in prison after the death of a priest who was critical. Salva shows that reality is a natural show. He transforms himself into the appearance of Christ, the success of the program is immediate. Spe, a woman with a show producer, is absurd, she does not want to pay attention to her. In the end, the end of his success is the victim. <br /> <br /> Jordi Mollak, the first director of this film, has had a great success in how the television role satirizes. In Spain, he was vulnerable to these types of programs, he saw his peculiar part, that is, the director was an attack on the audience and started to think about his story from the point of view of people. fortune among the listener <br /> <br /> Together plays have good moments in the film. Mr. Molla, as any actor who directs his first feature, would be more effective in the image in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons to watch the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gim√©nez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director.
