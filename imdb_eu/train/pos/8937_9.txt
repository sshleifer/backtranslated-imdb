It was an excellent example of how to make an interesting movie without great stars and effects. Tell us about a real story about African women's struggles between troubled men. <br /> <br /> This movie challenges us to analyze our personal prejudices and to see people, not black and white. etc. <br /> <br /> Good movie with a good message.
