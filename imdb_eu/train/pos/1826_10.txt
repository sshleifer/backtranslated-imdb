I loved this movie very little. At the age of 17, he is one of my favorite animated films. Beautiful animations and attractive characters are just two of the things that are about this movie. Although many people may not enjoy some songs, most do it well and go with the story. Charlie, who looks like a beautiful German beautiful Shepard ..., focuses, but eventually wins. <br /> <br /> It's not a kiddie movie any. Often very dark and scary times. Loving Don Bluth's enthusiasm and entertainment enthusiasts. But keep a hundred available. ADGTH never cries and makes me feel sensitive. Undoubtedly, one of the greatest Disney animated films of all time. Watership Down and My Neighbor Totoro. <br /> <br /> RULES: heavenly masterpiece.
