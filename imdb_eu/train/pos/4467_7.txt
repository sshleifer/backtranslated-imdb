Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing film Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as film by Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> Films and Oscars won the score of George E. Stoll, and the best movie was a candidate for the best actor. Kelly and the best of the best of Sinatra, with the singer Sinatra. <br /> <br /> Kelly's story was helping a girl to fall into a friend Sinatra. in love with him Grayson's lovely (The New Orleans toast) captivates us with her singing, and Kelly and Sinatra have had a lot of song and dance routines, as well as art director Jose Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Classical Hollywood music of the past.
