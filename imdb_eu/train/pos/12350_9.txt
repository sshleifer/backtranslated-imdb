I do not know how I got it when I first came out, but I'm glad I saw it at last. <br /> <br /> This film was written by Okabasho XIX. It circles around the red light of the century. Japan. A Japanese-based samurai code based on a society based on prostitution, caste systems and strong women. <br /> <br /> Only Akira is Kurosawa! Although he died before directing this movie, he shows the script's adaptation. The Japanese world and the caste system's vision are known and they clarify the way in which these systems interact. Characters can interact, but the caste system maintains its integrity when each character returns to the world where it enters. A warrior samurai who comes in for good and loving women returns to his life. another way with a man in his caste system. smallest smallest Many reward the world of samurai over all the others, but nevertheless, the inhabitants of the lower caste can help each other and love who can dominate them. The tenderness of this movie seems to be weak, but the unmistakable lovers prove that they are honorable. <br /> <br /> The film deserves a higher score. It is the survival of women in feudal Japan. During this period, it was believed that men were alive ... the strongest women were unheard and weak. This film emphasizes the strength of Japanese women and how they continued to survive and how they did it by force in Japanese culture. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Watching the sea". If anyone is a fan of Akira Kurosaw and there's a fan. It is a movie to promote a beautiful, quiet and soulful film that will be lifted by any movie collection.
