Note: These comments are for people who watched the movie. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is an excellent, complex and exciting movie, which is an existing line that examines the following: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Perhaps the plot of the movie would be mixed with different focuses from different directions. <br /> <br /> Considering these: <br /> <br /> I have not done it right now. The scene of the film scene, so I have to analyze my affirmations (and I welcome your thoughts), but try this and see if the movie is not in its place: where is it also a questionable 'splice'? <br /> <br /> Now, I do not talk about the agreement as the LE instructs the 'technician', since the same sequence can be interpreted as a rationalization within the mind / dream / comma of David Aames, but the real link between reality and dream. <br /> <br /> I think it's a reality. The car crash, the way it was shot (for example, no explosions) is likely to be a "splice" point, and it feels like any existential / dream / comma / reality sequence. The crash before or after the screen - Aamiren is part of the personal route, in the direction of self-realization itself. <br /> <br /> In that sense, we have two questions left there. finish (if you know more, tell me): Aames has really disfigured and where does it wake up? <br /> <br /> If you are not fully involved in a detailed sequence of details on the plot, or at which point your dreams are scattered, this movie becomes a wonderful human exploration that embraces this journey and somebody. It means today's pop culture society. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
