This movie is fine. As an old USAF Aviation Cadet, I can say that this movie has all this. The appetite of the application process. Waiting word. Pleasure of admission. Worry about crossing the course. Seeing one of your friends (maybe the best of them) is clearing the pain. The severity of paying the final price - flulow student airmen death. Graduation glory. Always fly, fly, fly. Many are called, but few are chosen. We paid for the payment we made.
