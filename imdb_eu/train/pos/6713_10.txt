I liked this television program, for she was aware of her sixteen-year-old girl as a witch and she lives in the aunts of her house and both are witches. Well, it was about a few weeks ago. When he used his powers for the first time, it was so funny that his enemy became a pineapple. She had to go back a day and had to repeat it a day. This series is very nice and it is a typical teenage series, but I used to rent a small apartment with some classmates in a house and apartment, then it was boring and I stopped watching. and the other was very wonderful. I loved Valerie and Sabrina's enemy hated Libby.
