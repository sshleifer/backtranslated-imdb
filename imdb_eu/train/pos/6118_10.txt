Jack Frost is really a cool movie. ... I said it's fun. His violence. and very nice. Most people say that B is rated, but that's not true. It has special effects and good practices. The only thing is Weird, Killer is Snowman. I think this movie was one of the best nineties. Most filmmakers do not have A Clive Barker Master Piece criteria these days. That is to say, to be original and not see what they do not expect. Jack Frost is Cool Cool. 10th to 10th grade: A +. Ed also, Grandpa Sam's movie, Jack Frost recommends fans.
