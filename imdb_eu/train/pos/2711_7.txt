When I think of 'Women in Prisionean', I often go to the bustling Spanish / Spanish productions, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei; and although these movies are often very noisy, they are very identical and have been seen; You can also watch it all. I admit that these types of films, in general, are not my favorites; But, in fact, the ideas behind the women who have left behind have been very successful outside Italy and Spain; and Roger Corman's New World Pictures are some of the best. Caged Heat CEO Oscar Demme is Oscar Oscar, and a well-done small movie is a great value for entertainment! Of course, the film is a story of a woman who has been caught by a crime and sends her to a female prison, where she has had many challenges for prisoners. The jail is directed by the McQueen superintendent wheelchair; and attacks a play that girls play; it will bring them away. <br /> <br /> This film is much lighter than women in prisons; but this is more than compensated by the beautiful scenes of action and conversation, and that is what Caged Heat does. It should be noted that the plot is not particularly original or intriguing, and essentially follows a structure similar to many other women in the movies that were previously in prison; But this is not a problem. The movie never gets bored and has great scenes; An attempt to escape in the internal field and bank robbery. The director of the film director, The Silence of the Lambs, under the direction of the director, has to be helped with the sure direction and has a cartoon; The best of all the legendary Barbara Steele, the role of the prisoner. In general, Caged Heat may not think of what the viewer has left behind at the end; But the bright small grindhouse is entertaining, and those who enjoy this type of film will surely want to keep up the track.
