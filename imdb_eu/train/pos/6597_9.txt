American films are always seen with special accents in each region (in the south, in the west, etc.). We have the same thing here. All foreigners must watch this movie and have a desire to take a new culture, as well as America and Europe, dominate almost the cinematographic industry. <br /> <br /> This movie knows the parallel world. t, even for those who live in a great city like Paul. All actors are improvised and they are very realistic. The cameras give us an invitation to share their world of mix, the solitude of each character and its world. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, and rent also has a home-made income.
