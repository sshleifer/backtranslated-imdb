They did it And, guys, they did it fantastically or what! BbC finally Doctor came back to our screens on Saturday afternoon! And they did it with style! <br /> <br /> EPISODE: "Rose" - One of the strengths of this new series is Russel T Davies and executive producer. He is a fan of the show and knows what other fans want, but also an experienced writer, so he knows what they want. One of the best shown in the first section is the character of Billie Piper and Rose Tyler. In the end, the doctor's assistant is a compelling story and a strong character. Likewise, it's nice to see Auton's return - looking at the classical series. <br /> <br /> TWO EPISODIO: "End of the world" - TARDIS to show the double bill. 'Strengths, special effects will end in a story! Nowadays they have technology to create real and credible environments and monster - no more rubber outfits! Also, the tips that appear in the end of this section about the past of the Doctor recently - very interesting to kill all the lords of time and to be the only one. <br /> <br /> THREE EPISODIO: "Dead Concerns" - We He had the future, now let the past. The first part of Davies's passage is a bit flat in some places, but it is composed by Simon Dickinson of Charles Dickens, and the gloomy Gelf, who appears suddenly on the plot, is not so endless ... <br /> <br /> FOURTH EPISODIO: "London foreigners" - The effects of doctoral actions are analyzed in this series, at least considering the effects of Rose's own. In addition, we are our first cliffhanger; It is not the best among the best. Slitheen is an interesting wicked one, though CGI can be very good for their own sake. <br /> <br /> EPISODIO CINTS: "World War Three" - The second part of this story about Slithe, above all, is the same problem with the same problems. Similarly, the next episode of the next section at the end of the section is annoying and people are spoiled. <br /> <br /> SEX EPISODIO: "Dalek" - Yes! We have the future, the past and the present (but), but now we get good things - Return of the doctor's nemesis back. Here I think we were able to complete Christopher Ecclestone - he was a brilliant doctor, and even in this section, where he pained his face, he remembered the War of Time and almost became his strange character. Dal himself. <br /> <br /> EPISODIO SEVEN: "The Long Game" - the only story that could be the final series for the final. Simon Pegg has saved a bad editor and Tamsin Grieg in a fun kameo. The media control us - it's never been done before ... <br /> <br /> Eight EPISODE: "Father's Day" - it's a wonderful episode. It is full of human emotion and heartfelt, and the real consequences of Rose and her history. Billie Piper's complete brand here. <br /> <br /> EPISODIO NUEO: "The little child" - I do not see this child very scary. Sorry, but not. It's a good section, but cliffhanger could be better: the "Next Time" pieces are damaged. John Barrowman presents Captain Jack with a convex cone - a good actor, but has long been a good actor. <br /> <br /> EPISODIO TEN: "Dancing with PhD" - second part. The WW2 story - made in the historical context very well. A beautiful break, though it might be confusing when it comes to revealing "Mummy" for young audiences? <br /> <br /> EPISODIO UNDEKAN: "Boom Town" - probably the weakest in the series, but that does not mean bad. A delightful return to Slithe and an interesting research on Doctor and Rose's character. <br /> <br /> TWELVE EPISODIO: "Wolf bad" - this is anger, heart-wasting and fun. Blighty on her television shows. The serious things are serious, however, and finally the revelation is the best kliffhanger in series! <br /> <br /> EPISODIO THRITEEN: "Sharing modes" - Goodbye Christopher Ecclestone. In so many wonderful ways of medicine, David Tennant has really made the socks really work to make it so good. At the end the scene of the regeneration is beautifully played. Oh, and Dal returned - at the end! God blessed CGI, because they were never able to get out of the ordinary! <br /> <br /> Overview - excellent! 9/10
