I'm sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you should see it for the second time and your opinion in the cinema will definitely change. The first time you watch the movie, you see under the love story and think: ooh, how romantic. For the second time (and this is not the only one I think) it's annoying and you're sitting down thinking that the movie is going to sink when that ship goes down? And this is not so spectacular when you see it many times. Playing this movie is not bad, but, of course, it's not great. Are you glad that DiCaprio did not win the Oscar for that movie, do I mean who thinks it is Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He is a half-length short film and will not make films less than $ 20 million. And then, everyone surprised that there were hardly any movies with him. It's enough to think the worst character in the movie. Kate Winslet was wonderful. I combine the director with great talent, too, to make this film a movie like this. There is a lesson about this movie: with too many love stories, filmmakers will not try to add romance to all the other movies! From 100% possible, I only offer 71% of this film.
