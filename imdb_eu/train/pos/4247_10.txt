MISSOURI Little girl arrives in New York knowing she wants to: she wants to get some money, and she does not want to marry her and lose her virginity. With good looks, he captures quickly the son of the magnate child, but, in accordance with virtue, he will also find true love. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow sits on this great little comedy. With platinum hair and beautiful ingredients, it's brilliant. But her beauty would not have been hidden as a very good actress. He has made his place in the Hollywood Pantheon. <br /> <br /> An excellent job provides good support for Harlow: Lionel Barrymore, the old boy, makes Harlow's sense wisely; Beautiful Franchoth Tone as his son, struck with love; Patsy Kelly aggressive, stealing her scenes as Harlow's assistant; Alan Mowbray debonair, English Lord as a good way; Senior Clara Blandick as the powerful secretary of Barrymore; Hale Hamilton, dear as a wealthy man; Nat Pendleton muscle, like the lifeguard that catches Kelly's bitter eye; and Lewis Stone, was an unforgettable little businessman as a poor businessman. <br /> <br /> It should be said that this film was created and produced by the Hollywood Producer Code. Two years ago, compared to RED EMAKUMEA, it would be amazing if Harlow's character pursued the same goals, but he uses very different ways.
