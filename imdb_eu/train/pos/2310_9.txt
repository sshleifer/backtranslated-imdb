I was very surprised that Man In The Moon was really great. At first, I expected a course and a prediction film, but I decided to do that. Well, I just finished leaving. Impressed (especially tears), Man In The Moon was horrible. This movie is very fun and the tone is very popular, and it's just a wonderful movie. Reece Witherspoon was great. so pretty and lovely), and all others. He was not really upset, I felt confronting with an end, but it was very well done. I also made some things as clear as I could or did. Before, but still an excellent movie. In general, I must say I do not say much about this movie, it's not bad, just like the movie. And everyone, even though you do not like this type of film, is still a nice movie. <br /> <br /> 8 stars 10.7
