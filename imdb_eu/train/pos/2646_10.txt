I think that the majority of people do not get the right idea about the movie, at least that's my opinion. I am not sure about a drug deal; But genius is a movie about the thought of the brothers, the drugs are side effects, something marginal. Once again, it's not a commercial movie that you see every day, and if you like it, it has definitely failed, because most people think it's one of the many drug-dads. However, I think that something else happens. As in many films that portray in different cultures, the audience usually understands their own culture, that is, they know something with their growns. This movie is popular with people who "geniuses" think about and what problems they are planning to predict. That's why they're bored with the reason they're doing :) They need to know about people who do minimal things and want to start spotting everyday space ships. The work starts quite hard and brilliant. I went to work, I did not do anything, I still made two projects around me, what should I do now with my free time? And what's even more boring? Preventing behavior is not a psychologist, because you have seen this past pattern. So, for them, it's a non-challenging task at hand, it's sometimes pretty boring, and others start to figure out the behavior of people. It's a bored recipe. And the most faulty things are usually done to get out of this situation. The guy before, the main problem that is trying to figure out logic terms (which describes the first description as a logic), though not logical, is really good.
