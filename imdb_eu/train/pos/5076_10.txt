This elegant action has been running for almost 5 years. I watched this movie almost 10 times and it was Gautham's effort. From my point of view, this movie is perfect. Surya ACP Anbuchelvan-undoubtedly ... liquid.Jyothika played a role in the Maya. The character is very well suited. The character that captured Pandia's film was very well-known to be Pandia. Jeevan received the ITFA 2004 Best Villain award. Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others were well-knocked. <br /> <br /> Racy script, an excellent conversation in Gautham and a wonderful narrative in Gautham. Harris Jeyaraj is a bust diagram that fits the BGM movie very well. RD Rajasekharren is a rich cinematographer. Peter Hein has choreographed the exact stunts.Athony.Bahatz is well with Kaakha Kaakha's best pockets. action and love <br /> <br /> Some Hollywood films will also compete with Kaakha Kaakhar ... certainly.
