I have not watched the movie for the first time since it was released, but it was memorable. Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell's performances were excellent, excellent photography and mobile stories and everything about it was the highest standard. However, it seems to have been quite forgotten <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a strange market in the UK, but I do not watch the movie on TV or video sad. Would it be more successful in the United States, perhaps it is seen as quite accurate historical drama? <br /> <br /> Always think that 50% of a good movie is music and I'm not sure I think the title "What is our friend Jesus" is a solitary clarinet solitaire solo solo. Then he dismissed that movie! Is it correct?
