wow, how can i discuss the movie without crying in my eyes? It has definitely been the star of my year - my life. Raptor graphics were not as amazing as the award-winning editors used the same background that filmed the entire film, even though the backdrop did not look like that scene. Wow, what genius! And while the movie is full of plots (for example, some tatt Rex animals where a raptor should be and a key where Pappy finds a torture chamber, screams, "Colin is a girl!") I will never forget the glitter of the Raptor Planet. Thanks for another Sci-Fi classic.
