I do not know if it's recommended for this movie for "Tetsuo" lovers. Why "Tetsuo"? You can easily mark certain things about this movie as "Tetsuo" is clear. The concept is similar, the edition is mad and fast, that is to say, that it stimulates the movie, as well as some mistakes that generate bass budgets and other factors. , less eroticism, and "Meatball machine", called "Necroborg" (very original) is a slimy foreign creature that is partly a human being (a very good creature). <br /> <br /> These thin little foreign spaces are used by humans for their gladiatine games, which they play together. They infest in the body, somehow they put an insane amount of mechanical parts as apparently pulled out of nowhere and turn Necroborgs into a killer machine for other purposes. They intend to defeat a foreigner in another Necroborg to get rid of and extract the corpse. <br /> <br /> In the end, the plots are absurd and I do not expect much, but at the end I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> As I said before, this is a small budget, but it's still quite decent. Do not expect many of the actors, especially they are not very good, but they can be tolerated. I liked the atmosphere and gore, directing and editing strange situations and movies. Although the story is not original, I have a particular charm - at least for me. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10
