I really enjoyed this movie and it was difficult to do it when your brother made a stupid comment in 30 seconds. But I enjoyed this movie, especially when I used conventional HK action movies. Most of the movies do not see the story line, see mindless action. And it is a headless act. You will see Jet Li Jump, rotate, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible breaks and avoid large bullets. It is true that this movie was released to a broader audience, as "The deadly weapon" was on the 4th. That's the fall of this movie's ratings. Most people surely expected to see a movie as polished as the American movie. You have to remember most HK movie quotes as high as most HK films, and the HK movie style is a very different one that usually requires a lot of wirework. If you want to see a good action movie, watch this to discard duplication. <br /> <br /> My rating was 8.
