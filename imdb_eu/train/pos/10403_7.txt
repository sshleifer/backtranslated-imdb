Oriental fantasy is an incredible adventure on ¨stations and Arab nights¨, fantasy witches and wizards. The evil vampire Jaffar (conspicuous Conrad Veidt) captured the throne of Prince Ahamad in Baghdad (attractive John Justin) with powerful magical forces, and then escaped a small robber named Abu (Sabu pleasant). It reaches the forest, where Ahamad and Princess (June Duprez gorgeous) fall in love. But the prince and the thief are inflicted by Jaffar, Ahamd has become blind and Abu has become a dog. The story includes some wonderful ingredients, such as the protagonist, a winged mechanical horse, a magical arch, a flying carpet, and of course an immense genie (Rex Ingram), Sabu, a magical eye, with three wishes. Several Kali goddesses, among others. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of all time is an outstanding image. Produced by London Fim by Alexander Korda and definitely by Ludwing Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan, there is also a stunning screenplay by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson. Dialogue as a writer and actress Sultan is fond of mechanical games. When World War II broke out, the shooting stopped and then the Three brothers and collaborators traveled to the USA in Grand Cannon Colorado. Specifically, Technicolor Cinematography, setting and FX won three Oscars: Designing Production William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda, George Perinal's cinematography and Osmond Borradaile's special effects are still dated yet and are urgently needed for re-use. In addition, Miklos Rozsa nominated music scores and eastern scores. An intense story with an imaginative dose that will appeal to fantasy fans and classic cinema
