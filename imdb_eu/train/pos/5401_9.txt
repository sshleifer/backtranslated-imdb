It is a testimony that shows the unbelievable film of Gosh, in 1969 that Hitokiri and his stunning masterpiece, Goyokin, were able to perform. In 1969 it proves to the general public (at least compared). Akira Kurosawa's great loved ones), Hitokiri and Goyokin received less than 500 votes. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu is Okada Izo: a stupid dog murderer, a faithful clan of Tosha and the boss Takechi, the statue of another genus, Tatsuya Nakadai. The Tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that protected the Emperor against the Shogunate. The historical situation is fairly detailed: Japan's imperialists and Tokugawa's growing political endowment, and Western pressure to end their 300-year isolation and social isolation. It helps a lot about what happened to Japanese history and what happened to Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the Shogunate in Tokugawa, but it is not at all crucial. Japanese films have mostly been made for audiences, so some things are provided as provided, but it is very good for beginners. <br /> <br /> Hideo Gosha's movie as expected in its golden years. At the end of the 60's) is a visual palette that is hidden behind the exterior and internal symbolism behind pictorial beauty. The style, however, is never the decoration of Gosha. He always works in the service of the story. <br /> <br /> Talking about the story, Hitokiri literally and figuratively dominates the tortured character by Izo Okada. Like most of the protagonists of the room, the double Izo is found in the moral link between giri (duty) and ninjo (natural impulse) - although it is a bit necessary to realize what is its turn. The movie Izo is trying to move forward in the first half of the social car. The aristocratic daughter's social aspect and great marriages - XIX. A breakthrough for the backbone of peasants in the Japanese caste social system. <br /> <br /> The turning point for Yzo realizes the self-progress, the loss of personality and, therefore, the loss of self-esteem. At that time, he suffers the symbolic transformation of a famous sword-shield, Toshiba, the Torazo the Vagrant, an "unknown" drifter or without a future. Although Iojimbo's non-genres and not technically neglected genres, apart from losing his first car, the loss of ego, ambition and self-illusion also allows Izo to really see things and save themselves. <br /> <br /> The end of the Hitler (I will not appear here) is the best way to end any story: positive and negative, Izo last laugh, the latest sardonic commentary with the death of an ironic latest death.
