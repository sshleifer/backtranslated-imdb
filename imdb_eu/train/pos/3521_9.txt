Other reviewers have made a short film outline. "Whew!" -I wanted to add it with. Make a comment about a reviewer about a reactionary blow to Elisha Cook. This was a doazy, I must say. Cook accepted some applause for his enthusiastic performance. <br /> <br /> The curiosities of the boss: The Cook server wrote in 1941 Barbara Stanwyck's "Fire of a Ball." The server was at the dance floor and Barbara was sung and Gene Krupa was playing the drums of the legendary battery, energetically. Does it make too much an inspiration for Cook's inspiration for the "Phantom Lady" film to inspire Krupa's work, as Cook did three years earlier? <br /> <br /> When you see Krupa "Fire of Fire", you will see some similar body movements. We hope, of course, that at that time it did not have any effect on drugs!
