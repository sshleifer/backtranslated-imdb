Peter Ustinov is an ambassador, who infiltrates into a British Texa-Conn company or puts it like that, as a computer whiz and security expert. He learns to hide himself in the computer, his boss, Karl Malden, the rival of Bob Newhart's office, and the hidden love of Maggie Smith, his secretary-secretary. <br /> <br /> Some business details were silent for business guidance, but they were credible and I got a general idea. Ustinov, Peter, sets up fake businesses in Paris, Rome and Stuttgart, and uses Texa-Conn's computers to send out all kinds of money. Foreign companies, of course, are the only ones, Ustinov, and the addresses are the abandoned chamber of artists in Paris, a barber in Rome and the German bakery. Visits only to receive credentials sent by him. <br /> <br /> I did not like it in the first few minutes, I think it would seem slow. I expected a bit faster and more aggressive, along with the lines of "The Pink Panther" or "The Lavender Hill Gang." But this movie gets into your grace as good as you appreciate in the plot, characterization and conversation. <br /> <br /> Probably, it would be a bad idea to add excessive gags but there are some outstanding examples. <br /> <br /> Ustinov's Secretary Smith: "Let me keep these companies active." Smith: "What are the goods? What are they?" Ustinov: "Little donkeys." Now, nothing short of doing this little exchange. The cut is fast and there is no delays in any kind of choice, that is, it's much better than laughing at one's own reaction. It's covered with wires. They are full of bricks and some of the old occupied paintings have been left behind. The owner does not speak English and Ustinov does not know French. Ustinov draws something like a naked female child and laughs: "Ah, a fam, thirty, right?" The owner of the house also laughed, replied "Vous le prenez pour une anee?" Ustinov: "Oh - ANNIE, so that's the name!" Leaseholder: "Oui?" Ustinov: "Entente cordiale!" (Mes amis, I missed these genres, je m'excuse.) Bob Newhart Willard Gnatpole (!) Has points with Maggie Smith and will guide his house and take him on a "stage tour". There are signs of instant suggestion. "Beware." "Lay-By". "Give way". "Yield". End the "STOP / CHILDREN" empire. There is another issue when Ustinov's scheme has been found by the board of directors - Fuzzy roofs, police cars, a greetings from Maggie, ending with a signal: PRISON, Wormwood Scrubs. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe one more. I can not still overcome Malden by deciding, "I never overwhelmed the decisions," then cleared the pills and cleared with a glass of water. <br /> <br /> The effect is definitely well. Bob Newhart's role is the best, for example. He did not have much, and his range was not limited, but this is a great part. Laurie Johnson's musical scores made a great deal of effort. It seems that he has written a short flute concert. Ustinoven is a passion for music and its foreign establishments include fake names like Claude Debussy and Giacconino Rossini. The fake president of Stuttgart is someone named Schmidt and the clinker is anomalous. Maggi Smith is pretty, sexy, bourgeois, and apparently not so muted. <br /> <br /> Lovely, in a quiet way, but do not expect a comical fireworks.
