Nothing is brilliant, innovative or innovative, but Dog Days is a wonderful character for some reason. It's like the bad dose of CRASH heroin, but not really. An Austrian film is one of many people, insolent and annoying, and following the life of excessive relationships. It is disturbing, but it is very well done and it is very interesting to see the bad things that these characters do. Undoubtedly, in generosity, this very pessimistic film does not end up offering revelation or revelation. For two days we only see the lives of these deaf people. Grade: B
