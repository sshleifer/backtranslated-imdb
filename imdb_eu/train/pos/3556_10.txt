Oh, music is horrible. There is a bit of mixing - Frank Sinatra confuses the Nathan Detroit as mischievously as Jewish, although there is an obvious Jewish song that is evident in "Sue Me". Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to cut one of the best songs of "Marry the Man Today" and replaced the smaller piece of Sinatra. In spite of these two defects, the movie is quite different. Jean Simmons does as bright as Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can not sing the beans singing, but it's thrown out anyway. Stubby Kaye reconstructed his Broadway role (written for him). Damon Runyon's languages ​​and pangs and moods are pretty good. This is my view-to-every-I-get list.
