I've loved this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carn√© ... almost everything has already been said about the movie, but I'd like to give it a little bit of light: it's still not in the real station room. The Nord (it's still ... I've heard it be demolished ...) has been used to make the movie - the whole scene has been rebuilt, and the main reason for St Martin's can not stop traffic. a few weeks
