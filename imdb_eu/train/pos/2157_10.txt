Okay As you can see, it's one of my favorite movies. The character is dramatic, very horny. The main character is a businessman who is thought to be "the same thing and other days". A woman watches over the melancholy from a dance studio's window every day, asks herself and decides to find out more about her. She decides to enter the dance class so she can only be a teacher. He then relates to another four dancers and learns to enjoy dances, as well as discovering the mysterious woman. <br /> <br /> There is no type of sex (or any) involved, how a small group of people learns. how to create and develop friendships. <br /> <br /> This film was renewed with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, and the appealing one is not as enjoyable as the original. The film never made a big deal in America, since there was no choice for Oscars since it was broadcast on Japanese television (movies could not be released on television or nominated for Oscar nominations). He won numerous prizes in Japan for the "Oscar" award for the best film, cast, director, etc.
