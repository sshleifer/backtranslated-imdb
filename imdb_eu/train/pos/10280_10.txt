Games of House is a spelling that is binding. It's so nice to watch films from time to time. There are so few films that I've seen. From this opening film, this film only gets you. <br /> <br /> I really try hard I still do not see those who have not seen much, but they do not have a SPOILERS. READ MORE THAN YOU DO NOT KNOW YOU. <br /> <br /> I would say House House is never a great movie, the best conical artwork I have ever seen. When the movie is finished, it's time to repeat it. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Crouse, Margaret Ford, is just perfection, she immediately introduces the voice flutter. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The interview in this movie has an almost unassailed book quality and looks like these two people do with their voices. I also liked the way I shot the movie, in a rocky and surrealistic way, it suited it perfectly and helped shape the movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen some movies and I love them. That reminded me of Grifters and Common Suspects, but really, House of games is quite different. Margaret and Mike have become the most absorbent people I've seen on the big screen, and they are not just moments from the time they meet the powerful and tangible display screen, but they are moments that start looking at each one. Another is electricity. You know something will happen, but you do not know what it is. And you realize that you do not even notice when you think about "something" ... <br /> <br /> Games of House is one of those movies that can be created. It's a genre of a kind of film, but basically a movie about human nature. Studying the character is not only the mind of this artist, but also the victims. As we progress through the film and learn more and more of the main characters, we learn about them, what they say and how they say. The character is an excellent research and it is perfect for success. <br /> <br /> In the end, I will rank 10 out of 10, call (although not my absolute favorite movie, quite high). On the list), it would be remarkable and incredible to be one of the best personalities and some of the best "twists" that I have ever seen. Although I love all kind of movies and genres, in the movies of human psyche, it's actually not much better. Watch this movie
