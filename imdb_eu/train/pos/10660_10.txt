I found that this film was suspensible almost on the go. When Miss Stanwyck begins her narration, it's only a few minutes until she knows the problems that arise from her mind. The empty space, the lock of the empty door of the gas station, everything you wait for ... comes here. At first, you think it's about the boy, but you'll start to get upset when you get off the ground. I thought this film was really stressed, although I had to see it before and be prepared. Now, the film that holds the suspense is worth the extra score that you deserve, even the white elbow prize?
