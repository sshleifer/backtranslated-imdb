When I released this movie, I saw it when I was 12 years old :) And I still remember the heroine / heroine how she escapes every time she was in danger :) And the best feature of the movie was the portrait of the evil! I think that many film-making films have copied many of the "getaways" in this movie! And when I see that copy it never impresses, it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The actors perform surprisingly. The heroic and heroic chemistry chemistry slow and real development was very natural and very portrayed. As children, we thought that love developed was a very natural love :) The ways in which their tests and difficulties overcome children can also value true love, sacrifice and care. Everyone is advised to watch this movie! --Vijay.
