This is because of its originality. I am tired of watching Hindi films of a wide range of Hollywood and British films. Some mistakes were essential, but this movie is essential. Surya was a clean policeman (commonly seen by those who were hungry) was a surprising portrayal of the police. It's far from the work of Nerucks. I really liked having to own the movie. I am not usually included in non-violent films, I felt for a certain character, so I can not call violence "innocent". I am not saying melodramas and romantic scenes that go along with Hindi and Tamil movies. I loved this movie completely. When ACP wants to lose his wife Anbuselvan, it's not excessive, it's heart-confusing and I want to get her eyes off. Sometimes I see the movie when I want to press the FF button. I wanted to do several times in the cinema room. I never wanted to see this movie. I really hope that Ghajini will be published shortly.
