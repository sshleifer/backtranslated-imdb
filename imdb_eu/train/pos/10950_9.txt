When I saw this show for the first time, it seemed interesting to me. I looked, as I saw in Sarah's way around, as the character sees the world ... revolving around him. I got it, but I did not laugh at all. <br /> <br /> A racist, raw, non-sensitive and highly-concentrated stage and its show. At first I did not get it, and I absolutely appreciated it. Then I saw his movie, Jesus is Magic. I think Sarah Silverman's first role was for me, explaining what he's talking to me. It's like Marilyn Manson, who works so hard to offer the faces of terrific ideas and images, but it's a statement that he's not finally an assault. And after understanding this, you are glad that I am happy when someone finally gives you the right. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that intelligents only understand it or prove it to prove hate this show. your stupidity While 'Smart' is like a lot of shows, I still do not see the humorous Curb Your Enthusiasm today. It seems good, but I do not know. Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman program, but I'm glad I finally came. <br /> <br /> The creators of this show work hard, each section is only loaded with conversations and plots, but with songs, or dreams sequences, production numbers. These people do not gather something to fill a certain amount of time and please the advertisers. Apparently, it seems to be the role of the best show they put together. If I announced the future of this show, I would say it will be Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It's time to cancel and live in the hearts of the fans and the DVD. Take heart, SSP creators, your audience is there, and we will watch it forever to make the show.
