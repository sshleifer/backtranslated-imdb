At that time my girlfriend saw the movie at that time and I can say that I did not have the best time I did not know about Ned Kelly or her story. <br /> <br /> But since this is a Biopic, it's important to know at least what the character expects. <br /> <br /> I do not know whether events are telling whether the mode is true or not, or everything is fictional. But I think Ned Kelly illustrates how the portrait of justice and heroine is fought, I think everything is true. I do not think he has been portrayed as a criminal or a robber, but that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> Western is a giant type, for all tastes. Heath Ledger is as great as ever and Naomi watts sexy screens. <br /> <br /> Select if this film sends a cable. Otherwise, I do not think I recommend.
