The plague The film directed by Elia Kazan in New Orleans replaces the femme fatale with a very faade. Kazan always gets great actors by his actors, but also shows a visual appearance, combined with apparent appearance, narrow compositions and one-off solo hits. <br /> <br /> A man entering a country illegally dies after a card game. It turns out to be a kind of bubonic plague, so it remains crucial to keep the killers from being arrested, so they can inoculate all those who have had a relationship. City and health officials have set up a secret plan that warns the community not to flee to the public and fear that they will spread the disease. An anti-clock detective and epidemiologist combine an uncomfortable alliance on the shore using contrasting styles of research. <br /> <br /> The street raises a huge ethical public question, as the official doctor argues to argue for the black media, thus creating a greater risk for communities. Regardless of the result, you can still guess the actions of the main character of the second film. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark, Dr. Clint Reed and Paul Douglas are the detective of War, and they are in charge of respecting each other for the murderers. Barbera Bel Geddis, wife of Reeden, has a good time with Widmark in some home-made aesthetic comics, with the relief of desperate quest for relief from volcanic tides surrounding the New Orleans River. McDonald. Zero Mostel is a slimy, time-consuming, criminal time, but sometimes sympathetic. Walter Jack Palance as Blackie Bone (Black Death?) It's just remarkable. An exciting intensity Palance dominates all the scenes, not only a threat but also a disturbing charm. In addition, it gives more sensitivity, especially in the latest allegorical moments in the film for a greater revival. <br /> <br /> Panic in the Streets, probably Kazan's non-Brando movie is the best. The tension is complete, with good pace and edits. The environment is in its local settings, which allows Kazan to be flexible in addition to its style of film, which can be applied to Panic.
