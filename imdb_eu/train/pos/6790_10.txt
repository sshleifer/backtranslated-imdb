This game is the best RPG. Fist is more fun than any other in the battle system (when you attack your attack, you will become a dragon, a special attack, magic ...). The script is very good. The characters are beautiful and you do not accept long conversations, as happened in several Final Fintasy series games. I was bored with these past conversations, when you want to keep the story of the game going. The environment is a treasure in this game, combining medieval fantasy with futuristic science fiction. It is noteworthy that the animation effects are incredible, I like more in some modern games (we can not remember that the legend of the Dragon Dukes is 8 years old). Then, the map is horrible, all kinds of places are hostile. In the end, Music is not the best thing I've heard, but it's great for such a game.
