Murray Abraham, the other face of Harris Yulin, who is trying to shake Tony as a policeman, Oliver Stone- Ecxellent's script, this movie Brian DePalm's most brilliant point is its long and small career, with this very talented guy or da. The movie looks great. Also, pay attention to two memorable scenes: an elegant restaurant ("Goodnight to the bad guy to"). The other is the final shootout, where Tony shows how he shoots and killing 20 killers that have invaded his home. This is undoubtedly one of the most spectacular endings of a movie I've ever seen.
