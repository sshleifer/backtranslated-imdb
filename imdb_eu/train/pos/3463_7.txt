I'm a Beatles fan. My favorite Beatle is Paul and my favorite is John. I've always met the Beatles' music and the truth of the recovery, as well as John Lennon's family and Paul's Wings. I was curious to know how John and Paul could manage the relationship between so many years. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with this movie. Although the story itself was a fiction, many references used by both musicians were very accurate. Among them, Yoko Ono was always with John, where the Wings song, "Silly Love Songs", was a success of that year and a concert on the roof of Apple Studios "Let It Be." br /> <br /> The actors did a great job when joining John and Paul. The accent might have had more work, but it seems that the Beatles have just pretended to be as long ago as I read. I also liked their conversation, which is essentially the whole movie. <br /> <br /> At first, I was annoyed, but if you think more about it, you are more grateful, especially that was it. how was it really real life? "Saturday Night Live" (Beatles performs $ 3,000) shows a fantastic offering to play on the show. (They offered more than $ 220 million) In general, I was not disappointed with this movie. Actually, why do Beatles create them and why they did not get back together.
