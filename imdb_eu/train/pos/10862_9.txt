Elections are a mafia movie, or in this case tr√≠adas. Every two years every year, elections are held to decide a new head, and it seems that they first know Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai, or as I know, "The Other Tony Leung") and Lok (Simon Yam). who had the full judge's contact!). After gaining ground, Big D does not want to accept the decision and is confident in recognizing a new leadership. Unlike any other movie that Gangster sees, this is not an action movie. It has its bloody moments, when needed, just like Goodfellas, but essentially the drama is just really effective. There are many characters, it's very difficult to track, but I think all of this is a bit crazy. For a hundred years, a stick, the symbol of the power I mentioned earlier, changes your hands several times before settling things. And it seems that the film ends at the end of the 65 or 70 minutes, although there are still some great surprises. Simon Yam is my favorite character here and a similar picture. <br /> <br /> The election was the winner of the Hong Kong Film Awards last year, winning the best actor (Tony Leung), the best directors, the best directors. (Johnny To, who made Heroic Trio !!), and the best script. Cinematography, edition, film score (I loved it) and three theater performances (including Yam).
