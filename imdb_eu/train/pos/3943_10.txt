In the American book Lincoln, in a good book, historian Merrill Peterson, Young Mr.Lincoln, calls it "boring, horrible movie." This surprisingly wrong analysis proves that the great historians have no critical shorts. I'm doing a PhD thesis on Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. As part of my essay writing, I made a careful analysis of this film, and I presented the excellent interpretation by Tag Gallaghers in his Ford's basic book. Mr. Lincoln comes out at the end of the first phase of the first film by Ford in 1939. At that time in Hollywood, Ford directed three great films, which were not yet fully appreciated: the battery Mohawk, Stagecoach and Young Mr. Lincoln. . It seemed surprising that Stagecoach seems not to be fully appreciated, but only among critics it is necessary to understand that it is the westernmost, and perhaps one of the biggest films of all time. However, NO is totally appreciated that these three films work together as a trilogy, a triptych. Ford creates a mythical American story on the screen. Battery during the Mohawk Revolution War. Lincoln is a young citizen of the Civil War in America. In the end, the Civil War in Diligence is in America. The three films are in common with the widespread meditation on Adam of America and its "wild challenge." What are the psychic and social costs of American goods as long as they try to build a new desert in America? American Lincoln symbolizes traveling, because it seeks to reconcile the impersonal civilization (law) with the freedom of desert. Lincoln is not a story (it's full of historical "Howlers", both known as Ford and Trotti), but the myth, which is Lincoln, is a symbol of justice and mercy, a man of Lincoln, a desert man. He found himself inside a civilization and became a "militant" American youth. Mr. Lincoln is not a long play about Lincoln's resemblance to James Age's play, and as a biography of Sandburg, he is an epic poem ... a beautiful epic poem.
