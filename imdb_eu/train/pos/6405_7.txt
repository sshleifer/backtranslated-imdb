I thought the prejudice and prejudice against Carl Brashe was very dramatic for the Hollywood effect. I do not believe that the United States navy is very racist. I can not imagine that the whole captain, the official commander, will never tell himself to fall asleep somebody. It's definitely not life-threatening. And it's never been the main officer, but it's all harmless to the WASP DeNiro character. While he was playing he was not headed and drunk, the Chief Master would first rise. Cuba Gooding saved another misunderstood film.
