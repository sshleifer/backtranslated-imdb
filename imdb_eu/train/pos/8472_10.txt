I totally agree. I thought it was an excellent movie for Gilligans island children's pools, and we can say that almost unknown Plato.it was almost unknown, and that's why it's almost impossible to ignore it. I did not fear and I would not want to end it. But it was unusual how it was done. The children's characters were excellent and I do not know what I expected. The plot also has much more to say about these kids than the fact that the children were experts in the very central plot of the fisherman, especially the initiality also helps them extract jam jam jam. It does not even have too much. I think that it does in less than 95 minutes with watches
