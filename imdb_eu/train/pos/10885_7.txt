Twelve years ago, production stopped when the product was "Hot Blooded". Now, some movie students have decided to end the movie, even though the movie is a damn rumor. Well, you know that some curse is true. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Scream was released, all countries seemed to want to succeed, even Australia. The concept of death today (a slasher movie within a slasher movie) was quite fresh and original at that time. The movie was released before Urban Legends: Final Cut and Scream 3 (well in the US but not in Australia), which was felt like the first movie in this concept. When Urban Legends 2 was released, many of us had the concept ready and since it was not a good movie, the worst movie was awakened. Now, Cut is never the best slasher film, or even trying. He knows it's rough, and they also draw a girl like Neve Campbell's blonde version. But instead of adding some new and original rhythms of the story, some slasher-80s decided to take the "Nightmare on Elm Street" and surprisingly, it really works. The killer is very awesome and it's just a killer mask! And instead of attempting to scare audiences to death, they have created a very good and awesome atmosphere that guarantees most of the movie. There are some movie holes in the movie, but I could not completely discard it, being the biggest part hole in the movie. Before the spoiler; I mean, they only played a single copy of the movie, where they found the last scene they showed in print? It does not make sense to tell you. End of disasters In the end, the line line up with a stupid story Cut is terribly awesome, but I've never had much to do with one of Scream's best roles. I'm surprised I never got it, but I think it was too late. <br /> <br /> Australia's slasher is rugged with very little movement. Cut still has a slasher movie that is quite clear and I should recommend it, even though the story is quite absurd, it's totally playful.
