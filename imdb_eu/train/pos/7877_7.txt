Write the word <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. It's not really! This is the myth that Madhur Bhandar embodies and glamorous and fascinates the pages of his diaries (read the traditions of the party), that is to say, the life of our only whirlwind (read party customs). . <br /> <br /> Page 3 is a phenomenon that is deplorable, as it is enigmatic. What exactly was the control over the printed word, and when there was a discussion on the initial page, there was a debate. The Bhandar clearly avoids this. Only the mechanics of this grotesque life are concerned. To this end, it brings together various elements of this lifestyle. As with Robert Altman (although I do not compare Bhandar's to the genius of Altman), Bhandar uses many characters to promote the cause. Whether it's the NRI page 3, those who attack the door, the newcomer, the next model, the social politician or the erotic novel authors; All characters have a purpose, each with its own character sketch, although the parts may be small. Instead, it sets the appeal of the film. <br /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma with young and talented journalist on today's page 3. In principle, his work begins with the rigor of his subspecies that covers his fake and cosmetic deceits. But the Bhandar is confronting the temptation to enter into a moral-movie movie that makes it difficult for a single character to be taken into account. That's why the movie is not only about Madhavi, but about Deepak Suri (Boman Iran); Editor Madhavi, an editor who accepts himself as a role for a bigger machine, Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - a society that suffers from social contamination. Abhijeet (engineer Rehan) - homosexual makeup artist and Madhavi's unstoppable star and Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - an aspiring actress. In a single story it seems impossible to assimilate so many characters (and more), but Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi's entire credit write a rough script. The interviews by Sanjeev Datta and Bhandar have been carefully documented. <br /> <br /> Any narrative, whatever it may be, may fall real when there are no real performances. Luckily, the 'Page 3' actors and not going out. Konkona is favored by the author's role. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best part of it, but it's almost over. Atul Kulkarni is wasted with a character written. Sometimes the director seems to be keen to access (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts used do not run. <br /> <br /> In the end, the Bhandarers are going to complete their voyeurism, but take a step further. It takes us through the pictures and seems like an amazing and distant world that reaches us as an amazing sight of this humanity sect. These are the same people who were immersed in celebrations of the new year, a hundred miles away, whose villagers stole the wildlife of nature. A fast writing, a skillful introduction of songs, a real feeling of plays and honesty, this film is essential, despite the fact that it is pure and productive values. 'Page 3' is a perfect way to enter a new film year. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Rating- **** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average + *** Good **** Very good * **** Excellent <br /> <br /> January 29, 2005
