I rented this movie in DVD format without knowing anything about it, every night to watch a movie in the winter part of the marathon. After some horrific American action adventure films (Ballistic, Daredevil, Life of Cradle) I found Zhu Warriors a brilliant original film. The story is full of nonsense, but I found the film's honesty, heartfelt and a lack of irony, and the movie is spectacular. Surely, special effects are not technically superb Hollywood producers, but the filmmaker makes sense that color, composition and movement are more interested than realism, and therefore they are very good. In a single movie, two superhuman characters are rocks on tearing rocks, creating a giant moon in front of them. The three elements are a perfectly balanced image. In another, the princess warrior passes through the sky behind his bright sword, looking for heat. And the colors are shot through a shot, expressing emotions rather than expressing reality. <br /> <br /> The characters have the same simplicity and correctness as comic characters, but they do not offer much depth but archives. they resonate deeper. Physically, many actors are amazingly beautiful. Their functions act directly, irony or deceptively, and are therefore credible. <br /> <br /> It's totally strange, though the plot conditions and characterization are thin, I found them near tears. the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wonderful and original vision of the director. <br /> <br />
