The beginning of this film is a bit rough and confusing, but you can be sitting down under the guidance of your life. The concept is compelling, in general, with interesting devices used to tell the story. There are good concerts around Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but it's not surprising. Ethan Hawke also deserves a very good performance. Mr. Lumet's leadership is outstanding. The film feels in the seventies when we face the risks of telling this story, unlike most of the rough films that populate the current landscape, which is really a thriller based on special relationships or product plugs. . There will be a lot of time invested in this film.
