Last November, I had the chance to see this movie at the Reno Festival. I must say it was so fun. Apart from a few technological errors, it has been an excellent experience. I loved writing and acting, especially the guy who played the role. There's a lot of hearts in this movie. I did the opportunity to talk with some filmmakers and it seemed really nice to them. The whole movie was a totally positive experience, and I would definitely recommend it. The story was fun and enjoyable; As a woman, I had a lot of lead problems, and I really could understand the problems. The film is a great job to play with the public. The friends in the movie are very well written, they are realistic. I know people like this, I only want friends from Imy and I feel as cool as this people when we talk. The whole movie is real, I'd like more movies. <br /> <br /> - Jayden
