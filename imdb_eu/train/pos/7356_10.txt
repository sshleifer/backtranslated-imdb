If you do not see Eva Longoria's "Desperate House Wives" TV, you're missing it. Eva will be one of the greatest stars of Latinos and you will soon see in theaters. Eva was the first movie and made an excellent job. He shot at the age of 24, and then he looked hot. In this low-budget film, the director is very good for the first time, a newly released "Juarez, Mexico" film that will be premiered in many United States film festivals. In fact, some news seems to have limited theatrical release. An "Snitch'2" with a higher budget is more spectacular.
