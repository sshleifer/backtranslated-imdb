This is an excellent movie for Generation X'ers. Another 1972 world of America was compared to our 21st century psychotic. A missing American in 1972 could make sense when watching this movie. I found that the costumes and car styles brought me great memories of a much better country than now. Think ... then 4 or 5 TV stations were only available. There was AIDS, terrorist Muslims, Road Rage, 911, Bird Flu, Freeway Snipers, etc. The Vietnam war ended. Star Wars will be 7 years before it runs out. Personal computers and Internet users should still be 29 years old. <br /> <br /> This first film was not intended by other film companies that had to make films by producers themselves. Therefore, small Protestant churches began to visit when they appeared on film projectors throughout the country (VCRS day before, of course). A robber would get a copy of a church shepherd who could interest him to show Nongro Thief. Then he arranged an afternoon to show up in the church's meeting room or lunch room. Congregation members would invite "unresolved" friends and relatives and would be a social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If only the limited value of the production of the film can be seen and only for nostalgic value, I think that you will enjoy more movies. Of course, I say. <br /> <br /> If it was a time machine, I returned to 1972 and now we will see the XXI. century wells
