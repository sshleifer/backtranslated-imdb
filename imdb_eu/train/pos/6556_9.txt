I really liked this movie. I'm a single dad, a 17-year-old daughter, elegant, athletic and talented. My daughter asked me so well to solve crimes and help others! So for me, maybe Fantasyland is a PG level. My Nancy Drew has read many books for my younger years, for some time. You're sure that this character was played by Emma Roberts, but I do not remember Nancy Drew's books. Therefore, due to the script and not the performance. <br /> <br /> Emma, ​​a confident young woman, is confident, responsible and proud of himself, with good manners and good taste. He is not trapped in a rivalry around him. There are some weaknesses in the plot, not just like Nancy Drew in books, but also trying to figure out what's in the decade (for example, what's that CAR?) <br /> <br /> I read the overview before watching the movie, I was working with Rachael Leigh Cook in other films. This is not one of his best roles, but I'm going to continue looking for his more films. Rachael was too old to play the lead, but he does a wonderful job as he orphan the orphan in the middle of the mystery. <br /> <br /> Here are some other very well-written reviews. Some people expect a better link with books, some expect credible or mature films. I expected everything! Good entertainment, aimed at young girls, and their parents want good children with high standards of behavior and achievement. This is the Teen PG Movie, not James Bond! What should you have a role model for teenage daughter?
