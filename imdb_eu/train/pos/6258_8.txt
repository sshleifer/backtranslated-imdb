You may have jumped from the beginning. I do not know why it starts in the Turkish part of Asia. If they were to go to the Mediterranean, they could be closer to today's Lebanon. <br /> <br /> Bakhtyari tribe chambers and crew arrived, starting a stunning 48-day trip. 250,000 goats, 50,000 camels, camels, and horses around the Karun river seem to be moving very fast. The ducks' skins are used to penetrate the ships. Where the head and legs are removed. The other "bank" of the river was very steep: I guess I'm rising 60 degrees. <br /> <br /> That was incredible, but much more came. To reach the pasture, they also had to overcome a large snowfall at four feet at four feet, but not at all. It was quite amazing to climb this mountain, and in spite of everything (but of all the animals) they barefoot on the mountain! Yes, barefoot. <br /> <br /> The disadvantages of this documentary were some of the titles with bad mock-ups. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary of the world, or this tribe not only incredible challenges, but conquer it. This is just an incredible document of a well-known group to face all kinds of challenges.
