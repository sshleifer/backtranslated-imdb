Finding this movie is difficult. The hero of the film (and writer and director) is Simon Geist with "an agenda". He created fake magazines with Los Angeles pork actors, actors, models, musicians ... to become an authority for interviewing. He thinks his defection does not smell. With a clear dialogue, Zucovic gets it. Surely, the budget of this film is probably what one pays for used cars, but this film is very strong and well written, it works well. Any person who can confirm the "Screaming" of Edward Munk, a reflection of a silver hat on a local cafe, should be picked up. Give this opportunity to the movie and listen to what it says ... Since 1986 they're doing the same car ... it's a car. Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
