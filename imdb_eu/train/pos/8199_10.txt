The Enforcer (1976) was the official "Dirty Harry Trilogy" after the last chapter of the series. Dirty Harry is back, older, more dirty than the original classic of 1971. <br /> <br /> Dirty Harry has killed a killer psychopath, vigilant police and veteran terrorists in Vietnam in the past. But now a new murderer, the murderer who is looking for the deceased, after his attackers, <br /> <br /> Sudden Impacts is a new sensation and a darker tone for Harry Dirty. Callahan is a new case of murder, turning to a woman led by Sondra Lock. He has traumatized himself with his sister. After ten years he has taken revenge on firing his attackers. The same is true when Callahan can cause problems for his bosses, when the boss of the underworld strikes them, he also hunts the mafia. So, to kill the heat inside the city, Harry needs to take vacation on holiday on the coast, but at the same time he ravaged the victim in the city because he hunted one by one among attackers. Harry is in the process of investigation and finds the murderer very similar, as he lives in killer routes. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact seems to be one of my 10th-century movies as well. Harry Sink's second best movie is much better than The Enforcer and The Dead Pool. Sudden Impact has the original dirty Harry value, a shades of entertaining value. <br /> <br /> So you feel lucky?
