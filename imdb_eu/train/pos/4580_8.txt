Tam Tam's princess is out of racism, as we think racism in the United States, but at that time more arguments about ethnic identities are subtle (American viewers). Pay attention to how Alwin's (Baker) plan is directed by other people, which depict the surrounding settings as "wild" in Africa, and ask yourself any agency with Alwina. I do not want to ruin it, but finally, paying close attention to detail, means that the dichotomy between "Eastern" and "Western" is at least an offense. The French have been past in all the depicted areas of imperial imagery (see Chris Marker's Les Statues Meurent Aussi-1953), and pay attention to those who visit Europeans during their visit to Africa, and what do they reflect on their attitudes? towards the "other". This movie is a 7th because I'm selling Baker and working on his professional career. Tam Tam, a regressive, has been overtaken by the efforts of integration because his work is horrible (I'm sorry to say, sorry.) But movies for me It is brilliant because of its performance and the relic of ancient mentalities is also significant.
