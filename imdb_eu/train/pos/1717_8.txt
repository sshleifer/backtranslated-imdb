The story is about Ankush (Abhay Deol): it is a witness to a professional wedding. In summary, he is a witness to the couples of marriage registries, and Megha (Soha Ali Khan) escaped from Nainital's house when he married him. Love interest Dhiraj (Shayan Munshi). The story begins Megha to show the wedding registry at the Dhiraj office, but for some reason it will not appear. So Ankush appears here, in order to win an image that Meghakin approached. He witnesses his testimony of 200 witnesses and eventually helps him to be his sponsor. Ankush grows on his side, in the bank that works as Agent ... Ankush Megha falls and falls in love with him (or kind of love). They agree in consensus and they will appear in the Dhiraj figure. Unexpected circumstances occur, I should actually say, unexpected reactions with the circumstance and then ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > The story of a really movie is not a film that we see but I do not think it's going to accept it. But if you're a movie theater like myself, I'd like to see something different and then you'll like the movie. The film is just an innocent love story written by Abhay Deola and Soha Ali Khan. The characters are so natural that you feel like the things that happen to you next. The background role of the movie is also very good, it's very good. Delhi's way of showing is very good and it gives a new feeling. <br /> <br /> So let's cut it and shorten it. <br /> <br /> The story: A very common story that came with a very good and wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> Music: Well, as Himesh Reshammiya was born, so I did not expect much, but I still liked a couple of Qawwali's song songs. <br /> <br> Session: Abhay Deol was the most amazing performance, very natural and innocent, but he had to sing in songs. Soha Ali Khan, doll, a very nice doll. Again, this is a very innocent and natural two theater and these two actors are perfectly suited to their characters. Out of these two, Shayan Munshi needs some acting lessons and little grease layers to cover bones. Other actors performed their work well. <br /> <br /> Stars: I also had 5 stars with 5 stars. You can enjoy the movie seen in the theater, I would recommend watching it in the theater, you are accepting movie freaks and traditional stories. Otherwise, wait until the DVD arrives. The movie will definitely not be liked by the masses, and the business it can do is oral advertising.
