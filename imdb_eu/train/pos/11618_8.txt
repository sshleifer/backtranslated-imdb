Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. Dream Team. This is one of the best thrill of 2005. Excellent land Excellent recording Eye candy This is one of Wes Craven's biggest films, apart from "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street." This can be the best. Land is one of the best things about the movie and it's very easy. Lisa Reisert (McAdams), hotel manager, retrieved to Red Eye LA. Little Ripper (Murphy) Jackson Ripner has continued. They make a couple of drinks and sit together in the background. Later, he was reportedly murdered as a killer sent to the Lisa's hotel, Homeland Security. And what should she do with Lisa? Well, the room had to be taken to his upper room to be bombarded if Ripner does not kill his father (Brian Cox). The story's rotation and contribution really gives the senses and side characters and side jokes. In general, one of the best thrillers in 2005 is definitely worth a visit. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 star 4
