I recall that when I saw the age of 3, my parents accidentally recorded, but for a few seconds, with other cartoons. So when I was 8 or 9 years old again and I was able to find out better things, I thought it was a good movie. Fast progress A few weeks ago (June 2006) I found again some articles / video clips on the internet and it's just not the same movie. I'm sure that he is still working with children, but in 20-30 days he wrote "Kultu Status". The pity is that original production has gone through a painful process; If Fox has enough time, it probably would be in the best eye today. Maybe they should redo a completely different story and have a star-cast voice, but it's up to Fox to decide. I know here, I know. I still think it's an excellent movie, but it can be a perfect one.
