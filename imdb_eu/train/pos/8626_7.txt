"Der Todesking" is not the type of film that hangs you up? This second cult cult of Jörg Buttgereit is much better than the evil "Necromant", there are seven short episodes? One per week per week? It is based on the suicide of people who have nothing to do with it. Among the events that are already very worrying, Buttgereit incorporates really awesome images by decomposing the serious body of the male. The episodes are not all equally strong, but, as healthy, "Der Todesking" is the highest among the most depressed contemporary art films. Particularly on Wednesday's episodes, the men explaining the sexual frustration of the park and the Sunday, focusing on younger men that are causing the deceased, are very vigilant. The added value or similarity of this movie is controversial and I do not know if Buttgereit has a message type or to communicate here. It's a mysterious letter from the chain, because it helps the reader to commit suicide, but above all we are informed about the motivations of those people. I expected it as completely, "Der Todesking" is not an exploitative or repulsively graphic! On the contrary, in truth, I would never expect that Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful about the portrait of pure human misery. This is a perfect example of this Thursday's episode, which shows different views of a famous German bridge, to show names, ages and professions of people who have jumped on the screen. Production values ​​are necessarily poor and the edition often lacks professionalism, but this is not really counted on this type of cinema. Is the matter so strong and forcing you to look less cheerful? but is it essential? life aspects Great use of tragic music too!
