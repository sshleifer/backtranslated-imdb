I can say that he has paid attention to the first film of this season. I received it from Gere and Claire, and I saw that the story was promising ... I've seen it and I can say it ... I was overwhelmed. Scenes are amazing, it's true ... but that's what makes them realistic. They would not escape from our reality, these things are happening at the moment. There are experts who try to change things and taste things better and laugh about their commitment to this. Actually, I can not feel "Hollywood touch" in the movie ... and that's better. Claire and Richard performed wonderful roles, worth 10 of them.
