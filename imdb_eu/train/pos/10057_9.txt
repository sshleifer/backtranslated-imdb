Last night I went to bed in my bed, and while I washed my teeth, I turned the channels, until I found this masked Chinese movie called mask. I thought I was going to have a Kung Fu film at the beginning, so I saw it, and it quickly caught me and I had to finish it. <br /> <br /> The movie girl was absolutely adorable. It was so big actress as a result of being so little. Perhaps it was in Chinese, English was duplicated, so it was harder to tell me ... but it was really similar. I felt very bad for the girl trying to please her "boss", but everything just got worse. lol. He also brought another grandson to overcome his art ... he was kidnapped by the baby, so he is detained for 5 days. lol ... that touches him to be an effort to be nice to his grandfather. <br /> <br /> In the end, he sees how much love there is and teaches the art of the mask ... that is, unfortunate due to the misfortune of the movie. <br /> <br /> A rarity, and completely original.
