The movie was a good end in general; the plays were spectacular and diverted to people who did not depict characters. I liked the shard especially, although he knew what would happen, he was still a surprise item in the whole movie. However, I found that it might be a bit longer (perhaps stretched) with the arrival of the end - it seemed to me a little shaken; before trying to get rid of the lines before falling off the sun. For example, what happened to Tristan's brother Hayden? We all know that he was killed in the hospital. Maybe he set up the whole thing ?! Who knows! Maybe it will be a sequel? Maybe? There are ... I can not wait to see.
