While shooting at the National Guard of Florida, "Tigerland" reminded me of Fort Polk, LA, shooting ranges, maneuvering areas, deep waists and all. The movie was authentic and similar to the AIT-like characters in 1974. The 1974 Tigland in 1971, and the 1974 year old drunk mine drunk in 1974, all sergeants and teachers know they have not returned to Vietnam. It was quite fixed, so the training was very relaxed, it was not a challenge. It was a pioneer of all our problems in the 70s and 80s, when I became acquainted with them until 2004. I never heard any "Tigerland" mentioned, but the army had a real training nation in Vietnam on different US bases. As Vietnam Vets told me, they told me that, until 1972 and AIT, they were pretty rough and rugged, because the shoes were there and they were instructed to train Vietnamese men, this was not always. Polk drill-sergeants and later one of my Viet Nam veterinarians, when we became a teacher of a basic training coach in Fort Bliss, they did not know anyone was willing to do anything and to know and imagine people. himself This movie is very high.
