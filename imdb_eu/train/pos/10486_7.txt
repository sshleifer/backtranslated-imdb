"Saving grace" has never been fun, but it gives me great laughter and I really liked it. Brenda Blethyn is a good actress and she works well in portraying Grace's widow, which is growing marijuana to pay off debts. It also works to help you work. French actor Tchecky Karyo has a fun little role. The premise is only attractive. It's a fun idea of ​​a woman growing and smoking on the mountain. And the film's premise is completely unwise from time to time. Of course, there are flat moments, as two-year-old women leave Grace's marijuana, which leaves leaves for tea, and starts spreading children's work in the store they work for. That was not quite pushed. The movie tone is in the bottom and occasionally it's sad, but I laughed enough to import a recommendation in English. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (10)
