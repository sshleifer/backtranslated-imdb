Film is horrible. I can not remember the Swedish movie I saw lately in layers. It's fun, it's tragic, compelling, and especially, it's a slice of life in the small Swedish town. He clings to Klica and keeps it deeper. Not only with the main characters, it makes you feel like a relationship with all the characters. <br /> <br /> A great city in its roots, following its birth, celebrating the 70th birthday of his father. people that have not met in a few years. Although it's not the story, it offers a new perspective. In the middle of the story it is a relation between the three sisters (in different stages of life), which are not very close. Or at least they do not know how much it has been closed. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons that makes it easy to connect with people in this movie is an awesome cast. First of all, I am very pleased that these films are not called 'A-list' Swedish actors. There is usually a large number of actors who are able to access nearly all of Sweden's most important productions. This time he managed to keep the production company through the actors that seem to love the true profession. Sofia Helin is surely Eva RÃ¶se is the first actor in Sweden to prove that you do not need to convey emotion. <br /> <br /> Writing is very attractive. The conversation is more than incredible, and compared to the other Swedish movies of the last year or two years, it's only one thousand. Maria Blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you do not, you should never guess that writing and directing the first feature. I can not wait next. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it, you want to see it.
