I have to say that I did not have any idea to sit and watch the movie. I think there was nothing better to do with class. But for every television I got interested. Most importantly, Helen Hunt has received my eye. I was not really passionate about this movie before. Surely Twister and Like I Like Good Gets. But he really did something about that movie. I would see a great fan now. This movie ... it has high marks like me. Give us a chance, it will not leave you.
