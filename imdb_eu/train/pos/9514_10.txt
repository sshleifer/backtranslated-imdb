This is one of the best films ever I have ever seen. Hanks, Newman and all others play it. Undoubtedly, Jude Law's best performance. Cinematography is magnificent, it is as good as the edition and also includes an excellent original score that matches the movie's atmosphere. Production design is also a factor that makes this film unique. For me, it's a lot more to overcome Padrinoa, but fantastic filmography has won this competition. No doubt the Best Feature Film in my book.
