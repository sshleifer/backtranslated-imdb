I own this movie and have seen it several times since its release. The Prince does not surprise us with his great style of acting, or music, and I feel like I feel here, considering this story, it is the best. Much of this film is straightforward and adolescent, but it is the guilty of the director / writers, although it is the best film with the best music. The main and moral beliefs of Purple Rain are very strong and because we are taught based on more films, we would be better in every environment because art reflects the life that reflects art.
