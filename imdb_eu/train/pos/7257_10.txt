Why do I write his script as a screenplay? I did not know very much about what I was doing until I was asked to watch the movie. I wrote to some producers, they told me. Because Alan Dobie was friendly to me, I was informed. I just wrote the first draft, because I was worried about the sound of the soil. I asked Peter Collinson, if I'd like to make another sketch through my agents. I asked to see my original screenplay because I lost it. They told me too late. So I did the only thing I did in these situations and I took my name. I do not know what they can do with my script. Then I was invited to see the finished movie. I was very impressed to ask my name very quickly. It was a beautiful piece of paper, starting with a first draft written, I expected a lot more work to do with it; maybe I would not be so good. Would you like to see my original script again if someone knows where it is? I would like to see the movie again, I only saw it once in a small Soho theater show.
