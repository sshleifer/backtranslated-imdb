I can not say it's a fan of comic books, although I have read my fee, so I think I'm part of the audience of this movie and I was not disappointed. At the end of the day it's not exhausted, it almost sheds light on ideas and Lena Olin, like one of my favorite actors, seems to have dropped off on the cutting floor. Also, a piece of Hank Azaria Blue Raja can go a long way. However, it's easy to forgive all those crashes if you have a very funny movie. All actors think they feel terribly awesome with their papers, especially William H. Macy Shoveler as a straight arrow and The Bowler as Janeane Garofalo. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the joke even more fun. I really liked the disco-disco's musical selection of boys; somehow, it seemed to him right.
