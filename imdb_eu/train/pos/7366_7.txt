The main market is probably never a movie that is accessed, since it is not easily seen by the viewer. Spotted Spike and the story about Heaton is not a specific Friday night movie, however, it has its own unique edge and it seemed entertaining to me. There are some brilliant films at some moments, such as Spike shot a small budget, for example when Spike poured aerosol. However, I do not understand the relationship between Spike and Heat, and I'm trying to get the most out of it, being honest. And also, I did not like the fact that most of the films were talking with two friends and not so much "action." It's a small, complex movie to watch, which is appealing.
