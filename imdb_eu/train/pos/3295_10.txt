A beauty movie that is difficult to describe. Maybe it's an unfamiliar conversation, or maybe it's just a star soundtrack, or maybe it's just Meena Mumari's feet, but it's a joy to watch this movie over and over again. I never approach another Indian film, and few of every country compete with its perfection.
