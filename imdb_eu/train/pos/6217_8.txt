Follow Float, a RKO production in 1936, featuring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in a romantic comedy complex. Although Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had a number of similar romantic films, RKO helped shape the situation of society in terms of state of affairs. According to the story of Follow the Fleet, it depends on the use of layered lines between the two main characters, to create a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie's general drawing is based on a Bake Baker, a boat. Fred Astaire and Sherry Martin, the peace love and dance couple, played by Ginger Rogers and danced in the US Navy. Their story begins at the beginning of the Bake ship and Bilge Smith's wife's wife finds a picture taken together, and Bake has revealed that she was asked to marry her the last time she saw her, so Bilge waits and unites. When he's on the floor, he expects a friend. <br /> <br /> The next main scene begins with the second story of the movie, Connie Martin, Sherry's sister, when she refuses to enter Paradise, if she does not drive a sister, she does not drive. It turns around behind Bilba and a drink bag, so he plays, as if he were waiting for him, and bought a paradise ticket too. Connie then finds out that Sherry finds out that she can not be lucky with men, so Sherry suggests getting a makeover with her friends on stage. Connie throws herself into the room and returns to Bilgira, her eyes are scared. This begins with the second romantic tale between Bilge and Connie. <br /> <br /> In the rest of the film, stories and rising acts are changing the comical reliefs of two pairs of pain. Within the entire plot. Bake and Sherry beat their first moments while competing in a dance competition and they won, reminding them of the success and enjoyment they had been doing together. Likewise, Bilg allows Connie to overcome romantic attempts to please her and retire to her home. <br /> <br /> The happy succession event soon takes the worrying measures, as the upsurge goes down. He left for peace before Sherry's night before retiring the boat before midnight, and said he would come in his morning. Unfortunately, the ship is returning vehicles, after returning from Sherry, and Bake is still a typical sailor. <br /> <br /> The hoax has changed again when another sub-beam flares in the movie when it's raining on a "big plane party". This alternative story period is used to create a buffer between stories of the two main relationships of the film, as well as the confidence and love of all good intentions of Peace. The break of the party is an unforgettable music created by Bake and its companions, losing a company deck. Their sisters will be glad to hear and play, and Bake is glad to be entertained with some dances. In the end, it helps to alleviate the mood of the film, as well as the happiness of the sailors. <br /> <br /> After returning to the story that relates to the couple, he tries to prove to Sherry Bake that he does not have the help he needs to land his job. Unfortunately, Bake does not know how to listen, and Sherry puts a good word in her studio when her listener listens to her amazing lady. When peace seeks for water, he is in charge of offering Sherry help, not singing well and destroying his hearing. Apart from the failures of peace, Connie spent all his money to solve the ship that would take Bilge as the captain. He planned a great dinner date for his partners when he supposed it would come, but Bilg understood his intentions and hopes that soon he would marry and he was no longer interested in it. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie keeps the mini-action up and down in the same format until it reaches the climax between the two couples, ending with both of them. The use of storytelling helps to build interest and emotion within each couple, both through happiness and pain as well as through each fight. Interaction stories are capable of linking each other and include sub-sections that do not come into contact with the end of the narrative. <br /> <br /> Even though Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have a lot of movies together, including romance, comedy, song and dance, it's the only film to use with Follow the Fleet sub-tabs technique. the narrative between the two main characters.
