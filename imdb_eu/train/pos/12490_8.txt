Allen and Julie walk in the cabin after her daughter died a night. Nobody knows the girl who killed her but why they went to the mountain. So they enter the couple's cabin and people are dying there, and everyone in the surrounding area does not want to talk about it. <br /> <br /> This movie has an incredibly marketable experience, and that's why I've leapt a lot. Some parts can be previewed, but it's a part of what I expected from time to time. The pretty movie was not the worst movie in the world, but it was still pretty scary to be pretty good. <br /> <br /> Also, I liked the end because it decided how the viewer was. it will end. Also, a sad movie, but a well-made horror movie.
