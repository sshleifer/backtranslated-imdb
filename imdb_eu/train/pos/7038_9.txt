"The first war will be 100% subcontracted". Dan Ackroyd's line says everything. It's hard to describe this movie; comedy, satire, action, screw. He reminded Strangelove twice or twice, especially in Ben Kingsley (I think he did an excellent job). I had no special hope for this movie, although I'm a fan of John Cusack, I just let the movie clean. And that's why I was very entertained. The political satire is wicked and the complex US business complex is very damaging. Sub-plot plots were predictable, but it was deserving the final lines of the stories. I understand why the film was not very popular in the US, but it is a story that is appropriate for the whole world.
