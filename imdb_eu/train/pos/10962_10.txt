It is interesting how the research train can be started. I began to explore the article about "The Gates" in Central Park. The article stated that Maysle has been the Christ's for many years. Hmmm ... Then I got to look at their work. I think one of them has passed, but the other is still filmed by Christ and Jean Claude during the creative periods. Gray Gardens is very interesting. In Boulder CO, the Video Station is looking for a dark or disconnected place and, of course, they were on sale. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women who live in the past, and oh it was a terrible past. Edith was very well, Bouvier was born well married, she had a wonderful relationship and became a singer in the forties. Her daughter Edie was fashionable and angry at Beaus. He never married and in the thirties he returned home again. It seems to have a certain nervousness. Too worried. It's just the shadow of the world they live, since Jackie O. had come to a place where her aunt and cousin could not get away, so they would not be expelled. It is a house with 28 rooms and it is worn and falls. But in the movie you will see fresh paintings on the walls. Looking carefully at the newspaper cuttings, it was very badly dirty. Edie Costume has a lot of light and creativity. Image viewer Edithe likes to leave naked but does not film. Edith was pretty lovely and you'll still see her shade of beauty while still singing "Tea for Two". Edie also had a great beauty during his time and 56 years was quite attractive. It was a good movie but not everyone. When the cat gets awed after Edith's behavior, he says: "At least someone is doing what you want!"
