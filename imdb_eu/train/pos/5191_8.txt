Scott is well. There is a fighting sword of two different people in the middle of the film. Swords with several fighters are not the best, though quite good. However, it is best to compare the Japanese-style samurai movies with the films in the center. In my opinion, the Chinese left scene has never surpassed the Japanese as regards the value of entertainment. Especially for a man who has to fight a group of enemies, such as the Japanese films Excel, Lone Wolf and Cub series. Even though Japanese filmmaking sessions were in seconds or a maximum of one minute, the intensity of these moments improved. However, it is an example where Japanese Chinese swords surpass. In the middle of this film the scene was five minutes long with the most amazing choreography. The other good films in this movie are, though they sucked the movie, they would also get 7 scenes. If you have not seen it, it is necessary. John Woo is a man.
