If you have not enjoyed this movie, either the deceased, or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. <br /> <br /> Everything that was brilliantly thrown out gave good performances. This film proves Adam Sandler is a good actress, despite critics. Adam Sandler has become a very respected actor. All started with the Big Daddy's work, then he produced a couple of filmmakers and then 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard's superb performance, then click on and now Reign Over Me. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything. As for the family, it has mother-in-law and mother-in-law. After colliding with his old classmate friend Cheadle, he fluttered his life. I will not say more because I do not want to break the movie, but I recommend this movie. One of the best films of 2007
