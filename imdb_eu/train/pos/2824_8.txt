Greta Garbo's American filmmaker is the path of our life in the analogy of fate and our actions; Like in a torrent, it helps us lose some part of ourselves. <br /> <br /> Greta plays. Leonora, the owner of Ricardo Rafael Cortet, the owner of Rafael. Ricardo is in love with her, but she is easily affected by her mother. Leonora is homeless and travels to Paris. In which he becomes a famous opera singer and develops a reputation for being a loose woman. Actually, the part of his attitude has more bitterness than Rafael's abandonment. <br /> <br /> She returns to her house to visit her family and, in the end, face Rafael. Surprisingly, no-one knows that La Brunna is famous and that Garbaga's role as a diva determines later on her portraits, so incredibly powerful and really important. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez remembers much of Valentino's appearance, and MGM cloned MGM with MGM, but did not think he was in reality and was right. It is incredible a simple part, unmistakably a mother of fashion, as a boy, and at the end of the film he is as realistic as his age. When he returns home he can not win Leonora, and when he continues, his courage is weakened. <br /> <br /> This movie is very well shot, with the great sequence of storms and sets that represent Spain at that time are real. looking for Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall and other great Mack Swain tenors are in second place. <br /> <br /> Although Leonora and Rafael have a story of Lost and Missing Love, they would not believe it. They were happy with each other, because they needed a more traditional wife and it was a very good career, and I do not think it would be a little town. The ending is a real life and there is no punches out. <br /> <br /> See this premier of Garbo's American filmmaker and pioneer of things that will come.
