If you are a cleaner, do not waste your time - otherwise take the hat and enjoy the adventure. I love Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr version - I've seen dozens of times, but this movie is very good, it's different. I did not determine the difference because it ruined the movie. Also, it's nice to see Alison Doody again (I'm a fan of Indiana Jones), Patrick Swayze is just as good as Quatermain, and she is an excellent assistant. The quality of the sample I find the quality of one of the trademarks of Hallmark Production, and this film is no exception. Cinematography is excellent and the score is perfect. If you're looking for entertainment, you're not disappointed.
