I heard good things about this film and, you guessed it, he was a little disappointed. Young Reese Witherspoon is very young, surprisingly good, surprisingly confident; really cast (all small) are all quite solid in the 1950's with easy American setting. I did not have a reason for this movie, it's the main reason, especially, in the end, the pain shown by old sisters did not seem so real and this made me take a little bit of the film. We hope you have to fill it in the plot, or maybe it's a longer film. I think Maureen's highly-developed character. It's understandable that Dani (Reese W., younger) was traumatized and angry, but why does she show that her sisters get angry? Was it a couple of years ago? Is not the final work undermining the rest of the film? The film seems to have met Maureen and Court, when he got the driver (warning: the scene is surprisingly violent, if he looks back, he seems to be trying to impress a bit. It works well). It will depend on what you want - if you want the girl to love the story of a young love, it seems that you want to get it, you will be amazed. Is the man on the moon terribly dreamy and curious and is he a great movie? a fairly bad combination? I liked the nature of the court, I see what girls see what they see. And I loved both daring to hurt my younger sister (most of them men, most of them had no movies) and killed them. <br /> <br /> 7/10 on my scale of evaluation scale. For some reason I found Jason London a fun driver.
