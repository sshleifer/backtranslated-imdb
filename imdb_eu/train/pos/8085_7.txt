Many things you can say about this movie are long, BERRITAN! Recently, two months ago, I bought this movie, seeing a new version coming. I was glad that it was made in 1978, but I have never lived in the 70's, is one of my favorite decades, especially in music! When I saw the movie, the story was very good at the beginning, but after about 50 minutes it started boring and repetitive. The animation will astonish me! I never saw anything well enough to see. But the film could honestly be a bit better; It is likely that only 15 and 20 minute scenes are struggling to speak and story. Then, in the last 5 or 10 minutes, he got the movie again and he got it right, but it ended unexpectedly. I thought it was very long. I know its 2 hours 2 hours more than 2 hours and that's still a cartoon, but it was boring in most movies, it seems like 4 hours long! But in general, I think a good movie and I'll see them again "one day". I'll see the news and I hope it's better!
