I had to give this film 10, because it was made by black audiences shot in so many movies. This movie was a blank video of all the whore mates, and even more gangster, rapper and dumb language. Physicians, African Americans and African Americans have looked at romantic relationships between men and women at a completely new and refreshing level. I was very impressed by the careful mix of dark movies, because it was a tough and heavy theme. You feel at the same time happy and sad. I also saw at the Boston Film Festival. AMC Loews premiered in Boston and I hope that this film makes a lot more audiences. Black people (and all others) would love such a movie LOVE. Industry only put as many SMART out there! <br /> <br /> As an add-on, your doctor, resident, medical student, pre-student, doctor, doctor, brother, family doctor or a great doctor. They also loved this movie. He portrayed state and practice, a medical doctor who watched the doctors, neighbors, and movies were very much appreciated. Dennis Cooper had a total residency in his internal medicine; Therefore, his knowledge / experience definitely applied to the film, which is very evident.
