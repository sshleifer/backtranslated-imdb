When I was 10 or 11, I watched this movie only Saturday in my parents' basement. He appeared on the "Chiller Theater", a horrible feature, I saw young religions. Now, I've seen a lot of old horror films thanks to Chiller Theater, but no one tied me with "Danse Macabre", a.k. "Blood of Castle". I am 51 years old now and I was just lucky last year to find a DVD edition of this supernatural supernatural quality superb quality; I would never think of it again. I've seen them four times and I can not get that tired. <br /> <br /> They do not make such films movies. The haunted Catacombs and the crickets are not black and white in color. However, Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, like a dark enchanted castle, have a number of castles often packed, unstoppable spirits rebuilding their deaths ... and an ironic end to end. <br /> <br /> IMO, that is, with Robert Wise's "Haunting", "The Innocents" (with Deborah Kerr), and the latest "The Others".
