When Shelby awaits Kent Farm from Chloe, Clark attacks and wakes himself up in the middle of a session with Dr. Hudson. He says he has been sad for a five-year-old psychologist, who has come from Krypton and has superpowers. Clark escapes, and Dr. Lana, Martha and Lex know the words of Dr. Hudson. Chloe only believes in his words, but he plays madness too. Clark struggles to find out about his personality and origin. <br /> <br /> "Labyrinth" is definitely an interesting "Smallville" episode. The author, very lucky and original, denied the whole existence of the powerful Krypton boy. An annoying smile gives off feelings of embarrassment and must be clarified by his mysterious sponsor. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Labyrinth" ("Labyrinth")
