This brilliant drama has been constantly on me. I could not get my eyes on the screen in the second, because each word would link the pieces with that stunning exclamation. This movie really touched me, because it showed a sad and hard life. Finally I cried (I do not want to give it up!). In addition, people can be cruel and disgusting as a murderer. <br /> <br /> Cast was very good. The only actress member was Anne Marie. He did a great deal of work, but the director did not. I say this because Anne Marie Fahey has found someone who has not.
