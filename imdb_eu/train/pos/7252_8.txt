I saw the movie before being a British army. I crossed my basic training, at the beginning it was difficult and then I was more easily progressed. During the NI and the Cold War problems I spent time. Sometimes I asked myself, I asked what I got, because long, I would always take training and you would always react to the instinct. The voice over the thinking of the soldiers is used, but I would add a breathing and heart rate, that is to say, because it drums on certain lawns in certain situations. A few years later, I was in Canada to join the family. She lives in the US, aunt and Columbus Uni Ohio. An article on the impact of the British Army on NI. He spent some time investigating. Even though it was very anti-British. He made a line of Bee and he was convicted for being a British soldier. I only saw my answer to the movie 'Long day dying'. A nearest civilian will know what the soldier does for what he does. The answer is OK at the end.
