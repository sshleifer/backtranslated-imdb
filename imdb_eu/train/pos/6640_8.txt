This one-minute movie, it's probably the first movie ever made. Other inventors had previously shot the action - like the photography of Edison's sneeze movement, but Lumiere brothers developed equipment in advanced media. At that time, of course, their cinematographers had to be surprised by their classmates, including their subjects. In the first instance, the brothers left their factory to the workers, and some of them conceal the camera's conscience. Lumieres tries to enter animals and entertain them by bicycling, but "La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere" will not fit in with the mind that will shoot later. The most interesting aspect of this short film is the selection of a well-known ritual work of the brothers. Their selection shows curiosity about people around the world, whose quality of today's experiments is very enriching and brilliant. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
