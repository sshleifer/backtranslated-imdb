This movie was based on a true story of a woman who had two children, because she was not very good at all, it was terrifying to be truly authentic! The play is driven by the great film. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton imagined two children of the main character, Patsy McCartle, and adored him. His screening on the television screen is a real life story. It was very difficult to see some scenes when it became addicted to drugs when it was real about what happens. <br /> <br /> If it was hard to see loving mother's mother, it was hard to see if she did not care. But it's true. I know where people retired, and it was similar to what happened in the movie, what I remember. <br /> <br /> I also thought the director was very dangerous. This happened to this woman about this film. However, it was so well done. I applaud this movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you know someone who is addicted to drugs or knows what will happen to you. .
