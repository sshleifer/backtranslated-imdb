Recently I was looking for the latest HD FLY AWAY HOME DVD and I found an interesting title I ever heard: GRAY OWL. Richard Attenborough As a film, I received my attention (responsible for beautiful films by GANDHI, CHAPLIN and SHADOWLANDS). I saw that William Nicholson (the author of SHADOWLANDS) was the script. This "Special Edition" was full of interesting material and the price was less than $ 10.00. That's why I bought it for that. WOW! What a beautiful movie. Pierce Brosnan is Archie Gray Owl, a 1930s trance of real life, who loved and respected Canadian land and worked to support them. Brosnan (who starred in the James Bond film) gives Annie Galipeau a dark, powerful performance, as a young woman who loves her feelings and causes her influence as a creator of earth. George Fenton's (THE CRUCIBLE) and Roger Pratt's excellent picture adds a brilliant result to the film's efficiency. And the additions of this DVD are something else! The two shorts made in the 1930s Royal Gray Owl and the audio-commentary of producer Attenborough and producer Jake Eberts; 2 Featurettes; There are many more options for those who have access to additional PLUS DVD-ROM computers. GRAY OWL has been released live on the DVD in the United States - Richard Attenborough is not interested in distributing something that Hollywood does not charge for violence and sex. This is a movie, not only inform and entertain, but let's think about something. I had a very hot feeling from the movie, and a new love and understanding for Beavers! GRAY OWL is a great movie, worth seeing! I hope this is shared with others.
