"You: magical wizard magicians" was a great classic! You should never guess what was done in 1983. Tsui Hark's use of special effects was very creative and imaginative. (The Chinese Ghost Story continues in the trilogy and subsequent productions). Still other films in this genre can still grow. "Your story" You are tied to the war of the "Zu" magical mountain! It is not necessary to understand the plot to see this movie. The plot is a bit difficult to follow. But it's not honest. It's about adventure and adventure! I always asked Tsui Hark what he would do if CGI took CGI. We now know that he has made this movie. Maybe sometimes it's too much, but the overall outcome is beautiful, I will not be critical about it. There is so much on the screen, you just do not believe it! I think it's a lot of embarrassment that this movie has not appeared in theaters in the Netherlands, because that's it. Movie screens are screaming in the movies! This great budget movie is like attacking Hollywood's "Superman Returns" or Xmen 3 quotes. Humor humor is the only thing to mention in the drama Tsui Harks, most of all, fantasy, martial arts and humor. Somehow this movie is missing. I will not be hard again. these little issues. The "Legend of Zu" action confronts you with the most beautiful effects you will see. Real classical!
