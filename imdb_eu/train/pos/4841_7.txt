In Cologne, we're not familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost shot it (I was recently a TCM preview) because I made a jump on the negative appearances of "Ghost Train". well annoying. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised that I am laughing. Askey's delivery of the physical and line of the comedy, Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen suggest what you should have. Comparing with other traditional comic book vendors in this genre is not a Budbott or any other conventional reducer. On the other hand, Askey and the British comedy feels a thread that connects 30 years later; At least, from the American point of view it is clear that Monty Python is more important than anyone else here. Regarding the rest of the film - the more you watch movies, the more you will look at the end, but it's still quite fun and atmospheric and it looks like the next look.
