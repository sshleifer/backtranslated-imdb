Hak hap (Black Mask) I would like to call a ballet by fists and explosions. I am sure that the plot has been tried and heard before (it is part of an elite power of the supermarket that is biologically an engineering soldier, who dies and brutal forces decide not to establish all things and to become pacifists) Librarian. But when trying to get an antidote that keeps the rest of his team alive, the policeman becomes a black mask.) It's very impressive, works and at least it's entertaining to me. I like to watch Martial Arts movies. If the people that swell faster than the air and retrieve the second parts of the impact, the rhythm and action stops. However, this movie is fine, what Jet Li does, does what he does, and that's his spectacular visual abilities, which are the least obvious. Like most of the fast-acting martial arts films. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung show for the first time, for the first time, these films are high in low-lying and surprising physical values. I have to say, even with the big holes left on the plot (how do we see that the only scene in his apartment in the apartment with 20 men is not less than 20 feet away, with an escape signal? Who knows?) She only cut the scene in the apartment ... Believe in believers I think), it's an interesting movie for me. It seems that the short film just lasts 20 minutes. However, there is a great rhythm action movie.
