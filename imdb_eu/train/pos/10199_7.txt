As a child, I love this game. In the spring of 1993 I played with my friend Andrew a million times. I played Axel or Blaze and it would be Adan and we did not play how bored we were. Then the streets of Rage 2 came out. And we quickly forgot that this also existed. <br /> <br /> You play as Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding as former police officers, who have let go of the boys in their own way. It seems that work on 8 levels is damaged by the city of the evil city X. The bad guy is caught and the boss at the end of the level is really fun. Level 4 (Bridge) my fave was the wicked that could hover over the rivers of the river. At the end of the game there is also the opportunity to become a man of Mr. X (price). When you become a leader of the union, it involves a "bad ending". This is exactly a mystery, as you're going to go down the X of the union, but do not worry. <br /> <br /> The Rage Street also has wonderful music. The composer Yuzo Koshiro made absolute miracles with the limited technology of Sega Genesis. Main theme, First Level, Level 4 and Last, stand out. <br /> <br /> Because Wii is the owner, I'm proud of my console forever. When Rage 2 of Rage 2 is also available, the first mode is deprecated. <br /> <br /> Pros: <br /> <br /> average graphics, but the progressive panel that matches the tone of the game tone in a comic book. <br /> <br /> Free conversation. <br /> <br /> Easily insert it and make it hard. <br /> <br /> Cons: << br /> <br /> Smaller streets that are much more complex than the streets. <br /> <br /> <br /> The worst enemy of AI. Baddies often go away when you start fighting. This is especially great at level 5. <br /> <br /> Missing movement of combo. <br /> <br /> Missing decent weapons. <br /> <br /> The bad boy models are repeated far away. frequently <br /> <br /> Graphs B- Sound A- Game B- Permanent fan B-
