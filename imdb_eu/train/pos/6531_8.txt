I really liked the movie ... it was nice. I like it, but if you do not, that's your fault. Emma Roberts played Nancy Drew well, even though he did not have books. Fashionable outfits are extravagant when you see them in modern times, but they look good to them. For me, the rich did not seem like a rich outfit. I mean, it seems that he has worn all his clothes in a garage sale and they all decided to put together. All dresses were rumors, especially regular clothes. I do not want to make the movie look bad, it certainly was not! Go to the theater and watch! You can enjoy it!
