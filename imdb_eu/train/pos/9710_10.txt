That's a proud British man. TV is a fun thing. The league is Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith. Fully underrated, this horror-comedy is perfection. The characters are iconic and "Hello Dave" are a bizarre lifestyle. It is a comedy that people only have to see. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the league of men is always fresh and the limit is always to be encouraged. No slogans (like the one in Great Britain) need to be fun. The league's most famous and iconic characters have shown that they have steel balls.
