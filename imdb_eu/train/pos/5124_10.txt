This is not a great movie that catches credit as a Saturday Night Fever on John Travolt's career. She plays a man who is in love with a girl, but the pig is also led to accept her feelings. Instead, he wants to make a bullfighting mechanic because he shows his man. Although it was made in 1980, it is still a good day today. Country music is excellent music. 10/10
