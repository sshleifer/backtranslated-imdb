I had never seen this program as being recommended by my family members. Of course, the girlfriend lives in Hadfield (shooting place) and points out some references when I first visited her. <br /> <br /> This was my interest, so I bought the 1st series in the video and I sat down. In addition to getting to know some locations, I'm surprised. Again the BBC created another example of one of the best comedies in the world. TLOG is easily located with Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python, probably the best. <br /> <br /> It's enough to say I'm going to get into the program. The characters are exquisite and show an unusual depth, maintaining a sharp realistic edge. The look and feel of the program is perfect, and in the North, it reflects frightening sensations (the respect for Hadfield is not a very pleasant place). <br /> <br /> I only hope that I continue with the original in the whole run (that is, based on the second series that finished in the UK, definitely nightly). <br /> <br /> Well done bbc !!
