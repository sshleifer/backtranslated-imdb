This movie appears apparently to be a rooteo movie that parents can use to entertain their parents with their youngest children. It looks like a movie and especially for children, but it does not stop at this level. I watched the first movie as a young child, and it seemed fun, entertaining, and sad, and I did not see it for a few years. I saw it again at age 18 and I thought it was almost as fun, but pleasant and entertaining. This movie is very limited and has a lot of real life messages. This movie is a story inspired by children's reflection story. I recommend this movie for anyone of any age.
