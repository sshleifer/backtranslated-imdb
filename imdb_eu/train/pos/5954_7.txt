I mix conflicts and personal tastes in the reactions of this film. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes here. Even martial arts stereotypes. All good and good, and sure, not all well done. However, I see a key point around this cinema ... the cultural importance of its location. The film is located in Pensacola (Florida) and does not try to say it. It is a daring cinematic movie and strange fans of indy movies. And, indeed, it may not be last. Pensacola is known throughout the world as a navy town, an aviation town, a bird city, and sometimes also a political debate. Rarely seen as a growing film country. But all this is changing now. Film companies are shooting more. And original Pensacolians have more power of cinema to know themselves. This film is part of the tendency of the Indy film-based Pensacola, and there are more on the way. Pensacola is making a lot of noise in the global community, and, increasingly, the world warns. See and hear the world. Pensacoli came from As a virus
