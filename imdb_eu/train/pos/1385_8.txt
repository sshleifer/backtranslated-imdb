I only spent one night at Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille in Paris after his first public screening. A nice 15-year-old movie about 15-year-old teenagers, all in psychologically identical stages. Many scenes give us back feelings about our adolescence and sexual relationships. It is possible to imagine that the director wants a sensibly strong feeling for girls to reduce lesbianism, but in that case it does not ruin the probability of the story. Sometimes you'll find a bit slow movie but it's an intimate atmosphere. I financed talented young actors, a special mention with Floriane and Marie, very credible. There are many small details, but this film also gave me the opportunity to discover synchronized swimming: wonder!
