With a special telescope, Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) proves successfully an unknown but very powerful item that landed in Africa a few years ago. Dr. Benet (Bela Lugosi) completes an Rukh-led expedition to locate the item. Undoubtedly, Rukh discovers "Radium X", much stronger and more radioactive than radiation and Karloff is infected and touches anyone just by dying. Sparks fly between Lugosi and Karloff in this classic science-fiction movie during the Second World War. Hillyer used several pieces of the "FLASH GORDON" series, which was filmed at the same time and added several meters of the Frankenstein electric machines. The universal did not know the special effects used in this great classic movie. Karloff and Lugosi were very good and worked together and future generations will enjoy it.
