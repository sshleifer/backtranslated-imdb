This film was located in Gerard Gardens in Liverpool, and was the answer to Blackboard Jungle in the UK. The film proves to be a good test of time, all the moral stories that are still relevant today (or even more). The film has some outstanding British actresses such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. The Liverpool police officer assigned to the youth bonding team considers Baker to be liable to adult responsibility if you take them at a minor age. <br /> <br /> Among the most outstanding cameo films, Freddie Starr (among others). Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play their brother and sister (their real life is their brother and sister) on the website they bring to the arsonists. Tsai Chin still plays and Nicole Kidman's "The Interpretor" may appear on the last stage of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Scotland / Russia. <br /> <br /> I lived in Gerard gardens where they filmed the film (but it was not born at the time), and they have good memories of the area. I have just recently completed a documentary on Gerard Gardens, a short film from "Violent Playground" and a feature film from the "Coast to Coast" in the UK, Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The temples and movies that were built in 1987 kept the memory alive. <br /> <br /> When the films were released, there were some complaints that revealed the film clearly. Time has helped heal wounds. <br /> <br /> I'd recommend a little treasure of a movie to look for it
