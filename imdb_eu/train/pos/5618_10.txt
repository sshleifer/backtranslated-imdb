This is a great movie. David Lynch is lighter than anything and shows Polanski's excellent director, this is not his usual work, and it's BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> It starts with Trelkovski. Paris. The previous tenant was soon told by a young woman that she had committed suicide and that she was convinced by other people living there. He also thinks they want to do the same. The result is paranoid and terrifying. <br /> <br /> The whole production has a classic horror: the musician of images, Trelkovski, can feel a horrible fear. <br /> <br /> Do they kill everything? Or maybe mad mad? Is there a difference? Find out about yourself. 10/10
