Neptune <br /> <br /> A great celebration of ethnic and cultural identity Carlos Saura's great performance is achieved by masterpiece Iberia Suite Isaac Albeniz. Centering on the centenary, Saura brought together many talents of the performing arts community in Spain to create this song of love for his country. Twelve "impressions" of suits are presented without narrative in a strenuous environment, so that each performance can explode before Saura camera. The creative use of large apartment and mirrors, combined with screen, shade, fire, rain and back projection, has dramatic effects on the varied selection of songs, dances and instrumental performance. Photos of Alben have appeared throughout the program, linking it with the great creative passion of music. All Saura Spaniards are immersed in their stage, with traditional costumes dancing with elderly flamenco dancers.
