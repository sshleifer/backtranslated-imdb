In John's Funniest, Eugene Levy is also very good. If I would like the studio to be in the DVD, I have it in a video tape, but I feel that this movie deserves a DVD (and it would be extraordinary to be excellent). Kung Fu Uuniversity (Kung Fu U) skit is so fun, because it's the whole movie as well as its The great scene with her girlfriend and her family does not seem like this on television, but she loses most. According to the darkness published on TV, if you want to buy the video (it's a good place to find a copy of ebay) I'll keep my VHS one day on DVD. There are so many good films that still do not have DVD released, and it's one of them.
