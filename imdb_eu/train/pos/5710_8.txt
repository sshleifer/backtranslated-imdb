Rene Clair's innovative music. If you want to see the song for the first time, this is it. This is a story about hungry young creditors who won the binding. Unfortunately, his card is in his apartment with his girlfriend and is given to what was given ... oh, but that would say. <br /> <br /> This is clear and juicy. It's a story that sings a lot of the conversation (most people think that it has not happened to Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). They no longer create the movie, and rarely did it. Five or six years later he is the sound of the first films he plays as a movie. Clair moves the camera, as Busby Berkeley did not (but compared to filmmakers, it is unjust, Berkeley was basically dancing-related dance numbers and Clair camera moved through the "real world." His amazing little movie is and it's a charming movie that makes her smile, it's just part of her delight. <br /> <br /> I can not help but tell you more. Its just a nice little movie and everything you really need to know.
