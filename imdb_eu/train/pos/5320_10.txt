I started watching this movie unexpectedly, it was just another movie to watch, but since the first twenty minutes, art and the main character, enigmatic, do not speak much, I'm really in this movie. <br /> </ a> The movie really liked it, it was dark, beautifully styled and very touching. It's a bit slow, but it's been a dive. Joey was a wonderful director, and he tells us the story that he has believed in the back of his life. Music was really great and well integrated in the scenes. The unexpected end was not seen. The type of film that we often see is not.
