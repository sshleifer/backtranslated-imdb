THE MAN IN THE LUNA A warm, moving drama of age around a 50-year-old family. The main story continues with a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon), a 17-year-old resident (Jason London), who falls behind her eldest sister (Emily Warfield) and an unexpected tragedy that changes the family's dynamics. forever In the 1950s, they reflect in love with each other, and the characters that are scripted will help you take care of it almost immediately. Witherspoon first started to gain an Oscar-winning talent that he would develop in this role and became a charming London man. Warfield gives a restful maturity to the efficiency of the old goat. Sam Waterston and Tess Harper, the girl-parents and Gail Strickland, the mother of London. It unhurriedly brought me a calm drama and this effect created strong emotions and gave more depth to the "family ties".
