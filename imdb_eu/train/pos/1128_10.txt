While Homer's last-ever "Troy" back-up was a fun addition to Brad Pitt, "Iphigenia" is amazing with Irene Pappas. The fact that the Greek actor spreads in a natural environment in their own language gives true authenticity. I had the opportunity to find one of DirecTV's many movies with this movie, despite my concentration problems, I was interested. There is no glitter or "bling" in the film, it's just a rich story that tells the story of such actors, they are listening to a real family of disruptive ones. I think Homer, if he really existed, would be proud of it. <br /> <br /> JLH
