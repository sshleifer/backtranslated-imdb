I really love this movie, I saw it last week after about 3 years. This movie is perfect, great performance, excellent story, director / camera / excellent music. It's a gift to someone you love. very bad jaco van dormael did no more films after this. Top 5 wool. Really! <br /> <br /> Today, 3 years and 3 days later, it is the top comment. It was never published since there were no more than 10 lines. However, yesterday I saw "le huitieme jour". This is undoubtedly one of my 3rd feature films as "Cinema Paradiso" masterpiece. The soundtrack is also very good. I'm really curious about the new "jaco von dormael" film. I hope that my movie will be found. If you watch this movie, rent it. Or even better. buy it Because you want to see it again.
