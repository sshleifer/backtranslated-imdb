Originally this movie was seen as a former Rialto Ancient boy on Saturday afternoon in a third triple morning bill, Vincent Price's "Last Man on Earth" and Mario Bava's "Nightmare Castle". I had a nightmare full of blood for a week! Then I did not know, all three films are classics of the genre. No wonder I was so scared! Although all three films scared me, Castle of Blood had a profound influence. <br /> <br /> The first was the bill. At first I did not see cinema as we got into the movies and we were missing the first 20 minutes of the movie. This is missed, since the edited form lasted about 79 minutes (running unedited for 87 minutes). However, the overwhelmingly dark atmosphere (ruined castles, shrubs, cemeteries, shadows and infrastructures), gothic design, strong and suspicious plays (especially in the last 20 minutes) frightened me and made my impression of permanent perspicacity. Years later they gave me a copy of the movie. As the French and Italian imports, it was not the movie that appeared in the late show of Winnipeg. I could not remember the title (I remembered that I had not seen the movie and I was scared), and to make things even worse, the movie literally released a dozen films (Danze Macabre, aka). "Terror de Castillo, Terror de la noche larga, etc." And the "Castle of Blood" title of the US / UK work was very similar, but it is similar to other horror movies. and perseverance, I finally found it nice to see the entire film in recent years, maybe it's not an emotional effect, when I was a boy, but it's okay to go home with awesome movies and at the same time compares with similar iconic movies, such as "The Haunting", "Innocents." The film "Black Sunday" is an excellent start by the Italian director Antonio Margheriti, who has written Barbara Steele's scream in the 60's, and wrote a good screenplay by Sergio Corbucci on a skeptical writer Georges Riviere , and in a bet he wins the night constantly and becomes part of a ghost story. Steele is hypnotic as a fantastic interest, Arturo Dominici, Dr. Like Carmus and Margarete Robsahm Julia. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many tricks of Margheriti are used to create a mysterious atmosphere of the film. cleaning doors, fog, etc.) are common in today's audience, but they work much more effectively in black and white than in current-day color. Instead of using body counts and special effects, the film creates fears of old-fashioned fashion, a good story, elegant management, consolidated production, interesting camera work and strong performance plays. She works with her paintings, she works well with the elements, and revitalizes her film, revealing the horrible paranormal secret of the house, as it undeniably reveals the writer. <br /> <br /> The movie is not without any mistakes. The rhythm is dragged at the beginning of the film (ironically, I lost 20 minutes originally). Surely the effort of the Synapse movie has worsened to recover the original length of the film. Even if fans would like to see a recovered movie, in terms of revenue, it may be a hindrance to help. Only double English voices are adequate, and in the restored scenes, the language from English to French changes (provided in English subtitles), probably annoying to some audiences. <br /> <br /> However, Synapse Films deserves a good reputation for the print quality. Clearly, some efforts have been made to recover and merit. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, and I liked anyone who enjoys the gothic Italian movies of the 60s or enjoys a good ghost story. <br /> Rob Rheubottom, Winnipeg, MB Canada
