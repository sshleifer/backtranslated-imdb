I'm not a great fan of Tim Matheson, but I must admit that I liked this movie. It was dark and a bit annoying with a bit sneaky with some scenes, I do not know how to classify this film a little bit of its character and a bit of fear. slash thriller I saw this at 2:00 a.m. or so, at my local channel there was nothing more, so I decided to see it. If you have not seen this movie, it's not recommended to get ID, it's not bad, it's interesting enough for the characters, but it's not really a matter of looking that movie better. I do not know if this film was going to the cinema, but I felt it was made directly from the television or the video, I would buy it if I enter the DVD, my film type is well suited and the X-FILES story has something to do with it. Corporate corporations or corporate bad guys in shadowy shadows. In general, it's a good movie.
