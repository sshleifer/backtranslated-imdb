Henry Hathaway was daring to love the people of the first days of US history as well as enthusiastic. However, criticizing the incorrect specifications of his film about Brigham Young and Mormon is not necessary or useful to comment on this film. In my opinion, Hathaway made a great direction for Mormon people who indicates what is happening at the beginning of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Last Saints during the period of Joseph Smith's martyrdom. Filming and conversing often in subtleties has covered many Mormon philosophies and teachings and covered many scenes. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this movie on Saturday morning in the early 1950s. After ten years of publishing the film and completing the Temple of Los Angeles, I saw seeing the Mormons seem strangely surprising. I recently bought the movie and I will enjoy these messages interpreted by Hathaway in his film. 1 /. Love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs. 2. Charity of those who are or are not. 3. The family is of great importance, 4. Listen carefully and carefully, as well as the opposite messages and important points to take, 5. Work hard, individually or in the community, 6. Prepare and save the need for the future of the days. 7. Expectation is a binding link with a higher creature and our daily life. And those that are identical and beneficial to any unique quality.
