For people interested in business and the corporate world, this show is just the best. One of the show's competitors wrote about this innovative show on his blog: People's Business finally had a hearing. The whole idea is perfect; Compete between a business group in the business-related tasks, located in the best place in New York. Donald Trump's head is perfect, even though his minds are larger than the infinite universe. It also makes uncertain decisions, who turn it on, one of the negatives of the show. <br /> <br /> Season 1: an excellent season, generally, the best "normal" time. This season they had real business skills. Subsequently the series was almost completely drowned in issues related to serial marketing. Excellent and interesting contestants in general, never with the most pleasing character of this series: Troy. I know I'm not the only person who was suspicious of Trump World Tower, Amy and Nick. <br /> <br /> Season 2: It's also a great season. The task was pretty good and it had a lot of interesting competitors. Jen M was horrible and would never reach the last IMO. Likewise, they were the fastest in this season (Pamela). Season 3: Terrible. Actually, I liked the concept of the smarts of books on street smarts, but the cast was so terrible that the full season (Trump elections also cast cast) was a total disaster. The best moments had a second episode (slowdown upgrade), with Brian's prime minister, adding just great comedy. <br /> <br /> Season 4: an excellent season, very interesting and fun because of the competition this season (especially the complete disaster called Randall, Alla, Marcus and Toral). The episode "Take me to the Boardroom" is one of the most absolute classics of this show, ending with a four-hour shoot-out. Sadly, I think we stole Randall vs Alla final. Trump was afraid that he could win, and I think he did not stop it. <br /> <br /> Season 5: a boring season, without any special things. Brent was just shame and, of course, there's only drama to create. The tasks were enormous in general (how does jingle business with your business create something?). I think the best man won, but personally I do not care less. <br /> <br /> Season 6: I look for why they wanted to try it as a new LA show show, but there was a mistake that looked back. New York will always have a place for that. During this season many new things were added, most of them horrible (as the team used to sneak away, the first winner continues, for example). The assignment was horrible and Trump won badly. James certainly deserved it. <br /> <br /> Season 7: Celebrity edition. The best time ever. Very different rules (like the use of rolodexes), but all entertainment and fun. The main problem has been that many competitors did not have real celebrities, especially those who were unknown to me, except Omarosa, who is ashamed of everyone involved. When Kodak attacked the head, another man came out of the shade: Piers Morgan. He never dominates anyone else. He crushed the opponents and also found himself in a good mood (although some Americans (not all Americans, of course, did not think it was wrong), unfortunately did not understand the social skills. THE WAY TO SEND! <br /> <br /> I recommend the British version of Sir Alan Sugar for fans of this, because the British version is better, which is something that Americans say (and the original) is a great show. Regarding the UK version, competitors tend to tend to the meeting room Playing like a decent human being, the eternal and eerie epoch in the US version.
