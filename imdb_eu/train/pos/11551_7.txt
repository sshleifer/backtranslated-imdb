THE ODD COUPLE (3+ outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most people, I always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are definitely "Odd Couple." It was a great watermark on the television series of the early 1970s and early 1970s, easy to read ... above the story and screen versions. However, how can you go with Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau? Matthau, Oscar, is a very good slob mode. Lemmon is getting used to it as Felix, especially if you have seen Tony Randall's outstanding performance. The good script is definitely the best of Neil Simon. (Here I will record that Neil Simon values ​​the worst dramatic and most dramatic plays in America). The story is very simple: Felix, his horrible wife and himself separated from his wife, moves with Oscar. Some help needs to save money by saving money. Living arrangement becomes like a wedding, finishing in tiff and spats. Fun and unique lines.
