... Heads, Hands, and Feet - A past band, like Strange Fruit. It was tripled. Those who did not like this movie were under 40 and did not have any experience. Sad for them It's a great way to spend an hour or two, and probably in the second half, it does not disappear much. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall, a drum player (somewhat of a pretty beauty), and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - turns overwhelming voices and faces super spectacles and has beautiful Juliet Aubrey. His sharp eyes are like Karen, because he tries to keep his team together, with a spectacular self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Syd Barrett / Brian Wilson's echoes are loud and clear, Mott the Hooplek up in front of his ridiculous pace, and the script is never a bad deal for a minute. Do not compare this with Spinal Tap or The Rutles or The Full Monty. All this is unfair. The closest comparison is Commitments, which is not bad. A group that I do not remember with Blodwyn Pig, but the name that follows, is a movie that remembers well. Well, someone in the group knows what they were doing. <br /> <br /> A little joy and thanks for your memories. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and I have another one - Little fingers. a-a-and-what SteelEYE Span ... Spooky TOOTH ... Ten Inch NAILS anyone? (You must watch the movie or be on the road)
