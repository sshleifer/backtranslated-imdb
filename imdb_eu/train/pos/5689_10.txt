First of all, "Wonderland" is a review of the DVD's two albums. <br /> <br /> Two films included in the rent, "Wonderland" and Johnny Wadd, are completely erased. Myth created by "Boogie Nights". This myth was much more than what the characters involved in adult film marketing did to make money, basically denying that they were not the focus of one's personality. The book "Wiseguy" and "Goodfellas" The "Godfather" fable and this is most similar to the rest of the rest of the gangster romance. <br /> <br /> Now, I really liked the irritation. Watching these movies and anyone who likes to see and enjoy "Boogie Nights" will be questioned; For supposed and sophisticated educators may be stupid and silent. "Dirk Diggler", "Boogie Nights", no doubt, John Holmes, unlike "Dirk Diggler", had no free quality. Holmes was a victim of a criminal partner who was excommunicated by someone close to him, consumed himself completely for the satisfaction of himself, and without a doubt he was a member of the brutal slaughter of 1981's Los Angeles-based murder in Wonderland Avenue. "Boogie Nights" is a lie and Linda Lovelace's explanation reinforces the cruel and pathetic business known as the adult film entertainment industry. You should see the two functions of the DVD "Wonderland" to have positive opinions about the story of "Boogie Nights".
