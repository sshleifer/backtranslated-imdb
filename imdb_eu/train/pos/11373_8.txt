Here's a curiosity: a current movie, about a killer of a series of fighting scenes, no-one kills, no self-escape, and no noise ... and it's happening in Russia. There are only two short scenes, but it's horrible. <br /> <br /> The story is the rest of detective works, and how many red ribbon the inspector had to solve the murder. This movie is very dark and the "dark" heroine describes the heroine's (heroine) hero. However, the story is not depressing and very interesting all the way. The remarkable Rea is a remarkable appearance of the detective. Jeffrey DeMunn is terrifying as being deadly. Donald Sutherland's Russian accent is suspicious, but he plays the only character in this movie that does not have any warmth. <br /> <br /> Again, the story is covered with liberal agenda, here and there, there is no single reference. Gay prevention, secular psychology, police and government officials validity boorish / crude / bigoted, yadda, yadda, yadda. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the crime film is smart and delicious. This film is quite popular, it probably is not known, but people who have watched it. Based on the true mind of this murderer, it's much colder. Do not overcome it because you have nothing.
