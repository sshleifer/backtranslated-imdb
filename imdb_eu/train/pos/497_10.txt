Call me a teenager, but I think it's a great series. If you have not had the chance to experience some Star Trek episodes, you should definitely see this. Perhaps stronger with Voyager's Caretaker, when it launched the Cpt series. Janeway, the adventures of Archer are quite different, but they are curiously familiar ... They're catchy music. The true fan of sci-fi can not at least ignore the Star Trek episode, and the deadline is worth the wait.
