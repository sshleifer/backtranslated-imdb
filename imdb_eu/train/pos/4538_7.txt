I never had to watch the movie after reviewing the Maltese review and rated 1 1/2 star. However, I saw it in my son's advice and it was much better than I expected. I would give 4 1/2 stars from a 4-star system. More than one movie must be seen to understand everything. If you do not know much about religion, you've lost a lot. I graduated high school when the movie was made; so I can better link it. Yes, it's something in front of the movie and it's a bit strange, but it was 70's what you expected. I see why people did not like the movie; However, I can not understand people who say it is boring. The movie is boring. Yes you will hate or love. If you think it's boring, you're probably dead in the brain.
