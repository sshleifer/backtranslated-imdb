Ladislas Starewicz plays curiosity with insects and cinema, in a short film about the triangular love between the Beetle, the Heron and the Beetle. A simple story of a double-hearted couple of couples looking to get married is akin to the Biographer or Vintutzer. It is the tour of the Staremic Story, with the use of embroidered cords, the legged legalization of the frame frame frame animation. Story Mr. Beetle is aware of the capture of the camera tonight, because a jealous jealous with a black book from the local store. When Mr. Beetle finds his wife at the arms of the artist's friend, he gets angry at her, but at the end he pardons and takes out a movie. However, Mrs. Beetle learns about her husband's infidelity, watching the jealous and dragon of Beetle's movie together. Mrs. Beetle, Mr. Beetle pulls out his umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps across the screen and both are imprisoned after fire catches. Insects are located in humanized environments, such as a house or nightclub, and they are human jealousy, anger, lust and revenge. The characters insects carry bags, they drive cars, and although they wear shoes, they still release the antenna and open and close the vegetables like real insects. The novelty of the story is not put on its head, after repeated occasions, but as slow as the movements, the movie moves slowly. The action is complicated with details, but the speed of shooting and the faster rhythm are lost in the process. Despite the rhythm, the film is an excellent example of the first puppets of Starewic and is highly recommended.
