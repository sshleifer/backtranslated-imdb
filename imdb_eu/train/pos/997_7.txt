I have to agree with most other posts. Was it a comedy? a drama? he sat down for me a little bit for the comedy. It could be a great movie without a comedy and I guessed it incredibly. Jamie has with Julio and her name. In New York, you know how many times you know someone in the center of Cleveland. And how can Robert Pastorelli Yankee Stadium hide the gold. Again, comedy or drama? But on Sunday morning it was mostly entertaining. I really liked Kimberly Elise's performance, she was a beautiful actress and seems to be crafted seriously. It will be a young actress, which will be viable.
