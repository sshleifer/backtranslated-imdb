"California" is an excellent movie that looks at ourselves. It has an excellent movie cast, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, With A River Ruth, and The Legends Of The Fall) Early Grayce, David Duchovny (X Files). ) Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek: Next Generation, Homicide: Life On The Street and Escape From LA) Carrie Loughlin, Brian's Girlfriend, and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Cape Fear, and What's Eating Gilbert Grape)) Adele Corners, Early's Girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Brian Kessler is a freelance writer, who is ready to write a series of killers. Brian and his girlfriends, Carrie, decide to go to California. So, Brian will announce at the university an advert for college to go to California. <br /> <br /> Previously Grayce is a parole and a partner, who has recently lost his job. The town's mirror factory, debt, is owed by landlord money. The first official conditional release allows him to visit him and tell him about a job. See the law and announcement, later Adele, her girlfriend told her to leave California. First and Adele Brian and Carrie know about the bus station and they leave the town. Brian and Carrie do not know that he was killed by a landlord. Brian and Carrie Early and Adele thought they were different, but they got acquainted and become friends Carrie and Adele become real good friends. <br /> <br /> Their trip is very important. Although Brain and Carrie did not know at the beginning, they had a killer in the movie. Brian asks him this question is a very good question about the murderers and our difference. The first Grayce mistake is not a sociopath. His path goes down the hill and pays the price. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great movie, I give stars and 2 small thumbs up to 10/10. I love the songs of the film, especially at the end of the film, The Indians "Look Up To The Sky" song.
