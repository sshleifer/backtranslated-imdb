The Spirit 1986 movie was a pilot movie for a possible series. The creator of the spirit Will Eisner did not like the movie, so it was not created. I thought it was a very entertaining movie and I caught the comic (spirit) with the modern twist of the spirit. I'm sorry I did not get it done in a series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones Spirit was perfect. Nana Visitor Ellen Dolan was delightful and, of course, he will be following Star Trek: Deep Space nine years later. Perhaps with Frank Miller's version of The Spirit, a great screen version, more people will be able to see this strange jewel of the Spirit's history. It seems that when Hollywood produces a film from a character or idea that has already been established, someone will not be able to search for previous versions of the asset and release the video for a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas wore a Zorro mask, we could get previous versions on the DVD, such as Alain Delon's superb version of the 1970s (although I never saw copies that were badly edited). Here is someone who will soon publish the Spirit DVD movie The Spirit.
