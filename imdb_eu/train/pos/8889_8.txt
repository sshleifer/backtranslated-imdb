I have lived in that period and I believe that the program caught the heart of that time. I think it should work more on the African-American theme, but I think there is a lot in the program. He was afraid to sit down and watch rebellion in T V's, they would not get home to the family and would not be burned. I thought Jerry O'Connelle did a great job that represented a war veteran. I went back to school with boys and I went. Some have changed more than others and not so many others. When I'm in Minar, the problem is not enough to cover it, or it's enough to make it entertaining. Live it and make comments. I thought it was a great movie and all made a great job. Thank you for a trip (dull and good).
