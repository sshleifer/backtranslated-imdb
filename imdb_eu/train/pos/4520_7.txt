Far over and over to the end, this comedy is completely enjoyable, because it never finds the problems of a "powerful" misfortune or hilarious woman who likes clothes for women. <br /> Julie Walters is always beautiful, but Adrian Pasdar is absolutely compelling and stole the movie. He (she) absolutely gorgeous heels and silk stockings.
