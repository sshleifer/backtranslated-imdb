I look at this page, and it seems embarrassing to hear a frightening and sad someone in front of a real classic. Of course, I accept everyone's opinion, but here I am: <br /> <br /> This movie is not to be missed by classic horror watchers, and there are several viewers around the world. Of course, he has lost his flair and greatness with age, especially today in the world of CGI effects, but this is not why you should like it. <br /> <br /> I'd really like the movie because it's terrifying. , to the current standards. In general, huge feeds make you look like original viewers, so do not give yourself a chance to play a classic. Check it out, but not with a critical attitude. Look at the toy, as it was originally intended.
