Intriguing Exciting Dramatic. The explosion Complex Epic Taking into account the lost story that only touches the iceberg point, it only reflects the leading edge of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> From the performances to the strange visual effects, LOST is a fundamental television show for science lovers. -Fiction, fantasy, action, adventure, and many mysteries. <br /> <br /> Each partner is so well chosen and so good that it is in the roles, lovers or haters, or downright want them dead. <br /> <br /> The visual effects used (very rare) are really well-taken care of by the usual production of shows. It can be "smoke monster," for white bears, LOST is unbelievable according to eye candy. <br /> <br /> Regarding the story, nothing is compared to the complexity of the audience. endure me Starting from now on, the continuity is almost perfect, the characters are developing, and the story that is evolving gradually gives their answers to their questions in such an eagerness. <br /> <br /> In general, there is hardly any LOST error. Arrested Development is doing what he did for comedy TV / science fiction television: he has set the bar. <br /> <br /> I recommend losing a very ill, intellectual and loving question. It does not matter how long it takes to reach it. <br /> <br /> See this show.
