This surprised me, and I was often disappointed by Adrian Pasha's past, but he captured the perfect balance of this performance, avoiding farce and patty, offering humor and true emotions. Julie Waters is always wonderful, and in 1983 she would have to rent Rita to educate anyone who does not have a scene yet (a wonderful movie). The rest of the good characters are also well-behaved, and they are so wonderful that they do not go over the eccentric ones. This is fun.
