LAUREL & HARDY Comedy Short. The boys arrive at the Noodle teacher's house to whiten the fireplaces, this crazy scientist who has just made his rejuvenation serum. Stan & Ollie continue with LEATHER LANA, which destroys the house and the roof. Then the teacher wants to try his new potion ... <br /> <br /> A fun little movie. The end is a little bit, but the slapstick is so great. Especially for the Stan & Ollie championship, the end of the fireplace. That's what Lucien Littlefield teaches.
