It is unusual for a single actor to watch a movie that is so good that the film does not have any interest, if it exists, without feeling its presence. <br /> <br /> Although it is a clear direction, it seems that several scenes have appeared quickly and unobtrusively - a quaint budget, unpleasant priest and a strange man who wants to take a place for another week, Pierre presence Fresnay is so horrible that from the beginning to the end, horror is achieved. <br /> <br /> I have never seen and I can not give it a better performance in the future, even when it was Paul Scofield's "A man at all times". . <br /> <br /> The truth is that the end is wonderful because Fresnay is not considered a deceived priest who returns from church to mind. <br /> <br /> "I suis Maurice Morand, prétre catholique" ("I am Maurice Morand, I am a Catholic priest"), it is so honestly said that it can be overlooked by the madman. <br /> <br /> Another horrible thing that this film has with a single scene in Morand: though it is an unfaithful, a priest who combines a lot of vines in a cabaret. It becomes the blood of Christ. <br /> <br /> Gérard, the man who wants to return to the Church or return to the Church, should drink it if he does not want to leave the cabaret. . That is why applause and applause make those four who think that they drink four of the vineyards. <br /> <br /> The next scene is also a dialect between Morandes and garbage collectors. "Do you bring men too?" Morand asks him to hate himself. "The answer to this would be too much work" is intelligent. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is not worth commenting on, but it is worthwhile to see it as a very strong and surprising atmosphere created all the time. <br /> <br /> I think that "Le défroqué" is a very curious film, but it must be seen by all audiences - if the good Catholics are to be compulsory - it is a curious story of a very unusual story. <br /> <br />
