I thought the pendant would be a mediocre movie. When I finally saw it, I caught a surprise. The movie is not an excellent thing, but it is very funny and the action scenes are done very well. Series like series 24 or Alias. It is very similar to that series, and reminded me of the thriller on the line-up of Wolfgang Petersen's line-up. If you expect the history of cinema to be one of the most original and thriller, you will be disappointed. But if you go with small hopes, you will enjoy the sentinel. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
