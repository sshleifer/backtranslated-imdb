I'm tired of having "historical accuracy" for judging films. SOURCES PEOPLE !! Writers and directors put an alleged story! There are movies that are not very accurate with the history movies ... Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, New York's vaults, Geronimo: American legend, the latest Mohicans ... all the fascinating movies are historically inaccurate. If you want to see some great actors, do the best, then watch this movie and do not worry about the accuracy of the events. Enjoy the quality of the film, the story and one of the greatest actors of our time.
