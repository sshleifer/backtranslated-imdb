It was a great year of 1933 for satirical (like "Duck Soup") and this is a good idea of ​​the obsession with the bridge of the contract. The tone is like a funny New Yorker, since the film begins with the "Goings On About Town" magazine. Casting is something special. Years later, William Powell and Myrna Loy would be perfect. However, since 1934, you would not be adulterated in such a sophisticated way, prostitutes that play beautiful young Loretta Young in shears and striped clothing or in a radio bridge. Even if you do not know about the bridge, maybe you can see a rare example of Hollywood Satire.
