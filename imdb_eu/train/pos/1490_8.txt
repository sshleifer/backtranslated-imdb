Everyone has the first love, and it is difficult to determine this sensation, when it's younger, that's where it's inside. This is what the Malaysian filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad tries to prove in his fourth film, a movie that tells the simplest and most direct emotion of the most complex emotions. <br /> <br /> Such a vision is particularly appropriate in this case. The Festival's love stories are two types of twelve-year-olds, so it seems to be a "deeper" analysis and unfathomable. These are not great shows given by Sharifah Aryana and Mohd Syafie Naswip. She plays the Ancient Orked (she is seen as an adult character in a previous image by Ahuben Gubra). She is a lively and rebellious girl, perhaps the "British" educator, who has learned her mother in England, who prefers to play with dolls. Violent sports with boys. Then, one day, he meets Mukhsin (Naswip), who has come to spend his vacation at the aunt's house, and suddenly changes his habits: greetings, cycling and climbing. But what does that mean? Are they just friends, or something more implicit, does one of them still know how to get ready, and even less accept? <br /> <br /> For the young age of the protagonists, the answer to these questions is impossible and, therefore, is not answered. As in "As in some smaller movies" (as in Lost in Translation), there is no real closure, an opportunity that leaves a sour dough, but at last a pleasant satisfaction: naturalized and unpublished (especially Ariana) gets almost instantaneously almost immediately , and a powerful support (especially the Orked family) helps keep the minimalist narrative fun and appealing. Soil approach is not always effective (ridiculous ridiculous adults fall too early), and Pulp Fiction is hard to justify at the beginning of the function, but emotional strength. Among teens, it's enough to become an interesting part of independent Asian cinema.
