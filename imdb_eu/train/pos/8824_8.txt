Mujar (Marta Belengur) will enter a restaurant in the morning, knowing that terrorists have kidnapped people in this restaurant and a curious and fascinating short film that will dramatize a number of music. Finding the director / writer on the same "wonderful" DVD. He had a pretty tough song and somehow brought a smile to me in the general short summary. I'm glad I came across it (I did not know I would have rented a DVD that would have been an extra) and I would not hesitate to recommend it to all my friends. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A-
