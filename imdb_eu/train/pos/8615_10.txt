I waited for a little Canada to get out and eventually I was very excited to see him. I liked it Of course, at the beginning, it's a very sad movie (and the days of new years - it's even more sad) - it's still sticking to you. The next day I was thinking again, because there is something that emotionally emits, because in a few days it's a good story. A person who sees how a person binds, but sometimes many things can be blinded. And just like Diane Keaton's rest of these kinds of nature he simply stays there. And how they keep them in the process. It was a great movie, and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) is the perfect comic. It is definitely a movie that needs a tissue box, but it will be with you for a long time.
