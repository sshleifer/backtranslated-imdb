I can not believe this movie is 6.9. In any case, this movie was one of the most important Indian films ever seen. It was a great pleasure to see the movie that showed the traditional family film. Regarding the story, I thought it was very good that shahid kapur was introduced in a wedding organized by amrita rao. The lucky guy is amazing, Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian uncle who is very helpful to her uncle, but the only problem is that her cousin does not pay much attention, just like her aunt. Amrita passion This hurts him because he loves evil Amrita. It was very emotional that the wealth of the Amrita family was not rich, even if it was a middle class, but while the Shahids family was a senior class, they still respected the family and did not really ask. he nodded with me. That is to say, I have actually seen people as being very rough, and those who think very little standards are too deep. This film showed that the Shahids family wanted to look at the great values ​​that Amrita had grown up of, and she blindly blinded her daughter's business or rich business. He deserves a total of 8/10 of this movie, I would like more and more of these types of films.
