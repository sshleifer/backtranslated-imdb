It was my favorite Christmas specialty because I wanted to release it on vhs or dvd, because my 33 RPM was lost, and any casket that I've made has also disappeared. <br /> <br /> I'm not a great John, a fan of Denver, but very surprised by the music, with a muppet spin (especially Little St. Nick!). It was a favorite of traditional music. In addition, it also includes some well-known songs (original?). <br /> <br /> Although this show was made at the end of the 70's, it was sensitive to that time. Quickly find a copy!
