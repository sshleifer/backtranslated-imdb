I never heard the movie I watched, I asked if the movie was independent and it was right, but I decided to take that opportunity. Essentially, Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is looking for work in the Red Rock (Wyoming) country, and has a large amount of money that he owns from Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's JT Walsh). Killing her unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). It does not direct, it takes money, and Suzanne warns, and in that case, after deciding to make a counterattack, she decides to leave. When Wayne knows his true identity, Michael continues to shoot a great gun until he drives it to a car with Lyle Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things make it difficult for Michael to say that Lyle is a man wrong and makes a quick retirement. Returns to Suzanne and, knowing both are in danger, they plan to stop the people and add another complication when they fall together. Before leaving, Suzanne stressed that stealing a large amount of money in security. Of course, things will not go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle will run away, and Lyle forces them and now he has to connect Wayne to get buried money. In the end, both Lyle and Wayne are worth the money, Michael and Suzanne are working together, but it is obvious that he cares for money and he gets what he deserves. Also, Craig Reay Jim, Mr. Vance Johnson. Johnson, Timothy Carhart Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam Truck Driver and Robert Apel Howard. Performances, not just Boyle lama, they're good dandy and they've got good black movies for a black comedy thriller. Very well!
