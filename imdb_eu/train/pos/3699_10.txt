The subject "Who loves the Sun" issues its lyrics, enough and enough to keep the story beautiful, but often more fun. It's been a long time since I've found a very nice movie and a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful movie that draws beautiful scenery and beautiful scenery with eyes. The peaceful image contrasts sharply with very tense human, very wrong and very pleasing characters. Excellent cups, five of the greatest players are interesting and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend the "lovers of the sun". It's a really funny movie that gives an insight into the pain that leads us to one another, and a surprisingly amazing but rewarding process of forgiveness.
