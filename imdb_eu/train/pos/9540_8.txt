Most of the opinions heard about Meatball Machine have been quite mixed. They say that a couple is "sucking". Well, to the people I'm saying, get f @ ckin's imagination and go for yourself. This was a very funny movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with this mechanical mistake and somehow attacks its hosts on the appearance of Necroborgs and the costume of Gwar and these deaths. In the end, these mechanical defects have also been added to some parasites due to the wiring of your nervous system. Unfortunately, for two young lovers who seek love, they go through a mechanical mistake before knowing that transformations are happening and bleeding. Is there a way to stop the transformation? Maybe this is a way to curb this mechanical mistakes? Why do Necroborgs fight each other? Do two hidden enemies feel each other and do it wrong? The only way to find out. <br /> <br /> I was reluctant to get into the Meatball Machine due to mixed reactions, but it was a big surprise. Some unanswered questions, sometimes in average ones, and weak endings that may be somewhat confusing at the end. From the sense of animation, even if parasites are small characters and even low budgets, this movie is much worse than the brand name. The constantly developing story is interesting because it mixes with makeup effects and blood splattering. That's the horror / horror / Tetsuo / splatter fans movie. Output 8 to 10
