I love this movie. First of all, it's a family movie. Secondly, because it offers a refreshing family of HIV in a family, which usually has a lower story than what they have in cinema. The brothers are very close, but they do not make any decisions. The desire to protect younger brother is noble, but in the end it is not necessary. I understand, perhaps, how to deal with Leo's treatment with people, but I think it was a good choice for him. I can not believe it was a French television program. It had great production values. I gave this film a ten, and I also think, after seeing it.
