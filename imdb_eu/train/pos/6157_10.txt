This is what I've never seen in this movie until I saw my 3-year-old videos in the store and liked the skin image of the Nabooboo island. We've got it and we've seen it again and again; In fact, we have rented several times. There are very few animation films to watch and pay attention to my children; What a pleasant change from Dumbo and the Sirenath. The play is outstanding, the songs are compelling, they come into your head and you can not help singing. Storyline, specifically about WW2, is timeless and you see something new when you watch it. I've heard about Mary Poppins, but I think that two films are very different, excellent, but somehow my son has no interest in Mary Poppins. This is one of those films that children want to see over and over again and their parents do not care. We have seen the days before and during the time of the bed and I do not feel that when this desire is happening, it wants to repeat any other movie.
