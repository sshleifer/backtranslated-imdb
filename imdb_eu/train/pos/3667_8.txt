North Hollywood is a satirical opinion of the Canadian historical film, the Canadian government offered huge tax breaks for the film made in Canada. Most of the time was treated like a cheap tax shelter or a cheap way to get American movies. For example, Porky came out. In any case, he plays for beginners produced by Matthew Modine, who wants to adapt to the beloved Canadian novel. However, to get money, it needs a star of the American star. He gets a loose gun and learns that the movie seems to endanger the point where the book originally looks. It works well in Canada, but it may not be understood outside the Great Territory. Americans think they are sad, but we will actually lose the point that we are satirising. 10/10 for Canadians for 5/10 worldwide.
