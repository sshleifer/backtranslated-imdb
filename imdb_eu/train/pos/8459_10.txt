I am not a fan of most anime, but Gundam Wing is something else. On the Gundam sloping, there's a lack of stereotyped melodrama that you might think in anime when jokes at 17 hours are only double in number, Gundam Voice goes to business. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is a political thriller, as a series of action. The biggest divisions are aimed at diplomatic relations of war, not just fights. Although the battle animation does not include extreme details, in the case of animation pain alone, the intergenerational sessions are almost artworks that gush around with complex mechanics and fast movements. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, a series of 2000 series and a series of cartoon networks were received in 2000, and then they were also professionally dubbed. duplication is wonderful. Not only do they say all the words, they also use voices as the characters are more believable. Many believe that it is best to watch English anime, but I do not want to do it. <br /> <br /> No voices are good, but the score above is very impressive. I just said I've been looking for a network to find a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The plot of this series is really a part of the audience, and do not miss it as a first drama like, like drama like Lost, just for you. Explaining the plot in depth would bring a lot of disasters, because many characters have no names in some series. The harsh idea of ​​the serious series and the colonies of its independent spaces now remain peacefully difficult. In this way, the war began, the military coup created and the diplomatic situation. In my opinion, more detail would have given me information that was essential in the plot. <br /> <br /> I'm going to finish here that they end up being told by anyone who likes anime as an anime, for anyone who thinks they are stupid (for good reason to think), and anyone who wants to join an anime. a serious tone.
