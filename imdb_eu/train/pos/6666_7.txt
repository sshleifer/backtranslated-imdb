I can not say this movie is about vitriol that some reviewers receive. Yes, excessive race, edited and exceeds the special effects of cheese cheese. And a comedy is missing a lot of energy that you want to sit among your audience members. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, some fun lines laugh, talented and powerful, and remarkable. Macy, Stiller and Azaria are superb as the "core" team, and Garofalo and Studi team are doing a lot of conflict and variety. I can not say that Reubens or Mitchell added much more to film production, although they each had little chance of appearing to shine. <br /> <br /> The earthquake, as I said before, is your classic "underdog-good-good". Not surprisingly, knowing that it will be a victory. What he deserves is not hero and nasty absurdity and evil, but rather dialogue and interaction between characters. Below everyone, these people are heart-babe, who want to do it right. The best film in the film is the film's emotional film. Check out her mother with Azari. Mac's innocence is fairytal Cap. The secret identity of amazing; Stiller's anger (you never know who was always playing in the park, unlike that strange and curious boy who would make an incredible rage in the park); The desire of Garofalus to avenge his father. The superstition that justice and goodness would make the children become a better world is a real favorite of super heroic comedians; And in the parody of the outside, "Mystery Men" tells us why they are telling us about these tropical comic books. <br /> <br /> It never got better, because it was half baked. subplots (love, family life, conflicts within the group, etc.), but the main plot, such as loopy fun. What we think is good to feel is that it is lost in some evaluators here, so I'll give it a note: if you're a kind of viewer who enjoys a cartoon Itchy and Scratchy. unexplained and illogical ("I have believed this somehow ... * snort * ... _magic_ xylophone?"), so you are much more reflective and humorous about this film. Joan Sandler instead of renting a movie. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
