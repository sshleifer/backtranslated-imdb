I saw this movie after seeing Capote and Infamous. It is incredible how subtle films are homosexual relationships between the author and the protagonists. The ruler is correct, the protagonists are more beatniks than gay people. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, but when we review it for the second time, we get some interesting information from Brooks writers and directors. . <br /> <br /> Note the initial cuts that initial killers and dead kill. Cutter on the phone is paired with Perry. Cutter has cleansed his face that Perry cleans his face. Perry only looks at the mirror and looks at the body of her erotic body with fantasy that plays Las Vegas's guitar. This failure / fantasy matches Perryk Alaska's failure to permanently match the fantasy father that builds his beautiful boy. <br /> <br /> Dick plays the phages and plays the Pheasants. I do not know they will die. We cut the mushrooms. <br /> <br /> Perry has attacked his harassment with the yellow-haired bird that attacks them, "Jesus is taller", dreamed behind him. "The monk asked for mercy," he says, "yet the bird has killed." The bird led to Perry's paradise. Curiously enough, Perry says Berbers, God and Religion. This is what he has recently wanted to apologize for his pardon in his last words, but he does not know who he is. <br /> <br /> The director puts it in every kind of thing that only and does <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The horse is still running. Then Perry will make his opinion about his home and his home. Nancy can not sleep at the house of her friends because her boyfriend will come to dinner. The decision saves the stamp of his destiny. <br /> <br /> Talking to Perry Bogart with the name "Sierra Madre Treasure". This is another picture of Bogart, written by Truman Capote, "Beat the Devil", where McGuffin is a fictional treasure. But Dick knows that the movie stars were nothing. Dick likes hard money; He thinks he is 10,000 dollars (Clutter's safe) (that is, ironically as fantasy made by Perry's Mexican treasure) <br /> <br /> Clutter's $ 40,000 life insurance crisis is currently thinking of death. Ironically, his death will end in a few hours. The insurance agent wants a long life in the company's name, knowing what will happen in a few hours. <br /> <br /> Dick said that they do not want to remember that they do not want to, so later, they were deleted by all the reminders they remembered. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "It was not a witness," Dick continues the police later. But was it witnessed by Dick, Perry, Truman Capote or the friend of God? The viewer is witnessed after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Fascinating film.
