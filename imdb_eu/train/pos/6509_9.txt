I can not believe any comments on this show! The show is just genius! It is certain that there is no such thing as a try and that it continues, but consumers always promote the same things that we always want. He should not sit back and enjoy something new. The style is not realistic as the previous "Scooby Doo" show, but it is not supposed to. The show, under the title Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Clue, says that this part of the title suggests that the whole lover of other interpretations would constantly bring it. And he never said that the mystery would not be resolved, and they could not even suffer monsters, so why did they want to? I'm glad that they have put on a long-running plot on a Scooby-Doo show. They still have jokes, bad dresses, swimsuits that alternate, standard aisle, and even Scooby snacks. In fact, I am pleased that this show is not there, because I love it. I'm glad that, at the same time, the rest of the group has been eliminated a bit, and they have been concentrated by two main characters and criminals. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it's ridiculous! Certainly, it is assumed to be different. Laughter is a bad thing to do and boost the victory of all superstitious robot tournaments in size. You are going to get the "Roobi-Roo" joke running for the running of the bulls. The whole thing is good, but it's not a single thing that I think is wrong. Writing, acting, animation, all the more. The title is a terrific music (my computer "TAKES FREE!" Plays it when it's thrown), and the background is stiff.
