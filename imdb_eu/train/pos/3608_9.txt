Sports movies have never been my thing, but few of them work for me. It's best to focus less on sports and more characters, such as Raging Bull, Wrestler and Girlfight. Karyna Kusamaren's directing debut is brilliant, and Michelle Rodriguez's first great performance. Girlfight feels realistic and implausible, it's enough to become a memorable film. <br /> <br /> Plots are a breakthrough. Diana Guzm√°n is the fourth year of secondary school, but in the corridor she is fighting for and eliminating her. As a means of turning his anger, he will enter boxing lessons in his brother's training (according to father's will). <br /> <br /> In ninety minutes, we are the audience. see something extraordinary. Diana almost literally changes a girl from a woman. We see him in his body and his behavior, especially when a club boy finds himself addressing him, and he enters. There is no bad scene, not the quiet / thought of the film. The only mistake that I would say is correct is that one of the sub-planes ends up like an unfinished note. In addition, Girlfight is an excellent movie.
