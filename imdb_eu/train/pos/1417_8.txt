I watched this movie with my family and it was great! This film is just a documentary (which offers more than cold facts) has long mono / -dogs and many graphics ... The whole "power" of this movie comes from stunning photos filmed under water. Air or Arctic. Watching this movie will make you discover more than one book on our planet. This shows WE WEZE is embedded in the circular flow of life. This movie is not just called "environmental enthusiasts", but it also has to see those who want to find a good movie with a message. This movie does not teach us on earth alone ... we live and all the plants and animals through the earth grow and die with us.
