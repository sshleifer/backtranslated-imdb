A really brave hero, shocked and horrified, struggling with mattresses, shut the doors ... for some moments that I love. I loved what I missed this show: pleasures and some good supporters were given the setting of the diamond of the show - Tea Leoni, 'Nora Wilde'; a tough, wonderful and incredibly wonderful accident. How cool an actor can watch for clowning? It's not surprising that Hollyood does not know himself. But where are DVD releases where OH? The amount of release (bleep), it's incredible that I am still treasure. (I'm wrong if someone does not please correct it.)
