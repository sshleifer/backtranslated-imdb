Since Red Sox is a long-running fan, I had to watch the movie. It was very good! The 2004 Red Sox miracles could not be a live footage, but some of my favorite Red Sox have been great shots. The film is definitely Chick Flick, which has enough footage footage of the 2004 red Sox baseball, one of the 10 best films of all time. Especially the Red Sox fans of Ben's baseball family liked me. The real meeting will be the funniest scene with Ben's day with his friends! Check out if you are looking for a healthy movie to watch with your spouse, date, or other significant ... especially if you are a fan of baseball ... and even if you are a Red Sox fan!
