I lived in Rawlins when I made this movie and I was lucky to work. Either extra and with special effects with Eddie Surkin. It was fun after seeing all the scenes running, Barbedwire, who lived on the Electricity chair, across the cupboard floor. Likewise, all Viggo and Tiny actors were very entertaining. In addition, the hanging door that hung on the prison is still called "Disney Gate". If you are interested and is always in Rawlins, most of the film sets are still available and can be viewed on a self-guided tour. It was very fun to work with R. Harlin and I wanted to do it again.
