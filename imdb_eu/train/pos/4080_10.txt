It's one of the best animated films of all time. Additionally, almost all of this title's viruses came from Hiyao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli's enthusiasm. Specifically, such as "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kikki's Delivery Service". Carrying a scam is pretty good, but the family is a bit terribly awesome: teens and adults are better. "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" is another thing that sets apart Miyazaki's other films as it is a great adventure walk. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so good? Because it's a complete package: the animation is very well done, and the story is really attractive and compelling. <br /> <br /> Most Japanese anime is imaginative, but it is totally dark or cynical or violent. and the animation itself is often the most stylized and the youngest. One of these problems is not a pestilence in the Castle. It has a burning imagination, and the characters are well-drawn, if there are too many versions of real people. (There is not any outfit for a dessert outfit) There are plenty of adventure, but not blood and gore. The animation is a smooth, accurate and cinematic ally: it's not flat shots. They are wonderful spots. <br /> <br /> The voice that plays the voice in dubbed version in English is first class, especially two leads, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). Sound engineering is also great. Use your studio sound, if any. <br /> <br /> I particularly enjoyed the aspect of a superficial story that remains unexplained. Laputa lived once and is now abandoned. Why? We never know We know as much as we know it, and then we must accept everything else, that is, it is easy to guess because the world is so invented. In fact, the reason is that the world is considered to be much more moderate than the rest of the world, especially characters of single-sized creatures (eg global Gruff, extreme friends, kooky old miner, etc.) highly recommended. People aged 6 to 60!
