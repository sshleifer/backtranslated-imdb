He is dying of an unexpected accident (Craig Stevens) with a famous violence (Dana Andrews) and tries to cover it later. The film directed by Otto Preminger has an atmosphere, but Andrews's story is dead by the dead wife (Gene Tierney). He went very well into a huge hole, but it was clear at the end of the tunnel for a black film. Gary Merrille is Scalese, Andrews is getting obsessed, and the tension between them through power and drive, especially the Merrill, Andrews, and Neville Brand spa and the tension given overnight. Meeting outside Bellevue Hospital, which defines something that can be deduced from the film. Andrews, Merrill, etc., and the general portrait of the underworld, the angle of love and the simple and simplistic elements of good police do not even help.
