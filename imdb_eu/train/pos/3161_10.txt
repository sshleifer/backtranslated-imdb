Actually, I did not see the show until I reached FX. I was bored and I saw nothing and saw the revitalization of the shows, so I saw it. I was so annoyed that I did not watch the show for the first time about television. I loved the show so much! Lastly, everyone enjoyed a show. I remember Full House and Family Matters and Step by Step and they were good shows, but they are not quite fun. They made joke myths and were more than stupid to laugh at things, but not in the 70s that Show. The 70's show was hilarious, elegant and real. I think the best show ever made and I'm very sorry that it's over. Although I love this show, I think Eric and Kelso should finish the seventh season. The last season was not correct, Eric was the main character and he had to finish the show when the character left. I still like this show and I hope I begin to do more television shows.
