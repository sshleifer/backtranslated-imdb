I'm a big fan of cinema, but I'm silent movie. Many mute films do not focus on my attention, but Show People is an outstanding exception. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies and William Haines are wonderful images. Davies, in particular, shows a wide variety as they go to a small star that takes a star from a small small town. <br /> <br /> Show people is a wonderful cameo. Some of the greatest stars of mute time. I caught the attention of the movie immediately and I forgot it was a silent movie. (I know that does not make sense, but that has happened.) Actors are so skilled in their craftsmen, who need a few conversations. <br /> <br /> Show people is a perfect silent movie entry. It's a lively and interesting rhythm, the best two star silent periods. Add to the Hollywood satire and have to be in the Show People 'list of audiovisuals for all movie classics.
