Instead of mixing Resse Witherspoon with the same name in high school, Hong Kong is a trio-style trio of Hong Kong. The designated election selects a new leader or "president" for the past two years. It is the position of two candidates, and the ego, bribes and past career make it a great race. It is aimed at the great director, not confused by the confusion of the story and the turns, before revealing it in all its savage glories. It's not a godmother of Asia, but a thriller is nice in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of the seat and shake it in front of violence. Subtitled Volume 1 It seems safer to mention other divisions, we enter into the dark world of tr√≠adas and their betrayals and disturbed. In any case, the beginning is good, and if there is no special film on its own.
