To be honest, when I saw the movie in recent years I wanted to turn it off. When I sat down for about 10 minutes, I noticed Navin had stolen the actress. His facial expressions and the attitude of the comedian shook me in the head WHY he did not have any more comedies. "Marty Feldman" is going to go to her, but much more talent ... there's nothing left for Marty. The movie really surprised me that Jerk had a close background, but it was a lot more. I truly believe that if this movie was released for the first time and I saw the movie Steve Martin in the second, I would say the second place is cheap. I know BOLD seems like a statement, but it's true. I like Steve Martin, but his performance is the second The Actress Jerk Too. I would like to get a copy for my collection. We ask that you find it.
