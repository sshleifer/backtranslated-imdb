After seeing several episodes of this series, I conclude that television producers have no originality. Here's an old science-fiction standby that picks up the form of an original concept that is truly thought-out, and yet they can only work as much as possible. Men's actors are trained in their profession. Most of the characters are well-drawn, the hero's special faces and reverse pleasure. Most plots in the section are nice. So what could it be wrong? In what way, women and their aesthetically-perfected actress to represent them. <br /> <br /> Producers portray female characters in these - almost good - series, because the final product seems to be an unfortunate champion. Why, I wonder why? <br /> <br /> Every season falls flat on the guest star or repeating character on the screen. These actors are incredibly incredible in their roles, and you do not really know how to perform their tasks. A blind person can tell. Listen to talk They talk with a drama and effect sixteen years after the middle school. Who would think women think they are PhD, senators, corporate directors and doctors? choose - every time? And of course, the series suffers. Bad!
