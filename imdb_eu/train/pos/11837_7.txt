This is a wonderful movie in many ways. Everyone in my family liked it. The animation is superb and it's easy to see that there are numerous producers that produce films that are as bright as any movie created from Disney Studio. <br /> <br /> The difference between ordinary Disney rate is Dreamworks. It does not give more strenuous bets on comedy relief. And there is no sudden moment, where the characters become songs. I'm sure the movie will not appear at the start of the movie in a Disney picture: Spirit of birth. But it is done with great taste and there is no attack. "Spirit" was a great fresh air. Do not get bad I love Disney for many years and I'll continue that way. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is another example of excellent animated gifts. When it was over, my children wanted to see it again. I had the same feeling. I highly recommend it.
