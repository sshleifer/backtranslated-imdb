It's a good thing I've rented the movie before seeing the reviewer on this site. The movie that I will add to the Christmas selection was wonderful. Chosen cast and Ben Affleck had a good head. Viewers who have not watched the movie go ahead and buy me. I value it directly with Christmas holidays. The movie was very entertaining and well-written, and Ben plays an eccentric rich. I would like to imagine what a person is saying and doing with what he's doing too much to do. The movie is more fun than Christmas with Santa Claus and Kranks. It also has a good story and Gabon teaches the true meaning of money.
