In the end, the movie continues to guess what will happen to the end of the audience. Well, we all know that the brothers, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (Hawk's players) are going down the road to destroying them, because they need to go down in other places, but we do not know how to date or when the movie is finished. Hoffman is superb, as usual, and even though his youngest brother, Hawke, was basically thinking of what he was doing because he could not really think of himself. Hawk could have been a bit of his element, but he played well. Add this mix to Andy's wife, well-behaved Marisa Tomei, with scamming Hank; Andy's corporate fund rejection to pay her drug and sexual dependencies; and finally the father who knows what happened on the day of robbery. This movie will help you think.
