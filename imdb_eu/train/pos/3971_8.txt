<br /> <br /> Have you ever felt the feeling you saw about the general movement of someone? Well, remember that before deciding to break the law, the FBI will always be there. At least that gets you feeling the crime of drama, but a little dull, after watching the FBI story. The organizational roots comprise one of the most modern facilities in the world from a small office (1959), counting the story of Chip Hardesty (James Stewart) from an eye of an agent. <br /> Chip started the first day with the FBI and was delighted to work in the world, even occasionally from his family. The FBI story continues its life according to what it promises, and how it affects its personal life. The film shows a spectacular job that shows how the FBI manages and manages how it works. The audiences will stop Chip stop Ku Klux Klan riots, they will be hidden to solve the Indian murder / real estate scandal, help rescue the rescuers, rescue the hostages and fight against World War II. Even more, the communist espionist helped to put justice. <br /> <br /> Stewart, with a rather complex interpretation, is as neurotic as a star (as always) the work he loves his work. One of the best part about this film is the fact that Chip's family lives and how his work works. We'll see that he is suffering from his best friend and then killing his son. Similarly, his wife has been a short event and his wedding is rocky times. Because his personal problems almost all love his work. Vera Miles plays badly, but it's very compelling, though. He was never a great actor, but there was always something very attractive and appealing about him. Well maybe that's just for me? Unfortunately, no other feature has been mentioned, but the story of amazing accounts has helped keep it very interested. <br /> <br /> The film was a huge film, especially South American scenes of the rainforest. All colors set a textured atmosphere. Perhaps the biggest part of this film was Mervyn Leroy's brilliant director. Each scene was very light, to tell you the wonderful story they had thrown together. It has a simple camera shot, some with a hitchcock feel. <br /> <br /> In the end, The FBI Story is a spectacular film, but it's not overlooked. Two and a half hours of watchmaking might be embarrassed by some spectators, but if you recommend this option. I enjoyed the spectacular show and the story of Jimmy Stewart.
