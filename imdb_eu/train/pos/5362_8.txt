THE RUNNING MAN, together with TOTAL RECALL, is Schwarzenegger's favorite movie. No, this is not 2001, but it does not mean. And the play and script here are not matched by other Arnie films, such as PREDATOR or THE TERMINATOR. But I think that behind this movie IDEA is the coolest of the big screen. The state-sponsored game show, the criminals who are convicted of serious crimes, compete against heroic heroes of all kinds of weapons (the runner is not equipped) to encourage the sport and blood of the citizens. Last award winning runner-up: Freedom. Or so, they claim the rules. <br /> <br /> For example, for a movie with high-level death gory and intense headlines, it's a lot to be said. Anyone else has stressed all the comments on culture / government presented in this film, so I will not be included here. It is enough that you will see much more than looking beyond the seemingly stupid movie of the film (you can enjoy it a lot) (especially if you are a great SF imagination). As I said, it is not a serious movie of art, but it is surprisingly surprising in the 80's movie. This premise is borrowed for a short novel by Richard Bachman (Stephen King), but it is quite different from the source material, especially in the end. (The book ends with nihilistic ends - of course, this movie does not mean). I enjoyed both, but I like the movie better. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "It causes steroids."
