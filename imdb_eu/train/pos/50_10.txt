My kids happened to stop at this movie the other night and when they started playing things, he revealed my interest. I had to leave for the Bolatoka football field, so I had the chance to record the DVD, so that the rest could be seen later. I have seen it well and the front of the tee shirt should be weaned rather than tired. It was an excellent movie, although I almost felt the pain and discomfort these girls lived. And never for a million years, I had not guessed Alissia went from that beautiful girl to social wealth. This is, probably, why my shirt was soaked because Alissia was feeling the same pain I experienced. I would not even look for this movie, but I'm glad I saw it. Very moving, very moving. It's good for those who love theater or tear-jerker.
