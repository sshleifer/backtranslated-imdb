... I saw the cable in the late 1980s, since I was a great wrestling fan since 1986. This I saw on the VHS 'for sale' and I bought it. In 1998, I started training as a fighter after the Air Force, and I always returned to see how this was a very detailed portrait of the people who were struggling (family and unbelievers, travel, heart, etc.). Henry Winkler is funny and, sometimes, he sees sad that no one can understand what a genius of creativity. Fonz was a great way of playing Happy Days at that time. Also, look at cast ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice), and Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Mr. fighters If you have an option, see.
