This is a saying about Batman animation, and it's a great deal, and there are many actions for the same reasons. His story is good because the voice of the actors is very good, for example, Kevin. Konow as Batman, Mark Hamil Joker, and so on. The evil is really good, such as Joker, Two Face, Catwoman, Clayface, and so on. So, I'm sure you do not feel disappointed with the new enemies because it's really good. So make sure that you see it on television or that it is really good for buying or buying rental collectors. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ********* outside ****** **** <br /> <br /> **** outside *****
