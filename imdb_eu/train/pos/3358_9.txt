First of all, I have only one word for this movie: 'wow'. This is probably one of the best films I've touched, such as Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni in such amazing plays. I was very impressed by the latter, because he was deeply involved with the character, because it was very hard. However, both of them formed a pair, from the beginning to the end, when I was surprised, the friendship full of love throughout the day, set in the film. The story takes some time, because it is a long introduction to the characters, but we end up with a fascinating story about love and humanity. If you have the opportunity, see, it's a movie that will stay in your head for much more time. Simply amazing - 9/10.
