It is universally accepted that when Simmetria Fearful Kolchak's effects were dissipated, they will be the ones that will be, that is, a source or tribute is a completely controversial point. The most important of the two series is the subscription to the final belief, although it is less commendable. James Whitmore was brave to work under the direction of these difficult episodes, stunning elephants and gorilla costumes were like catastrophic recipes, but he's thrown into style, it's an absolute hint. Lance Guest is credited with creating Kyle Lang's compelling character and threatening Jack Rader with Ed Meecham's great work. Forget Fearful Symmetry's dubious originality and enjoy it as a Full X File.
