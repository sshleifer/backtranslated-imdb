I saw this movie on the cheap. Now I just remembered seeing advertisements and trailers a few years ago. I thought "What is" and when I bought it, basically the plot seemed interesting and Claire Danes always had one of my talents in my eyes (I also became a fan of Kate Beckinsale). <br /> <br /> So, they are talking about two girls who go to Bangkok on vacation, who are being dwarfed (of which they are innocent) and are sent to a prison in Thailand. The film continues with what is happening on them and questions their innocence. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give great performances, and the plot of this film is commonly captured and creates beautiful moral debates. <br /> <br /> I think this is a good movie, but some improvements could be made. It may be longer ... strengthen these characters and better understand the Thai justice system policies. /> However, if that's not the case, good movies have great shows. <br /> <br /> PS For all pop culture junkies are looking for a two-minute function of Paul Walker. I did not even notice when I saw the movie.
