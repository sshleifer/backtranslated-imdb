Wow! If Elizabeth Montgomery's (if she speaks Russian), I can say, I'm doing right now. In her short skirt, high boots and a huge bust on the line, she is a real baby, although her zombie-like eye shadow comes and goes. This 30 minute is definitely the sexiest of the series. Keep in mind Bronson with realistic wrestling and revealing rabbits until he finds his chin, destroying all the fun. Well, I probably need to leave my hormone response. <br /> <br /> This is a very good half hour due to the success of the Buck Houghton series. Producers want to take them in the third season above the average. It is an American holocaust-nuclear (we know it's part of the invading force) and only American Bronson and Soviet Montgomery remain with twenty realistic tones. They mislead their mood in alternative moods, but we wonder how long it takes for biologists to refuse politics, of course, in the end (lucky Bronson). And that's about it. There is no real debate, what Bronson means, which is very impressed. However, the script is still fun and very daring at its time, although all Russian women did not seem like a truck driver (a well-known Hot War of the time). <br /> <br /> Passing ... it's pretty curious that Bronson (Buchinsky) looks slavic, American and looks shiny as a Slavic Montgomery. The wise look should be the opposite. I think that the producers do not want the American to throw the role of the most physically vulnerable woman without any apparition. However, although the usual TZ fear or atmosphere is low, the section continues to be very durable for 30 minutes.
