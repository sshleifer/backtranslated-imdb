An unexpected pleasure as I heard anything about this film. <br /> <br /> Because it is very shameful for a broader audience. <br /> <br /> A social message with a surprisingly humane story, even though it is accepted in the forecast in its resolution. Directors act correctly. Beautiful photos hidden in a gray color that captures nostalgic shades of color. <br /> <br /> The final entry of the film filmmaker (That, The Road Home, Not One Less) is my hope. to continue exploring. China and its people are an amazing canvas for filmmakers. "Masks the King" is highly recommended as a starting point for anyone interested in the latest film in China. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
