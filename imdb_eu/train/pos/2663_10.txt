Sometimes a filmmaker like Kubrick needs to bring something short, a unique, inevitable and elusive component for an entire age that makes a special movie or master script a magnificent masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's story is enough to have enough meat and potatoes, even if all the directors are left unattended. Heck, even though King himself was not so bad. Kubrick is a way of perceiving the King's universe, indicating how the page is transforming the time on the screen, which shows SHINING shine and turns them into a compacted masterpiece. <br /> <br /> As usual, Kubrick's scene is terrific. The movie progresses rapidly, sharply and vividly, although it is not quick or even edited in less than 160 minutes. The camera runs from numerous corridors of the Overlook Hotel, a mystical maze that explores linear exploration, linear tracking, and embellishments decorated with ornaments. Kubrick is a symmetrical space and a geometric view that inspired the Japanese directors in the 1960s. As there is no depiction of all the drawn elements in the frame, <br /> <br /> some images stand out prominently. The first film by Jack's writer, accompanied by rumors of a ball, like the drums that come from the floor, or the typewriter itself, is an eternal event as if it were nothing. that's just it. The red river that raises the motel rooms. Jack takes the ax door and moves the camera with it, as the action continues rather than static, if the camera goes through the door and not the ax. If you zoom in on your kids' face faster, see the dead girls before their POV. And of course, the bathroom scene. <br /> <br /> The abuse of Jack Nicholson has had a great impact. His cousin has not been completely successful, but Jack Nicholson. The guy is half-mad. When he gets mad, he becomes an extra caricature of himself. Shelley Duvall, on the other hand, is the inspiration for Kubrick's never-ending casting. Robert Altman in the 70's (3 WOMEN, THIEVES LIKE US, NASHVILLE) brings a wonderful array of fantastic performances to his character with the pain of fragility and emotion. Excellent actor and very little.
