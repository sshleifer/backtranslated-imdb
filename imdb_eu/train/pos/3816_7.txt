"Secret Sunshine" reminded me of "The Rapture" (1991), with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better film. It represents the super-religious religions of Greece in the Korean province, and the main character lives in interaction with them after a terrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae, a widow's mother's daughter, moves to Seoul with her young son Milyang ("Secret Sunshine" Chinese). Milyang chose to have her husband late (killed in a car accident) where he is born and believes he needs a new life in a new place. It does not react well to the encounters of local Christian enthusiasts, one of them trying to persuade her to come to church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is an essential religion and people throw people so kind as gracefully as possible. Actually, at the beginning, Milyang's oppressions almost all oppose him, but some of them continue to try to invade his world, and the consequences often make fun of. To say more, movies would be far away, but it should be noted that female performance (Jeon Do-yeon) is a huge achievement for women. Having read the winner of the Cannes Best Actor in 2007, I expected that it was decent. But Mrs. Jeon is brilliant and it is impossible to remove the eyes on the screen. The movie is a rejection of Evelyn Waugh-Schire's work, which shows how Fate's feeling of insane feeling is dull.
