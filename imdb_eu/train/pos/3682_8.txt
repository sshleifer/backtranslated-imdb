Often, the movies of this nature are found as a mixed-job bag, to fulfill the execution's accessories. Regardless of whether it's a great help or project, Paris je t'aime never falls. I think that the movie is generally better than its pieces. Among the wonderful transitions and the endless fantasy sequence, those who join the final view of Paris's love, I believe that if the movie was to be removed, it was undergoing a movie. To be honest, there are some notable notes that have been overcome by the rest, but in the end I have a permanent image, even in the second half of each short landscape. Love takes on a variety of forms and talent comes in here, through the horror of poetry and emotion that amazes and scares audiences. <br /> <br /> Barrio de Enfants Rouges: Maggie Gyllenhaal is shocked as she narrates the actress of Paris and finds her dealer. In the end we show you how much the balance changes. <br /> <br /> Latino Quatier: Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands (recovering the relationship with Cassavettes in an old cinema?) They bring great. When they met strict spirits and sarcasm to discuss their divorce. The truth of their conversation is nothing more than anger, it's nice, smile on your face. Quais de Seine: Director Gurinder Chadha gives us a wonderful portrait of love beyond racial and religious differences. It's a sweet little story that has a shameless connection between two people, of course, that feels like a connection, but it can not be quite vocal. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: Sylvain Chomet does not feel disappointed by an animated sequence. Together, however, this live story of a mimicking mime in a Parisian prison has the same strange character as the Triplettes de Belleville. <br /> <br /> Tuileries: Coen brothers have a sense of humor and good laughs. Steve Buscemi really plays and sells performance without speaking. The verbal abuse of a French fray does not work for facial reactions. <br /> <br /> Bastille: Here's a great portrait of the heart, so you can get back to the tragedy. Sergio Castellitto and Miranda Richardson are a movement, while coping with the problems and finding a solid bond of true love. <br /> <br /> Pére-Lachaise: a surprisingly funny horror story by master Wes Craven. Oscar Wilde lets him add loyalty to the relationship with humor. <br /> <br /> Parque Monceau: Alfonso Cuarón makes a long-lasting look at the Children's Men's long-term love affair with this two-story love, walking down the street. As Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier have come to the fore in a great way, we will find the real context of "forbidden love". <br /> <br /> Porte de Choisy: The glamor of Paris is very surrealistic. . This is probably the strangest entry, but it is very interesting that you can not go out in front of a foolish look. Do not make your aesthetic Asian, however, annoyed. <br /> <br /> Pigalle: An interesting look at the relationship of a role-playing game. It's necessary to have a small variety of Bob Hoskins on. <br /> <br /> Quartier de la Madeleine: Paris vampires also find love among food. I do not know whether Elijah Wood should be happy. Beautifully shot and silenced to leave the power of red blood, this short one is strange, but then it's also love. <br /> <br /> XIV. Downtown: Allow Alexander Payne to add a little bit of humor. This voice story told an American in Paris about how love is. It's a contrast to the true accent we are listening to, his hard and educated French, simply to make that story fun and real. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: An interesting introduction to the procedure. Paris may be a city that defies daily activities such as finding a car park, but when it comes to love, the prisoner will take her to wherever she goes. <br /> <br /> The 16th of the Loin: Catalina Sandino Moreno shows the love of the child through his performance subtle, singing children's tale, each time they are completely different. <br /> <br /> Place des Fetes: my favorite range. Seydou Boro and Aïssa Maïga are fantastic. The cyclical nature of the story and how fate joins the two characters together twice, Boro is hard to ask for coffee at the end. Sometimes, at the end of your life love is enough to leave this land. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Place des Victoires: one of the best stories of a mother trying to resist the death of her young son. Juliette Binoche is devastating, mother, disappointed with her son, and Willem Dafoe is perfectly perfect as cowboy. <br /> <br /> Faubourg Saint-Denis: Sometimes one must think that love has lost that he has not invested completely in that relationship. Melchior Beslok remembers that knowing what was going to be 'must' at the end of a brief and quick meeting with Natalie Portman, she was trying to find out where she was going. <br /> <br /> Le Marais: Leave Gus Van Sant announces the gap between communication and understanding, because his films almost always delay. Elephant's photographer is an American living in Paris, the catalyst for revelations of love and soul associations by Gaspard Ulliel. Sometimes, no one should know what happens with what happens in pause.
