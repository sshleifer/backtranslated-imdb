"The Godfather", "Citizen Kane", "Star Wars", "Goodfellas", all do not compare with the complexity of the "Sopranos" brightness. Each character remains in layers of absolute truths, absolutely and completely in three dimensions. Tony Soprano is completely responsible, although the simplest example of good and evil is evil. The protagonist ever created during the history of sopran is a provocative, intricate and fascinant. If you are keen to question the viewer, and if the feelings of recreation are permanently changed, see "The Sopranos." Anyone can sit down and see it in the first section of Season 1 and I do not want to continue with the series. Each season is perfectly unique in its own way. DVDs are a must-have for anyone 4
