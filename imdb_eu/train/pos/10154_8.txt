This is Michael Vartan's first movie I've watched-I have not seen Alias-and it was curious to see whether he could sense the guy. Sure and it's a favorite movie. Natasha Henstridge is, of course, beautiful, but he usually stays in more physical and routine activities, so I found a very good and lovable role in a "sweet" teacher's role. Some negative comments read are true, it's full of topical movies and the story is not true. Also, all the characters in the movies warn that they look good together, I do not think there is a screen chemistry. However, I liked this movie. They are good places, the characters are good and good, and the actors are pretty good. If you expect to see romantics, this is not. However, if you want to see a pleasing innocent movie that is pleasing and beneficial, it is very good.
