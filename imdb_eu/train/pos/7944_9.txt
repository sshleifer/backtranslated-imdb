Have you ever had, or you, a pet that lives with you, thick and thin, who would have lost, and what do you care? Betchak never thought that they feel the same way for you! <br /> <br /> A wonderful and wonderful family. If you have a soft space for animals, this is guaranteed for any age. I saw this movie when I had a girl, and at age six, I love her. Then I could not decide to decide on the favorite character, and I still can not believe it! I love three animals. The conversation seems very real and comfortable, like a loving but feuding family. I love Chance, and finally, at last, he says he has a family. Cheesy, well, but remember that this is a family movie, and that role is perfectly fulfilled. Sassy has the perfect dose of "sassiness" and Shadow is the perfect model leader / role for young adventurous Chance Chance. <br /> <br /> The animal overcomes humans in this way, but, of course, it is a serious moment. He had to interact with them (that is, Molly recovered and at the end). There is a great soundtrack that has a greater emotion at each moment and a sensational feeling of heart inflammation. I will give it 9/10. Cats and dogs and babies should be compared (and even more valued).
