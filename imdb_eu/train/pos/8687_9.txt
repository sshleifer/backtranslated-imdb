This was the second entrance to the regular Columbo series and it is now well. Since I've seen and watched on the DVD, I'm really surprised by the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski (directed by MANCHO CALLAHAN and several television episodes). The murderer after the murderer shows two screens on two glasses, see how the murder is assembled, see the shot from the corpse perspective. The avant-garde musical musician Gil Melle, jazz jazzman, was awesome but awesome and contributed so much to the atmosphere. And Brett Halsey's golf project was amazing. There are several subtleties and complexities that could be ten times a quarterfinal in a role that would be cuts. "Formula" has not yet been categorized when this section was shot, so there are still some surprises in Columbo's methods. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp and Ray Milland are high quality actors and it's nice to see them. All men know about other roles but they still lose their characters here. In total, this entry in the Columbo series and MANY is a very long feature.
