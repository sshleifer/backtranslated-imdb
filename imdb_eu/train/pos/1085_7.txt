This movie was a fun comedy about Murphy's Law on property ownership and construction. If you were doing such a movie, it would definitely be a dysfunctional family. Since establishing it in the fourth fifty years, we suppose it is a typical family of the time. Obviously, of course, it combines comedy and dramatics with elements and works better than Loy and Douglas's powerful supporters. Ninety minutes of their lack are entertaining and strong.
