"Pecker" proves that Waters will not be able to change his rough ways in his old age. Many things have changed since Waters started producing movies in the 1960's, but 40 years later he still does what he wants to do. Over the years, the budget for Waters' films has grown considerably. This is one of his latest productions, but I was surprised that Waters touched this "trailer park". Edward Furlong plays with Pecker, a child obsessed with photography. She lives a lot of life in Baltimore, MD, with her friends and family. Pecker attracts attention to a New York art agent (Lili Taylor is always visible) and his life varies the worst. Waters spreads art, fame and heterosexuality again. It's not his best movie, but there are some belly laughing here (he has the best lines in "Memama"!). It's hard and funny, and I've loved this "weird" sensitivity in the Warters' movies.
