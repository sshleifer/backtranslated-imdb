I was very impressed with this small independent image. This story is about two friends about social partners, and those who give their children some support systems, sometimes they are fun, sometimes sad, but always provocative. Music, especially underground bands, was a great effect, as well as experimenting with camera angles, filters and slow or slow movements. Screenings (directed by the film's writers and directors) some of the best I have seen in the last two years. If you want to insert a round hole into a square slot, I think you appreciate "Hook or By Crook".
