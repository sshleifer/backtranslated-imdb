I liked the movie, first of all, because it told an interesting story, but the story in the movie seems to condense a much longer story. The book has more than 400 pages, which is why. From the 1920s and 70s, it will be included in a fictional South American fiction country. I think it would be much better than a six-hour mini-series in 140-hour format. <br /> <br /> Even though it is running, the story does not get lost so much it gets confused. He's saying goodbye. Blame is that Clara's supernatural powers appear consistently; Yes, they should even appear more uniformly in the movie career, or they should be left behind. Two other mistakes (might be a breakdown): Esteban's tenderness to return to his goodness is suddenly overwhelming and it seems that Ferula's curse disappears, although it suggests that the story's tone should last forever. <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent. Gluel Close, to be the pituitary of Ferula, is very remarkable. Jeremy Irons, like a wealthy man, is brilliant. Meryl Streep, the main character of Clara, is very good, though it's often better than this movie. There were also several minor roles. The biggest blame seems to be that there was no dial-up trainer; Every actor spoke in a different accent.
