I saw this film two or more times and I found it well done! It was over at the end of World War II and it was called "Cold War". This movie, therefore, was "propaganda", prepared by American filmmakers and, on the other, people who still create "NATO NATO blockage" in the countries can be defined as a threat to the future. The film celebrates US power over the centuries, projecting it during the recent war. Nice and fun Columbus describes the discovery of the Americas continent and is a good example of New Amsterdam's "espisode" and drinking from Manhattan in local Indian shopping ... It's time to see (at least once in a hurry) fashion advertisement over time! :)
