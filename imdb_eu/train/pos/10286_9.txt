This movie is amazing! While it is fun and fun, it is deeply deep and eye-opening. I will see it again and again. Bruce is a man who is unhappy with his life. He has a job and life, but he does not think he will bring happiness. Bruce is bitter, she is not happy, and feels she's not the way she feels her life. As a result of this mental state, he ends his work and denounces what is wrong with his life. God comes to Bruce and gives him divine powers. Bruce uses the powers to always get everything he wanted. His life was finally pleased with how happy he was to think ... with just one exception. In the process of winning everything, he loses one person who really loved him. As the film opens up, Bruce realizes that he was not the real changes that had to happen in his life, but he realized what he was really up to. This film was inspirational and profound. If you are really careful, we force you to look at your life, as long as we are blessed, much more blessed with respect to the humble respect. As my wife says, "when will he know what he is doing to be happy?" and my humble opinion: "We would not lose ourselves while we know that it matters to us."
