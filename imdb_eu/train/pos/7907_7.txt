I did not agree less with the rating given to that movie, and I think that most of the audience in the world have come out. Really ... Do you forget that it was a kind of cinema art before trying to entertain some exercises? This movie is not entertainment at least as easy as you get into movies like Titanic or Gladiator. The style is different, it is moving ... Therefore, most have hated so many things: it does not want to be pleased. It's just a story, I'm very curious, but it's just a strange story. It's not a great story or a great movie job, but I think it's worth a 7-star rating just for the author and the director, who has shot a story that has not pleased the audience, so it sells billions of dollars. make copies and make the studios bigger. This movie is, for me, an art theater in the US, and everyone who does it is worthy of respect. Be mindful of courage or humor.
