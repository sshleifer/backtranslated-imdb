The premise is easy. This film starts with the appearance of the average movie of your youth, which are two attractive young people joining an airport, and then things that take a 180-degree rotation ... <br /> <br /> None, I really like to like . Think of the nonsense of the love story that infects a movie theater. And it's my humble opinion that Wes Craven, based on his previous meta-horror films (Sceam), also ... <br /> <br /> Following this logic, it's not surprising that Craven sardonically takes time . 'Sependipity Love' story was nauseatingly sweet sweet, only the whole dreamworld full of sugar-covered dreamhouses that destroyed Cillian Murphy ... <br /> <br /> His character Jackson Ripner's scope (Jack the Ripper, get this film, is not ?) In this film, it's spectacular, it's completely charming, it's going to be a twisted nihilist, that is, it's in my book. As the victim begins to appear (Jennifer Garner, Rachel McAdams seems to be quite boring), you can not help knowing the guy ... <br /> <br /> This is Wes Craven. In Jackson Ripner, by Cillian Murphy, bashing all the bubble-drawn lines ... <br /> <br /> Mr. Craven, I'll greet you. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do: <br /> <br /> Jackson Ripner (after raging the violin of Rachel McAdams in the air): "Thank you quickie !!!"
