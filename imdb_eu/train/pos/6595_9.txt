I borrowed this movie that did not know about this friend, and it was a great documentary about the trip on the ancient abyss on the ocean. Thor Heyerdahl developed a theory that the ancient Peruvian Ink crossed thousands of kilometers across the ocean to Polinesia, based on relics found in two places, some types of ships that were available to provide some kind of marine ships, which found ocean and wind flow analysis, and Inka travels to a certain amount of sea that they know <br /> <br /> To test their hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his crew build a ship. It was available to the ancient Inka ancestors, using only rafters and other materials from that period, and Lima, from the capital of Peru, is approximately 5,000 kilometers away. br /> So much similar theory about ancient history is impossible to make sure 100%, but as the travel coverage is straightforward, it offers solid support. The film is more than a narration of photographs taken during the 100-day expedition, but a very detailed description is what happened and what were the accidents and difficulties. I often want to find the Oscar documentary awards easier, and I'm still still more interesting and informative about this 50-year-old, I'm sure it's been released for the first time.
