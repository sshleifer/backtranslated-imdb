"A shot, kill one, no exceptions". You should see that you are in the seafaring or sniper's. Two big thumbs up! Great story, excellent camera work, good drama, action, details and more. The real thing approaches. But this is not a movie to choose from fault and selection errors. That is, sit down and 99 min. The Earth is deep, but this movie is not as thought. Sniper lifestyle and enjoyment of action. 2 and 3 snipers are pretty good, but the first overall movie is still. Tom Berenger plays an excellent role playing his character and shows the hidden side of the sniper's life. to fight all deaths plains. Must be seen by sniper enthusiasts.
