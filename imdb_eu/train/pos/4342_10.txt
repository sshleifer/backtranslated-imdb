This movie did not surprise me, and so it improved. I thought: "Paul Rieser wrote, right? Well ... we'll see how he does it ..." Then I saw Peter Falk there. I appreciate Colonel. Although I was never a fan of the show, I always liked seeing Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> Peter and Paul's performances were so natural, I felt like a fly on the wall. They played very well from each other, I felt almost delight! ... And I did not drink! <br /> <br /> This movie was made very well, I wanted to know what he liked for Paul and how he liked it! but I could not find his number. It has to be unlisted or something. <br /> <br /> It was one of those films that did not know what it was or what it was. It's just, and I thought: "Oh, why not? Let's see. I do not like it - I do not see it ..." ... and I finally loved it!
