Did you think you were tough? You should watch this movie. Carl Brashear is the courage and decision. This man had to be inspired by what he should do to become a diving ship. And, noticeably, after seeing this movie, I saw that half of what I've shown is not! Cuba Gooding, Jr. presents some of her best works as Brasheas. De Niro, as usual, is a good southern sash that he prepares. Only George Tillman's second feature film ("After Soul Food") has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker. If you want to move and inspire, you should definitely look into this.
