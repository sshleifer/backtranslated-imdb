If you're on a boat, boat, bus, or redundancy in the bus, you should go back to the Hollywood movie that will take you to the movie. flat money and thus, without ceasing to exist, and in the frontier film that does not really show the reality of life. The travel sequences over time make the audience feel the same frustration and "wait" the feelings they have to endure. Frustrating? yes Imperative In fact. The limitations of this trip are key to the "roots" of this Turkish family. Beautiful movie with great performance. Sad, but worth it.
