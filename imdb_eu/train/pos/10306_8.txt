Buffalo, a person living near New York, scored the movie even before seeing it, because the story is here. There are also a few bits of pieces, Buffalo's anchor for new real-life television ... and, once, it does not hit the area. Alleluia! <br /> <br /> Meaning of theology, puh-leeze !!! God continues to look and think like humans ... and, of course, a bit liberal. A light comedy should not win prizes, but it's entertaining and it's a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are some laughing-out-loud comedic scenes, and, fortunately, the audience - Christian atheists. - Get some laughter taken out of something, such as what you really need to pray for. Writers like to get this theology right and give a good message. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a good movie that should be very little.
