18 directors had the same task: they told stories of love in Paris. Of course, some of them were better than others, but the mosaic is very charming - would not it be boring if everyone had the same vision of love? Here's how I segment (this could change in the second inspection): 1. "Quartier Latin," by Gérard Depardieu <br /> <br /> One of the greatest French directors ever directed my favorite segment, Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara always spectacular Soul and kindness <br /> <br /> 2. "Eiffel Tower" by Sylvain Chomet <br /> <br /> Cute, visually amazing (thanks to the director of "Belleville Triplets"), the story of a boy with a mumble parents. <br /> <br /> 3. "Tuileries", by Ethan and Joel Coen <br /> <br /> Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = hilarious <br /> <br /> 4. "Parc Monceau" , Alfonso Cuarónen ("Y Tu Mamá También", "Men's Children"), feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (funny); <br /> <br /> 5. "Place des Fêtes", Oliver Schmitz, feat. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (touching); <br /> <br /> 6. "XIV Arrondissement", Alexander Payne ("Elections", "About Schmidt") is a fascinating aspect of life here, feat. Margo Martindale (Hilary Swank's mother "Million Dollar Baby") is an underrated actor, a midwife of American holiday as a lonely woman and soul. <br /> <br /> 7. "Faubourg Saint-Denis" is a story of a young actress, Nick Tykwer ("Run Lola Run"), in love with a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind man (Melchior Beslon). <br /> <br /> 8. "Père-Lachaise", Wes Craven, feat. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (plus Alexander Payne's stunning atmosphere ... Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9. "Loin du 16ème", Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (talented Brazilian directors, Catalina Sandino Moreno), a simple and moving story; <br /> <br /> 10. "Quartier des Enfants Rouges", Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), a wonderful story. always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Le Marais", Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful (simple but funny); <br /> <br /> 12. "Quartier de la Madeleine", Vincenzo Natali, feat. Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> <br /> Gurinder Chadha's "Quais de Seine"; <br /> <br /> "Place des Victoires", Nobuhiro Suwa, feat. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The "Bastille", known as Isabel Coixet ("My Life Without Me") Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "La Pigalle", Richard LaGravenese, feat. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> <br /> "Montmartre", by Bruno Podalydès; <br /> <br /> 18. "Porte de Choisy", Christopher Doyle, with Barbet Schroeder (mostly "Barfly", "Reversion of Fortune" and "Single White Female"). <br /> <br /> I classified some segments as split and other (or even boring) average, but not one of them bad. In general, I gave him "Paris, Je t'Aime" from 8.5 / 10 and I recommend what it is: beautiful love and other things.
