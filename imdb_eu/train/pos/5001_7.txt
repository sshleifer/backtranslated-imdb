Aardman does it again. Next to Pixar, Aardman Animation once again demonstrates how to do the animation correctly. <br /> <br /> A great time I saw the first section of Creature Comforts. I thought it was a good time for American public. My only concern is that most of the audience will not get humor in this show. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of the BBC version and shorts, I knew what I was about to see when I saw it. The animators did a great job with the perfect match that matches the pre-recorded voices. Check out the first episode with goats, rocks sounds and dogs calling together "dawg" together. <br /> <br /> This for everyone? No long shot. In fact, I would be happy to see the show for the whole of the season. But as I said before, the audience will not get it.
