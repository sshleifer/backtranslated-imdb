Return to the roots "like in the sky". What are the true values ​​of life? The Swedes make a message that attracts every heart. We've seen twice in a movie covered in the final seat: you love love and joy in the choir's music, which is very simple, but full of power when they find their inner tone. <br /> <br /> The glitter of the glory of the prestige that is ready to fully adapt to his new home, as empty and ready, Daniel wants to start listening and come into life. Simple, warm and rude people in the North. <br /> <br /> He has won the hearts with music and he has the ability to love and love without conditioning. <br /> <br /> Do not see if you've been directed to Hollywood. This thing is not extras, your laughter, your mercy, tears!
