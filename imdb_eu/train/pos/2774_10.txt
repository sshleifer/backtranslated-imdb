For me, movies and plays are a story to tell. David and Bethsheba's story is a profound tragedy, and anyone who understands and understands biblical accounts can feel it. In this movie I thought that Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward's story telling were very good. Understanding and understanding the story of David and making a trip to the king of Israel, the story was even more compelling. You would feel a feeling of a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the real difference of the man who had more than his life. Susan Hayward's fear, reluctantly, but then obeying his authority as the King was very well represented. David's anguish could also have felt Urias's night at home than at home. Even when he died in battle he was sad. Raymond Maseshe made me feel the anger of the king's powerful and powerful condemnation. The sets were real and the atmosphere was compelling. In short, I think this is one of his best films. I gave him ten grades.
