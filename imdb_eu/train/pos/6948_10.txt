This episode I saw for the first time was a shock to me, it was really the first time I saw "24". The speed of things happening is amazing, and it's so amazing, exciting, and even more interesting, just like you're reading a book; Before beginning, it is very difficult to spot. Richard Walsh spoke to Jack about his privacy, because having a hole inside the CTU, he was sitting at 6:40, I meant 10 episodes !!! (It seems fun and crazy, but when I'm interested I can not stop being a guy) This is one of the types of this series. And it has been built to hold several stories that are linked together. Recommended in all ways!
