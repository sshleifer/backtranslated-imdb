This is one of my favorite movies. I read the book and I liked it, but this movie is full of everything that is known about the book. The performance is amazing, especially Jon Voight, Mr. A very bad character with Sir. This movie has a certain way of story telling, it keeps you all in the way of linking everything and everything ends. I also love the way in which today's day and the story of the ancestors Stanley are in the lead. Louis Sachar wrote the story, but it seems that this story is made for film, and Andrew Davis directs his work. I highly recommend those who enjoy good movies.
