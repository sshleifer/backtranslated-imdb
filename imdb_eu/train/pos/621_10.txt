In general, fantasy-filled fantasy and Neil Gaiman *, especially among the works, I expected a feature-length film with such a bold, so bold and savvy blend. I almost think it's here. And what do you know? I do not have to be afraid, the movie version is awesome. Different from the book, but in a good way - less capricious, more comical, yet very sweet and charming. <br /> <br /> The special effects are totally stopped and they feel natural and appropriate. without showing the impressive and invading world of the wall. <br /> <br /> We counted accounts and rides with the best accounts, and the main questionnaire is a victory, with the spirit of the prince (almost readable) "Who's Who", the British contemporary "Rupert Everett", David Walliams of Little Britain , two of the Green Wing blocks) steal most of the best lines and steal almost all the fun movies. abundance <br /> <br /> In fact, I've had a bit of criticism about all of the movies, sometimes the comedy elements become a bit of an OTT, the underscore comes out of the window at the expense of the main story ... Ricky Gervais's camera, for example, "Ricky Gervais's usual David Brent Because of the Office comedy character, "it was much less, I like it, and, in my opinion, it created bad and awesome stories from the magical tale that creates the story of the past. (Correctly, although I remember, in the original book, Ferdy's character was quite "Ricky Gervais" when I think) ... <br /> <br /> But this is not a case. otherwise, completely molded and scriptwriter, with a good mix of stories and actions. Charlie Cox, Tristan as a protagonist, has captured the right mix of naivety, subtle comedy and self-realization in a story like this, "a simple boy starts the quest for life-changing"; Claire Danes Yvaine is as beautiful, courageous, and vice versa or ethereal, beautiful as the perfect interpretation of her star role; Robert De Niro, in a camera that is talking about all the reviewers, deserves praise, enjoyment (even with a ball) ... and Michelle Pfeiffer is a wicked wicked witch, Lamia, my favorite. screening of the film If you enjoy the strict performance of "Hairspray", you can also enjoy it. <br /> <br /> So, to complete the review: you will laugh, you will surely smile, and we can even cry - Stardust is a wonderful family and heart-warming fairy, immediately with gold heart and more sass' n smarts . One of the favorite movies of all time, Princess Bride is absolutely wonderful, and Stardust can easily be seen as a kind of movie similar to good reason, similar issues and territory ... and like The Princess Bride. After twenty years of initial release, it remains fresh, intelligent, and fun. I think that enjoying Stardust's oral cheeks will come our TVs (or future equivalent device!) For many years!
