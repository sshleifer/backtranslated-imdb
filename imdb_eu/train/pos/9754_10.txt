Raggedy Ann and Andy This movie is very adorable. We like to see Ann and Andy singing and dancing, along with a camel with wrinkled knees. This movie has made Camel the wrinkle of his knees so popular, singing his song, "I'm noble I Love You". If you love Raggedy Ann and Andy watch the movie and you'll see why they love and adults a movie!
