I've always been a fan of the show, so I accept that I'm a supporter. When the show was over, I felt many questions answered. This film was closed to me. In recent years, I've seen the people I've been following in the end, it was very rewarding. I have probably heard that this is the only Homicide movie we hope. If that is the case, it is a good solution. This movie is sometimes a poem, sometimes amazed, but always satisfying. If you are a fan of the show or have seen it, watch this movie.
