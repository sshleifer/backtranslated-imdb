I'm really surprised that this movie does not get an IMDB score higher. It is one of those films that could easily be accessed by someone, but "Moonstruck" is the same for the romantic comedy. It seems to be what seems to be the setting and ethnic charm. The film only makes it almost perfect. In the 1980s, few films were as good as "Moonstruck" and it's fun. **** outside *****
