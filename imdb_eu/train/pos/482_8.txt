It is a film poem, presented with sensitive artworks and wonderful photos. It captures time and atmosphere perfectly. (Neighborhood of the Italian lakes in the twenties). It's a heart-loving story. The characters are unique and credible. Settings are deliciously exotic. Some scenes --- the fog funeral vacation --- the chess board intricately patterned tile floor long long shot --- are beautiful images. And, happier than happier, this story has a sweet taste. If the movie is an art, it's next to a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> <br />
