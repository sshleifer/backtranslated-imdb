This, like Murder She Wrote, is one of those shows, after a stressful day at school, I sit down and watch TV. Why? Because I really enjoy it, it's shameful that it's not already in the air. Dick Van Dyke is astounded by Dr. Mark Sloan, a detective activated, who solves the killings with his son. For support, especially the unknown but very competent, Barry Van Dyke is the son. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that the series changes their hairstyles. Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter also liked me, but I especially loved Michael Tucci Norman, and he was surprised how he suddenly disappeared. This show is very fun with a great guest star, sometimes it's clear, like Colombo, but in every section, it's always something to laugh at. As a result, a great series with two fingers and a 10/10.
