This is one of the best Adam West and Burt Ward, one of the best meetings to parody and have fun for those who do it. It's amazing that the effort made in detail, especially the recovery of the 1960s, the Batcave set, Wayne Manor, the costumes, and West, Ward, Burgess Meredith and Cesar Romero for the best cast. and Frank Gorshin! This 90 minute is worth your time and it's nice for all fans of Classical "Batman" 60s of the 60s. "Batman" clips were a movie, and not in series, I am sure that I am warned, probably because of legal restrictions. Let's hope the three-time show on DVD.
