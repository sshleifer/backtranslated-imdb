Ghost Story (The New House) is a horrible horror story. This is Circle of Fear and Ghost Story in the early 70's. The beginning and the end of each story is told in Sebastian Cabot. Do you remember the family first series, Family Affair in the 1960s? In this particular story Barbara Parkins and David Birney are the main actors and are the main characters of the story. I saw it recently, and I was so scared! If you are alone, I would not recommend it. It's horrible, gore or curse, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played with her young wife. He played David Birney's husband. Both actors were very well in their parts. If you like ghost stories, funny and horrible stories, you'll like this little curious thing. I gave it a high score. This story is highly recommended.
