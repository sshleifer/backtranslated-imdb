Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a young and beautiful woman who comes to a roadside bar. Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai), the youngest and most irresistible wife, and Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa), will find the oldest and most impure husband of this bar. He sells his mechanical skills through food and lodging and he has a relationship with Giovanna. Both decide to kill Giuseppe, creating a car accident. Their relationship becomes guilty of feelings and police investigation. This masterpiece ends in a tragic manner. Luchino Viscontinu's outstanding black and realistic film. This is the first time I've seen this version of "The Postman Always Rings Twice". I love the work Turner version 1946 and the 1981 version. There, Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange are one of the hottest sex scenes in the history of cinema, but this is definitely the best. My vote is ten.
