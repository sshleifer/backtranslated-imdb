Andy says: "No one is hurt, everyone is earning." Before he said, the truth is that the opposite is true: everyone is painless, nobody gains. It's a new American cinema cycle, or perhaps it's an old machine that has just returned. Think of "Eastern Promises", "There Will Be Blood", "No Country Old Men". These films are dark, serious, very well made and do not care about the happy ending. I love them. "Devil knows you are dead" is in the general description, but it creates its own atmosphere. Kelly Masterson's first screenplay is just as close as Hollywood's movie traces her to the Greek tragedy. Sidney Lumet paid homage to Stanley Don's veteran director, Sidney Lumet turns his dark story into a brilliant dramatic character of the old school. Initial drawings, although the wife trophy wives made with an obese accountant, have the look and feel of the Dutch master's painting. On the contrary, drug trafficking habits are like a chain of Mondrian. Great performances around. The only character in Albert Finney Charles feels a bit, his eyes wide and his mouth almost over time. But then it has problems, much deeper than any of our people ever know. For compensation, Marisa Tomei is super hot. But, of course, you do not have to say that. Why would Gina want her character to be like a guy like Andy, he's never been told, but it's okay. It's an action character, after all. Carter Burwell's unique and magical touch of music makes this wonderful movie masterpiece. Do not miss
