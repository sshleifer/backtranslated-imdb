John Thaw is an excellent actor. I must admit that his range was surprised by the role of a cruel role that tells the old whisperer to escape the streets of London (the era of World War II). It's also an excellent movie. Very moving story, endless ending. Some characters do not develop badly (especially the teacher's school), but they are not essential in the plot. Basically, the story is about the boy and the boy, and the movie does not need another thing.
