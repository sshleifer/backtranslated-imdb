I watched this movie with my father. At the age of 15. I had to be quite young. One afternoon he was in Star Movies. The movie started a bit, but you could tell that the thieves were picking up this score. He got a very fast pace after half an hour. <br /> <br /> All actors are excellent, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I have searched the set, they play well together. At any moment I can watch the movie. I think the characters are trying to deal with the relative stupidity of the plot and the extravagant punctuation. The jokes are not crisp, but at the same time they are subtle and extreme, as they are so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The best comedy in the lazy afternoon.
