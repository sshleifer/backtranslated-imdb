At the time of publication, it's not surprising that the story of 'Panic in the Streets' is released in 1950. He is the body of a mysterious illegal immigrant and no one comes out until the body that looks at a public health inspector says it is an influence on the bubonic plague. In today's world due to the current drama, it is surprising that this film is compelling for today's audience. The director and the team are excellent. Richard Widmark's first role after the first performance of 'Night and the City', with a great movie contestant, Jack Palance, is also a feature film, Paul Douglas and Barbara Bel Geddes, a young (and quite nice). Non-accredited non-professional actors (in Kazan's director) meet the rest of the slots. It is directed by Elia Kazan, Joe MacDonald (later collaborating with Richard Widmark again in 1953 'Pickup on South Street') and Alfred Newman. Most of the participants here have done a better job, and "Paneak in the Streets" is quite rewarding. Especially the fans of black cinema.
