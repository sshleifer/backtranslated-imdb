I watched this movie for the first time and I liked it. His dance was very fun. I read somewhere that he knew he had taken part in this movie because he knew how to dance. It was also an excellent landscape. Yvonne is a talented and beautiful woman. We laugh at the stupid kisses scene, but that's really old movies! I grew up with them in The Munsters, and I'm enjoying his first movie. Perhaps not all of them are the best, but it is still worth a visit to watch and sing their actions. I slowly buy all of his films and I see them received. I have a large collection of his memories.
