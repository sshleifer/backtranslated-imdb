A good piece of fine cinema. This is one of those movies you see, and you do not know why. Well, one of today's most amazing directors can be one of the reasons we are capable of filming emotions before. <br /> <br /> When you're watching the movie, you can see Mr. Straight. He decided to go to visit John Deere to visit his brother. What changed your mind? What changed yourself when you saw this movie? <br /> <br /> Lovely brother of love.
