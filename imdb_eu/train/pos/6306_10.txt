A hummingbird hack, a baby, a security, a plan and a baby. Add them and get the best comedy you have not heard. <br /> <br /> Even with a single list of stars (at least, minus ... well, b-plus?) this film did not get any little advertising. He did not diminish his genius. <br /> <br /> An excellent writing, strong delivery and a compelling group of characters. Some really classical lines and fun fun at the end. <br /> <br /> This is not a dreaded comedy "Nutty Professor". They are life-threatening. The bad man with a low-life lifestyle speaks in their own language and acts badly in their lives. But they do it for your games and entertainment, and they do it well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies I've ever seen.
