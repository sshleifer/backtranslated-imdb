Pinjar is one of the films that really leaves a mark and a great deal of thinking. Located in Partition India, this film shows the real reality of India's partition. Urmila has got the brand name as a beautiful and emotional portrayal of women's suffering. Freedom, personal identity and family respect have been taken on a nightly tragic conflict. Manoj Bajpai is just as excellent as his remorseful abductor. In some moments the movie is crying. At points the movie is very traumatic. Some partition scenes are spinal cold, but Urmila's resistance and survival are remarkable. A woman stole freed women from giving them freedom in similar situations. An outstanding credit award for intelligent characters and storyteller.
