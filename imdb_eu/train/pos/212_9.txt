Together with the "Sunshine Boys" comedy, it has become a forgotten classic after 30 years. In addition to the other comedies of the 1970s, it is hardly mentioned. This does not make sense due to the peculiar peculiarity of this film, perhaps it is the best one ever written by Neil Simon. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays with Willy Clark, along with Lewis and Clark's half-legendary vaudeville comedy. 73-year solo work, which can not get a potato chip. His nephew and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) make sure that he can work if Willy agrees with his unknown partner Lewis Alman (George Burns) for the celebration of ABC-TV show nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is what "Sunshine Boys" is doing, while in the 1920's they featured a series of feature-length plays alongside Cole Porter's "Be A Clown". Then, today's Manhattan movie is in today's atmospheres, where flared pants and polyester bonding are abundant. At that time they collide with a fascinating mix of an apartment in Willemscan Manhattan. In it, pictures and cartoons look at the walls of the long-haired, deadly title titles and Zabar empty food bags. If you had a lifestyle like me in the 1970s, you might even feel like you're in that apartment. <br /> <br /> Of course, Willy is too long. She is sleeping before the TV when the bowl in the other room is boiling. Willy wakes up and picks up the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hello, who is that?" Pause one "It does not matter, it's tea." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < To be cheating makes this adaptation of his 1972 theater comedian. gold. The amazing thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is how much is rubbing your nose in almost existential Willy's, without turning it off. "89 years and that's just nothing, it does not die" Willy says about an old friend of the singer, after killing a song called "lady" and "baby boy" after deciding on the man <br /> <br /> Burns won the Oscar for a smooth but gentle Lewis mute because of his simple acting, but Matthau's house brings make-up and proudness. In fact, at the age of 73 he really sold you. Willy is a disgraceful extreme, Ben deserves a description that deserves a deserving "worthless old man", but you are encouraging for himself, because he enjoys other victories as well as the cost of others' patience. They will also kill you, especially when trying to kill Lewis, the television encounter will be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> "You are not touched!" Willy tells Lewis a moment. "I'm still in demand. I'm still hot!" <br /> <br /> "If this room were in the fire, you would not be hot," replied Lewis. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It allows you to calm down.
