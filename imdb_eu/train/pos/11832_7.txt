The time of time, eh: I thought that the Spirit was an excellent movie. However, there were a few things that were left to me when I was 6 or 7 (I am generous with 7.) <br /> <br /> # 1: Matt Damon gets worse. I was thinking: 'when they got a crazy voice for the main character', when I first heard - and then I realized that it was Matt Damon. The man drags me so badly - The screening of "The Departed" was awful and the movie was prevented for me (before it was possible to break the movie itself, but it's another story in the past), almost "Spirit". "I could overcome this, because there was really a lot of narration ... luckily. <br /> <br /> Point # 2: Brian Adams sucking ... The result was horrible ... The songs were original, generic and bad It was executed, I did not find anything to adapt to music, and the lyrics were awesome. Each Lame song came on shut. I almost thought I would hear about patriotism propaganda (I was not able to play on radio in the 9/11 continuously. remembering the horrible patriotic songs.) Considering the American side of the film, they had to go with the right instruments with the right radio, a teenager, teen-bop, a 14-year-old girl, I thought I'd go back to school - I can not believe it could be better - I refuse to say that, unless I do this, I would add a movie to Disney, knowing one or two things about originality (ok , do not be afraid of some of them to say what they think most likely). Bad, it's a shame not to hire better musicians. <br /> <br /> I liked art and animation, except here and there ... Sometimes angles are too sharp on the face. and lines very thick or dark in the body (thick / dark lines predominantly near the end). I often thought that they tried to express emotions and facial expressions and failed to draw true emotions. But at that time emotions were too thick. However, many scenes were lazy and the layers were obvious. <br /> <br /> I agree that I sleep here, so I will shorten it with less sense before ... <br /> <br /> An attempt at an epic movie horror ... but it was wrong. Matt Damon, you guys!
