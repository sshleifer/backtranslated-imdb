Another Downey to watch! If you're an obsessed fan like me, you have to watch the movie! He plays with Alex Finch, a Yale 22-year-old, who is aware that he has left his life 26 years ago. Alex Louie Jeffries, a happy-married lawyer from Corrine (Cybil Sheppard) has been upgraded. Louie died in his one year anniversary when he caught a car. He wants to go back, this time in Alex Finchen's body. Enter Robert Downey Jr., lots of mess and lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> Although this film is 15 years old, it is still surprising if there is one thing that will be picked up again. . And if so, how many souls live after life? I do not know the answer. But I know you need to watch the movie. It's a rebellion and Downey looks good on smoking. This film believes in love and love never dies. Recycled
