I will not repeat everything I have said about the other viewers of this film. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the movie is excellent, not just the story of a relationship between father and a man. his adult son, but also a small window overlooking the world of Islamic practice, for those who are not very well-known religions like me. <br /> <br /> <br /> This is an important part of this story. young people agree with their father's beliefs and practices, and how their attitude towards religion seems to vary sharply as they progress in their journey. <br /> <br /> This is very thoughtful, pleasant and enjoyable. I would recommend it with my brain and my heart.
