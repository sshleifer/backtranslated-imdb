It is a romantic comedy dedicated to the comedian. As usual, for lovers - Sally Field, the queen of the king Celeste Talbert's telesopen is almost over; and Kevin Kline, a light and talented actress Jeffrey Anderson, are working on a cross, apparently not in love, and so on. Bette Davis's Margo Channing's All About Eve (1950) and a little bit of everything in general. As far as the theater tradition is concerned, Sally Field goes down to happiness while encouraging love and happiness. Kevin Kline, one of the most popular men in recent years, is very good and very successful, at the same time achieving a beautiful, vulnerable, egotistical and lovable one. <br /> <br /> The disaster center feared Celeste's fear of losing her audience in the forties, and the point of crisis reached her nephew, Cori Craven (Elisabeth Shue) as an aspiring actor for NOT his nephew, along with the complications of the subsequent plot. Cori gets involved as a dumb fan since Cori's television, including Celeste's (and Jeffrey Anderson's) relationship. But do not worry. <br /> <br /> As a romantic counterpoint or Robert Downey Jr. (director of soap opera, David Barnes) and Cathy Moriarty (Montana and Nurse Nan) are directors. David Barnes is so hot for him, but he's just one thing: clearing Celeste to make it brighter. To this end, Barnes performs several things to sink the Celeste route, but through evil events and / or logic, all their attempts are worsened for the enjoyment of the audience. <br /> <br /> Whoopie Goldberg plays with Rose Schwartz, the main writer of the show and Celeste's alter ego and confidence. Carrie Fisher has a shallow part of the show nails. <br /> <br /> I thought it was more fun than I was the only other mistake in the television world I saw (Young Doctors in Love 1982 was a global television show and it was pretty good). Soapdish is more fun with a script and laugh-out-loud shoes and plenty of fun performances, Field, Kline and Downy, are fun with Jr. But see Sally Field who is outstanding.
