No doubt, I am glad that I made a movie about Carl Brashear's stunning story. As was the case in Civil Law, Brashear became a source of inspiration for people from a minority group without the intention of obtaining an unexpected status. <br /> <br /> This is an example of the Cuban Gooding Jr. the behavior of the life chosen. It was very similar to Jackie Robinson who integrated baseball and he sticked it according to his nature and behavior. In Brashear mode, Gooding knows that he does not want Carl Lumbly to play his father's life and that Lumbly is clear enough to take more lives than he knew. <br /> <br /> But while Harry Truman Armed. The services carried out after World War II are still limited by the army. A black man can only be the chef or the official car, they deny real battle parties. It's not good enough to make a request for Gooding to become a seafaring divers. <br /> <br /> Once in the diving school in Bayonne (New Jersey), Gooding throws him all, especially the main officer. Responsible for Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may have some prejudices that may be left over, but it may be a hero and an inspirational issue to get a breed of fracture. <br/> <br /> <br /> Of Of Honor Men Of Honor Is Chemistry Between DeNiro and Gooding. Certainly, they come from different places, but they know each other, they are men of honor of two men. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron, DeNiro's wife and Hal Holbrook are pioneers. In the diving school, the army wants to retire only for the reasons you will see. <br /> <br /> Honorable man is an inspirational story about people with courage and ability to change.
