This show was very good, I thought initially for kids was not only for the whole family. <br /> <br /> The first season, above all, was the father of two daughters and son, who unfortunately died during the second season, when I could not hear it. <br /> <br /> I dressed up following the show, what really happened in life and what to say farewell to the episode. It was so well done that it was so hard to shoot that they were real tears in their eyes. I'm a 24-year-old man and this section tears me, I know how they felt that his father was 13 years old when he was dead. <br /> <br /> <br /> Season 2 and Season 3 was a great comedy. We have also had some of our favorite 3 season games, such as Freaky Friday, Secrets. <br /> <br /> I still think that it was enough to continue the show, when I was disappointed, it was not the best. The Familiar comedy show was home to the best home improvement and could be the next friend. <br /> <br /> It would never end, but we're still repeating the love of everyday life.
