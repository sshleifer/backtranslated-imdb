Bellococo refers to the main political film, the description of the revolutionary Italian movement, but it seems more metaphor than reality. Well, the whole movie almost seems almost metaphorous. The revolutionaries, and some of them we learn very little, may be mafia. Get out and get out. Andrea, a psychoanalyst, seems to guard traditional traditional bourgeois values ​​- morally correct, impure, clean and tidy, ritualized. <Br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems that the girlfriend of a revolutionary, Giullia, seems to think what is wrong with the reason he needs, but he can not collect the type of devotion that he promises. (I think here). It seems Andrea, a young teenager, that the guy in the movie is not in a relaxed way. Father is respectful but disobedient. He loves Giullia, we assume, although he's not quite enough to learn how to handle his reflexes properly, but it does allow him to appear at school and complete the final examinations. The route between these contradictory ways of life can be described as "media". It is between one and the other, who knows what the meaning of gradualism is, while it is the screaming person who allows him to impress him. <br /> <br /> In most cases, it is summarized in its final point, asking if he asks him to return the part of "Antigone" and comment on it, contrasting the traditional divine authority with laziness and free freedom. <br /> <br /> That leads us - I do not have any special route. Knowing - Marushka Detmars-i. A few years ago he reminded us of New York cartoons. The two hippocamps are deep neck on the river, and a gazelle looks out over the bank, and one falls asleep to the other: "I hate it." Good actress (Let me leave that out.) But all the others in the movie. She brings her speech and manner with her, the richness of the profuse illusion. And all this comes from actresses, not from executive support. Detmars does not harm Catherine DeNeuve's "Repulsion". The walls are not gummed and their hands grow. Instead, we see animation - sometimes even animated. And the memorable mood that gives us shocking impressions varies and threatens the threatening threat of a stormy storm. <br /> <br /> He was horrified by a critic, but he probably did not look for the word. She is compelling and beautiful in her fluffy brown hair, her white smile ready, her innocent giggles. And the eyes are like paintings on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs. The sexy pieces are quite erotic, because they are not so explicit, but also the characters involved. (It is more interesting to see a pair of honeymoon next to a skin film). Actually, there is no such sex. There is only one scene of simulated interview, but the director seems to be in real time. Eighty-one year old boy in real time. <br /> <br /> The young man who works well is a good thing, because it is a necessary thing, the film will depend almost entirely on him and Giulio. They must do it and they do it. If it were not for shows, I do not know that film that would be as interesting or admirable as this. Romance can be quite slow and boring. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's worth it.
