The renowned director Sidney Lumet offers us one of the best films of his historical career, a story about a family that does not work like a baby is very intense and ultimately amazing. Philip Seymour Hoffman (a performance featured here for the Oscar) along with A-list cast, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has captured pure crime, such as Reservoir Dogs, but family stories too. Ordinary people <br /> <br /> Many audiences will be confused and feel like Lumet's plot is here. Instead of showing linearly, Tarantino's route has taken place and reveals the central scene of an ill-fated robbery when different from different perspectives. Personally, it seemed to me to be happy, and then I constantly figured what would happen. The script is very powerful with Hoffman and Tomei, along with their husband and wife, as well as between parents and son Finney and Hoffman. All actors want to see and, of course, Lumet is having fun with a style that does not usually work. A crowd of audiences and suspense to keep the two-hour running of the audience, this is not a curious film. t disappointed a moment.
