First and foremost is a wonderful series. It is very well done and very interesting. As a fan of World War II, I learned a lot before seeing the series. One of the best things in that era is all conversations with people from the past, when the war was pretty cool, that is, vice versa. There is nothing against the men that are being interviewed in today's programs that most of these men were not involved in the upper level of what was happening. This is one of the best sections published by Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend anyone who wants to learn about World War II, but I really think that only those who are dead, for example, can buy or watch this. The only real complaint about the whole series is that certain events do not know how accurate yet. The information on the Soviet Union is excessive or is inaccurate. This information is different today due to the fall of the SESB. It is a wonderful appearance of World War II and a professional or personal historian of any Second World War to be seen.
