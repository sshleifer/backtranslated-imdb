Well, I'm an emotionally-attached movie I think I saw for the first time in cinema 10 times more ... I'm helping my master's dissertation or, rather, to get away from it! <Br /> <br /> Over the past few years (and several films), what a hand-made little jewelry is! I have never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a stronger performance, and Mr. Jeremy Northam is the perfect Knightley - where does a man like him? << <sigh> >> Miss Sophie Thompson plays between two honest Bates (oh, napkins, sorry!) and the rest of cast does not disappoint. Toni Colette brings Muriel to his Harriet, and Ewan McGregor is brilliant, and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are "impossible"! <br /> <br /> Of course, clothing and costumes, and a beautiful soundtrack, make it almost like a Hobbit. In the film environment - even in cinematography and decorative art, it is almost an overview case. It is very nice, but a little simplicity can have a better sense in a sense. But it's a good idea that the movie is not serious, and there's a lot of fun - and some beautiful beauty that it edits - that it does not sink into Merry Old England. <br /> <br /> My favorite is the ball scene - here's some beautiful performances and direction, and the last dance summarizes Emma and Mr Knightley's relationship. That the last scene of the last compassion is still a long time - cut off two shots (I can accurately figure out what!) And it would be much more that the movie matches the rest. <br /> <br /> Gosh, I just noticed (reading the imdb lists) I saw Jeremy Northam in at least three films, although he did not know that it was, he seems to have gotten much more, as an actor, than a black knight with a heart Being! Hmm, I guess I need to save my video store ... <br /> <br /> Lovely movie. Now, the adaptation of my favorite Jane Austen - Ang Lee's sense and sensitivity might be a better film, this is the closest to my heart - and I've definitely seen them many times! Look, if you can - and do not hesitate to make mistakes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
