This movie was one of the best films I ever saw this year. I did not see the movie cameos, but it's still pretty good. It's similar to Anchorman in the Department of Humor, but I think this is a better-combined movie. It really has a point. If you want to see a whole T & A range, you'll be disappointed. Just a well-stocked movie !!!! If you do not have to do anything for the day or you need humor, it will be a good movie. I think that Ebert and Roeper's review of this movie is correct. I mean, I do not like Ebert in most movies, but that's what I agree with. The movie has enough story, it's really unbelievable that there are people in it. There is something to say about treating virginity in this movie. Yes, surely, you laugh when you find out, but it still suggests waiting. Steve did a wonderful job in portraying the person he made in this movie and is still fun.
