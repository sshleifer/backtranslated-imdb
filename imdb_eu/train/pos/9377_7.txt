Drama is a thriller surprise with more wheels than a double crossover and cruise. Dahl is an excellent plot with an interesting plot supervising under the influence of the Twin Peaks-ish. Nicholas Cage has very little actors and shows a great portrait of a man who has a great relationship. J.T. Walsh (a brilliant RIP actress) is always wonderful, like Dennis Hopper. There's never a shame to make a living profile higher. I'm sure he has his followers. All this is a wonderful movie that shows you that you do not have a big Bangak or commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining movie.
