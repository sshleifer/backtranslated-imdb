The sensitive film shines brightly and, to a certain extent, has no narrative structure, but, nevertheless, it's brilliant to shoot and do it. However, the narrative structure point is controversial. In the latter scenes he combines loose and his thoughts gives an impression that modern viewers describe the "story", but I feel that the structure of the narrative that this sensation requires is "accurate and detectable. It will undoubtedly be compared to SOMERSAULT, the main protagonist (I am not sure enough!) As a young and very young woman, despite the confusion and power of the newly discovered sexuality - of course, Cate Shortland's film examines this aspect, but there is no visually impaired way of getting rid of this movie, much more than PEACHES SOMERSAULT It's also a bit more ambitious, maybe it's not that. Without a doubt, Monahan's first feature is very different: THE INTERVIEW! I'm not sure about the sex scenes weaving and lounging about in the story, who knows ... maybe they did it. The bad and dangerous character of Weaving's character was taken away, though personally I've got this need of these scenes. <br /> <br /> ***** NEW CINEMA YOUR ACCOUNT *****. **** <br /> <br /> In a second look, I can see how it works as a telematic one. But I'm not sure what categories are different or that we're doing this distinction. In any case, I think the layers in the movie are enough to distinguish Hallmark's effort. On the other hand, the film structure is very formal, and its content is hardly a challenge, at least SOMERSAULT, TOM WHITE, THREE DOLLARS, FAMILY LITERATURE DOCTORS, TRAVELING AND SOCIAL TATUA. The performances are good, but I realized that the main reason I was enjoying the movie was that it adapted to the genre of "Australia", without necessarily adding anything ... and I understand that it can be quite good. The reason for another person * NO * Liked! In fact, while Lung enters Vietnam, it does not start a punching movie. But this leads us to another debate - * Do we expect the movie to challenge at any moment? I definitely like a movie (or a book, or other people), but there is no room for a nice story? <br /> <br /> <br /> I have not deleted my initial message from the movie, I am very much aware of this kind of action. But I would reduce my initial grade from maybe 8 to 6.5. <br /> <br /> <br /> With regards to AFI's Best Film Nominees, I voted for MY TYPE, THREE TUES AND MY VOICES. It should win both ways.
