The only thing I saw on this movie was 10 years ago. As I remembered these years, I could not stay for one or more weeks after watching. He was very innocent. I had a vacation with my aunt Ft. Worth, Texas and I will never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter tries to get a copy of her as an adult. He has done a lot of research to find out about the movie, but I always remembered that he was in Barbara Stanwyck and could eventually get his name and reviews. I liked it very much, but it gave me a lot of fear! Jail
