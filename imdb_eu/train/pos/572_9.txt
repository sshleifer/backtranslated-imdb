The answer to what the film has commented on and how someone has responded to the role of his brother did not answer: <br /> <br /> The role of Jess's brother is the form of a dramatic story about irony. Craig Sheffer / Norman could have had a great deal of livelihood with life, seeing how Jesus's brother was. In some cases, Brad Pitt and his life are running parallel, for example, when Jess's brother Craig Sheffer brought him to a disconnected bar and then discovered Brad Pitt a few days later. There was a dramatic irony, Craig Sheffer's character was more troublesome than his brothers before death, knowing that he could do more to avoid it, and then create a greater sensation in the film.
