This movie is all time classic. Music, camera shots and theater are superb. The black-and-white movie was given a much better look and made music perfectly, like Psycho. It's amazing people have commented so little about this movie. My intention is to find a hard film. I gave it to the movie 9 Watch the movie and you know what I'm talking about.
