I watched the movies for the first time on the BBC's July 27, 2005. For me, it was a good interpretation of Conan Doyle, and I really wonder what sherlock fans think. I also think that if you agree with the movie for these fans, ask what you are saying, or A. A. Doyle could ask a strong person or ask. However, it was the founder of the famous Holmes, but how much was a bi-bio? Although this adaptation is very important, it is a movie to be watched - if you do not care about films or books by Sherlock Holmes - look, enjoy and give your opinion.
