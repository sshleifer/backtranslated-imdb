Caprica (S01E01) episode is performed as a pilot. Actually, this section is just as accurate as the DVD rider release. That said, episode 01 is a very important part of the "Battlestar Galactica" series, which is very important (original version and 2007). It is widely applied in the 2007 series. Like the last plots of science fiction, this series explores "virtual" life or environment. In addition, it is much more in line with the Adama family, as well as the relationship created by the Cylons creator (Battlestar Galactica series). In most cases, this first passage is based on "virtual" life (and as expected) about life at the beginning of colonies and on the birth of Cylons. <br /> <br /> In all, I prefer this passage. Although I did not see any new material that anyone who saw the Caprica pilot's DVD visibility, the series seems very promising. As with many riders, 01. The passage cliff stops us to monitor a audience (science fiction community). I am certainly developing, as well as developing. <br /> <br /> I give 8 stars to this series.
