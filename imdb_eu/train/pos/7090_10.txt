Linear linear journey In fact, time goes by 12 monkeys, between the present, the future and the past. However, the linearity of the film can not be avoided: it is the work of the projector, narration development. <br /> <br /> As we can see under the theme of time, it is an indispensable reflection on our actions. . The world of Terry Gilliam is a world that has little space for pure will. <br /> <br /> From the beginning we began to know the prophecy of schizophrenia, according to which the plague was going to direct the Earth in 1997, forcing it to survive underground - the only place where viruses were caused. <br /> <br /> Cole's (Willis) mission is clear: to return to the mid-90s and to relocate their liberation. virus There is no way to change past mode: we will find that today's scientists can collect information that may help (that is, the viewer is a future). Do not change (the past is essential), but improve the present. <br /> <br /> In his "return", gradually, Cole reaches a huge dilemma: his life is better than in the past. in his general life. <br /> <br /> The latter is dark and dehumanizing, bringing totalitarian scientists (word ironically speaking) to "volunteering" to travel to the past. <br /> <br /> Scientists have not yet achieved the greatest achievement over time, and Cole ends the wrong dates, that is, later on in the plot, his psychiatrist will work as proof of Kathryn (Stowe) psychologist. <br /> <br /> We have combined linearity and non-linearity through the evolution of the story in a temporary circulation. <br /> <br /> It's more than a moment. It's the first one and it's almost final - and it's definitely the climate. Cole's reputation varies according to the recovery. Those that are dreaming come true. <br /> <br /> In an airport, a man shoots at death when armed, in the other direction. A blonde woman died <br /> <br /> This is the scene that connects with the past (the child visiting Cole's airport with parents), the present (time of narration). and the future (adult Cole) Throughout the narrative, Cole has a feeling that has already lived in reality. His dream for the prophet is proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened. The shooting agents prevent Peters from killing (Morse) a mad scientist, that is, responsible for spreading the disease. <br /> <br /> It can not be changed. And in the case of Cole, what would be what it would be. Forever. <br /> <br /> It's not very well understood for many movies. For me, less than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Other best-of-the-art films like: Retrospective trilogy ("the mad scientist" with a different angle to the character and even the disintegration of the atmosphere - especially the second movie - Gilliam's work is only a bit more optimistic than Hollywood, Only a Hollywood picture.) <br /> <br /> In another record, "Marrubiak" is one of Bergman's masterpieces. An incredible and luminous journey through the past through dreams and memories. <br /> <br /> I never saw "La Jet√©e", but I could not find it.
