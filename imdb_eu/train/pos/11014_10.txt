I first enjoyed enjoying Cliffhanger, when I thought that woman was scared when she was scared, I thought the scene was terrifying, when you see, I thought you were nervous in your body. Fear full of fear and heart goes faster. I liked Cliffhanger, I think Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and I think he plays Rambo and Rocky.
