The best Chinese movie I've ever seen is, much to my mind, Hero or Chrouching Tiger, much better than Hidden Dragon. The movie is a unique combination of genres: it's a beautiful love story, action movie, comedy and fear at the same time. And the most amazing thing is that it really does! <br /> <br /> This movie reaches my top 5 and has to be enjoyable for all the movies. The sequences of actions have a traditional unrealistic jump and even fly. However, the heroine of the shooter is different and the wing always looks great and it is usually sensible (the ghost can fly) <br /> <br /> See this movie, you will not regret it. 10/10
