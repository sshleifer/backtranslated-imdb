This movie feels terrified when I was just a child. It's not "Citizen Kane" but it has its own moments. The scene of the arms is good. Plots are good even if they are not characters - it can be related to acting. Put some renowned people in the roles and then see what you have. One of those shots was editing (there was little) and distributed a type of movie for a couple of months. This is a low-budget science fiction classic and it's just worth it. I have spent 9 years in this genre.
