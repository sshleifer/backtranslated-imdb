It's not Michael Jordan <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Names that can be easily extracted from the lips of the people, following Russell, Cousy, Byrd, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Wilt; But the volume has dropped a bit, with Stockton and Malone, Charles, Patrick, and the other excellent players who have lost Michael titles. <br /> <br /> I've seen that Gretchen Mol's route was flamed. As a result of the superficial article on Vanity Fair 1998, he announced the inevitable superstardom of Mrs. Molts. They told me later that it was over. I do not agree. <br /> <br /> I still remember the time when I saw The Devil's Advocate in 1997 or 1998, I was confused about what actress Mary Ann Lomax was playing with. Was Mol or Theron? Yes! Charlize Theron was in "2 Days in the Valley" and "Mighty Joe Young" and Gretchen Mol was "Donnie Brasco", "Celebrity" and "Rounders". <br /> <br /> In my time I saw the "thirteenth floor" (Mol) and "Sweet November" (Theron), I had quite a few rushes, but I still kept them in the same mental file. They both had great talents, delicious faces, similar types of body, short hair and so on. <br /> <br /> Theron, however, offered more work. I loved Sara Deever as Adele Invergordon, her beauty was irreverent. <br /> <br /> In 2003, "Monster" was released, and from that moment on, what was known as "Best Actress. It's worth it! Theron was Aileen Wuornos. Aileen Wuornos's real way of looking at something better would be to reproduce once more the digital video captured by Selby's head. And great talents to be physically non-appealing! Unknown! <br /> <br /> Then in 2005, "Notorious Bettie Page" was published. Mol's performance was excellent. Maybe Mrs. Theron was in the shade. It was like a hall for the celebration of the victorious presidential candidate, no one and nobody cared for them. It was a continuation of an old story, a promising actress with a constant career, who takes part in "B". Ho! No, no, no! Wrong! Anything you can think about the movie (and I'm enjoying films from the 1950s) if you spend this, you're missing one of the best performances of that year. Mrs. Moll was so much like Bettie as Theron was Mrs. Aileen. Sadly, Aileen, directed at the public cinema, is a nice character. For any reason, an angry murderer, a sociopath is less disconcerting to us than a simple, harmless, non-invasive religion and religious girl, whose crime against the majority was to live her life completely trusted and totally unbearable. Bettie Page was one of the icons of the fifties. His photographs and movies have never been sexual, ever pornographic, but he was presented as a caricature of all Kinky. There was no sense of realism, only parody. Mrs. Moll captured the essence of the character. Some 20 kilos that won some pieces of jewelry usually added to a small image and put on different photographers for the film, his body was Bettie. The full impedance of inhibitory frontals is exactly in line with Bettie's published. Cinematic nudity usually describes eroticism or sexuality. This film is about innocence. I could not jump to Gretchen / Bettie I wanted to jump but I wanted to protect it from the horrors that people could have in common. If you pass this movie, you are missing one of the best performances of the last few years. By the way, shame this MPAA by giving it an R rating.
