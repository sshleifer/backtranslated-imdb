I like this movie a lot, but it's true that you can not understand it, if you are from Yugoslavia. Most actors were dead and they were the best Yugoslav actresses. I appreciate that this movie is in Divx and in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegowina. Croatia. Slovenia. <br /> <br /> Everything was in Yugoslavia, melting in the Balkan nations. It might be dream land; Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman, and other nationalists who have the idea of ​​poisoning the nation's minds.
