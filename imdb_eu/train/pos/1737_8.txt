I love old movies Burt Reynolds. They are more fun and better than any other movie. You might also have to stop the films that were left after the movie "Cannonball Run 2", but I think how could they know they would not be good? This man is a good movie. Burt Reynolds must dress in chicken and the race is very important, and Loni Anderson will be in luxury, it looks eighty times hot. Burt and Loni were the days! Loni Anderson had this magazine with a container. I love that ad! Additionally, the movie that defaults the hypocritical audience is something that Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and shows the nonsense between audiences and his fingers sticks his butt to show his despair! I laughed so much I spent almost all night! If you find this movie, rent it! And then I never saw the other movie again, right now I tell you: it does not make sense.
