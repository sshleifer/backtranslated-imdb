I'm really addicted to Capriccio, because Battlestar Galactica's prequel series is very good. It starts with a slow pace, but it's likely that soon you will take the new episodes into the air. <br /> <br /> I have heard some great things about the future stars and star guests of the first season. <br /> Sci Fi drama loves lovers who love mixing between two genres. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz does a wonderful job, as well as Polly Walker Clarice Willow! <br /> <br /> Enjoy it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Take Caprican on Fridays at 9:00 p.m. / 8:00 p.m. at SYFY.
