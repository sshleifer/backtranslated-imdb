I watched this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and it is a movie and not a movie, which was apparently shot by HBO in this year's cable network. This movie has been talented enough to be a talented actor to become an acting actor and presents a discipline fetish. The page was more than just a little bit and it touches other roles of modeling, but it's not enough to pinpoint the path of the pinup icon in the 50's. It is believed that Richard Foster is based on the book "The Real Bettie Page". Black and Black is filmed for this nostalgia for the 1950s. I have a book called "The Bettie Page, The Pinup Legend of Life," which has many books on the page's career chronicle, and this movie must be played in the film, as a Gretchen Mol page, many of these famous photographs. accurately. Bettie Page is Bettie Page with black mushrooms and brown contact lenses Mol itself. Not only does Bettie Page look, but it has a personality smile and features that have come up with the camera perfectly. And his body is next to a replica of pages as much as possible. Great casting The story is very thin and tabloidsque and certainly can be much better. But the TV movie is pretty good. I would rate 7.0 on a 7.0 scale and I would recommend watching it on TV.
