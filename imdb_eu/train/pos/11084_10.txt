<br /> <br /> I saw it in the Glacier Fox theater when I was nine years old. My parents took me three times. I started looking for a video about five years ago, but at the end I showed a copy of an online auction line, but I would like to receive a new distribution and bertsolaritza (I understand that the original video was small). The rights purchased by The Family Channel, Disney, etc., and show them regularly. A fascinating story is the story of a life of a family of Azeri family in the north of Japan, told by a wise old tree. An exquisite soundtrack fills the movies well. It would be a seller today, much better than today's children's movie offer.
