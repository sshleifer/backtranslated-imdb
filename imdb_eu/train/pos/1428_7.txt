There is a beautiful and spectacular picture of many landscapes and animals, including the arctic tropical and all. The camera techniques are varied and the places near the aerial works vary. The edition is horrible and the comments are also very appropriate, with the right tone and dramatic and significant events about our world. The place where the movie falls a bit is trying to cover four topics: seasonal patterns, climate change, animal stories and hunts / hunts of interaction in multiple environments. In the end, all are a bit weird and disconnect. Generally speaking, especially considering issues that are worth seeing, but do not expect Oscar material.
