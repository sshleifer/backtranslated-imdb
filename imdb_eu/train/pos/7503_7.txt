The movie is fine, very entertaining. It was pretty good, and the second one I have commented on: Glenn Quinn was outstanding and only enough to see this movie. The group has been brilliant with the "nasty" friend and director of the same! <br /> <br /> "Beyond Gravity" makes a lot of songs in this movie, but this is not really a surprise. The movie is VH1 production. However, if soft rock / pop music is not at ease for someone else, you can progress to these scenes. <br /> <br /> It is necessary to overcome a team that wants to reach the LA flag but to overcome it. The many obstacles that are on the way are not original, but they are very entertaining, somewhere and sometime with the amazing plot.
