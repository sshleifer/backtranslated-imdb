What a wonderful movie ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . <br /> Incredible casting ... <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow Emma's role was perfect. Toni Collette was as good as Harriett Smith. <br /> <br /> The character that stole the movie was MISS BATES !!! He liked the looks, he was amazed at the edge of the seats, he hung up every word and hysterically laughed at it. One of the most attractive characters I have ever met. From a public opening, thanking Mr. Woodhouse when he sends it "this beautiful quarter of pigs" ... PORK, AMA !!! "He calls his torment and Bates (Emma Thompson's mother, interpreted by Phyllida Law) is listening to her unhappy mother, who is lost and lost. <br /> <br /> Emma's comedic way to avoid the grid with Bates He builds himself up in a picnic that is a really scary little scene, when Miss Eman takes Miss Ms. Miss Emma Bates in her cruel heart. Then Miss Miss Bates shows us at the edge of sinners and tears and just so frustrated she can not He's helped, but he's got his heart out. The scene is classical, redesigned and reproducible ... <br /> <br /> It ends with "Sense & Sensibility" and offers one of the greatest lives to get married. Your best friend ... <br /> <br /> I'm mad at this movie for all of you, I like it to myself. <br /> <br /> I ADORED!
