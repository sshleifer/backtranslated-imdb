Yesterday afternoon, there was no dry eye among the audience, since I left the movie, I saw a treasure in this movie in a house sold at this year's Hamburg Film Festival. And all the laughter was shed. This movie was a ridiculous thing, this is not a different way. There was not a bit boring, I laughed with her and with me for three hundred French movie lovers. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat was wonderful. He must have a great clown, if it is serious, if he asks for the situation. Performance, of course, was absolutely up and coming, but this is precisely the story he needed and what worked well. Charlotte Gainsbourg liked me a lot, I loved her a lot, and my mother also had a great performance. Your sisters could be more wise writing, but that's why there's nothing. I saw a good evening watching this movie as it was being raining in Hamburg, and I would like to see that this kind of film from France will get a regular release in Germany. But this country's distributor does not understand that Frenchmen are good films. I can not wait to find a DVD that offers at least subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?), The movie I need at home, so many times more!
