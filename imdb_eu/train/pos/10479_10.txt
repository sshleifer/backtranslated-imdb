My dentist really recommended me the movie, and I'm happy. A mixture of British humor (Should I have to say Humor?) And the reality of a middle-aged widow who lived in trying to survive. Add the added mix of the reality of the pot to really grow (the bushes below the plants will NOT receive the TLC without receiving it) and it's really fun, but it's still touching. The visibility of all the inner patrons with sunglasses, I laugh whenever I sweat with sunglasses! Maybe it's just the blood of the Mendocino counts, but the British probably got it! 10/10
