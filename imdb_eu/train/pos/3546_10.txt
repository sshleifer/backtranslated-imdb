One of the best music ever made, producers and directors were not afraid of an example that they feared for their talent to select actors, than what people would expect. The lighting and set is very special, giving it a very interesting effect (I have a special name that I can not imagine). No single interview is used for contracting. The movie is well-rooted, beautifully played and interesting from the beginning to the end. The real joy is MUSIC. The first songs, from the beginning to the end, are perfectly interpreted and orchestrated. The music is very original and very memorable, and I think about the music of the thirties. Without a doubt, it has original and beautiful songs that have more than just two or three musicians. There is no bad director who has no experience in this type of film. It's another quality when it's cool.
