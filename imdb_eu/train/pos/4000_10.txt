Wow They watch at night and still work. All the people felt real (although most of them were selfish and holes) and a bizarre story - the middle age that started with the endless boy of the widow's daughter's daughter - was absolutely compelling. Highest performances with Daniel Reid in North of Anne Craig and Our Friends in Our Friends (that is, next Thewlis next). <br /> <br /> And the director Roger Michell? That's just as far from Notting Hill. Thank you to God. <br /> <br /> See the movie !!!
