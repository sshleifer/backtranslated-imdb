After seeing this movie in my mind, it's "the first beauty". Beauty is in the actress's theater (Andie is superb as always), in well-designed shots, and the author's red line of ideas - Love. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think Kenny's character is the only one. The place for these three women is also a boring and predictable life. His interaction turns Andean's character into an entertaining, surely entertaining one. When it was gone, it was evident that our internal beliefs and sacred desires can not be accepted and sustained. <br /> <br /> Andy successfully regains this loss is not a bad thing, but rather shows that life is prevalent. Any shape, even in this small British town, is perfectly visible. <br /> <br /> This movie is another reason I love, it's the way Britain is in every way - all of this, houses and "fags" and accent :)). Andie is doing an excellent job again! It's a pity that this movie is very small. 10 to 10!
