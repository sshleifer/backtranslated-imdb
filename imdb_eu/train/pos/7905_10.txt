I really feel like people go to movies and pencils to write down mistakes and warn them about the bad movie. I feel disdain for people who swear to me and I can not hang reality and / or enjoy 90 minutes of boring or busy life! Get a GRIP person. The ECGTB is very entertaining. If you take film seriously, this is NOT for you. If you expect the movie to look like a book in any way, this is not for you. But if you enjoy the fascinability of the queen of the Priscilla Queen or the "what I see the hell" of Moulin Rouge. Or the raw comedy "The Sweetest Thing". Let yourself go to Cowgirl. It has really fun pieces. Really hilarious It also has a very good music: kd.lang spots. Also, I say that it's Uma Thurman's 90 minutes ... should I say more?
