Hanson brothers - Andy (apparently doing his job together) and Hank (clearly not working together) need money. Andy draws an outline for the Hanson family to make the most of the dough. <br /> <br /> This film gives it. This is a roller coaster ride full of layers, knowing exactly what he's doing. I would compare happy crime / thriller mode to 'No Country Old Old Men', despite the fact that both films have a wide range of dramatic and emotional feelings, Devil 'thriller is more prone to fast pace.' No Country 'is really cool and cunning. You can, 'Devil' is a bit more enjoyable. There is no less violence than 'Devil' than 'No Country.' Ethan Hawke, sometimes in the wood, looks like a heavy past, a perspiration and a face to the besieged Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Andy, has the toughest scene in the movie and has quickly become an actor, what you think Can not do that. <br /> <br /> There's really a lot wrong with this movie. It goes back and forth without being confusing. The events go uncontrollably, but the movie never writes (Kelly Masterson's first time), director ( Sidney Lumet veteran) and the edition is as tight as the drum. In many categories, this award is calibrated, but perhaps films like "The Departed" and "No Country" tightened their profile, if you liked it like that.
