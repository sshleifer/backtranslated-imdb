In the 60's, I was not alive, so I can not make sure that the movie was a very accurate representation of that era, but it is definitely a mobile experience and performance. There are excellent performances, especially with Josh Hamilton (With Honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), which are distributed by war. Bill Smitrovich, an actor who has not long forgotten his father, cares with his father strictly, who is forced to question his beliefs and values ​​as his son is forced to go to Vietnam but return as he goes back. Inside, the other is the opposite. In short, this is a wonderful movie and a converter so that everyone can experiment.
