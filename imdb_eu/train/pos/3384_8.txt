My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I really like the movie. Compare the current headless movie (nothing new and nothing special about new events and special effects); Today, "Soylent Green" does not ask about something that does not exist anymore: Think about it. <br /> <br /> Well, there would not be a big surprise that human beings eat "human" cookies on the human body. With all this happening in the planet, and seeing people indifferent to all, this kind of future is possible. <br /> <br /> Surely this movie takes a bit of age but the idea behind the movie is once again authentic. A rich paradise, in hell. Well, nowadays there is a luck, they are television and they are stupidity like "reality". <br /> <br /> Television is clean. It is a blame for human intelligence not to advance the technology. Since everything has stopped being written. <br /> <br /> If you like reality, the movie is not for you. Even if you think the politician himself. You do not like to now and wonder about the future, let's not ask the movie.
