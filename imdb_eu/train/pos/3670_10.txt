I rented this movie on the DVD without knowing what to expect. As I am learning places in Canada, I will certainly bring them to class in all places. <br /> <br /> The story, centered around the unfortunate film group in the history of the history of the cinema, is a magnificent handwriting and a very talented actress obtains a direct performance at all times. <br /> <br /> If you can not just laugh at "Hollywood North" "I recommend you to see a psychiatrist right away, you can have serious problems. <br /> <br /> In addition to the wonderful script, Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine I also saw a great chemistry, Jennifer Tilly (playing as a deadly actor), and Martin Landau also made a very fun and entertaining show. <br /> <br /> A great movie, even better.
