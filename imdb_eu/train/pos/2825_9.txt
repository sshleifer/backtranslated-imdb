The movie was amazing. Actually, I did not expect much. Greta Garbo's first Hollywood movie? And what? Probably, it's something rough and common that has regular recessed nipples and facial reactions that show so low silent films. <br /> <br /> Well, I was wrong. Greta Garbo's studio people had to be surprised with me, because this movie has become a star, so it's worth it. He understood the power of out-of-instinct, or simply having a significant expression for a long and lasting moment, so that the effects could be felt and ignored. I continued to think myself, how did this modern actor get a crisp silent film? He spent years and years in his time. <br /> <br /> The story is not very interesting, finding and losing the usual tale of love. Garbo is in Leonora, after a bad town in a big city, and gives life to the man who returns. Ricardo Cortez is an excellent cooperative, but his character never really develops, and is very much dependent on the script. At one point, Garbo's clothes are dressed, put to bed, and then he will give them irreverence. Let's not even talk about Garbo and his wife's horrible scenes. As usual, I did not have much career after this and I understand why. But Leonor's obsession is as good as mystifying object. <br /> <br /> This is a completely fantastic movie, all that's just said. "Leonora, you're going to be awesome." Yes, it's obvious. <br /> <br /> Really, if you want to know what you do not want to see the whole movie, see the last 30 seconds or so - while while lying in a silly look at Garbo while saying in his luxurious car. all. "He must be happy, he has what he wants" - yes, Garbo's face says that. I need to see it again, Garbo is amazing.
