I really think this movie is very good, personally. But every movie is down. Now, some of you might not have seen 'Raise your voice' in Hilary Duff, but if you think about it, you know exactly what the two shows mean. In "New Girl Brave", Holly wants to get into the Haverty Conservatory so badly. Terre wants to "Raise your voice" at the L.A. conservatory (do not remember the name of the conservatory). Both are in the field of music, and they both need to sing at the end of the semester. It is very funny that both films are the same. Even though I personally liked 'Brave New Girl', 'Raise your voice'.
