I saw the pilot as the first rider, and I am sure that many "Spirits" hated fans, like Batman, Green Hornet, and so on, he took the character "camp". But, of course, I never got enough of Batman, because I thought I was entertaining, in the same way in that show. There are two parts left with me. First of all, Denny's pair has been deadly and always performs a dramatic talk as always in the law and in his letter. Then he says something, "Boy, I'm stupid!" What this way of saying to Denny, that's why (even though it's about TV Batman) to become a Vigilante. Then the scene where villainess will enchant her to kiss her, but do not be fooled, because she is honest because her kiss is surely enough! The actress and actress was also an excellent example of "camp".
