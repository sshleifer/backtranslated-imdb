I am facing Jim Carrey's work. This film is still in my head. Grinch likes Martha May, Cindy Lou (who is very annoying, innocent innocent), which Grinch intends to achieve the Christmas spirit, Grinch's childhood (very funny!), And also with Christmas isnta. t about all the gifts. I have to say, the theater came out with the fool, the baby and the small bunch of little children, but this movie was a good adaptation of Dr.Seuss's short film and IS ages.
