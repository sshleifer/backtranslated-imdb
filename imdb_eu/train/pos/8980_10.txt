I should first admit that I'm a fan of The Dandy Warhols, and that's why I came to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The peculiarity of this film with other modern rockwives is not only that it is not only. About a story page of a group (called Wilco "I Am Trying Your Heart"), but it takes a long history of the group. In this movie, the director and producer Ondi Timoner have followed closely the friends and their rival The Brian Jonestown Massacre (BJM) and The Dandy Warhols (DW) for more than 8 years (1995 - 2003) and the movies are filming 1,500 giant hours. 1:45 p.m. (Future DVD books will have much more material than the original movie). The result is amazing: there is no filler. The film is 100% and is a true footage of footage, which is why you are feeling the progress of cinema together with your favorite films over the years. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < With Dandy Warhols signing a contract with Capitol Records, he was disbanded by Brian Jonestown Massacre (his director of self-destruction, Anton Newcombe) after making a single record, especially in Europe. (at least, how the film is represented). And the film comes down to Brian Jonestown Massacre, contrasting with the rise of Dandy Warhols. <br /> <br /> First of all, I was glad to tell the story and the story of telling Anton Newcombe (for example, Courtney Taylor - The Dandy Warhols boss), but after thinking, I noticed something is wrong with the movie in this. <br /> <br /> First, Anton Newcombe is treated as a person who has disappeared. The project began in 1995 as a documentary about the groups of promising emerging news; For this reason, Anton Newcombe and Ondi Timoner were the same partners (for this reason, in those years, Ondi Timoner had direct access to both teams). Anton Newcombe was brought to The Dandy Warhols project. In the end, he was totally excluded, as was the case with the project. People talk about BJM, but it does not take part in discussions. I think it was not reported by the team when the last editing process began. There are always two aspects of the story, and here we have one ... of course, as you might expect, Anton does not accept the final result and he watches this film with his old friends. <br /> </ p> Secondly, the film is very much a trend in Dandy Warhols. Without a doubt, the winners take everything, but tells Courtney Taylor (DW's leader), which seems a good chance of a seemingly implicated feeling, and the later history of the groups is considered to be moderate (BJM is covered until 1997 and 2003). Until next year), it does not add objectivity to the film. Third, the movie is (somewhat) superfluous. What do you want to teach us? A critic said: "... the film explores the old questions: where does the origin originate in a commercial world? Does it get and needs to be self-destructive to preserve its integrity?" No, these questions are not analyzed! He describes the story of a great but successful musician, who is not so brilliant, but who tells the story of success, which secures oneself and secures the eternal freshness of an ego that is taller than the mountain. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie was fun - raw, fresh, elegant ... it's just a godly interest, at least for DW or BJM lovers. The rest of the people - I do not know ...
