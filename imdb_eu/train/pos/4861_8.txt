Joan Fontaine is "Damner in Distress", a 1937 music show featuring Fred Astaire, George Burns, and Gracie Allen. The land, about what is around, is about a British woman in love with an American (Fontaine). Astaire, it is wrong with the musical comedy. <br /> <br /> A film directed by George Stevens, Gershwin has a wonderful music, such as "Nice Work You Get You" and "A Foggy Day." The best scene is the "Stiff Upper Lip" number, which takes place in a fun game. <br /> <br /> Astai's voice song is stronger in this film than the others, and it's superb. dance numbers Burns plays over his top advertising and is Secretary of Allen Burns. It's fun Others have said that Fontain must dance with Astaire at the end of the film. Stevens could easily double in a long dancing that he used to do, and it is taking place between trees. I thought it was double except dull dances. <br /> <br /> Certainly it is worth seeing.
