It's a very good movie, only Lady Murphy for comic lovers, but also for those who like animated movies / adventure and fantasy series. <br /> <br /> It's about a girl that kills the movie. something that he did not do something, but who was the daughter of the king of hell, Lucifer himself. <br /> <br /> Then he seeks revenge ... and the rest looks better on the movie. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie, the characters are like original comics, it's Chaos. I have never been able to read the first episodes of the story in comics, only last ones, after the episodes of the movie, so I can not say events are comic commercials, but ... one way or another is Lady Death!
