A complex story set in the back of the Bharat partition. An honest Moslem kidnapping a Hindu Muslim innocent and a Hindu who burns a Muslim man. However, at the end you would like both. The story is powerful, but the script and the flow are questioned. Rear music scores and songs are remarkable. Next comes the memorable Urmila Matondkar veteran. Photo The time of the Punjab countryside, captures violence and taste very well. Other actors did not play or did not play. The management link is really weak. The characters were not well developed. It's not crispy, unlike "Land", where it also draws 5 line characters. The end is very interesting. This story may have different endings and could all be the same.
