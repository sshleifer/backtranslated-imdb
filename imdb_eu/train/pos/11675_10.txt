Dakar always continues to see, so my husband did not wait to buy Charlie's 'Race to Dakar' DVD house. Of course, we saw the run of the race, but this is never the background and specific teams. <br /> <br /> When you start the journey, if you go a long way, you will not be amazed. Actually, it is a language that is more offensive than a fun one. <br /> <br /> The only thing that worried me of the DVD told me he was Charlie's hair, but he was named before Dakar so he needed neatness to fit the feminine one; Tho 'I like' flame 'without undies lol like LWR, the preparation race was just as incredible as it was. I almost cried when Charlie broke his hand and shook himself before the hateful ones during the training ... and, of course, the death of Andy Caldicott ... the tragedy was horrible, but there is something every year. <br /> <br /> Russ is nuts, although its attitude has improved a thousand times by arguing film. It's good to see Charlie as good as now. <br /> <br /> I learned from this odyssey: 1. Never leave Scorpion when preparing your vehicle! - They had a month of preparation for X5, and even before leaving the team to Lisbon, Scorpion only had half of the things that had to be done and the vehicle was in pain throughout the race; 2. Dakar organizers have to do more work in the driver / driver's recovery plan - Matt (and maybe many other riders / drivers dry out for themselves unless they are dry). The adventurer wants to be "hard and hard" in the adventures, but he really likes to do it, and in the end 4. Charlie and Ewan are planning for the long-term in 2007, and I can not wait to put their hands on them !: D If you love bicycles and / or you can go to the really pleasing "vowels," you must see, I guarantee that you love me. It's really fun. <br /> <br /> In the end, Simon Paveyri - you're a hero, I was so impressed with your 'calm intellect' mode and you've really finished ..... it's really a race that's incredible what monasteries are. And Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team - for the elimination of the whole brand. A pretty green group can not think so much that it's got really marvelous. You are wonderful.
