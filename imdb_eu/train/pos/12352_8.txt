My boyfriend and I liked this movie a lot. The viewer is moving away from modern life to the viewer from Japanese life, which at the same time deals with issues. The characters are realistic and accurate; It has an unpredictable ending and story, very refreshing. The story is made up of mini-lands that inhabit some of the geisha living in a poor urban center. A movie that I recommend to anyone interested in an ancient Japanese love or real life. <br /> <br />
