Undoubtedly, Beat Street is the best movie about the breakin scene. All this is everything, clothing (puma), music and dance! The story is basic, but what's the story of that? All the point in the film is to show what they were doing at that time, they were important. Adolescents are generally good at showing age, that is, everyday children have had a great deal of importance in music, dance and friendship. I've been surprised by the good news of the DVD I've seen for a long time! The costumes were not dated (maybe Puma is currently bouncing), fresh music remains and dance is still attractive. A film between 10 and 25 years old should be seen within its youth culture.
