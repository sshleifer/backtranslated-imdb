Eytan Fox repeated: the viewer's heart was going through a dreadful dive. The film also describes the amazing city of Tel Aviv, an incredible city. <br /> <br /> I was a month ago and everything is there: life, relationships, heart. In the city, the mess, the thoughts of utopian minds, stifling the lightest and most unforgettable megalopolis ever. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended: a trip to the hearts and minds, with an interesting perspective. Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Nota Bene: There are middle loads of the movie. If you think you're too gay-friendly, be prepared to be challenged and finally see "just love". (and do not worry: Chick is hot too!)
