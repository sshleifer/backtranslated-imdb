Well ... easily my favorite TV series. Call a footnote message, but enter violence, mafia, sex, games, drugs, etc. in a show. Combine all of this with the performance that goes beyond what you've seen on the small screen, add direction, adapt it to vintage-style cinema, and make every effort to compete with intelligence (and develop a few long ones) and get yourself a show that will be quite tough to compete. <br /> <br /> Above all, James Gandolfini, Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco, his wife Carmela ... stand in the way of Gandolfin. Words can not indicate a way, if you do not see it, now see it now! <br /> <br /> I can adhere to all the characters of the show, psychological splendor. scenes, etc. But I could not stop, so I can say that with Seinfeld it's the only show, I'm able to see it from the beginning to the end and I enjoy it too. more.
