The novel "Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni", written by Mar√≠n Preda (a very controversial book and movie) continues the screenplay of the novel "Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni". or Hamlet's story, which is very popular and difficult to achieve due to the satirical content of the communist regime. The drama of human intellect represents a "red world". A movie with great passion, fear, sexuality and a great movie recipe. One of Romania's biggest films, despite its psychological burden (after all, is a European film).
