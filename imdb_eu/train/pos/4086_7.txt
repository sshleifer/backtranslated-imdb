Wow Uhm ... well ... wow! I start to land. The bride (Lucy) will come to her husband (Mathurin) in France, where a bishop or cardinal or someone from the Catholic Church would come to marry (to meet the will). Waiting, young Lucy learns the legend of a Beast who traveled for centuries. At night in bed, he begins an attempt to rap and agree with Beast's fantasy and the old lady. That's interesting! Plots are pretty fine (and they seem to drag some time in the middle of the flick), but the filmmaker awards it (?) With a touching and hilarious ending. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. If you're looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a movie about honesty (a good looking look at the subject), the movie is for you! (If you are weak in the stomach, do not be afraid of it. At the beginning, horse deeds are a very cartoon 'deeds', IMO).
