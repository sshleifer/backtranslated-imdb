As regards Nathaniel Hawthorne, he said his failures were more successful. In my opinion, this same comment was adapted to McDonald-Eddy's images. And above all this. <br /> <br /> It seems that it has a lot of empty movies: it's kitsch, script, censorship, and does not have any strength? However, this film has good points: Rodgers-Hart's good music ("I got married with an angel", "pull strip"), with E.E.Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you do not like it, you can not forget it. This strange movie really strikes a dream, leaves the impression, and you will probably consider it for days, maybe weeks. Why? In the early sixties and early 60s, the films did not have the same average current: like dreaming, the deviation of people had to overlook a difficult reality. This is a great force among all the dreams of this time. <br /> <br /> To say a bit, let's say if you want to understand this movie better, it's not good or bad. See, like you would see a dream.
