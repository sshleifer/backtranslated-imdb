The Secret of Nimh and the unforgettable masterpiece of The Land before Time, was a sour-blue cartoon. I remember very well from childhood, funny and dull and very beautiful. Well it starts to get dark, a pound escapes and a dog runs away from a friend, ends in the sky and returns. But it becomes sweet when it comes with an orphan girl who can talk to animals. Some scenes were horrifying against other cartoons, like Charlie's dream sequence, but everything else was fine and the songs were straightforward. Memorable Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I love that guy, though. And Judith Barsi Jaws The Revenge, God can rest his soul, little girl, she would not deserve to die, but now she is in heaven, good people go to heaven. In general, the animated film is very good, classic Don Bluth, anime and Disney shame. Recommended for the whole family. And knowing that, if you have a video below it, you will find it after the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, but that guy loves it.
