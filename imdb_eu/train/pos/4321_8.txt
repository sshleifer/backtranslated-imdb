I will do this pretty briefly. I think it's a great movie. Badly written, badly filmed, it has a great soundtrack and, worse still, I have not seen the real life of the portrait. OK, therefore, it's not quite credible in its entire length, but this film seemed to have lost some hope in others. Do not expect too late to save tremendous things that people are still so much life. Gangland is real violence, right? Okay, no! This movie has a great social message that cynics do not like, but it's still to be praised, but instead of being ignored. I watched this movie with great pleasure at least eight times, each time with enjoyment in the same way and every time the world is better and it is a feeling beyond the saving (not until 2008). 10 to 10 this for me In my opinion, it's almost perfect.
