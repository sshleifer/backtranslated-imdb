When I saw this movie on TV I never saw it again. During my life, I could not remember the title and I met the movie credits by Roy Thinne. An excellent, horrible and horrifying television horror movie called "Crowhaven Farm". "Do not be afraid of fear"; and "Satan girls' school," all satanic classics lost. Clint Eastwood also has parallelism with the classic "High Plains Drifter". Why did not these small shorts premiere, especially when you look at the latest garbage downloads from Wal-Mart Discount DVDs? Most of these films continue to worship, so sales do not have to be a problem.
