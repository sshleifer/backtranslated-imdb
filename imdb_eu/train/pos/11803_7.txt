"Sasquatch Hunters" really was not what I thought. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Inside the forest, Park Rangers Charles Landon (Kevin O'Connor)) Roger Gordon, (Matt Latimore) Brian Stratton (David Zelina) Spencer Combs (Rick Holland) and her sister Janet (Stacey Branscombe), escorting Dr. Helen Gilbert (Amy Shelton-White), are Dr. Ethan Edwards. Gary Sturm) and Louise Keaton's assistant (Juliana Dever) to find some of the best bones around. When they camp, the team finds huge burial and rare bones in the region. When the members of the group begin to disappear, they begin to walk in the woods to safety. Sasquatch is behind the killings and the group has been found to survive. <br /> <br /> Good news: this was not so bad as I thought. The movie really begins to fall into the middle when the creature attacks. This is a magical series of scenes because the whole group is suffering from attacks by creatures, and the suspension of the whole play-out is very large. A tree-lined area that is pleasing to these pieces increases tension and a person who walks through the woods will arrive immediately. The use of external stripes is quite generally free through the film, although it is a general use of scratches that are really dreaded. They really add much to make this part so penetrating, and in others, shouts of shouting. It is very effective and works well. It's quite nice that the last part of the film is getting pace, because it's coming out in the midst of good performances. A scene I'm sorry to say is a special scene at the first show. As a man walks through the woods, he finds the expedition he is looking for. Helping him to lift his hands, the second will announce his presence, he has been attacked from nowhere and has died quite quickly. He was surprised and I saw a small jump for the first time. <br /> <br /> News erroneous: there were just two pairs to complain about here, and it's a common complaint. The creature here is given through CIGs, which is quite ridiculous and destroys credibility. The air of threats generated by the opening of the movie has been filmed almost directly from the window when it appears on the screen. It's so strange that it's a shame to have a little bit of work. I have denounced this a lot, and it is something really to be done, because it does not look realistic, and very false. Another great off-screen is dying here. Often he was captured by a person in the film and then escaped after a bloody body. It is very serious if the murderer looks nice and juicy. Otherwise, I do not have a problem about this problem; For those who did not usually criticize him did not worry about me, but they're called for others like that. <br /> <br /> Last ruling: I like this, but it's never the best Sasquatch film. It should not be taken seriously, and if that is so, it is really nice. The enthusiasts of these films have to take a look, and some of the features such as Sci-Fi Creature can also be found here. <br /> <br /> R rated: graphic language, violence and some graphic shells.
