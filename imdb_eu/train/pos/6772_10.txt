He said he sucked this movie like a different user (and Olivia Hussey was terrifying), I do not agree. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing !!!!!! Olivia Hussey is wonderful where she is! Yes maybe he's older now, as Rome and Juliet remember many, but it's wonderful! <br /> <br /> This story line can often be used, but it is the only movie and I will not fight with consensus! I liked this movie as much as any other movie in the movie Olivia Hussey. I love Olivia's "my girlfriend" and my work. <br /> <br /> I first saw it on Saturday (07/04/14) and I fell in love with her. Not only because Olivia is a movie, but because of a unique and wonderful story.
