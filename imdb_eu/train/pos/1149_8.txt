A fast and fun satire about a live television show. Robert Harling has a dramatic writer with funny and funny scenes. The best of them is the highest point, a live broadcast, improvisation bad and a brain transplant quickly. Keven Klin's killing her lines, because she has not been wearing glasses, is horny. "He conceals his brain in the next homes." It is a great scoop on the Kline's page. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall and Kathy Najimy are perfect. This movie is like the one you can click on as a movie. This is a classic that slipped in some way by cracking. <br /> <br /> P.S. Alan Silvestri scores is a bonus. It fits with his flamboyant and melodramatic air for his television.
