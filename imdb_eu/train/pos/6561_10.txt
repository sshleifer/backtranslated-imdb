Honestly, this is the best reality that has ever been shown. To earn money, you really need to have a RESTAURANT. Ahead, courageous, wicked, etc. You need to have it, it really requires dexterity. Just like the little bangs that happen in these days. And yet, they only have two seasons! The bull ... they must bring this show! <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's hard to get out with Anderson Cooper from CNN. It was great. <br /> <br /> But seriously, the show was amazing. You never knew who was going. And so much fun was trying to make the muzzle yourself! You could be a show if you want to play it yourself! <br /> <br /> EKARTU RUBIO !!!! USE RIGHT !!!!
