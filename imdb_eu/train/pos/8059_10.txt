At night, I saw the film at Turner Classic Movies and was amazed at the performance of Victor McLaglen in every sense of "tour". He recalled the atmosphere of Dublin in 1922 through the design of cinematography and production, prioritizing techniques used in the first 40s of the 40s and early 50s. He had very detailed details; While Frankie McPhillip's (Wallace Ford) wakes up, the dooms are praying. Irish Max Steiner's unforgettable score. Later, such as the 1939 GWTW films, the folk balloon adapted to local color and place and time. John Ford: A giant movie already in 1935!
