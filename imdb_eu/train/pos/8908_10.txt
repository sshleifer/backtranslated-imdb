First and foremost, I did not see the "Blob" when I was 7 or 8 years old and it was a great experience to see it as an adult. They can also write about the influence of pages on horror films today. And even more could be written in his social context in the 50s "fear of teens". This small horror story of the Interplanetary continues to be a very horrifying movie, if you leave it. <br /> <br /> Surely this cheesy thing seems like it is in our modern world. But the momentous "The Blob" raises the horrible terrifying children as they continue to be unstoppable, because adults do not believe it. In fact, there are also a few mild moments in its sweets. And Steve McQueen gives much more than just the story that's worth a bit of money, so we're captivating the audience at the moment and believing that we're believing it. <br /> <br /> In short, if you take away your postmodern irony filter, love it much more than it looks.
