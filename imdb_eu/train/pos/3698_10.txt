I did not know this movie L.A. Until I read in the Weekly I agree with LA Weekly reviews and I decided to get a ticket to get this movie. filmmaker Molly Parker (Deadwood) and Lukas Haas, the protagonist of the movie: I could see more in the near future. The movie is fun, has mild hearts, great performance and beautiful pictures. I do not know if the movie has a distribution, but I hope it's coming soon. this is a real indie strange. my favorite music also has silver Jews! Molly Parker was the only despair in the project. no, there ... I was given the best movie I watched at this festival.
