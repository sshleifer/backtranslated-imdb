In a word - excellent THIS IS CINEMA. Go and see Director Ron Howard ... I mean, the director Ron Howard has done a wonderful job, as usual. Attentive attention, vivid colors and decorations, Whoville atmosphere, amazing outfits. Wait, there's more than that, the story is very good too. There is a clear message from the viewer's thinkers. Jim Carrey is high. Probably the best Grinch. Taylor Momsen is a really good girl. I'm sure it's a great future. The dog is nice. After all, it is a very Christmas story of great quality. If you like fairy tales, it's for you. If you want Christmas, it's for you. <br /> <br /> Read other comments here ... Take life. It's time I'm sorry to see people ... well ... that the hearts were two too small.
