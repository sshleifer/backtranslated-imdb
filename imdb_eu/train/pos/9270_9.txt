I must emphasize, before reading the review, that it is not in any way an expression against the Iranian people ... that you really want to read something, rather than hope, that is, in general, against politicians. ... but if you want to get upset ... I can not help you! <br /> <br /> Because Iran's film is not forbidden (see the curious features of this film). It's a pity because it's a great movie. It would not be called "Grbavica", which could be won at the Berlin International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> From now on (if you wanted to be the second or second place). Why? Because it's a movie clip This woman is no longer a problem. The Government is trying to keep people up. Analogy is so clear that the government should ban the prohibition of the movie. But by banning, nothing is fixed and / or this movie may disappear! <br /> <br /> Another reviewer had a huge summary line: "comedy about a tragedy", which is quite good!
