This film begins with a family with different directions and Martha MacIssac, a teenage daughter (Olivia Dunne), was in love with Joe MacLeod (Zack). The mother directs Mitzi Kapture (Jill Dunne) and immediately plays her daughter and Zack, and then there are many problems. Jill Dunne always travels or is a husband that is far from home. The ally of this family does not like it, it is also a great problem that decides to travel abroad, and it can not fit into the open air and keep all the bells properly. In many ways, Olivia has a great performance for teens and Nick Mancuso (Richard Grant) as a great hotel owner. He will continue to guess how this film ends, and you will enjoy the full of fear and fear. Enjoy
