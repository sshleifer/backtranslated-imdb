OLIVER TWIST should also have debate and success, after Dickens published in 1837. It was a moving and new image of the city's ghettos, and the main figures of the novel were some criminals. /> <br /> One day he went to London and passed a young woman who liked his friend. He said hello, but it was pretty hard for him. He could not understand A few days later they met again and asked him what he should do. "Well, if you know, I did not like your latest novel," he said. "Really, others think very well." He was surprised: "What's wrong?" "O, Charles," he said, "I am a Jew. How can this character be like Fagin?" He did not expect this: "Well ... you know the Ikey Solomon's robber in the last year, a trial judge. He's a faginist and he was a Jew." <br /> <br /> Dickens did not settle things. "Yes," he replied, "he deserved that. But Charles did not call them" Jewish Solomon "as you call" Fagin "" Jew ", and Salomon did not plan to murder. Fagin." Dickens could take it for granted. He left thinking about what he had said. <br /> <br /> Oliver Twist was published in several publications. Dickens tried to improve Fagin. Then he got an idea. He has renewed the chapter entitled "Fagin's Last Night Alive", while the man is afraid of hanging on. He has added more details. <br /> <br /> He decided to change his friend Fagin. He met a friend a day or so later. He looked at him as he was mad. "Do not you like the changes?" He asked. "Charles, what's changing - he's still a mad mad man!" He replied. "Yes, I have saved them, but you will not see how afraid the death of the prison cell." The young woman realized this, but felt that she felt so bad that she was afraid of fear. "Ah ... then it was because of me ... and I added the small details that I saw?" He asked. "What details?" He answered "Seeing the first Fagin now he is preparing dinner ... do you read that?", Dickens hoped for a glance. Instead, she was confused. "I read that there was a fireplace, but I had to pass the passage." Dickens smiled as brightly as he was, "a pig is preparing dinner." "What a!" He said. "He is eating pork, my dear ... see ... it's not a good Jew!" His friend looked at him, shook his head, and, in his affliction, he left his friend's house. Years had not talked to her. <br /> <br /> Dickens never damped his avoidance, but led to a partial attempt to change the novel that changed the situation. OUR MUTUAL CULTURE (1865) has little character, Mr. Riah. An unpleasant escort eats you to rent. The plaintiff indicates that the landlord will be considered Jewish. <br /> <br /> <br /> But Mr. Riah is a good man. Good man The man is very, very, very, very good - as good as being disbelief. When Fagin began to see Mr. Riah, he would surely go back with a stick. <br /> <br /> Fagin is similar to anti-Semitic until today. It's the size of the writer Dickens, who overcomes the novel. However, when the story is filmed in the film, scriptwriters and directors are having problems: how can the film's cinematic treatment of a novel be affected without the whisker after the Holocaust? David Lean showed how they appear when one or two scenes from Alec Guiness show the human side and, finally, face a mafia with true dignity. Sir Carol Reed continued the musical version of the novel due to the rewriting of the original music script. <br /> <br /> OLIVER entered the West End music band in the mid-1960s and then moved to Broadway and succeeded again. With a wonderful score by Lionel Bart, including "Glorious Food Foods," "I'm reviewing the situation," "Look," "Sale Boy," "Who buy it," "Including the time for me". it is worth the success. Reed has done well, including her nephew Oliver Reed Sykes, Ron Moody Fagin, Mark Lester Oliver, Jack Wild Dodger, Shani Wallis Nancy and Harry Secombe. Bumble A decade of non-musical success in Hollywood - The latest GIGI was won by the Academy Award for Best Cinematography in 1958. OLIVER won 1968. <br /> <br /> And Fagin - how to manage eternal. caricature problem? In music, Fagin did not capture, try and commit murder. In the end, even though Lean Fagin tried to control his confederate in his actions. But here Fagin realizes that he is becoming too old to be dependent on this kind of life. Although he loses his treasures (because he knows their value and admired their beauty, these saved objects), he can reform it. To this end, he admits his faithful acolyte, Artful Dodger. I do not think that Dickens would make changes (maybe he might have his friends), but a modern audience definitely considers it inappropriate.
