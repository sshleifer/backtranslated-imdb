"The Plainsman" indicates the direct director of Cecil B. DeMille. Creates parallel plots for Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer, and Abraham Lincoln. when the dead story is over. Again, DeMille floats on the truth as it is dangerous, but it immediately moves away into a pure spectacle and show conception. Custer is an essay sponsored by Custer's last place, with a fictional, life-long battery of people, which has already been manufactured and manufactured. Actually, this is the world by DeMille - a zeitgeist in entertainment analyzes, but quite a campy relic, according to current standards. often white with clean and very strong blacks. There are several films in the film series and it's not missing at other times. In short, the quality of the image is a bit incoherent, but it's never bad or good? slightly better than in the middle of the road. Similar age-related objects are maintained and digital anomalies are not disturbed. The audio is monkey, but balanced. <br /> <br /> EXTRAS: Forget. It's universal! BASIC LINE: As a pseudo-history on the celluloid, this western is compelling and fun. Just take his paintings and story a salt specimen? in some cases? It seems like a whole box is more suitable!
