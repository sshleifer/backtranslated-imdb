What a wonderful movie. Although it was not based on real life, Forbidden Lies was a portrait of an exciting element. And it's true psychology students can learn some sort of lying about. <br /> <br /> Forbidden Love's author, Norma, appeared as a cheating on the media, but this movement offers a great deal of opportunity. to clean his name. <br /> <br /> But the bends that documentary take are amazing. What a patient is a woman! I love this movie. I have not read the book but I have heard good reviews and I saw a boring rainy afternoon. This film takes your journey light, interesting and completely penetrating.
