East Korean folk culture is one of those films that are exploring around western cultures. <br /> <br /> Loving Local Time is a sad movie that is not appealing to those who are not the main ones. Ken, a rock'n roll fanatic, a Japanese girl from Kyoto, will be able to stay in the United States when her visa expires. The marriage is expected to be temporary, that is, until Kyoto acquires legal status. He seems to have lost all relationships, it's the Kyoto one and he tries to make things work well. That's why his friends spoil Kyoto and get rid of all of the girl's engagements, but it's a bad rock n 'roll, though he's inspired by broken hearts and all that's written. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto comes from a traditional Japanese traditional education, and it is not expected to be married to all Ken. Not only that, but at home it is wrong and wants to return to Japan. It's sad that Ken finally loves and has been with him, and except that he has found someone who feels this way, the girl is not expected to continue long. It's not like that Ken does not like it, he simply has "a totally notary of life". He said: "I can not say the way I feel in English, and Ken can not tell how he feels in Japan." The 80's soundtrack is a sad story of a techno-nintendo killer. <br /> <br /> I loved Tokyo's Time of Love, they reminded me of my favorite movies of the 80's, Tokyo Pop. And as you have enjoyed the Tokyo Time of Love, look at Tokyo Pop (New York singer goes to Japan and joins a Japanese Japanese coverage group), except for a happy ending movie. <br /> <br />>
