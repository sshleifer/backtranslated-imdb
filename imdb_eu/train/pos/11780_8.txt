I have come across a documentary that I have found on the More4 channel in the UK and I thought it was very interesting, I became aware of it. The main material of this documentary will be to find that book. Basically, Jared Diamond is a theory teacher, why some parts of the earthly societies have prospered and others do not. The argument that he presented to me was new, and he worked on the correct farms where the wealth of good farming is sensible. Regarding the documentary, he is very well shot and well described, without part of the restored scenes that destroy a lot of modern documentaries. Diamond also helps not be condescending, that is, many intellectuals are a mistake when trying to get messages. People are Marxist theory, but I do not buy this and I see more social geologists. It was refreshing to hear a theory about the evolution of a religious-based society. It is highly recommended to watch.
