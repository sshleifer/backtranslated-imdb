It's a very well-made movie. I heard mixed reviews while in production and I was waiting for the release! Encourage the director and all the actors. The help he had to work with was Eva Mendez. The rest say that the last part of the film is very awful. Katie Cassidy did a great job with her character, because she did not do much work when she made this film. She wants a career before. I was surprised at things. I enjoyed the movie, I questioned my values ​​in life and preferences and I am a better person! A great message is inside the movie. Release it to enjoy it all!
