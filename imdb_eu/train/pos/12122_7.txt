It can be a great movie. I saw her last night, but I do not want her to give her honest opinion because I first read the book. The book is much better than the movie that was disappointed. If you want to see "Human Bondage Of", do not read the book before. On the other hand, the book is so good and has a lot more than the love with Phillip Mildred, and you can still enjoy it after watching the movie. I do not say this claim lightly. I read a book for four days, and I have seen several authors like Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Platon and Shakespeare. "Of Human Bondage" has won one of my ten novels.
