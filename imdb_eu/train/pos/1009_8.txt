Event: Stargate SG-1 is a science-fiction television series. <br /> <br /> There is no escaping. How much you try to excuse or explain Stargate SG-1 is a young science fiction television series. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG-1 lends and steals ideas quickly. The special FXs are not as exciting as you can and the action will not come out of the chair. Or a seat too. <br /> <br /> But that's actually what I think is worth every credit that Stargate SG-1 can get, in every section or in the stolen idea. science fiction movie that is worse than a television show of at least one hour. <br /> <br /> In fact, some sections needed 90 minutes and were still better than the best films. <br /> <br /> And this quality is saved in the show and is able to carry out the story and promote the story, as well as Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> I'm very hard with my selections. Perhaps one or two TV series are mostly followed, and I keep high standards, when I was caught I was surprised. <br /> <br /> So there's no science fiction show for those who decide on the Stargate SG-1 brush. You stick with it and you'll see what I'm talking about.
