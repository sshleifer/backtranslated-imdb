Madhur Bhandar touches on taboo issues and gives the most realistic picture of modern society. The impression of the director can also be seen from the first films by Satta and Chandni. The topics discussed in the recent film are discussed here. The casting is amazing and the views of each scene can be viewed from a wide angle. In most cases, the movie asks you a lot of events. As things begin to guess, you're most often approaching, but in many scenes you often miss out on the brand. Eventually the impression lasts. <br /> <br /> The audience is Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Iran and Atul Kulkarni, among others. The interviews are well written and you feel like you live around some of these people. There are still some scenes to think deeper. The songs are backed up and the voice of Lata is saved in a significant song "Kitne Ajeeb", which only allows you to feel left behind in the midst of modern society!
