It's a high-school shooter like Home Room colombian, but instead of overcoming the incident, there's nothing more than movies about what happened and what happened with trauma, guilt, and denial. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * The same shoot is treated as a provisional consequence, since they did not respond to a SWAT teenage commando after filming a high school murderer.

Occupy Philipps, older than Christensen for three years and completely unknown to me, I was away from her dramatic and screen presence. This girl was a part. <br /> <br /> It is a great movie and it relates the brittle and brave relationship between two girls traumatized with you and their special attention. Gus van Santen Elefantea (2003), although good, almost dramatic and dramatic play seems to be almost superficial and homemade. I see this movie as a screen time and a small exhibit. The loss of a traumatized American is much more. Ten to ten
