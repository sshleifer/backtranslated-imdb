This movie is very fun and never boring, it lasts almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the pieces are excellent in the film and they are very credible. Violence was a bit of an extreme movie, but then it showed how drug trade was at the time. The ending is amazing and one of the most beautiful scenes ever happened. Great movie and you'll probably really enjoy it.
