James Stewart and Walter Brennan Cowboys bring their herd to Seattle and Alaska and join Canada to make a claim. In it, Ruth Roman has to fight with a seductive and shameless business woman and James McIntire must be a gifted spirit of spiritual spirits. <br /> <br /> John Wayne can talk more, but his good friend Stewart has made western western superb director Anthony Mann. Actually, I would take this, with strong action sequences and beautiful melodramas, in more than one northern Alaska day! <br /> <br /> Far Country has amazing landscapes and cinematography to be screened on the outgoing screen. <br /> <br /> In addition, Brennan, Roman (wonderful), very pretty Corrine Calvet and James McIntire, who always plays a favorite of my favorite tunes. He does not take it seriously. <br /> <br /> This would make a double-billed bill with the other Mann's Northwestern Northwest, Bend Of The River.
