Jim Carrey was part of The Grinch and I was impressed by his performance. I was not afraid of his lack of enthusiasm, but I was pleasantly surprised. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou. For a long time I have seen on the screen, she was the happiest girl, and showed her maturity in her maturity for years. Sometimes I drew tears! I have not read a great book by Dr. Seuss, so I do not know what I expected, the humor was quite dark. In general, I enjoyed the movie (aside from the songs!) And I would recommend it, especially to the family.
