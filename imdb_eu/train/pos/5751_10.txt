What can I say about this movie? For the first time since I saw it I saw it 6 times, I saw the English version and it was done very well. It's an excellent movie for all ages, but it's aimed at children. I love the child's humor and I appreciate it. If you have not seen it, you should rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!
