The only reason I wanted to see this was Orlando Bloom. Simply the average movie was spectacular. It's not bad, but it's really not very good. The edition is good; The movie is a good one. The directions are competent and certified. The story is plodding. The movie Ledger, Bloom and, usually, Watts and Rush are superb. Accents are impenetrable if you are in the US, I like to sit down and enjoy the landscape (or as I call Orlando Bloom). At the end of the film, I did not get bored or moved. Some people asked Ned Kellys about what happened at the end of the movie. I have to say so I do not like this point. <br /> <br /> Really, the only reason why I recommend it is Orlando Bloom, which shows some sorts of bundles (although often ... I'm pretty attractive ... I'm pretty confused, so fangirls are worth the price of matinee You can find it. Just do not see it. It's not enough, not bad enough, to be entertaining.
