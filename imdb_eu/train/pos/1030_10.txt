I have named this and the best science fiction television series BABYLON 5. My mind stands out as unlike the two STAR TREK series, because the evolution of the plot and the characters is consistent. STAR TREK and STAR TREK: If you look at the original TNGs, they were good shows, but all sections did not have a general theme or plot. In many ways, you can usually watch shows without sequences to understand what happens. It was less with DEEP SPACE 9 (all the last season's great battles were taken) and TREK had another story that showed more. It seems that this consistency has been developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and has been seen more extensively with SG-1. In that sense, it was like the series could be seen in many families or it was slowly taking a long novel. Of course, there were some "detachable" episodes that were not linked to the rest, but they were very few and far away, and they were usually quite fun. <br /> <br /> And conversing with fun, I loved that SG. -1 he kept moody from time to time and was not so bad. In this way I enjoyed much more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character on Homer Simpson's sarcasm and love. It is very bad that it gradually disappeared from the series in the late seasons. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> This consistency gives the extraordinary power of the show. If you do not like the correct SG-1 option, science fiction is definitely NOT a genre for you.
