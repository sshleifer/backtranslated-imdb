Reading books by James Michener with remote places with the names of strange sounds, probably the most popular in the 40s and 1950s. Tales Rodgers and Hammerstein in the South Pacific Ocean became the success of Broadway. South Pacific was directed by Joshua Logan and Sayer was making films for the success of another hit by Michener. <br /> <br /> Before a decade, American films in World War II were not portrayed as Japanese. pleasing I am sure that it was not easy for the people of war in the Pacific to change their attitude from one night to the other. This and, in general, a policy that is not occupied by the people of the country and, in general, the core of this story about interracial love. <br /> <br /> Sayonara is a big movie today. The military have always been able to escape the personal life of their workers, as civilian employees escape illegally. In the United States in Sayonara, there are still laws of miscegenation in many states. Nowadays, military gay people are a serious problem. Someone can make a movie like Sayonara one day. <br /> <br /> Joshua Logan was a land known. South Pacific also had racism in its plot. With a safe hand, Logan prepared a beautiful old story. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, and Kent Smith Western players do a great job. But the oriental steals the images here. Miko Taka is a beautiful brand by Brando's love. But the real stars are both the Companions Oscars, Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki. <br /> <br /> The buttons are your temporary enlisted Air Force member. Miyoshi Umeki is in love with Katsumi. They marry and the military does everything they do cruelly. The Buttons and Umeki are the best known. Buttons was a television comedy and a fair talent, but he never got any part of the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> And Miyoshi Umeki was the first to give an Oscar to an East. He earned a lot of attention during the Oscars, which featured the Drum Song of Miyoshi Broadway. I had the privilege of viewing Broadway, which I had ever seen was the first Broadway show. I still have a memory of that. <br /> <br /> This Oscar also symbolizes something else. The war ended with Japan and we saw a great nation of Sayonara tradition and culture. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Montalban plays Nakamura, a Kabuki theater actor. If Sayonara is doing now, Logan would never escape. But Montalban is well. <br /> <br /> Positioning photography and a great story. This film has to be revived frequently, with great morale.
