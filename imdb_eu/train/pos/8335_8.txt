Although bright chemistry between Ryan and Robbins is enough to see this movie, it can add a double support (including Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning, and Jacobi, Saks and Maher, a fun trio). Matthau is shining as Einstein, Fry Ryan's clinical fianc√©e is perfect, and Shalub is a line of Einstein's gig, as noted, one of the most important events in the film. The talk of Robbins for the first time was pure poetry. To make Kudos writers manually and smoothly. I thought it was as brilliant as Keene Curtis Eisenhower. This may be like a pikodas movie, but I think everyone's coming out. Eight strong points.
