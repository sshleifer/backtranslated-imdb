When the daughters of current college daughter were in the preschool, this mink was present at A & E between 8 and 9 in the morning. My neighbor and I made an agreement, Jane Eyre had not lost a minute and our kids went to preschool every morning all week. Good choice <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, I forgot how much I got old VHS copy until I came out. Timothy Dalton is very beautiful, but still perfect as Rochester. Dark and voracious faces, a steady and direct attitude tempered with humor and tenderness were directly from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a bit of landscapes, I could not sit through a wimpy William Hurt or Curing Hinds grumpy adaptation. Magic is that women love Dalton and capture romance. <br /> <br /> I'd like to know what Zelah Clarke is about. Jane is dead, relaxed, formal, telling the volume with a mere look. The brightness of the eye gives the spectator the power and awful nature of the abuse of abuse by young people. The criticism of "wood" is lost. A servant of a good English house maintained this behavior, but he spoke passionately about excitement. Unlike many other Janes screens, it's pretty clear that Jane is still good enough to buy Rochester's attraction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < in full. Dalton and Clarke captured interactions between Jane and Rochester and a quiet and intuitive incident. Although Jane's vanilla is just as plain and sweet as Frost, she wants to darken and whirlpool Rochester. Both directors play each other beautifully. <br /> <br /> This is the best adaptation of the best American ever ever.
