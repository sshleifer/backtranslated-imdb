I was really surprised that there was not enough people in the movie and I had to write something about it, even though my comments are similar to those already written. <br /> <br /> I like a lot of movies. Excellent performance between Mastroianni and Loren. The narration of the film: Humanity and love are being developed gradually between these two outsiders, and the fascist radio-agent (who is part of a Mastroianni partner) and the followers "instead of going temporarily and drawing with the contrast of drawings" and the show "For me, it's a great movie about being a human being, maybe some of you would argue that the" anti-fascist "" message "is clear, but it's not for me to destroy this movie anymore. My vote is 10/10.
