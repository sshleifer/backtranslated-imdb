I've been a fan of this movie for years and years. With Teri Hatchers moving in the forefront, I had to get out of the shelf and watch it. In 1991, why did not he see why the movie was wonderful for me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are wonderful. I have never seen day-to-day TV series, even though this movie kills me every time I see it. The play is in a comedy, and intelligence is so intelligent. If I still can not see it I recommend watching. You will see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher ... to name a few ... all give great performances.
