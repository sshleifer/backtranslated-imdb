I was fine when I saw a teenager in the movie ... The songs had a huge success but the elite classes skipped the movies of Govinda. coz govinda and karishma (aka karizma) were not seen for this "class", but many people liked the fact that the series of these films spread to the 90's and most of them were successful ... I saw them again for a long time And I remembered the people that created the style and rebellion they created. when a song appeared ... Govinda and Karishma dresses for each other (the worst little costume of that time) were welcomed in the late 90s, the charisma was transformed, but Govinda was still very faithful, his designer still remained the same as the dress ... but then everything It was mixed, it was very good ... everything went well and the elite class gradually realized what was missing ... and it was not a matter of looking back for the Indians to continue a series of tracks that a few people love but who love them. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to rent in time or do not watch on TV, I do not think you'll regret ... but remember it's the worst thing at its best. <br /> <br /> I still watch these movies I've got time to cook, I can not laugh, I'm laughing ... so I'm going to continue and I'm funny, there's a time when we all love stupidity and, above all, kings of his time When they do, it's probably watchable ... Recommended for movie lovers ...
