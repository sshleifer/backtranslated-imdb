You are waiting to see the shadow better or worse. I gave Audie Murphy to the movie 3 ((I'm a tough guy), I made the second smaller Audie (the smallest "Battle at Bloody Beach" if you're curious). I give this movie a "8" value (and I'm a tough release) soldiers "story, if you want to call them against the North, people like Quantrell and illegal men. <br /> <br /> The original version was juicy, the cover was very clear, but it still represented these men's fears. True Say, movies like older versions are targeted at adult viewers, because they separate this story. I would appreciate the original "R", which is a GP of a dense nature, because newer films give a fairer version, a message that will make it easier for young readers to get older.> <br /> In the early sixties film makers talk about "realism", but some of them have been delivered, instead of scenery, clothing They provide strange things and events, but with the stereotypical comic book characters, the spaghetti era's weakness. <br /> <br /> Modern filmmakers realized this mistake. Today's Western style is clear at the top. This movie is an example. It gives realistic settings, but they also give us the characters that exist at that time. <br /> <br /> It has a few barnacles, which is why it is very difficult to sit and have unexplained situations. But unexplained situations are fine as long as the feature films last forever, and the characters are quite interesting. <br /> <br /> It starts a bit but really improves. It is a person we can identify and identify at least as sympathetic. The first film Audie Murphy does not mind sympathy, and even without motivation is honest. There is a motivation and insanity method. We never feel that it is really "proper", but we can understand where it comes from. <br /> <br /> There are many activities in the film. There is also humor. It's a good scene when it says heroin hero, who is not lying, thinks it. <br /> <br /> This movie is made by filmmakers who work for decades. The director and the writing team are well. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Full success
