I do not agree with this previous comment on this movie. I thought it was nice and funny and they brought me good messages to girls like girls. You do not have to wear a cool costume as a cheap outfit. You can be both stylish and stylish at the same time. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good cast and the story came from the public. All-in-my-my-wife-daughter (10) and each one thought it was a good movie. I definitely recommend it. He also encouraged my daughter to start reading the mysteries of Nancy Drew, as she probably loves Hardy Boys. <br /> <br /> Tonight was to sleep because the battle wanted to start reading right away. I can not imagine that the best result of that movie was to spark the interest of that classic series.
