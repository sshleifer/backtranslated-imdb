With Chris Rock my hobby varies with his films; I hate 4 after the deadly Weapon, but I hate all that movie after that. I like him and he does not like it, like Dogman. Well, this is his best yet, it was not that good that was expected. I walked across my ass all the time. Chris Rock has created a wonderful story with some of the funniest comedies that I have seen for some time. I love.
