E! Television is a great channel and Talk Soup is so fun, you can change some episodes in a flash. We want the best entertaining writer Stan Evans. The patron saint of ordinary intentions ... He is a truly talented writer, actress, comic, producer, director and founder advisor. She loved Anna Nicole, but it was not a $$$$ Billionaire Billionaire. Many super stars have wanted to make the movie with actor Stan Evans, interpreting "Humphrey Bogart" {Clark Gable}. He had to do much more film. Maybe with Stephen Spielberg, or maybe with other talented producers. We want to get FAME to win a great moment. Does it create a dramatic production? or maybe any docudrama ??? A project on Bernie Madhoff would be an excellent TV movie by STAN EVANS. How many scriptwriters have you written? Is it a contract under $ $$$$$$$$ .000 million? It should win more than $ 50 million ... It may write a recent TV movie called KING OF POP. Michael Jackson. We want to see more and more on Stan Evans and on TV. Thank you. Elvis has left the building !!!!!
