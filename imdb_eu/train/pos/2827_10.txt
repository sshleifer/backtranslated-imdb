This is probably a bad movie ever made. It ... terrible But it's so good! It's best if you do not expect the earth to be terrific and something wonderful and fun, because it will be disappointed. However, if you want to see 50 million vases and you can see the wonderful hair of Goro / English. Really enjoy it The harder the movie you think, the worse it is, if there is no competition, you'll find holes or screws, and you've got a few hours of entertainment before that. I really would recommend this film to make you feel terrified or tough for Smap fans. And even then, the latter should be very careful, because the Japanese Goroes were somewhat annoyed, they thought they were selling themselves. (It was not really, when Johnny Kitagawa (when he was an executive producer) can do that.
