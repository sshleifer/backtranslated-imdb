I enjoyed this movie and I had a very low expectation because of all the negative reviews I went before. I went this rumor completely annoyed, because some posts were so angry with that movie and with Korea. Oh, and he has published Korean favorite movies. I liked the host, but not my favorite. Favorite science fiction / fantasy movies can have a sense of my liking: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City. <br /> <br /> There was not much confusion as everyone said and that monsters were good and great battles. There are a few holes in the story, but it does not really matter. I adjusted these things and stopped asking me for some time when I saw summer meals. The Korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation work was different, and I believe that the characters are faithfully dressed as the Korean actors in other characters. Ethan's (Behr) hair was so Asian. <br /> <br /> Yes, it can be better and in the future, Korea can expect the extravagant senses of life, vivid emotions and unexpected humor. diversity to the blockbuster genre. Maybe the host and Dragon Wars combination in the future?
