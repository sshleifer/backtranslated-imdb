THIRD SERVICES THIRD STILL "If you want to do something right before you start to kill Baldrick" The unfortunate show of the second series came back with loyalty to the current renowned proprietor and server. Prince Regent, Hugh Laurie played the vain and stupid role of Blackadders Venom. Baldrick still carries it as another piece of comedy. The format is similar to the previous show. After all, now they have changed their formula. We see that Blackadder is much more likely to get rich in the back of the Viceroy's wealthy, trying to find a good wife for Bladrick M.P. In many ways, one of the most authentic series in history, the king of the prince took control of his throne during his assault on his father's insanity and some of the characters tell about many times. Samuel Johnson, William Pit and Wellington go through events and steal their scenes and they are not easy.
