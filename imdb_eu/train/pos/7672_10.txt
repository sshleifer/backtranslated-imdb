I must admit that Holly was not in my Edinburgh Festival watch list. However, I decided to see the Festival's Artistic Director after expressly recommending people to more than 200 films, before giving up another movie. Wow! <br /> <br /> The movie is a very difficult and uncompromising topic of child prostitution. Sometimes I'm crying while I'm in the movie and I laugh at others. Talking about an emotional roller coaster Keisha Castle-Hughes reminded me of Whale Rider, but here the task is much sharper because he needs a child prostitute. It can win many prizes. <br /> <br /> The main story is about a girl who is selling her family in prostitution and was held as a sex slave in Cambodia Bordelu. He encounters an American (who plays at a potent role by Ron Livingston who does not use himself), which after a while has decided to help him. By the time, it is sold again and looks for it throughout Cambodia. The story becomes and becomes and the viewers can never predict what will happen. <br /> <br /> The effect has been very strong with the international figure very interesting. Udo Kier (very credible as a sexual tourism), as well as Virgine Ledoyen (as a social worker) and Chris Penn (one of her last films). Asian cast was also great. <br /> <br /> Although the film deals with these difficult subjects, it tells a strong and compelling story. It was shot in Cambodia (almost real scenes in a brothel) that is added to a documentary. It seems that DP has used hand-made cameras and approaches, and it generally feels like part of the story. <br /> <br /> After the screening, I was listening to each other. The audience members went and they all seemed shocked. This is not an easy movie and I can say to filmmakers for not making "Hollywood Film". <br /> <br /> In fact, it's the best movie I've ever seen at the Edinburgh Film Festival. A shared opinion by my husband and others.
