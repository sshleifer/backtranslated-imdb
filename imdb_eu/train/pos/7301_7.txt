When I was released on the DVD "Hammerhead" and eventually I heard it in my local DVD store, I thought "Nu, Nu Image's other cheap monster movie." Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner's boys over the last few months created B - cheap but very funny photos, but also very disappointing films. So I did not expect much, especially a few days before I saw the "Shark Zone" disappointed. But "Hammerhead" was a revival of the 1950s monster movie. We are a mad scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, shouting at women and girls, men who eat, and, of course, beasts, a huge mix of sharks and sharks. A fun monster movie that you need. The only thing missing is the nudity of the sex scene and the nuances you expect in this kind of movies, but since the television movie has been made, it's understandable why these scenes are missing. And it does not matter that "Hammerhead" is the best entertainment and horror entertainment. I have given seven points to seven points, however: first of all, the monster is not often seen and the destruction of creatures is faster and worse, and in the second, William Forsythe is just not the best part of "hero" and fall in love with a beautiful Hunter Tylo. In addition, it is highly recommended for movie monster fans for these movies. Take fresh drinks and popcorn, watch the movie and have fun. Jasper P. Morgan
