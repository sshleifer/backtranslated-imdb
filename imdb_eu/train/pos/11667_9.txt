Kells's secret is a movie that I've seen after watching the Cartoon Saloon's Kilkenny footage. I'm here to say, it's worth waiting for. The cartoons are very stylish, but they are not annoying, as I was afraid. The whole movie is a great beauty and imagination, especially like a lively animated book, where small images live on the page. Characterization is excellent, I like Brendan Gleeson's voice as an Abbot, and especially liked the voice of Aisling Sprite. The forest is a victory, a beautiful place. The story is well understood, the mix of truth and fantasy. and really draws the viewer Brendan encouraged the Book to look for the perfect materials. I am a lover of calligraphy and lighting, however, as the subject is close to heart, but I know all the people I have seen and craftsmen do not agree that it is a beautiful movie. Without a doubt, I will buy the DVD when it's released, and I would like to say, well, all the people involved in Cartoon Saloon and this mammoth project. There may be many more. :) If you returned here, I said that I bought some DVD copies and when I was given Christmas, everyone loves it! And I want all the luck around the world to have a great joy of Oscura to see this name.
