It seems that there is no movie in the middle! Mostly it happens in a dream and like most dreams, it is often stupid and not logical. There is also a great production of excellent songs and beautiful plays, especially our angels. <br /> <br /> The unknown suggestions of Jeanette and the fun of the dreams are fun to laugh at and surprise Binnie Barnes with Jitterbug is a surprise and enjoyment. At one point, Carmen begins to sing a part, the last trio of Faust (for some reason of equality) and "Aloha Oe" on the beach! <br /> <br /> Comedy is surrealistic, it is very funny when you enter the slot.
