Broadway music brilliant film. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) wants to kick dice and love organizing illegal acts. Adelaide fairies (Vivian Blaine) wants to love if her beloved wants to marry her. In the final game, Sky Masterson decides (Marlon Brando!), Big bets in the city. Skyk is committed to the fact that Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) can not go to Havana with her. It may seem like a strange plot plot, but it's also a movie! <br /> <br /> This is a real bag that is confusing: here are some wonderful things. The songs are good and the dance is incredible. The actual show stopper is the final crap game. Brando is also pretty good here, it seems weird to think about singing and dancing, but he's thrown away. I must admit that Brando's big and dancing moves are big! Sinatra is also pretty good and Blaine is wonderful for her girlfriend. His singing and dance numbers must be emphasized here. <br /> <br /> Now, for the worst parts, Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress, but he has no colorless footage and can not do that much. The movie is too long in 150 minutes - Brando and Simmons' scenes should really drag and narrow. In addition, most of the characters speak English in detail. Contractions are never used. Maybe I'm trying to be fun to get out of the gangster's mouths, but I thought it was annoying and I was thrown out of the movies. <br /> <br /> It deserves songs and dances, but its length has gone a bit. I give 7
