Baghdad thief is a treasure. First of all, the story is good. Despite the exposure to my four-story children's story, one of the most famous stories in the Arabian Nights comes from Disney Corporation, the interest of the Baghdad robber until the end. The story moves at a good pace and the reduction is reduced. Sabu, who plays with the young thief, measures Abu, faced with any teenage actress of today's recognition, as her eldest daughter heard me, said: "It's a c-u-t-e!" <br /> <br /> In 1940, the film won Oscars for cinematography and special effects. Today, of course, these effects seem to dated ("Look, Barbie is through the air," she declared my daughter in front of her father's eyes). However, the story goes well. The film ultimately has more than 60 years. Effects match script. Also, those who see the Thief of Baghdad maintain the state of art quite well over the next twenty-five years. Only the initial editing of a Star Trek 1967 session has to be compared to see it. To do this, it was a great achievement. <br /> <br /> This is classified as a family film, even though the end is roughly earrings. The play is so obvious and wounds are the bloodiest of those scenes that are so animated. <br /> <br /> All, a fun movie that deserves a bit of free entertainment or a historical value. consequences. I recommend it.
