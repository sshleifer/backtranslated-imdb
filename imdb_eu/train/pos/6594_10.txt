Tweedy's teachers thought they had all gone out. Nowadays, the people of Polini live from migrant Asians, the Far East, Island and Island, Tahiti and the rest of the tropical islands of the South Pacific for thousands of years. But the thought was not well thought of by the young ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If this explanation were true, how are people born and growing in these islands tradition, artwork and physical characteristics similar to that of Asia, but similar to South America? How do you look like Ecuador, Peru and Chile plants resemble a few thousand miles from the island? Is it reasonable for Iceland to look at the ocean in South America and say where their ancestors came from, Tiki, the equivalent of Adam? Meanwhile, how do the Norwegians tell about the scandals that fled from the South American continent colonized, and together with some native countries, they start off from the sea - WEST? It's too much to match Heyerdahl. Many Moxie, with a few crew members and local knowledge of traditional rafters, starts an expedition. It is a journey in the human imagination, a pseudo-scientific manifestation, which means that it is possible only for the instruments and sailors' basic factors. The Oscar-winning documentary can have ethnocent tones and insights, but it goes through a spiritual adventure that improves the spatial program that started a decade later, thinking that men think they plan to think. It's true. Wonderful. Make yourself a favor and read the first book. This is an amazing page page and is a perfect set for the news style movie.
