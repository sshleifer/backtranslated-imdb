This will not entertain the movie you see, at least I do not know most people. <br /> <br /> The wars are portraits of body and mind cruelty, as the characters seem plausible, especially because you have "read their minds", something that rarely happens in books and films, but it is very well done in this work . "All silent in front of the west" and "Die Br√ºcke" would put me on a permanent impression. <br /> <br /> I could see it in the school, along with the other two films - However, finding a copy was pretty hard, that is, shame.
