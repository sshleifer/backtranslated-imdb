This is a great movie, I've done a play for some time. I had an extra Zing ... I loved Vanessa Williams, Rosey, and Jason Alexander has a good voice. It was very good. The environment was very good. For two hours and 50 minutes, it is quite long. In general, I give 8.5 stars. They added some parts, but it was still cool.
