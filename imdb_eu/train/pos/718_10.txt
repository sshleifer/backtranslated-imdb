The best Rock 'n' Roll High School movie ever was created! I think it was so wonderful that it was the only reason in Ramones! You can not do the same movie and put something like The Clones in the Sex Pistols or instead of The Ramones, it would just be the same. youngsters, clint howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel and theaters monters, have just added a new movie. The whole movie is about Ramones ... especially Joey! So, everyone has shown that Rock 'n' Roll High School is your true PUNK hobby. It's not the boys of the new joke ... but the types quickly and quickly. Only type Ramon can do. R.I.P (Rest in Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
