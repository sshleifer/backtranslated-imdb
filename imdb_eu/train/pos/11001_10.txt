The Canadian director, Vincenzo Natali, took on an exciting circuit of stormy weather, Cube's crisp and surprisingly intelligent, favorite SF movie of the 90s. He created a fundamental reflection of a group of strangers trapped in a maze-like cube, shot in a single set, and taken up in a wonderful direction. <br /> <br /> I'm eager to track Natali, and for another five years, to build another project, I'm glad I'm waiting for it. Cypher is a wonderful exploration of a human world place, and with a completely logical chain of events, it is found in a state outside its control. <br /> <br /> I do not want to show too much about this on the plot, because Cypher's delight goes down to us. Today's age is refreshing to see what an SF has for more than one idea. Cypher is that movie. <br /> <br /> DigiCorp has hired Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), one of the busiest people ever to cross the planet. They will be sent to other places in America to record seminars. Their exclamation is very credible. Shaving covers as much as daily as cream and cheese. <br /> <br /> While Morgan waits for a seminar, he has gone with Rita Foster (Lucy Liu sharp), the definition of an ice cream girl. She gives it a brush, but she does not want to find something. This is not surprising, given his local wedding. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < And I do not say more about the plot. For this, the rest would reduce the impact that the rest of the films would have, as well as the path to follow. Indeed, as with Cube, Natali shows great talent to appear to be commonplace. People, getting out of knowledge, and basically what will happen to the unknown. And Cypher follows a similar pattern. But it's not a copy of Cube. It has its own inspiration. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a movie that is commonplace amongst theatrical and paranoid stories. A great thing about Cypher is how the story of these matters goes into the story. When Morgan realizes that his false identity is a part of a much larger puzzle, he is merciless as great as him. <br /> <br /> Cypher's cube is a bit more subtle. Cube's minimalist environment and budget quarrel with silent confidentiality, Cypher has a low budget, but Natali saves it as much as possible, spreading the horizon and launching Morgan into a stunning trip. through the labyrinth of his personality. Natali's direction is sensational, with a right hand. There are some stunning camera angles, such as the enormous office block of the DigiCorp building, such as Morgan's fading star away from Morgan. It seems that all the color is taken from a photograph, the perfect tone of the film goes on as a contemporary black-and-white film. <br /> <br /> The effect is evenly excellent. Jeremy Northam is the original image of her unmarried marriage to question her identity. Its performance is excellent because it is modulated. It seems literally transforming before our eyes. A trusted man who will do anything for anyone who will make nothing new to the whirlwind without a clinical wimp. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett makes a good look at this impact on Cube. Black in Men lives in a secretive borrowed lifestyle. His scene is best because suspense and paranoia are a carefully calculated exercise. He is an expert expert in the identification of double agents, and is an excellent handwriting, played by Hewlett. We have to do everything to look at Morgan and enter her complex complex game. <br /> <br /> <br /> But Lucy Liu is the scene robber here. Often, it is thrown into films that are not used for its full potential. But he gives him a character that suits Cypher's hand. Rita Lio is a variant and caring woman of delight. It seemed to me because he controlled everything he had always shown, and he could stop silence only by the power of his frozen gaze. <br /> <br /> The thing is very nice, this is not an ambiguous note about the way Cuba has done, but Morgan deserves a wonderful end. When I got dressed like that, I cheered on the last scene. The last moment is excellent because there is a ray of sun after a dark 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> All figures are successful. Reception, moving, always entertaining, Total Recall was everything he wanted but not. Matrix is ​​a refreshing and refreshing antidote with no refreshment. <br /> <br /> Natali's fine tracking. And now I'm a fan of man. Wonderful thing!
