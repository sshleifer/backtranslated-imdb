seriously I love this movie ... I started to read the book and I loved ... everything was ready and everything was in the end ... I think that this film was so good that Louis Sachar wrote his screenplay. . and, of course, directed by Andrew Davis ... Shia Lebouf gives a great performance for his first movie ... the story is very cool and interesting ... humor, heart and intensity ... it's similar to the book. ... this film is not boring ... I love you ... and I encourage everyone to read the book ... it's very well-crammed and carefully crafted all over the movie ... two ... small frames for me in every way
