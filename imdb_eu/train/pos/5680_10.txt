The holy dirt is so stylish! Why not write such an American comedy? Anyone who has to think about comedy, in the six episodes of this series, is nonsense and intelligence in the novel shelves! Hugh Laurie is full. I could not believe that the house was so calm. In these series there are so many lines and gags, you can watch each show several times and collect new things every time. Rowan Atkinson is horny and has put Edmund on the table. This is my favorite of all Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is never as wonderful as the heart of the series, "Bald Masses" Baldrick. Some of my favorite lines: "When someone puts it with Wellington at his feet," Baldrick explained his name and cousin, Macadder, explaining in Scotland "top kipper vendor."
