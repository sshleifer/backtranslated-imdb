I thought before that that the movie was the most important Muppet movie. I would go back to that statement. In my opinion, nowadays MUppet film is more serious than the TV movie IS IT IS MUPPET OF CHRISTMAS WEEK, YOU WOULD LIKE YOUR LIGHT'S SUSPENDER was really awesome. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but MERRY MUPPET's are just as nice as Christmas. <br /> <br /> The best songs are 'You Can not Answer The Song' song, by Muppet Babies and the final song of the final. Since I loved the Muppet Babies TV show, I love the sequence of Muppet Babies (it tells me it inspired the Muppet Babies show) <br /> <br /> MANHATTAN MELODIES was a real show. Sesame street hangers also appear for weddings. As Kermit says in his final line, "What would be the best way to end something?" But I would like at the beginning and the end what was a bit more entertaining. With Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines there are pretty cameos, and the brilliant sequence of Rizzo and Rats's dance (Jim Henson's own choreography created by himself) and the movie is definitely entertaining. I have to say that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are three MUppet films defined.
