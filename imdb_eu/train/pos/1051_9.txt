Cameroon is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse. Lawmakers "women" and lawmakers in 2004 accused the husbands of their husbands being treated with ill treatment and a woman who wished for divorce by desiring a Muslim counsel. It's long - about two hours away - but they are fascinated by lawyers who succumb to neighbors and accused and judge judges. I will let you know when that change has occurred when it's left. How and when do women come to occupy authority positions in Cameroon? In some cases that appear in this film, women have a significant influence on the part of the spouses? Did the judge give a divorce to a Muslim against the specific will of his husband? I do not suggest that filmmakers can answer these questions. Two years ago they made a movie, not yesterday. And they deserve a huge public movie.
