"Perhaps we can organize a meeting." "Where are you now?" "I'm sitting in my office." "I have no doubt." "Why would we question?" "You were in your office right now. I should have this conversation face to face." <br /> <br /> <br /> Bourne is still a tough and elusive street. His only inhumane resistance is that the movie is far removed from fantasy. The interview is a macho, only Bond humorous divide. It's about action. <br /> <br /> The feeling that is happening in the world we live in is the trilogy that is very good. Waterloo, the scene set by the Guardian journalist, has an excellent effect. There is no gathering of the world: you are either in it or your body is useless. <br /> <br /> If the camera vibration does not overwhelm, I hope you enjoy the movie and maintain some franchise.
