I noticed what was happening to this movie, I checked it in the video store and I enjoyed it when I saw it. Short film by Bernard Rose's multi-genre director (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Great stories and characters. As a fan of Glenn Healdy, I was surprised by his British accent. There was only one exception to this film. However, it is worth the rental.
