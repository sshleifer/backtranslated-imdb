The perfect film is strange. Even though my favorite movies must be flawed. Sometimes the temporary window is small, Chris Elliot's Groundhog Day character does not work, music scores are the best of our lives in the year. It's too slow, but this movie is straight from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> The script is superb, the performance is superb (even though Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, they are full of the whole movie), they are inspired by management and photography and without touching music scores. Intrusive (Miramax scores are very manipulative). The sad moments are really moving, smile at all times. I'm really one of the best films I've ever watched, and I'd like to have more films like that. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that Reese Witherspoon continues to be behind this movie, but I'm sorry that the latest movies are running away and they're fools more than a real movie about real people. real feelings and real problems. Brilliant! What to see
