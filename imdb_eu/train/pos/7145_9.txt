This movie has a large number of adult actors and is directed alongside young young actors with feature films. Management and editing were very good. I would like to look at the book that was right for you. It was very good. (I liked it.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson were there to watch! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis did not see enough, but they were fun on the screen. Children in the camp could not be better. (Like I said, I liked it!)
