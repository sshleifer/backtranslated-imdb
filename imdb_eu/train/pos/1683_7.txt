I watched this movie with the previous "Blood Rites" recorder of the forbidden video games as well as the second feature. Because Blood Rites was so huge, I do not expect much from that movie. But, in fact, Andy Milligan's landfill director seems to be basically based on blood rhythm with Seeds of Sin, and the height of the seventies is a bad sexual illness. Earth is similar to Blood Rites, as we focus on a family dysfunctional unit, and of course; heritage is in play. The film is filmed in black and white and reminds me of the look and feel of 'The Curious Dr. Humpp' classic. It is evident in any way, and as the director seems to pay more attention to sex, he deals with incest and hate. The play is usually trashy, but most of the women appear naked at some point, and despite the bad reputation, the director of Andy Milligan really seems to have an eye on that thing, if the many sequences in this movie really do. beautiful. The plot is fine paper, and most of the films are stuffy; But they are catchy music, and the director makes a surprisingly good performance with the sex scene, most of them erotic. In general, this is not an excellent movie; But it's likely to get worshiped and the "Blood Rites" gets a much better quality and better quality recommendation.
