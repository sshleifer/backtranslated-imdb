<br /> <br /> I have to admit that I expected that something that I had seen for the first time "Night" was very different, although Australian unexpected strange horror would rejoice. I am a genuine fan of horror that I came here and called 'Cut' was the best genre ever produced in Australia, but later it is one of the best comedies / comedies that are later on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I'm sure it was a mood ... because it was a humor. <br /> <br /> And, of course, there was an indication. <br /> <br /> The 'customized use' was a bright shear of the garden - apart from the grass that is waiting. In short, it was a lot of different types of creativity in violent deaths, to make the skeptical of the movie just enough. <br /> <br /> The appearance of two Kylie Minogue (her short appearance) was just another reason to see Molly Ringwald. They were both fantastic performances, as well as the excellent role played by Simon Bossell ("The Castle") as a technician. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think that this movie is one of the best couples or of the latest horror products of the past, as well as a beautiful satire / parody - toungue-in-cheek to the finish line. <br /> <br /> She loves it.
