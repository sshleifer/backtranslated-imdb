A pretty romantic comedy, and I do not think he has ever seen Meg. All the players made a good job to keep this alive. Of course, in the real world there is no genius mathematician looking at a monkey without fat, but that's why I love romantic comedies ... to forget about reality and have fun. Nice movie Damn, Meg is a baby, right?
