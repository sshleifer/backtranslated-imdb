Thomas Ince has always fought with frightening and ambitious nature to frighten stories. This is the "Italian" movie. It's simple, especially George Beban, George Beban, Jr. the silent young actress, and a wonderful set of real sensations of the first immigrants in New York. These 1915 film gives the unusualness of this vintage, the features of this vintage. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the current day and reads a story about a man from an Italian immigrant (George Beban in modern clothing) and then we enjoy the transient story with George who immigrates. He raises enough money to bring Italy to America, he marries and has his son. But time is hard and the family survives. I wondered why the mother did not breastfeed her children and avoid complications with dirty formula, but well, as well as the Dream Factory also promoted the correct behavior of women in 1915! <br /> <br /> The best scene of the image when Beban finds himself able to find revenge on a leader who leads the crime, decides at the last minute to decide against his planned action. Very clean I loved the curtain effect, it was great. The brilliant use of lighting in this film. <br /> <br /> I give 10 to 10 from "Italians".
