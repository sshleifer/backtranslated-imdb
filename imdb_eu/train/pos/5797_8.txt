And I'm not saying badly. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie when I was 6 or 7 in cinema. For me and my cousins ​​I was magical, beautiful and horrible at the same time. . When we got out of the theater, Michael was our best friend, although he did not know about it. <br /> <br /> Over the years, I watched this movie several times but I always changed the channel. Seeing a couple of seconds, though, it would bring a feeling of magic and warm up the heart. That's how I liked it. <br /> <br /> So I only watched this movie once and I think the good decision is not to see it again. When I see it today, I know I can not help criticizing MJ's acting, plot (if any) and this and that. For me, it's a memory of childhood, so the feelings of the baby have been going on for 20 years. <br /> <br /> My adult participates in my assessment and I give memories and wonderful 8. music Fear of 20 years ago, it was feared for this baby, which is undoubtedly 10.
