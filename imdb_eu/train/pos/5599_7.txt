I saw this film a second time (with a French version, dubbed in Italian) and I feel better in the following points. <br /> <br /> If it's powerful, slowly build it with a terrific character and see the Paris settings dramatically. In the long run, it would not be Polanski's highest and I would put it into the 9th position of his filmography, but still a confusing mixture is confusing and, above all, a great comedy. There is also a good cast, all of them are good, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. <br /> <br /> However, I do not know the sudden forces of Trelkovsky. change the previous tenant '; Apart from the owner of the previous apartment cafe, where Simone was also offered what he wanted to offer him, he has little to say (however, as far as I am) that's all. he wanted! Well, so Simon found things lying in the apartment, but what dressed up dresses did and how did he start himself (even if he started doing it without realizing it)? Following his vision of the nightmare for the bathroom, the final episode of the film (where all Adjani disappears) is almost unfavorable; above all, the landlord and other tenants will be watching over their nightmare on Opera night. Jean Cocteau used a concept that was used 46 years ago THE PUT DE LA POETAN (1930)! <br /> <br /> As a result, it is at the same time facing and unresolved; Is this apartment out of the window ?! I also remember that I was also at risk of seeing this factor, and I feel it is not clear now! Please note, the first two-thirds of the movie are pretty strong, but I'd like to see Polansk in the darker plot points a little less.
