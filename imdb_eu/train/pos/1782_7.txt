I watched this movie three times. The last time I jumped around the confusing scene to find a decision on the plot. Perhaps the plot does not want to hang logically together. Or maybe these bad places are in the plot, because the memory of remote events is quite faulty. <br /> <br /> Take the young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who has taken part in an unnamed university college of a wealthy family. She had to pay very expensive education, but she did not seem to have any connection. It seems he never had relatives that could have the consequences of the strong decisions of his relatives. <br /> <br /> Ann shares a passion for an afternoon with Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson) with great love. Then, when Lila purchases Harris's brother Buddy's tragic death, Ann has sudden guilt and is bored by his conduct. Here I needed to lose something significant. Annen's behavior is completely understandable. Announces the relationship with Annek Harris and, in the end, she is married to one of the spouses of a Lilac wedding. Although Ann Harris condemned, he still has deep feelings of his death. <br /> <br /> In his conduct, it was clear that Harris thoroughly knocked Ann and would gladly marry him. A scene scattered around Lila's weddings showed Harris still had feelings with Ann. <br /> <br /> The film showed Ann's romantic relationship model. The man always fell and dismissed them. This model was celebrated with Harris and two husbands. On the contrary, she married a man who did not love Lila and continued with her husband until he died. Lila might have built a relationship because she refused to marry. <br /> <br /> Then, Lila Ross's more comfortable appearance came on the night of Annen. Apparently, Ann's nurse Ann was able to get some information on the latest news in order to identify and contact Lila. This communication has not appeared in the film. <br /> <br /> In the last days, I asked the house that Ann lived. How did you pay for the singing career of that house? Ann always seemed like a step down financial ruin before raising her daughters. <br /> <br /> At another level, the film's setting and music really enjoyed me. The Palace of the Sea passed so beautifully. Claire Danes was bright as the young Ann Grant. She's really a talented singer. I'd much rather like a blonde with her natural brunette in the stretcher on the film. If these pesky CGI fireflies only disappear, I would give the whole story in my vote!
