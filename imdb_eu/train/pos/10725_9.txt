Space Camp is a pretty decent movie. Land is predictable, but actors make a good job, and special effects are from those times. <br /> <br /> This movie released about the time of shuttle disaster, which really prevents it. was well-known to the people. <br /> <br /> The transport spaces open in space are spectacular on the big screen ... that is, on a television ... the average. In the theater I remember this scene. You feel that you really felt you were there. <br /> <br /> This would be a good movie to watch in IMAX, but I'm sure it will never happen.
