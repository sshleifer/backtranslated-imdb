I watch this movie repeatedly. I have to see it at least once a week. I'm from Africa and I do not even know about Africa about this movie. I taught him some things. Denzel's films are full lessons for the life walks. I would like to be my brother. I have also seen and I love your Masala Mississipi. What an exciting state. When Denzel struggled with his brother, my teen reminds me that my brother was always upset that he was busy all the time. My brother always looked after my old father and he wanted to see me in the same way. By the way, where did Denzel get that African accent in Cry Freedom? I watched the first movie in Africa and I do not know when Denzel was an American until I went here.
