This story based on two pieces by Edgar Allen Poe ("Usher House of Fall", based on "Death of Death") is quite astounding at the beginning and end. It is similar to some old black movies on people who are old in an old house (for example, "Cat and Canarian", "The Dark Dark House", "Night of Terror", etc.). Boris Karloff invented life-sized dolls that frightened guests. Has the film died at the beginning (or is not it?) And the domestic population is experiencing enormous experiences. Here I am not going to include too much detail, but it is definitely essential for fans of mysterious dark houses. <br /> <br /> Look at popcorn and soda in a dark room. <Br> <br /> Dan Basinger 8/10
