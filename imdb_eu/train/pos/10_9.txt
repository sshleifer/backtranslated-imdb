I am a man, I have not been given to women's films, but this is a really special story. Jan Fonda is a personal love I do not like as a person, but it's a hell of a beautiful job, DeNiro is his usual excellence. Everything is well done: acting, correction, images, settings, photography, casting. You can enjoy the true love and true love story - this is the winner.
