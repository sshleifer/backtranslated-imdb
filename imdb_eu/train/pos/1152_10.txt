Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg's market for the revival of Sally's light spirits are just enough reasons to enjoy this movie, but wait! It's more! For the daytime television, the cinema box has the horrors of downfall and (and up) and love. Robert Downey Jr shows the slightest part of his genius, and Cathy Moriarty is brilliant. The conversation is bright, and the physical humor is full of skill. This is for those who really enjoy the arts directed, directed and written.
