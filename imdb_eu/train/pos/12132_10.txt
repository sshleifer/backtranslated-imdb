Although Leslie Howard's performance is enjoyable. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a cool and interesting character. This man feels that he feels; However, I'm encouraged by Bette Davis' Mildred. Davis gives one of the best performances (he has been nominated for an Academy Award). Thanks to its performance, this movie is sad. ** Not sure how to tell Philip about how he feels Mildred.
