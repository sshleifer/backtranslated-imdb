Will Smith performs a stunning performance and a harder heartbeat than a single rock guitar, and I've raced with the previous collaboration with the director of "Seven Pounds" (The Pursuit of Happiness). . Remember that the name of Gabriele Muccinus is sold by some of his films, because the actor attached to the project is not so profile. <br /> <br /> I'm very wrong when I calculated the intention of Will Smith as soon as I calculated it, I put two and two in the first scene of suicide when the scene comes when Rosario Dawson's heart is incurable. height <br /> <br /> <br /> However, I think that the writer / director has made the right choice to make book books (first and last books) so that the movie is a source of need and tension to gradually How could a man make this last sacrifice, and it was wonderful to see the relationship between Smith and Dawson's character flourished and developed, knowing what was in these always absurd characters in the back of his heart. . <br /> <br /> A friend with whom I watched the movie thought it could have a divine gift of Smith, and I understand why his performance is almost angelical when faced with his seven elective voters. Sometimes it might be hard and terrifying, and when he was alone he got the full weight of his situation, and he completely breaks it. The result is versatile. <br /> <br /> In the end, I can not forget about the crash scene, which is very surprisingly made in cinematography and with music. Put this on your list.
