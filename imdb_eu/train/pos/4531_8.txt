This is the love of all times. The film looks for Keaton to love an old lady in Rome and today (1920). In all three cases, Buster is a classic and he fights against Wallace Beery for his love. From the three times, I think that the one who liked the Roman one was the best, although it could be recognized the most honest. I really liked the play with a lion dressed with lion, and the strange race of snow carts. But I liked all the amazing acrobatics of Keaton. However, the three old seasons were good old fun and the movie, although not his best, is still a sensational and enjoyable film. Check it out!
