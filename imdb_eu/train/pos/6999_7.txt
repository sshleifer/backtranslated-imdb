Seven kilos with Will Smith with Will Thomas, Ben Thomas, as an agent of the IRS collection, has the right to raise taxes after paying taxes. Thomas killed seven people while he was talking during his telephone conversation and the film continues to attempt to make his crime quite unreasonable. <br /> <br /> The story is subtle through a brick. a greenhouse window What you see is what it is happening: the end of the Titanic was even more surprising compared to seven kilos. It's not totally upset, there's no confusion or no doubt about what is happening. <br /> <br /> Normally, I just like Will Smith as the worst boy. The guy is the best when a gun plays a sports car, drives a Ford GT and says "Aw Hell Nah," it's only a pathetic attempt to get an Oscar every time you try to play it seriously. da. This is probably the main reason I did not want to make the movie, although there are very few here. Comedy are clear but subtle. In fact, it has been the clearest play of Will Smith I have ever seen and that's why it was wonderful and it was ironically nominated for an important award. <br /> <br /> All the support work was also very good. Rosario Dawson looked like the door to the death gate, and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were all right, just like everybody else. <br /> <br /> In general, it's crying, but it's not all we can do to cry out on topical and all violin violins. Sometimes my stiff heart was almost broken. One of the situations that are not associated with your own life will not make it harder. That seems real. <br /> <br /> I would give it 8/10. The Will Smith show goes dramatically to The Pursuit of Happiness without despair and that's why it's better.
