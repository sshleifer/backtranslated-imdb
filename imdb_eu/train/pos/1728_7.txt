Wooden Horse was one of the "greatest" stories of the first World War II flight, which tells the story of others who fled Eric Williams and Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. I really like the movie, but also transferred to Amazonas VHS in England and PAL in the US. When I read the book when I was in school, I saw a part of the movie in the early 60's. Peter and John's theater theater. Escaping from Germany during the war is more realistic than the escape of fleeing from the Great Escape. This film is a treasure trove that will be available to American audiences.
