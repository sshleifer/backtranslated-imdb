I'd like to comment on the April Love movie. It's one of my favorite fathers because my father, Nelson Malone, plays a horse trainer. I remember the difference when he came to Hollywood when he came to Lexington (KY), where we lived in the love of April. My father had many plays and was very talented. I tried to test one of the offered bits, and here's the script that came home. How exciting it is! Similarly, the number of my classmates was the scene of the people, especially those that appear in the amusement park. It is very nostalgic that I see a movie once again seen in April, and I see Pat Boone's April Love song being played. We now see films that make time and time recalled with sex, wrong language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more films like April Love ...
