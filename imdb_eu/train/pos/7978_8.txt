This film is the only component that must be the revenge film, and that is the real thrill. Sadness, love, laughter, anger. There are so many emotions in this movie. From the beginning to the end this film is fascinating. It's a rubbish throwing the paper plots into the face of the audience, but it does not go wrong, this movie is powerful. Washington works like always. <br /> <br /> In a word: the man has a depression, the young girl gives life, the children kidnap it, the man wants to revenge. It does not give any particularity, but it is much better than any other movie similar. At the moment TAKEN is a similar movie, but when you compare them, MAN ONRE wins your hands. The characters are fun and they all get a great deal of performance and great leadership. Mexico City is alive, it seems that the Mexican city is like Mexico City. Everything is reflected. I enjoyed the direction of style and brought the best Mexican capital <br /> <br /> This is one of the films that you will post once a year and see a movie you can ask and see friends. From the beginning to the end, you are promoting the main character, becoming a Russian roller coaster. There is enough action to please you, there is not enough character development to please you, and then Washington is brought to a smile on your face. Watch this movie, you're not disappointed
