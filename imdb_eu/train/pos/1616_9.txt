Coming romantic and funny comedy with the underscore, bringing together beautifully-merged networks and bouncing lines together with each other with a specific comic, a beautiful show. Cher's unrivaled spirit asks him to make peace with his younger brother and peace with mood. Operational symbol, confessions of Catholic churches, love bites and snow falling ... "Moonstruck" is timeless and smooth. The photo is about 15 minutes to go (grandfather and his dog are rough with a small cemetery, and the scene appears to be the gateway to Cosmo and elderly men), but the plot is associated with the living abilities of the patch, and the film's stunning and kooky spirit are infectious. *** 1/2 ****
