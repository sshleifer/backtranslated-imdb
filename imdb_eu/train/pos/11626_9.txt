In Wes Craven's (Nightmare Elm Street), it's an excellent nightmare, about 85 minutes away from the supernatural, and gives us something more terrible, human evil. Jackson Rippner's much-awaited crime is much more than Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) is a great job to present an unbelievable, pleasant and charismatic murderer. Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire, The Wedding Crashers) are great performances. The majority of films are performed at a very intimate level, with two eyes, faces. It is an action on a small scale, not a broad gauge of the canvas, and it is not so credible for these limitations. Cinematography is not unique, although, of course, it can only be done with a camera with limitations on passenger flight, but it's a great conversation, a story that is tough. There is no distraction, it is not a subversion of the conflict between the main characters. Keeping his focus and distractions, Wes Craven turns into a threshing thriller that takes a very simple plot and makes an exciting move.
