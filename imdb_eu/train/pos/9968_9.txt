My mother took me to a movie as a child and I wanted to see it every year when I made all my favorite Christmas. I remember most the devil and Santa was apparently moving through his telescope. I waited and I looked at the T.V-year-old guide, and then I would see it every year. Normally I would play Saturday afternoon. I only found the movie in English and I wanted to find something special about this film and found a copy of Spanish. I loved the movie heartily and I never thought of the nightmares of others. Yes, it's a movie about Santa Claus, which is unique and unique. I can not get a copy of this movie and watch it with my children, if you share my favorite parts and memories!
