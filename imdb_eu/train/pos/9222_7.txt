There have been many films set up in Kolonial after Africa. This altruistic echo of the 1970's slavery shows the best and worst African values, unlike the values ​​of humanity's integrity. He also had shortcomings in the face of African and western Arab ideas. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anansa Linderby has been catching David Linderby's beautiful wife of English-language English physicists. Arab slaves, with a teenager Sanofu and a young boy. Suleiman's chief slave trader is Arab, with his rhetorical flowers and sometimes humorous and sudden gestures. He should not "Continue to follow this Camel" but they are not this standard. It's worth the movie. Peter Ustinov, of course, had enough abilities to face the deficiencies of the script, and otherwise he saved the wrong nature of one dimension. <br /> <br /> Following the stereotypical theme, all three of the Suleiman Arab workers have no right and a tendon towards the boys with a pedophile, since they are not happy to portray on the screen. <br /> <br /> One of the first calls made by David is an African local police officer. bureaucrat David, then, will discover two stereotyped white ex-pats, an Englishman (Walker, played by Rex Harrison) and an American (played by Sandell, William Holden). Sandell is a mercenary with the "usual" views of mixed races and refuses to give up early if David does not pay in advance. David earned himself in love with Anana and, knowing that he was in love with the discovery of love, David decided to take him on his helicopter to look for Anansa. Suleiman and its captive border and can not reach the surrounding territory - Sandell's doubts and David's lack of firearms, helicopter kicks off, but David is alive. <br /> <br /> Then we will present David Malik (Kabir Bedi), the African family who lost his family from Suleiman and only guards them. Sanufu girl finds a Tuareg group and they know they are on the right track to find Suleiman. <br /> <br /> In a scene of heartbreak, a slave trader is killed by Suleiman, who was not found to be alone, and they did not have the opportunity to be sent to prisoners who had previously been acquainted. <br /> <br /> Later on, we found out that the boys who had been raped were a doctor of witchcraft and, on the other, a great scene with supernatural scenes, he uses his knowledge to kill one of Suleiman's achemen. Ananosa, despite the skepticism of the boy, is able to get rid of the other two Suleiman workers. <br /> <br /> At that moment, Suleiman and his slaves arrived in slavery a few days ago. /> <br /> Suleiman definitely means that Anana is "a" problem, that is to say that she is trying to sell a hard-earned but intelligent Omar Sharif prince. When Anansa thinks he is an American who works in the United States, the prince definitely decides to continue negotiating regardless of the consequences. The scene of two men shooting is one of the best films. <br /> <br /> In the slave market, a young boy is sold to a pedophile German middleweight and guess what the boy is still "wunderbar" when his owner receives the skills of his witchcraft doctor. <br /> <br /> In the end, David and Malik face Suleiman, and Malik looks like a sweet ending. . <br /> <br /> In the end, David and Anansa meet again, and Malik, whose life is corrupt, can console her after seeing the tasks performed. <br /> <br /> The Film plot is superb, but marks the stereotypical portrait of the leading brands. The credits must be directed towards the main actors to face the most important actors.
