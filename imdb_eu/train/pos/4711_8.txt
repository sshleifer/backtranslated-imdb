Oh, what's fun here! <br /> <br /> Amy Heckerling directs the comedy (Fast Times Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking), but it seems as if the actors say they go and have fun. Micheal Keaton relieves the role of Johnny, easily screened with the best performance. Joe Piscopo is an excellent Danny Vermin, who has not received anything from the shameless directors. And I play Richard Dimitri Moronie and the character's own vocabulary. I do not think that an accident is written by MARON that the greatest part of the character is. <br /> <br /> Sprinkled with good lines throughout the movie, Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne.Mauren Stapleton, Merilu Henner gave good lines. Even actors with little roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale have got good lines. <br /> <br /> Recommend to a friend.
