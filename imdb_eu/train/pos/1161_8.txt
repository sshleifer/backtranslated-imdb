It was a small budget (some scenes were recorded with a home video recorder). However, it has a good plot line and it is easy to follow. After eight years of sexual abuse, after eight years, Amanda has been released from the psychiatric department, which is hidden behind her doctor. The doctor finishes renting a house and purchasing a car. But in the first 20 minutes of the movie, Amanda died and will fall into her backyard. Then, her neighbor, Richard looks at her and does nothing to do anything. He is innocent, but after another, Buzz tells Amanda that he is to kill him and his wife Richards has tried to kill Laurie (that is, Amanda and they cool him). Then Innocent leaves it aside and tries to kill Buzz and later Richard tries to kill and guard. And you should rent a movie to see if Amanda dies or not. A good general movie, my life reminds me that the whole acquaintance of the neighbor falls and nothing remains until he is a part of him.
