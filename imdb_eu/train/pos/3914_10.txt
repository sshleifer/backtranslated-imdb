Personally, I think it's a very professional movie, I love choreography and theater. The plot is also hard and mysterious. The movie itself is very emotional and I like to make the most of my thoughts. Antonio Gades has had a very important role, and I must say that it is one of my favorite images and that Saura is a great director.
