Currently, I'm making movies at the AS level and we've seen a movie "this is not a song of love" and I think it's a very simple story, but the back story is complicated. If you draw on the surface, you will find a two-man movie thriller that walks along the countryside, after murdering: - "sounds come out." <br /> <br /> However, you need to go deeper to find the true sensation of the genre. As you can see, it is a love story between two homosexual lovers, full of confidence, deceit, and betrayal. We do not directly tell about this "love" through the movie, but the fact that Heaton Spike makes this facial love almost cries. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is a good example because British films do not have to be rejected as "rubbish" because they are made with a low budget. <br /> <br /> A good movie of a complicated and good story. and probably not suitable for Hollywood blockbuster enthusiasts.
