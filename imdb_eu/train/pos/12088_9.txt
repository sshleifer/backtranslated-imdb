Hardcastle and McCormick are a great TV series. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is expected that the Duke of Hazzard, Hunter, A-Team, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> This show is a clean television. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormicken is quite fun. Often they take jabs together in more than one episode, which adds humor to the show. He carries out a lot of self-escape in almost every section, but who does not enjoy car chase? Especially with Coyote! <br /> <br /> I would like to make a clean TV like this today!
