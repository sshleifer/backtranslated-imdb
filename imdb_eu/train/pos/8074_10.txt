Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is just as bad as anyone else on earth. In 1920 he lived in Ireland, Gypo and his fellow Irishmen are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressed British. A certain rebel who wants to kill England is hiding in the town. Gypo believes he is trustworthy with his friend, but the Â£ 20 prize is tempting. Gypo has killed his friend and has entered into a hole in despair and drunkenness. Meanwhile, other Irish rebels are looking for informants. Immediately, Gypo, when he smokes money from his pocket, is a suspect, but his friends do not want to believe. The story of The Informer is very easy in his argument, but it is complex in moral and emotional problems. It's very easy to be one of John Ford's greatest emotional movies. Gypo was wrong, but, of course, we can understand his reasons. In addition, we understand its sensitive nature, which is why there is a great deal of sympathy. The script is also very suspensible. Without a doubt, we can know how to end it, so we have to cross our teeth together. The play is outstanding. Ford McLaglen, Ford's many films, probably gave his best here (and won an Oscar). All movie interpreters are worthy of it. In addition to stunning screenplay and performances, The Informer is one of the most expressive films by John Ford. I love Ford's darker side. As I remember and in his affairs, the informant reminded me of my favorite Ford movies: The Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); In addition, The Grapes of Wrath (1940) is similar to grape. 10/10.
