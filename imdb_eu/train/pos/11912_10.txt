I enjoyed Albert Pyun's "Nemesis" for his cheesy action and semi-complicated script. Many people complain about the image of the first "confusing" movie, which is why it has a "Nemesis 2: Nebula" rumor, when rocks work with the same super-action. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> This is the name of the first movie hero, Alex, a super-woman sent to the past to the past. An African tribe grows up A large part of the film has no subtitling in the African language, because I liked it because they liked it (how often do they actually try to make movies in this genre?). It is not long time that the evil cyborgs spend time trying to enter and kill time to travel. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to be wrong, that is, it's empty (it's not that. the first one was a bit big). There are suburbs that penetrate African tides, treasuries and tribal battles. The brains are very short, so one of these things is not a very good treatment. The image is basically a fight to escape the muscular baby vs cyborg. It's a recreational value, it just does not expect quality, or anything from the first movie.
