This is just as good as the original 101, if not better. Of course, he steals the show Cruella with his awesome behaviors and outfits, and the movie probably most wanted to watch Cruel. This time we see a lot more. I also like Kevin with Ioan Gruffudd, the worst of all. The idea of ​​using Paris's movie was clear. The film deserves your age, whatever you like animals.
