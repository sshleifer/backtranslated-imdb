Some of the other collaborations (THE BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER) are a horror dandy movie, although the questionnaire is very curious. Boris Karloff is Dr. Janos Rukh, a curious scientist living in the Carpathian mountains, near Dracula's character. Dr. Bela Lugosi is Dr. Benet and has never been discussed in nationality, although he is definitely named French. I really think it would be sensible to have two modifying roles, because Karpato's role was adapted to Lugosto, especially with the accent. However, despite this unusual turnaround, two still did an excellent job. Karloff was definitely the protagonist, but Lugosi was completely normal as an acquitted person - he often did not play in movies. It seems that Dr. Rukh is a bit uneasy, other scientists (especially Benet) believe their theories are weird and absurd. However, throughout the film, Rukh is correct and Benet is especially generous in the new praises of Rukh. But unfortunately, this wonderful item found by Rukh is a bad effect that makes the crazy machine crazy (do not you hate it when it's happening?). Although scientist was a brilliant scientist, it could be a simple pleasure, it was built on the plot, well-developed characters and unmatched Rukh, a killer, but complex and interesting measure. <br /> <br /> This will be enjoyed by anyone who hates horror movies that anyone hates anyone. You can really say that Universal Pictures has taken out all of the stops and has made a budget with a movie that Lugosi and Karloff unfortunately, instead of gravity in recent years. Good things
