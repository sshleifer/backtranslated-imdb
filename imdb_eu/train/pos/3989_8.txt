"Mum", at the age of 60, tells a new enrolled mother of two adult children (Reid) who, as a result of her husband's death, wakes up from a sleeping lifestyle, also has a young carpenter. her daughter's married lover. The film has a quietly passive mother, with a serious relationship with her son and daughter, with the silent need of sleeping a young lover in bed and the ties that arise. An antiseptic drama called "Mother" is a brilliant work by "Mother" in a comfortable way of coping with realism, avoiding free sensations. It may be possible to play with more adult audiences, perhaps, the main nature, need and need. (B +)
