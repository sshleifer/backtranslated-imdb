*** 1/2 outside ***** I am not concerned about duplicate English versions, as mentioned by some reviewers, it must be taken into account, it seems to be living in many of the original heart of Quebec. However, this was a movie I was responsible for as a child; Considering that it is a child's work, I value it on a relative basis. The story of the children of winter breaks is a wonderful snowman that controls snow-capped weapons, such as snowballs and other cakes. If you have children, this is undoubtedly a movie that I would like, I was wowed by the snow-fort and I think, even today children would agree, even with Pixar and all computer animations, maybe I I am up to date and I do not know. In addition, the message of the film is very allegorical, which is positive for children (and even adults).
