Small spoilers <br /> <br /> Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) is a successful top model, with Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) attorney at her apartment. She tried to suck twice before: when she was a teenager for the first time, her father saw her cheating with her mother when she had two women in her house, and then when Michael's wife died. Since then, Christ and the Catholic Church left behind. Alison wants to live alone in her apartment, and with the help of the real state agent Miss Logan (Ava Gardner), Brooklyn Heights is furnished with old furnished apartments for rent. On the floor of the building, he sees a strange man in the window, and Miss Logan notices Father Francis Matthew Halloran (John Carradine), a priest who lives alone with the help of the Catholic Church. Alison moves to her new place, where she receives the visitor: she welcomes her neighbor Charles Chaz (Burgess Meredith) and will present her new neighbors. Then Alison invited him to Jezebel's night cat. The next day, weird things happen in Alison with her apartment and her health. Mrs. Alison is looking for Logan and the priest is told that she lives alone in the building. More research shows that all the people who knew about it were deceased criminals. Surprisingly, Alison once again embraces him, while Michael Strogoff investigates tremendous events. Alison realizes that he lives in the hell's door. <br /> <br /> Although the user is rated in the User Rating, 'Sentinel' is the best movie horror ever. I watched the movie at least six times in the 70's for the first time in film theater. I bought and imported a DVD imported on September 7th, 2002. Yesterday I watched the movie again. After so many years, the movie is still fantastic. The terrible and awesome stories are still awesome today. Cast is a constellation of stars and stars. You can see a lot of actors and actors at the beginning of the career. Fans of horror movies worship the "Sentinel" undoubtedly and I am one of them. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'A Sentinel dos Malditos' (<br /> <br /> Obs: On September 2, 2007, I, I saw the movie again.
