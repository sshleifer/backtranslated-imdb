As well as documented by previous posters, Rockstar's real stars: INXS and, in fact, Rockstar: Supernova are Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. I do not know who they are House Band is an awesome, narrow, rockin expert and talent who made this show more than a sad clone of something American Idol. <br /> <br /> Remember the "chains" night? That music was precision and perfection if I ever saw it. An epic performance called Suzie McNeil's Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody', Tyones 'Stones' You Can not Always Get ... by Ty Taylor, 'JD Fortune' sings "Suspicious Minds." The common denominator here is House Band. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> As it was just as good as INXS, unfortunately they are the shadows of their ancestors, although JD's live performance has breathed a bit of life into their music. This show is about HB. <br /> <br /> Producer release: third season (if we do this we bless) Rockstar: House Band should be. Get the boys a good singer and go to places.
