Well, unlike any other that Lynch runs. There is no supernatural thing, no violence, no deception. However, it's a beautiful movie. It's a bit slow, but perhaps the 6-week week-old man (this is my best time) was a must-have story. Characters are everyday people, so they are credible. The performances are good and the final scene was very touching. Everyone with a sister is related to it. Lyle and Alvin do not even have to say anything. For a moment they have returned from the past and all the struggles have been forgotten.
