Really sad, shows like Six Degree and Brothers & Sisters are real reality TVs, not glory that is more than just a game show. I think the fatal torments have been in recent years with many shows made by worship. But Jericho (that is, what I enjoy) and a bigger reaction to other shows can also begin to reverse the trend. I'm like others, I do not support any other show until I'm given a second season. Then, I will decide to see and catch through DVD and online audits. Until then ABC has been lost as a viewer.
