There seems to be a lot of comments on IMDB about this movie, in this sense, they try to compare them with an older version. Actually, "HOLLOW MAN" is a restoration of "THE MAN INVISIBLE", but the similarities end. "HOLLOW MAN" is an entertaining film. If you see a movie to make some mistakes, you will not see the first movies. True, some movies are terribly terribly and overwhelming, but "HOLLOW MAN" will see what you wanted to do if you were invisible and want to do something if you put your friends in. Kevin Bacon is a strange scientist, along with a group of colleagues, finds the way to make animals invisible. Now, its mission is to make it visible again. If you think that this group of young scientists (if you guess at work in the Pentagon) find animal formula again, Bachelor Kevin volunteer is trying to find the first new experiment in the drug store. After that, of course, things will go wrong, Kevin Bacon is still invisible to the latex mask, so colleagues know where he is. Paranoia and desperation have begun to take on the character of Kevin, and when he learned that his girlfriend and assistant (Elisabeth Shue) had a close relationship with a young scientist, he eventually fell back. Then the movie "ALIEN" and "slitzer" will become a hybrid, but this is not a bad thing. They are afraid and fear and a pleasant rhythm is filmed. The special effects are high-quality (always the quality of all Paul Verhoeven's films), we see sequences of "body reconstruction" never seen before a movie. Perhaps if you want to complain, it is a forecast of the following situations; The curious and extravagant departure from the first movie of Kevin's bacon will eventually end up being a murderer. And the end is a little bit, but anyway, HOLLOW MAN is still worth watching. If you want to know what RISK movie is about, lose your money in "FEAR DOT COM" (with Stephen Dorf) or even worse with THE Henri (or Henri Sasken), with Henri Henrizen. Now it's "empty"! 8 * 10 *!
