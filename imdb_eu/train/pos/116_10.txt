Man oh man ... I was in a stupid procrastination (it's not a good term, it's a long list!) To see this movie and eventually had the chance to do it. And the "news" are the wonderful Maze show! <br /> <br /> Von Trier's "followers": Riget, Crime item, Dogville, Darkness dancer, Five Obstacles, etc. Europe is surely a difference for its visibility. Everything is beautiful and dark, claustrophobic! In this imajinario nightmare you get a feeling that really gets you. Bunuel, by the surrealist film makers of Bergman, the black film of the late 1940s, lead the scenes of the art scene to the film scene of Von Trier's adventurous droplets. The authoritative, irrational way of dealing with very complicated topics affects the nerves of the audience in order to cure some of the most serious injuries we experience in our hypocritical worlds. <br /> <br /> It seems utopian, I think people like Von Trier can help society in many ways in a broader aspect. The days in which the powers of this day are not necessary, as a reflection tool, may be the beginning of a new era: "Our fears of the time of emotional control." This is constantly offered to us through his work. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
