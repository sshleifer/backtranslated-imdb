This is a short and a point. Star Trek: The story used by Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. The play is on the whole map, but it seems that over the years, the main characters have worked to improve their skills. It's hard to think about this series for almost 7 years and it will arrive at the end of May 2007. <br /> <br /> I have not already said what sets and graphics have been said about. If you think everything is a volunteer, it's amazing, it's amazing. <br /> <br /> If this is classified as a professional production, I would give a good story but a harsh set. However, I have to give my fan-based production an excellent score with the exception of other efforts, that is, in its league. To get the volume, I do not think this has been paired. Congratulations on the effort they admire to castles and groups.
