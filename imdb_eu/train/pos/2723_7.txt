IN COLD BLOOD Richard Brooks masterfully adjusts and adapts. However, it is still realistic, sometimes clinical rather than entertaining. Counting the brutal killer of a Western family, the author of Truman Capote is aimed at the minute, bringing himself and the reader to the theme and topic! Brooks is so cool to get something closer to Docudrama. Although it shoots in real locations, it keeps the distance. The killers are probably depicted as dumb fool. They are not perceived as the soul (as in Capote's book), and the savages of their actions are enormously forceful. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent as killer collaborators, such as John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as a journalist (Capote "character?").
