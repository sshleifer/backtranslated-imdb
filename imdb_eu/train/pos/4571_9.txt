The most important thing about this movie was Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor's excellent behavior that Christy Brown, guineas, artist and fighters, despite his physical condition. As a person who has worked with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure themselves that their performance is convincing. Christy helped her family, low-income workers, and Dublin's helpers make it impossible, and this picture illustrates this great help, does not read the book, but the interviews were wisely written by the powerful personality of Christy Brown. I recommend all of this movie, especially to classic movie lovers.
