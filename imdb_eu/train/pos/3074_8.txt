Recently with this little treasure of a movie I had in cinema. I was surprised, although I expected the group that participated in this movie. <br /> <br /> He directed the directed film, Henry Bromwell, and shows it. It always asks you about the secret life of the killer hit. It is not too far away, they are probably their neighbors, or familiar societies, or even friends; We are not different at least on the surface. <br /> <br /> In this story, grandfather, who questions what does not preach a beautiful person. He does not scruple to teach ropes to his son, and even to the grandchild! <br /> <br /> Alex is a man who lives in the break What he has done in the past and, suddenly, he knows the effect of his actions. He needs to see somebody who helps him find someone to help him find peace. Dr. Parks is trying to find acquittal, but he has not found it. On the contrary, Alex supposes something to die, and has a dramatic phrase. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> William, H. H. Macy described it brilliantly, captivates us. He is not only a wonderful actor but a man. One of the best things about the movie is John Ritter. Parks is as compelling as the man who illuminates the mystery. Donald Sutherland, my grandfather is perfect. A natural actress is everything she does. Neve Campbell was surprised by Sarah's key role. It shows incredible capabilities and range. Tracey Ullman is Martha, a woman who suffers and does not do much. Barbara Bain, who looks strangely, is the hell of a mum. David Dorfman is a delight to the movie. He shows his maturity over his age. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
