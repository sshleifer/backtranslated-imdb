When I was a college coffee chair, one of our works was to study group movies and student films. One of the things that came to power in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original premise was that the Broadway off-off was the theater that was being televised through the public monitor, so everyone had a great seat. The premise is: skits would change regularly: Saturday Night Live, keeping things fresh. They decided to make a general distribution movie. <br /> <br /> Developers said that Chevy Chase was the first time in the movie. When he saw that his eyes were naked, the forest was terrified. Like many of my previous reviews, Saturday Night Live WAS was such a thing before it existed. I recommend this video. I told my 13-year-old son of Coconut Clown. Can not wait to get a copy!
