The title is an onomatopoeet, the sound of a rail tram street. It is a metaphorical that people who live in dump can not be. This misery of people shows illustrations of the transitional passage, which is not quite a rich middle class wealth. A very infectious disease with the mother of a small child and her father's mother is very infectious. The first movie of the Kurosaw was colorful, with strikingly beautiful hues, colors that only come to life. The film surpasses surrealism and beauty. The compassion of humanity is a fundamental force, but as always, it is focused on capturing Kurosawa's beauty. It is the masterpiece of a cinema genius.
