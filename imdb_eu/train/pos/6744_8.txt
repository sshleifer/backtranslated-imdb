A headache is accidentally killed by an alleged murder and then covers the crime, but he is guilty of conscience when trying to solve a murder case. Directed by Andrews and Tierney Preminger, the film "Laura", as a collaborative collaboration as before. Andrews is a good man who has captured a responsible police officer in an unhappy situation. The performance is fine, including Malden, the harsh captain of the police and Tully Tierney's father. An excellent and prolific scriptwriter, Hechten, is very sad and Preminger creates a great atmosphere.
