I turned this to see the incredible Ethel Waters, now I'm reading autobiography. I will confess that when my calves fall when pork and watermelon references begin, people can not play this movie as stereotyped or racist. The short film made by Belarus is quite short, as the entertainment industry was very segregated and the stereotypes of the people involved were black in its era, the old tendencies for humor. Modern black films look like they do the same, but with new trends (stereotypes), "ho" and "hood". I think that if you look back at eighty years, I think today's movies would look like racist. Waters and Sammy Davis Jr. should be grateful for the audience about this movie. It's the talents of talented people. Shirley Temple is the one who touches his contemporaries and is a prominent figure in adulthood. All of the people who participated in this film clearly enjoyed making fun. Why not enjoy what it is, what should you think?
