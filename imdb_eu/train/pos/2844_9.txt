I saw New York: I love you today and I love it! I really expected to see him after seeing "Paris je t'aime" and, in general, I liked it much, much better ... Perhaps I must see again 'Paris je t'aime' I do not know ... Some reviews of ILY in NY I read them. Yes, the movie is not without its mistakes. When you pay tribute to a city like New York - it may be surprising, and the city is not fair to do justice ... so I have not written about the shortcomings of the film. I liked it. <br /> <br /> Unlike Paris je t'aime, the short film of each director was well rated and titled, NY: ILY is not, and over here has found a lot of reviewers and overlays. The characters here are annoying and even confusing. I thought otherwise. I liked the stories about how they liked each other and, above all, I liked the overlapping of characters - it is possible because it works in so many movies. But I still like it because I did not find it forced. And the idea that all those connected at the end of the day is also good and even dull, some of them who will find crispiness, but I think it's beautiful. <br /> <br /> I liked all of the movies, but it was the touch I've had most with Yvan Attal Robin Wright Penn and Chris Cooper. It was so well-behaved and the script was finally revealing whether it's obvious or not, in the past, the stranger once again - it tears me and I continued crying in a row. Wright Penn always liked me and I'm a fan of Chris Cooper. A few seconds away from the restaurant standing outside, before getting the call, talks about the ability to communicate with a Cooper character, without saying anything. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters that come together for the first time in this story, or the newly-known characters, except 4-5 stories, except for those who know each other for a long time. For me (and I would be wrong), it seemed to me that the stories were different, but everyone who tried to push back home, had the need to go back and see a new light on people. for a long time in our lives; See people and things around you with the eyes of an unknown and know them and see for the first time. <br /> <br /> Shunji Iwai shared with Orlando Bloom and Christina Ricci with Natalie Portman with Carlos Acosta and Taylor Geare, with Brett Ratner with Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirlby, Shekhar Kapur with Julie Christie, Shia LaBeouf and John Hurt and again Yvan. When Athan Ethan Hawke and Emilie Ohana are in the cafeteria. I really need to see more about Yvan Attal, like I really liked it! <br /> <br /> In general, watch this movie with an open mind. Do not read before watching comments! Perhaps, the love of New York and the love that surrounds them may not live and it is really due to this vision of any movie. Check out this movie, a good music, a beautiful cinematic landscape, a part of life comfort and a story that will enter your heart.
