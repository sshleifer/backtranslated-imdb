I only saw a press screening of this movie and I was very impressed by it. It's not often that they get my favorite actors in a movie. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the pocket scene, and it was good that Rachael Bilson and Hayden returned together. I think the camera camera chemically away from the camera is the correct result of time. My favorite scene is far (surprisingly) Bret Ratner's piece ... without saying anything, I'm going to say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging out ... <br /> <br /> The old couple together were very good and together with each other it seemed to me to have gone by. <br /> <br /> Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke's segments looked like they had realistic purchases and similar experiences in a large apple. Above all movies, it's a great place to take a good date ... especially if you already like the city. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next love cities.
