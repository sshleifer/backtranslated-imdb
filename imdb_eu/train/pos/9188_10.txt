It is very bad that many people do not understand this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> But do not worry! misunderstand :) <br /> <br /> This episode is divided into 2 parts. <br /> <br /> The first part is Tony's "Dream" in his comma. The second part is what happens in real life. <br /> <br /> What does not understand people is that Tony's dream is just a dream. This section deals with the preparation of his death. He loses his personality and eventually forgets himself, thus disconnecting all his world from all connections. I realize that I'm saying in the doctor's scene that he has lost his baggage "for his life". The authors really did an excellent job of thinking about what happens when you die. <br /> <br /> If you understand the whole plot, the next and next episode will be the only thing with a great spiritual meaning. <br /> <br /> <br /> As with all the sopranos, theater and filming is superb. <br /> <br /> I did not understand the only thing that was the role of monks. I'll look for that to get it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this passage really touched me, and I do not think that others can see what happens with almost the death experience. <br /> <br /> 10/10, definitely.
