I saw this on my last day at the festival, and I was happy that I was more than a couple of days ago. Poetic, moving and surprisingly funny, curiously. It's so strange that the director of this style works, to find real astonishment and humor in a re-realist world that seems precious or bending. It seems improvised and still fully controlled. I have doubts about the fact that these filmmakers are actually affected by digestion (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... the most common suspects) and have found their own style, but if you like the modern director of this tradition (Lynne Ramsay, David Gordon Greene), you are doing nice Cinema is wonderful and I hope that more people will see. If this film is played at your city festival, go! go! go!
