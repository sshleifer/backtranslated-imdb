I only saw the first part of this series when it was released at the end of the 90's, and has recently been able to see three parts through Netflix (with proper service). In short, I like this, sometimes, the challenge of the genre, this mini series. The story of a man of a older woman seems to be working and the actors are well. Yes, it has a number of topics of love that goes down in the rain or at the train station, but they have the opportunity to explore the characters, so it does not look tasty, just like the Tom Hanks vehicle or the like. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of Scott Bakula as a child, reminds us of his wonderful work of love, and to see the series of spells and tide of desire and rejection. Personally, I think the series could do it with two sections, but I suppose it is a debate. It seems that there is a sequel, and tomorrow it will be coming to Netflix.
