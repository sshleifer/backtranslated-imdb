My Super Ex-Girlfriend is an entertaining movie, no less. <br /> <br /> The story is very easy. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) knows Jenny (Uma Thurman) in the subway and connects with her. At the beginning of their relationship, everything seems to be fine, but Matt says that G-Girl is. At first, Matt seems really nice, but it turns out that the G-Girl is jealous and poor. So he decides to break it with him and he decides to join his colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). This makes G-Girl very mad and his boyfriend has been beginning to avenge himself. <br /> <br /> The G-Girl that most liked the movie is Matt's scenes. It was also nice to see Anna Faris in a new role in a Scary Movie. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film from 10 to 7 and I like a comedy that likes it.
