I felt this movie. I was fascinated by Russell Crowe's talents in developing Lillie's relationship. Typical Aussie mix, soft, smooth, undisturbed and very durable. They loved cinematography and direction. Pace was fine and the portraits of all the characters were spectacular. <br /> <br /> Oh, did not we ignore the talent of Russell in 1993! ... and I have not seen Gladiator yet.
