The British culture is the key to Monty Python and James Bond, Doctor Who has been a great success for 26 years (1963-1989), which has become one of the longest television series in the world (most of the magazines are lucky for ten seasons). The series restart plans were always featured on the BBC's agenda, and Fox could not capture the magic of the original version after another Fox-produced TV show, within a further nine years (Comic Relief spoof and animated miniature series), the last time Lord Lord needs He had to return before he came back, by the famous writer Russell T. Davies. <br /> <br /> When he enters the character, he decides to find out through the eyes of an unknown brillian. Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), a normal girl living in London, is attacked by a creature created by a living art night. He has saved an elusive stranger, as a doctor (Christopher Eccleston), and then disappears after he disappears: "I am glad to meet you, Rose. Run your life!" While he is becoming more and more curious about "man", he will soon find a new world: he travels around aliens, invasions, time and space, and of course, the omnipresent TARDIS police box. <br /> </ / p> <p> Doctor Who's first 45 minutes are almost perfect (it would use a bit more to smooth the effects) because Davies is a key thing: the humor of the show and the protagonists. The most significant features of the original series were impressive science fiction and a purely British comedy, with strong, if not impossible, hybrid export. Here the laughter is linked to conversations between Rose and Doctor, after a full circle of characters. Well, technically, Eccleston's doctor is the ninth name to use this name, but it moves away from the previous eight incarnations with a northern accent (which is used every day) and justifies it with a fascinating line: "Planet Earth is in the North!" <br /> <br /> The real victory of this episode is the behavior of Piper: in theory, Rose is at the end of teens, so it's almost as old as thousands of young audiences who never heard the doctor. A portrait of an ordinary girl lost in a new and exciting universe, in terms of the return of the new generation television icon, and the immediate chemistry of Ecclestone is a sign that is just as good as Doctor Who. old <br /> <br /> The first, fifth, ninth difference was no different: Eccleston (and Piper, on the other) could be ahead of others but together, William Hartnell, Peter Davison and the rest before. It is a single character in the sorcerer, so green is not a name: it's a doctor.
