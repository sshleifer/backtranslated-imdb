The film has all the limitations of depravity that has a different (albeit rude and rough) humanity - it represents a lyrical and rigorous punctuation comic book of their illnesses, as well as most of their goddesses (as the train strikes the woman). ), a half-pitiable weakness lurks not far (Dewaere sucks sucks like a baby). Blier removes the scene that Depardieu Dewaere wants to rap. For this reason, we are never sure about the explicit explicitly homoerotic relationship that is explicitly used to read, in a way, the outcome of this is the beginning of its relative humanization (so it could not be a movie. It's definitely a pro-gay reader, though it's likely to read everything you want). The film has scenes and undeniable points of sexual policy and is probably considered as a general drawing on the two sexes, which undermines the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty and achieves a possible depth. If you make enough shots, you need to try some of them.
