This film was almost an imaginary movie. Shakespeare, mix of pop, jazz and faerie stories. This movie was about the Cinderella theme. It has a powerful cast directed by Kathleen Turner. This movie had everything. All but production values. I hardly ever believe that a movie requires special effects or big budgets, but with such a high production, the same quality as for television has appeared. In addition to a better film, this film was almost perfect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
