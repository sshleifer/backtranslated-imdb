I went to Chesapeake camp. It was located on the head of the Chesapeake River on the North East River. It was a similar camp site. Coatesville, PA established YMCA. As a young champion, I became a Junior, Senior Advisor and later a Waterfront Director. If the campaign continued, I would like to do something to become an external director. Alas, YMCA's powers decided to close the camp and MD to sell it to the state. A few years later I went out of the boat, and abandoned the MD status and the natural destruction due to the nature of the mother. A 350-hectare area served so much with all the advantages of contacting natural offers. A black man named Curtis Ford and his family were homes and homes. Mr. Curtis was my friend and guardian. I had every being in idol. He did not swim, although he swam. Asking if the fish were choked, he would name the place, and I would be a ball. There was also a family camp in the summer. These memories will be with me forever.
