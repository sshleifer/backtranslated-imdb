It's not a day spent without a new computer animated movie out, so we really have some options to see more than just fine effects. After seeing Ice Age I guess I did not have a big impact on other movies in that genre. <br /> <br /> But now I am a great guy and I am sure that this is a very nice movie for children (maybe 14 years old). The story is very easy and the "actors" are fun in a fun, humorous or complex way. Although "evil" is beautiful, fluffy big cats with funny teeth. And the story has a happy ending, to me, roughly (the main characters are condemned without extinction, sadly knowingly), but a great thing for children. And outside of battles, no one dies (even if a mammal passes more than once), who made a cartoon feeling. <br /> <br /> <br /> Computer animation is very nice, but it's not special. It's a really cute cartoon feeling scene, when you feel like painting a beautiful or comic pages. [That means a lot of work!] <br /> <br /> I smiled at some gag - I agree, the creators tried to satisfy them - but they are difficult and (I think) are better. unnoticed, he does not feel like going into the story. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is nice, but it's not enough for a floppy-floppy kids movie. If you do not hate the pretty animals that make fun things, watch at least once.
