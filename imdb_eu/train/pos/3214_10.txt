I fell in love with this silent action drama. Only Kurt Russell and Kurt Russell could play. To get to know just about war and fight from childhood, Todd (Kurt Russell) flows on a planet, after being genetically engineered by the engineers' soldiers. <br /> <br /> It was a classic icon set up and another action movie. born - SOLDIER. Not Rambo, not Schwarzenegger, not Bruce Willis, not Mel Gibson, or Jason Statham - Kurt Russell plays a role and is very original, courageous and completely human. I remember that sequences have never been made. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
