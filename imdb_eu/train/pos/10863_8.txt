First of all, I must say that I made the mistake of seeing the elections in the sequence of movies. Unfortunately, after seeing Elections 2, the election seems disappointing. Both films are similar to theater plays. And although the Election is a nice piece of cinema ... it's not as good as the race. <br /> <br /> We will introduce ourselves to the President of the First Electoral Assembly; Big D and Lok. After a series of debates among "Uncle", they decide, almost unequivocally, that Lok (Simon Yam) will direct the Triada. It's enough to say: it does not compete very well With Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) struggling with competitors and purchasing, Big D's two uncles are kidnapped to drive the election authority. This has an adverse result and the three positions complete war. Lok decides to become president, but will not become an officer until the "Dragon Head Baton" has been rescinded, the material representation of the President's power. The current president has hidden Whistle (Chung Wang) to witness the spot where he is and he can recover the first one. <br /> <br /> A large part of the film is used to recover baston. . Planned leaders seek twice and avoid elections and counter-parties. They will take them to the most important electoral scene, namely Jet (Nick Cheung), a bad and bad one. He catches his attention to Nick Cheung's presence ... I ask Johhnie To, a second-in-law-in-chief, who has made any impact on him, since he has been delighted by Jet's character for the sequel. <br /> <br /> <br /> While Nick Cheung gives a scene that plays a play, I do not have to give any other actors about the movies. The election has a large set of plays, well-thought-out performances, subtle and impact. Simon Yam is a horrible character and the film also benefits the heavy weight of HK, highlighted by Louis Koo, Tony Leung Ka Fai and Suet Lam. There really is not any weak link and we can easily imagine that real gangsters are watching. <br /> <br /> Although the performances are excellent, Johnnie To eye is one of the most exciting electoral issues. for the camera. It seems that the film has some great shots and it definitely means how to draw your shots, because it is treated with the viewer's camera and innovative and very bright angles. All this allows the election, especially, to look for a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> My problem is mainly due to the carving of the characters involved in the Elections. It's a bit hard to keep up because the movie is full of characters that can not be on the plot. While deciding to focus on two candidates, the first election includes the unproductive, police and infrastructure of the electoral process that match the story. Maybe the movie would work better, if it were a longer time to work on the triad, or Johnnie To director would explain the necessary items and more on them. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - All in all, this is an excellent movie, an excellent cast, excellent and oppressive direction. It's a bit more complicated than necessary.
