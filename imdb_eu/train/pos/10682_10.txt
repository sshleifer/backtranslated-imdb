A few years ago U.K. The Gold channel channel encouraged the repetition of 'Men Behaving Badly' with hype. True is false Man About The House was also a flat-sharing sitcom and ran from 1973 onwards in 76. <br /> <br /> Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke were the founders of the popular comic "Father Dear Father". When it was over, they decided they could do something more in harmony with time. <br /> <br /> In the first section, when Chrissy (Paula Wilcox) and Jo (Sally Thomsett) discover the flat Myddleton Terrace when they find their home in a wild place, they are following a wild party. Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan), Southampton, with no constant cooking cuisine. While drying clothes, he prepares an outfit and prepares food. Their culinary skills are surprised, as they invite you to stay. But it's not a bad business. Robin expects to be gay ... <br /> <br /> BBC-2's "I Love 1973" show, which was shown in 2000, by Julie Burchill, "House He envied him to his life. It was not alone. One of the most iconic British TV shows in the 1970s was Sally Thomsett, who slipped into the London subway, and the sun brought a blind man, and a blind man grabbed twice as he rocked at the bottom. <br /> <br /> A man who lives with two friends, was a terrible subject of the time, but Mrs. Whitehouse did not have to turn the necklace on, he was innocent, sympathetic. Mortimer and Cooke's scripts were as close as possible to the corner without crossing it. <br /> <br /> Richard O'Sullivan still considered "Bingham" when he began when he was "Doctor In Charge" of the TT. In fact, the second session of 'In Charge' coincided with the first of the "House". He was born to play Robin. Paula Wilcox was more than 'Beryl' in 'Chrissy' street, he played a role among his "The Lovers", but Sally Thomsett's 'Jo' was a wonderful dizziness. When he was dressed in time, he became almost a younger brother. <br /> <br /> For many audiences, Brian Murphy and Yootha Joycek Ropers have fought for the show. George lost interest in sex, but Mildred did not. They performed their show, under the title 'George & Mildred'. Doug Fisher had the courage, Larry's friend, Robin's friend. He worked well when he became regular. <br /> <br /> Since the start of the debut, there was an indispensable movie spin-off. I'm not a big hobby of the "Man About The House" because it has been adapted to fit into the big screen. Most of the characters did not appear in the section. <br /> <br /> The format was sold to the Americas, where "Three's Company" was a longtime feature of John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. It was much more suggestive than British origin, but Somers often saw them with sexy outfits. <br /> <br /> After six seasons, 'House' ended with Chrissy marrying Robin's eldest brother Norman (Norman Eshley). The fans were destroyed because Robin did not see the girl he loved, but there was a consolation for her show - "Robin's Nest."
