*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Shepard. <br /> <br /> Along with a well-formed story and all the films, Brosnan has never been better in his film "Bond" outside the film. In 2004, "After the Sun", his most recent role lacks laughs and is a good time. Professional hackers, in other words, is opposed to a job by Julian Noble in a City of Mexico, Danny Wright (Kinnear, probably one of his best roles), contrary to his great business man. Two pair on the screen take away the comic book and laugh and do not laugh. Davis in one of his best roles "American Splendor" gives a charming and exciting performance. The best and most fun movies of the year. My final grade 9/10
