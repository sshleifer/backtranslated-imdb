Chase has created a real phenomenon with Soprano. Non-showcasing, rock-solid writing and a great music make up the best show that ever happened. <br /> <br /> All casts are very strong, but each one of Falco and Gandolfini Emmy has gotten. Anyone who questions this will only take some passages; especially during the first seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely tough, it is absolutely terrifying, and still loves you, he fascinates you. <br /> <br /> Many people I've talked about Sopranos (not yet seen) will say "I'm not a fan of mafia movies / shows." Whatever Run - do not walk - and get it. People themselves love "E.R" normally, but I bet they do not care about hospitals ... It's not in the context.
