This week I saw the movie, when I opened the night. It was very good !! I am a fan of sports movies, and it has been among my favorites. Dennis Quaid was great. (A, of course, Mr. Quaid, if you read this ... my sister lives in Austin, where you live ..... and she immediately drank a drink ... well ... she ... she was a bit ... But he did not want: C) [No one thinks ...]) ERE, it's an excellent movie. All those who like a good sports movie should watch and watch! : C)
