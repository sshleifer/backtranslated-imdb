In this land win column, it was a great cream. The plays were excellent and the script was very good. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt was magnificent as a police officer at Riverside Gina Pulasky. Gina was a complex character. He was a new cop with the Riverside Police Dept. He had a colleague who knew about his wife and children. However, he took on a dangerous task to capture a killer secret. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (resembling Ray Lions) worked a lot with Gina, who had a great deal of relationship with the police and often made a finger. He was static as an officer, but it was the opposite of his feelings and the dealings of his spouses. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber, such as "Wings" from the sitcom, did the pleasant job, as a sociopath quiet, threatening and harmful. On the front, an innocent loser, but under the skin the cold killer died. Weber took on the character of a young child who was not an insolent donkey to kill young boys. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was spectacular. Each scene, each verbal exchange, identifies the characters and more. The production team made a condensing work in the condensation days, taking advantage of events in a 90-minute movie. It was a good example of this very little movie.
