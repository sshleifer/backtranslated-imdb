Some of the comments on this IMDb made Dog Bite Dog's classic 90s 90s, but it's definitely a violent, violent, and very wrong, but Pou-Soi Cheang's film is not enough to be horrible, rude or sensationalist . However, it still has a punch that deserves a clock, especially if it is a bad mistake. <br /> <br /> Edison Chen is Pang, a Cambodian traveling to Hong Kong. to kill a judge's wife; It's Sam Lee Wai, who has decided at all costs to do whatever. After closing Wai with his intention, Pang will not be able to stop him from escaping, until Yue knows about an illegal immigrant who needs life to escape. <br /> <br /> Quietly a cinematic play, stunning sound, stunning scores, and solid performances of Chen and Lee (as well as the new Pei Pei, the love of Pang's love), the hyper-violence of Asian violence with Dog Bite Dog (think). Chan-wook Park's Vengeance trilogy line). Hanging, shooting, compassionate bumps: this movie always happens and Cheang director can not catch them. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is the end of all that is involved in the unfortunate ending story. and probably all of this movie is dying (evil deaths). Unfortunately, there is a beautiful line between tragedy and (involuntarily) comedy, and in the last moments, it is crossed by Dog Bite Dog: in a dreadful dramatic scene, Pang and Wai fight like a pregnant Yue. In the end, after all three injuries are seriously injured, the injured Pangek makes a DIY Crash (now a dead one) delivered by Yue, giving birth to her babies before they die. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be a "classic" slice of Hong Kong, because, with the brilliant and visual OTT, it's still worth a look.
