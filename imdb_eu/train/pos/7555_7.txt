Genre Bender sex for a bit x files. This episode has an interesting premise, a good story, but an end to it. Actor Gender Bender has debuted with actor Nicholas Lea, known as Alex Krycek. In this section, Michael plays a man attacked by "The Kindred". You should see this section to see less than the spectacular start of Nic Lea. An interesting thing about Kindred's "seductive power". When Marty makes his victims, they turn to him. However, when Andrew Scully seduces him, he just did not know how to do it and groggy, and it does not appeal to Andrew. Maybe Marty has more experience than Andrew. This episode reminds me why sometimes it would be unfortunate to be shot in British Columbia. The whole episode is so wet, stomach and mud. Could not be so much fun. Despite the endless ending, Gender Bender is still a wonderful section.
