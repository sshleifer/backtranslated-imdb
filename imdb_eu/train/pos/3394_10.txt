I watched this movie as an accident, when I bought Omega Man on DVD B. Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment: except for the beginning, it was a clear inspiration for 28 Days Later and the rest in TV movies. But Soylent Green is in another league. This bet is one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the film, as I have seen before. Heston talked about "furniture" as he went into bed and did not talk about something else! A drill fleet goes out to crowds! He recognizes a priest and shot the confessor. Ok, maybe, since that's been done - but there are not so consistent many original movies like that. And what about Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this ever the best gay pair, or what? Fortunately, I saw the movie ending, without knowing it was strange. Then I saw it again, and at first I enjoyed all the little footprints worthy of the old scenes. A very nice script and some good sets too. When you thought of everything you thought. . .
