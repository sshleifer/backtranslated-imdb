As the other reviewers have said, Tarzan is one of the best films. Unlike others, I like the start of the movie, it seems to be a detailed description of what should be a commercial post. Also, the exhibition is necessary, so why Harry wants to go back to the jungle. In addition, the beginning of the film is one of the most exciting sequential harassment ever made. Harry's safari team must overcome a tribe of cannibal. The values ​​of previous production of censorship add realism, depicting the dangers that Europeans expect from entering the jungle. Even though the film is similar, it clearly teaches how their owners treated white Africans. Also, Jane sexy, thousands of elephants, great sets and two cheetas! Do not forget about a classic adventure.
