In Iran, women are not included in football matches. Officially, the male's public language and their common behavior must be saved. But, of course, it's sexism. Women are smaller forms of humans. <br /> <br /> Some brave girls oppose and try to get into the stadium using different tricks. The soldiers are captured and kept in cages until the police come and collect them. <br /> <br /> Despite the madness of the situation, it's a humorous movie. Also, it is encouraging that people find ways to fight oppressed. You can touch at the same time, because there are a lot of laughter. Good work by Jafar Panahi. This is a heroic comedy, in many ways.
