Robert Wuhl teaches a New York University Film School at the University of New York at the University of New York. <br /> <br /> It generally covers false histories and falsehoods. I would like to see more about that show. It's really fun. Mr. Wuhl uses some examples and "show and say" to get his points. The tour of Paul Revere's Midnight Ride did not really mean that Paul Revere was not a person. He used the name Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Revere because he heard it better. <br /> <br /> I've seen them with Robert Wuhl year after year, since the stand-up comedy and "Arli $$". HBO He is a good actor and stand-up is a good comedian, but he's a great teacher! I recommend watching a section of this show. It's worth your time.
