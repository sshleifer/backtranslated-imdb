This movie was not so much promoted in Greece, although good actors, a great script and a good photo were not in my country, the blockbuster. The film itself is very powerful when a translator returns to his home town, it's a difficult time that he has taken when he was taken out of prison for five years (medicines). The end is pretty dull ... Mourikis is trying to keep up his task and manage it well ... Lambropoulou is brilliantly and very sexy in a strange way and, of course, Hatzisavvas is close to excellence ... 10 out of 10 there are very few Greek films . make such an impression!
