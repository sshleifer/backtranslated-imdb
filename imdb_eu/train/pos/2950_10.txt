If you did not get a DVD DVD, if you were sad, you probably were looking for 'Delirious'. How many times are you laughing when you watch comedy routines? I was young to see Richard Pryor at his best, and to see Eddie Murphy's 'Delirious' and 'Raw' as fun as not, I never knew where Eddie got a good deal of her inspiration. I'm still older and after Murphy, I've seen a lot of Pryor and comics, I realize two things: Eddie everyone works, while Eddie loves Richard. That's a big difference: Eddie was original, fun, provocative, thoughtful? and more. It was something he never saw. It was all we needed. Is Eddie Murphy boring and old today? But it was once the King, and 'Delirante' was the biggest castle ever built. Truly one of the funniest routines of all time.
