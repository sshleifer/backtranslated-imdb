This is arguably the game I have ever played. There's no kind of shoot-everything-that-moving kind of fps (usually I do not care much), but acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, surrounding sound effects ("Scryeeee, Scryeeee ..") and especially all the stunning atmosphere. I love Scrye, which allows you to watch or hear events in some places in some places. The only game I had to take a break when I spent a few minutes playing the atmosphere's intensity. I'm a fan of horror. Clive Barker's stories and movies in particular, and engaging in such horror stories, wants me to play more hard-pressed and more engaging stories. 9/10 (I'm not a fan of -1 fps and maybe it's been a short game?)
