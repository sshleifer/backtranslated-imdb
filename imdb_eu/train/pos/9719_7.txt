Entering this movie, I heard good things. When I was leaving, I was not really surprised and disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a childhood character like his films. There were a couple of laughter here and there ... nothing fun. Surely, the scene of the movie is dancing with my favorite part of my film. Eventually I'll try to find myself in a club. Some stars here and there: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, X-Files and Jeff Bridges. I found it very funny in a scene that appeared in Thandie Newton's mandate. With Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run, he will be in the previous movie. I see it as a raffle, you'll enjoy it in some measure or you'll get bored a bit. I can add it, Kirsten Dunst is a great winner in this film. : 3
