A meeting between a salesman and a successful man changes his life. This is a curious film that makes this work an incredible effort by the writer Shepard. James Bond is a far-fetched non-glamorous role, Brosnan is a surprisingly effective, lonely man who begins to bind his work under stress, but can not connect emotionally to anyone. Kinnear is a good seller, a smart man with a gap in his life. Davis is fine as the Kinnes wife is sour. A character study, especially because the film's richness feels fresh and unpredictable, the comedy is very dark.
