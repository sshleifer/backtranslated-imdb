EDMUND LOWE (someone reminds me of Warren William) directs a pretty head of an interesting little mystery that moves on a fast pace, and it's only a matter of hours. <br /> <br /> Douglas Walton plays the worst. Who seems to be self-destructing (hypnosis, anyone?), and among the suspects Bruce Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph and Benita Hume and Rosalind. Ivan and HB Warner. As an add-on bonus, Nat Pendleton is a detective and is also responsible for the decorative decoration of interior home-made furnishings. It should be a set that was used in many of the following films. <br /> <br /> In a positive sense, the mystery is not so difficult for everyone to continue the plot with a fair reason for not being abusive. Suddenly it is clear to the detective Philo Vance, and afterwards with the last murderer he gives a five-minute five-minute strange suspense. <br /> <br /> Going well and spending time in a fun way. .
