In this sequel to classic K-9 classic action comedy, police Dooley (James Belushi) and Jerry Lee are fighting to fight their crime, but this time they meet with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner, on average. Doberman has been named by Zues to make it look good. Dooley does not get along with her new partner. All this changes the movie. It's an intense movie, like everyone who wants to kill Dooley in the past. It seems that the dramatic scenes about Dooley's wife's death do not seem like the movie tone, the rest of the movies are sequential action, dog jokes, jokes and bad jokes. in a certain area. I know that humor seems to be very little, but some of them are very entertaining. I did not watch the movie for jokes, for two reasons. The first reason I am a fan of James Belushi and the second is for action sequences. James Belushi is more fun than K-9, and action sequences are also better. K-9 character would be nice to return, but still a fun movie. If you are a fan of James Belushi, you love the movie.
