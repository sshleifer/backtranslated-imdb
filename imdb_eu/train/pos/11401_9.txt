In Paris, he was an American, in many ways, the latest blend of art and Hollywood music. MGM's powers were as a musical power, the film being a memorable musical by Gershwins, which was named equivalent to Beethoven and Mozart's 20th century. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly also had the height of his competences, although he could reasonably argue that this movie was the warmth of Singin 'in the Rain (1952). . Both films have a close connection. Apart from connection to Arthur Freed, "Rain" Broadway Melody segment is an incredible American Ballet sequence of Paris. A dance number may have been the only one mentioned in the initial credits of the film. And it's worth it because Gene Kelly's dancers and choreographers show top level skills. <br /> <br /> The thrill of the movie is excellent. Leslie Caron, who made her debut in the first film, shows the maturity she thought of making films a few years ago. His introduction to the dance sequence and later to the Ballet's work, he offers some amazing stunning moments with MGM Musical, Cyd Charisse's work is Singin 'in the Rain and The Band Wagon. Oscar Levante is the most horny of Kelly's stoic suit, one of the best moments in the film: the final season (for one who has not watched the movie) and one of the most memorable films. which matches the incredible piano skills in the standard (at the moment) with special effects. <br /> <br /> At least memorable Georges Guetary is as romantic as Kelly, although he has achieved some musical points, and Nina Foch as a romantic against Leslie Caron. Kelly's character and Nina's December-December with George Peppard and Patricia Neal reminded me of the "man-only" breakfast with Tiffany's. <br /> <br /> There are some elements of the film. Few satisfy me for Singin 'in the Rain. Ballet, quite lyrical and well-produced, is not very well suited for the rest of the movie. Without land, the bollard just happens, without any real rhyme or reason. And unlike the Broadway Melody sequence, it really has nothing to do with the plot - and in the best music, the songs always have a genre of reasons. <br /> <br /> The worse thing is the end of the film that is immediately after the Ballet. In the end it was not surprising (this is MGM music, after all), a little more ... when I finished the movie I expected it. The director Vincente Minnelli could not follow the ballet as if he had not felt it. The movie literally left me. <br /> <br /> Americas is located next to the best Hollywood musicians in Paris. He's not reaching Singin's height of rain, but he's approaching and Gene Kelly's capabilities continue to be one of the greatest dances of all time.
