At 4 I was a fan of the Hindi movie, but I never saw my movie in motion and impact, especially as an Hindi film. In recent years, I have seen and watched classic movies today (Teesri Kasam, Mereza Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.). But all this was changed. It's one of the best films I have ever seen. I thought I was moving, but it was a very good education for a first-generation Indian woman born in America. It helped me to understand the history of my family, it was always very abstract for me. But "seeing", feeling and understanding helped me with the passion that I had to endure with the struggles of generations and Indians. The film puts a lot of things on me, especially considering current events. I never thought that the way I thought it was before I changed the way ... that was done. The plot is wonderful, it is a great and direct way to work. Two thumbs up!
