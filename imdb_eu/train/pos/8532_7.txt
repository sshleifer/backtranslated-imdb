The Lupine goes to Morocco looking for a mythical treasure. His only idea is an interesting jewel given by an old man. With Lupine it is a pleasant place, a desert and a hot exotic feeling. <br /> <br /> An interesting thing about this movie is Jenyek's task much less than usual, as well as being in a different place than Lupine. . On the one hand, their classical dynamics are lost together, but it is a pace of change. In addition, Lupine can pay attention to women ... <br /> <br /> This is Fujiko's rule. Throughout its feature, Lupin captivates our audience. After that, Lara is the girl of this special story, and it's pretty nice. This has more nuances than any other Lupine animation, that is, it's a fun distinction. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny ninja guy, this is the best evil, and of course, there is a great fight with Goemon. , as well as fun games with Fujiko. The Zenigata inspector, of course, also has a warlike road here in good shape. <br /> <br /> Much, this goes with a Lupine. The plot is average and there are sluggish places, but this movie is completely enjoyable. Enjoy.
