Yesterday I watched the movie for the third time. He recommended me some fried weeks. I never saw or even notice it before it falls into the category "Swedish Movie" and those who uploaded with Hollywood productions (like me) have skepticism about foreign films. What paradigm change in hell! It touches the movie, because it maintains my hope, mankind can change it in a better way. The Swedish people are just a model for all areas of the earth, where people live together - they are religious, misunderstood, daring, predictions, brutal brutality, but also the ability to play, encounters, singing ... from outside, everybody's masks that keeps it) to extract masks and feel human beings just like humans want to live our lives. I can never stop seeing such stories, because it keeps my hope as before. For five minutes in the story of Gabriella's song, I have never been one of my films. Thank you Kay Poll, I was happy for these 5 minutes!
