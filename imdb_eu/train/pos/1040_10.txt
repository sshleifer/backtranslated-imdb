An outstanding 1943 film along with Paul Lukas released Oscar's release of his family as the head of his family as an Nazi threat to the Americas. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis keeps his popularity here and a change was not nominated for the best actor for this film or any movie in 1943. <br /> <br /> When Treason was playing around, Lukas improved the situation. He knows he must return to Europe in a clandestine mission and return. <br /> <br /> Davis goes out again with all the stops, when they shed tears as Katharine Hepburn, sharing. To resign, he knows that his older son must follow the path to freedom. <br /> <br /> A wonderful film, a positive American propaganda against a nasty enemy.
