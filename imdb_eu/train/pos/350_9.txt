I watched the Valentines I saw at the time, Richards and Marley Shelton, because they played in some of my favorite movies. When I saw Valentine, I really surprised the story of the line. Because it has a low value, because it is horrible. Actors and actors surprised and ended the way it was so bright and wicked. Some scenes were unbelievable and humble, and at times it was boring, but in general, it was not pleasant and fun. It was unbelievable to have a story line that had been invented through the whole way and it does not deserve to get all crap. I would recommend watching this movie at any time, especially on Valentine's Day, because it will give you a lot of silence. Oh, and do not even pay attention to the trailer or grade, please NO ...
