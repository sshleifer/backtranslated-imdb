After returning from the West War service, the western complex was a milestone in the JAMES STEWART route, trying to change the reason that the western 50s ended. It's very impressive. Sorry, there was not a photo of Technicolor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> SHELLEY WINTERS is a stunning gallery with renowned prestige and local STEPHEN McNALLY from the Dodge City boy boy. WILL GEER Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA Shelley's dear boy. And you did not know that you know that it's a universal and international film, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (at that time unknown). <br /> <br /> An interesting sequence is the first Indian attack. CHARLES DRAKE reveals himself to be a hint that walks, leaving only Shelley in the horse drawn. Then he freed himself, but the hand of the gun is only one of the twists and turns of the unsavory hand, but eventually ending with the consequent owner. <br /> <br /> STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART have their final shootings almost melodramatic (but not quite well) like DUEL IN THE SUN's fine end of the spider. McNally makes himself a perfect nurse and DAN DURYEA is a bad role played by a small gun in the 40s. <br /> <br /> A very well-constructed story is well-aimed by Anthony Mann and it's very fun to paint the Indian war that plays ROCK HUDSON (Young Bull) and a young soldier TONY CURTIS, which Shelley Winters was then attractive and attractive. <br /> <br /> Well worth the final story.
