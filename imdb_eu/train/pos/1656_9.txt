"Thieves and lies" presents us with a very naturalistic description of corruption that causes many Puerto Ricos and makes them impossible if they are difficult for their loved one's life. The works are excellent, given the fact that they are non-professional actors; an excellent opportunity to increase the reality of the film. Photography stirs the story, as it should be in this type of film. The script captures the idiosyncrasy of the "Boricuas" very deeply. Sometimes you're watching a documentary! You see that movie is a real Puerto Rican society and you think you are secretly watching. I love!
