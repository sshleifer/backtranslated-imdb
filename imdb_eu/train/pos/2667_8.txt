I have never had any horror movies. They tend to scare small audiences, like noisy and creepy children. The original is not usually and excessive. I like the only horror movie Kevin Bacon with Echoes of Stir. He was well-behaved and he had a great story. However, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining has passed, perhaps, the strangest movie ever. <br /> <br /> A movie writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family continue on a hotel after. winter is closed There were rumors in the place where he was there and his last home became mad and he killed his family. But Jack is confident and can use the peace of the writer to overcome it. After months after solitude and silence, Jack becomes twisted and later becomes violent. Is the cabin fever or something crazy at the hotel? <br /> <br /> Kubrick is one of the biggest sensitivities of isolation. The hotel is very quiet, and the rooms are huge, but always empty. Jack's son is still riding a bicycle in the narrow corridors. Jack Nicholson is also one of the best performers, I'm afraid of myself and I'll be safe. My favorite scene is talking to a ghost within a refrigerator. <br /> <br /> I think it's a shine on horror films, snot and illnesses like The Blair. The witch's project. It may be old, but it's definitely good. 8/10
