I watched this movie on the DVD and thought it was a very good theater, but it wanted a lot to the general story. This movie has the same look and look like Panic's needle. It is hard to believe that men can live this type of life; On the basis of society, their full existence is based entirely on the hard drug use, crime, violence, sex and self-esteem or self-reliance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Val Kilmore, the former star of John Holmes, is a prominent role in the redundant star. It's as good as helping cast. However, the film is dark, dark, disturbing and depressing. The murder was wild, but it was also the daily life of these people. Unless he is interested in murder or John Holmes's "fan" is not to watch this movie. If you'd like to watch a documentary about murder, Truman Capote in the 1960's is Cold Cold, Scott Wilson and Robert Blake, the main character.
