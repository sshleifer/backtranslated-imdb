The power of dreaming is a wonderful thing. He says: "They are not all dreamers, but they all get their dream." If we analyze our imagination, we adapt our future. Or build empires. Maybe to overcome our fears, constraints and obstacles. Earn wisdom and benefit in mankind. Or (just put it) to find true love and happiness. Freud can express these things in symbols. Fantasy language <br /> <br /> Tristan comes from an English town called Wall. It splits in the wall. Portal Looking for something that will show love for Victory (Sienna Miller). Victoria is not very serious. So, he is committed to taking a falling star. <br /> <br /> Stormhold is a world outside the wall. The dead star reveals that Yvaine (Claire Danes) has taken shape in a beautiful girl. To make things difficult, three evil witches want Yvain. If they can eat their hearts, they will renew their youngsters. (One of the witches plays Michelle Pfeiffer, who makes wonderful looks and fashion transformations.) The good guy who is on the way is Shakespeare Captain (Robert de Niro). Pirate is a tough outer, but underneath it has a lovely wardrobe. The heirs of Stormhold, on the other hand, struggled to inherit the Kingdom. Ricky Gervais is an add-on add-on. One of the bufts trader in the Gervais type gags standard.
