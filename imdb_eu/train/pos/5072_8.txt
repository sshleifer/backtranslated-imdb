Pierce Brosnan will be the only knowledge of Richard Attenborough's new biopic. The rest is new to international audiences: Canada's History and First Nations Culture. A light study of "Gray Owl" is how to take Ojibway in northern Ontario, learn and preach with the environment. Some decades before it was politically correct. The film has a love story, a moral message and a tortured past. This torture, however, does not always produce a dramatic effect. <br /> <br /> However, the viewer is a non-violent movie. He respects the First Nations of Canada, and presents them in a dignified and stereotyped way. Brosnan's performance is hard, but I suspect that Lord Attenborough's way of thinking. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Canadian proud.
