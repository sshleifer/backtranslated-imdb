With "Brothers & Sisters", "Six Degrees" was one of my favorite autumn drama 2006. <br /> <br /> The big boot, but enjoyed the work of Campbell Scott (the photo camera that came) and Hope Davis (the widow of the latest journalist killed in Iraq). <br /> <br /> Regardless of the performance, the writing was fresh and the performance was excellent. The show was also shot in NYC, a real city, not a Warner Bros. or adding backlot, secondary layer or realism to another studio. <br /> <br /> I think people are interested in "Survivor" and other real-world waste. The bad one did not last.
