After succeeding in the second half, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third appearance. This time, instead of Tudor times or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA named Rowan Atkinson) lives in the French Revolution. With Baldadick (Tony Robinson), a fool but fairy-tale, Blackadder George is the director of the Prince of Wales (Regente Regent). Throughout the third series, Blackadder tries to make it rich and powerful thanks to its wonderful location. She tries to choose a husband for a rotten city, tries to sell a book, tries to get a bet on Scarlet Pimpernel, she wants to be a freeway and eventually she puts it as a prince. This is a very good part of popular comedy. Robbie Coltrane, including Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. He won the BAFTA for the best comedy series and was nominated for Best Design and Best Makeup. Rowan Atkinson was 18 The 50 Greatest British Actors, number 24 The Comedians' comedian comedy, and was British favorite comic 8, Edmund Blackadder was 3. The 100 Greatest TV Characters, number 3. The World's Largest Lightning Comedy, and Blackadder (all four of the series) was the UK's second best British sitcom. Excellent!
