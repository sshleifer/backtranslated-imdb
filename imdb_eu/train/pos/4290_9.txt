I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. I can not understand why some say that it is not. Boring .... ??? Maybe it's boring to say it's boring. It was an excellent actress and the movie was excellent. He has wonderful ideas and good performers. Management was great. I think I'm in the middle of France with all the sophistication and perfume, flowers, churches, problems, etc. When she goes to the Sister's store, it's amazing. Everything is great. For a long time the actress is very good, wonderful. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I like LA SCIENCE DES RÃŠVES in the next film. And Eric Lartiga did a great job. <br /> <br /> Ana
