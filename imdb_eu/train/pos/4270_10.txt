Ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all time. Believe me I have watched a lot of movies and comedies, but you tell me how much you smile at each watching. But it's true that comedy humor is inherent. It is Serbian caratherisic. And all former Republic of Yugoslavia know very well !!! So I think the rest of the audience (for example: in Europe) can not enjoy it so much. Because the subtitles break the hole. But at least they should try !!!! Yes, it's ironic! This is the best movie in Serbian history and the world does not understand! :-) If you can see this, you have not started it right!
