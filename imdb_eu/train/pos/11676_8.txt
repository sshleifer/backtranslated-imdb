If you love Long Way Round, you like this pretty much. Education is fun, interesting and tense. Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates, two mechanics of exhaustion, two great and many Russ. Ewan makes some appearances but only Charley goes out. It's fun, passionate and still stress and hesitation. Great things! <br /> <br /> Collects in Series 7. Like LWR, training is as interesting as the race. Even if they take the race out, they could be a little bit of a car and truck, which they are merely mentioning and rarely seen. It is a motorcycle movie and loves two wheels. <br /> <br /> The series offers some kind of talkative photography and popular oral interviews. Yikes There is another theme song like LWR, but this is not as good as Stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you live in the US, you will know when it will be published, so buy Amazon and see it on your computer as I did. Oh, and be ready to buy another motorcycle.
