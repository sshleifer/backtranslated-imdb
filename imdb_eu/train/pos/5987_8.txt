Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) leaves the school reform and returns to the shack. His sister (Ann Sheridan) makes every effort to leave her, but she seems to continue. Except for those of the termite group teams, the true gangsters still have a schema to crack the insurmountable random random building constructions. Unexpectedly somebody needs someone, and it's not Gabe. In terms of the term, it is a matter of law to work with the law and only give gangster desserts. <br /> <br /> The scene with Dead End Kids is pretty good. The boys pass on the street furniture of the neighbors, and they continue on their own. They talk in false accented conversations and tea is drinking together; Bernard Punsley takes his chair in his chair. The boys begin to fight again with the new boy, but after proving that he is a good fighter, he will be asked to join his club. <br /> <br /> The first scene is also good, full of wickedness. It seems initially dangerous, but it is very clear and innocent. <br /> <br /> Later, Billy Halop learns how to become a boy when the boy becomes a teacher. This is amazingly staged, with a tiny hologram on children's faces and shooting at questions. Angels Wash Their Faces is an excellent title because Angels With Dirty Faces successfully plays. and he really says what the children do. Due to the bad behavior of this group, these guys make a nice movie. But it seems to lie, it makes a great laugh. Many of these guys are a preview of The Bowery Boys series. We also got some bitter words from Leo Gorcey.
