I have to say, but Angels in the Outfield was a beautiful movie. I like how it teaches children to have faith and never give up miracles. Unlike other baseball films, this particular movie was very interesting, with very special effects that were amazing and a well-orchestrated soundtrack was very interesting. Although I liked this movie, it had a bit of a mistake (for example, when Ray Mitchell went to the end, he would not ride on the plate and therefore would not score it, but that's not a question). I must say that I am surprised with the presence and morality of this film: believe it, do not give it up.
