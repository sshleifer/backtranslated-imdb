I really enjoyed this movie about Delany sisters. I know them, but that was all. This movie opened my eyes with courage and courage. What a pair What sacrifice they made to live in their lives. It's just a movie directed to African Americans, but for all Americans. History is a lesson, combined with a single documentary and a fun biographical film. It has been a high level of all the operations and we see the difficulties that have been experienced by both sisters for many years. Both sisters are very different from each other. The family was very loving and very strict with a high level of perfection and perhaps impossible. Sad Sad's father refused to continue misunderstanding his daughter's boyfriend. I highly recommend this movie and I'm glad I caught on TV the other day.
