Yes, it might be useless and it might not seem like a great quote for a lot of comedy, but the movie is really fun if you really see it. Tim Meadows has always had a Night Night Live show on Saturday. Every time I did this show I would laugh. So I decided to check for a night when I saw Comedy Central playing. In short, I was surprised by this movie, because they did not win the Oscars or become an annual comedy, but they were entertained by fans of Saturday Night Live who love Ladies Man. This movie also features very interesting lines that can be recited for years to come.
