I'm not sure what director Viscontic was trying to film the novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" by James Cain (I'm not sure if Viscounti got the rights of the book), but the film is very interesting. It's not the best version of Cain's story (I like the best version of 1981), but Visconte's brilliant director and Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple) should be thankful for fans. Visconti blends neorealism with black sensitivities and has a great impact. The movie is not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the movie is too long for its benefit. The story is very slow (I did not think that Viscontik was very good at editing his films). I think the noir film works better in a short time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are the magnetic actors that are interested in the audience. However, as much as this movie and remakes like me, I did not make the final version of the Cainen book praised.
