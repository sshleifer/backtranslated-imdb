I'm a great fan of Woody Allen and I could not help myself when I saw that movie being played. Allen wanted to see that I would continue with his great movie Match Point, because G.B. is another of his films. (that is, the only work of Allen) seems like a new Scarlett Johanson museum. Scoop is much lighter than MP and humor is the most enjoyable part of Scoop. Land is a story about Johanson's character (journalist student), a hot story beneath the grave. A serial killer (Jackman) is in love and decides whether he deserves a truth or not. Oh, all of this has been done with the aid of a wizard activated by Allen Reaper. <br /> <br /> I had to say I enjoyed the play of Johanson very well, but I could see it a bit harder, in three hours. Filmed with Johanson always in the frame and keep the enchanted. He plays a happy dear, like the character of Allen's stereotypical neuroses. It adds a good body language comic effect. It is worth mentioning that anyone who sees this will be a terrifying character of Johanson, plus one. <br /> <br /> It's Allen Allen ... She still plays the same character as Chaplin and the little character. I'm going to see something that's happening in this movie or I'll see it again at the hypochondrial neurozubi. It is not in the cast of the next photo, and it's a long time to just pass behind the camera ... <br /> <br /> Jackman is also pleased with the suspected monthly murder as a suspect. I can not handle Jackman's role in particular, but he does not fit in with his character. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, I can not feel that it's cool ... Indeed, Jade Scorpion makes a curse. They are much more like detectives than Johanson and Allen. However, I have to call it Allen's endless applause, because it is sharper than the Hollywood version of Hollywood's most popular version. When everything is black and white, things are painted in dark gray. Being totally innocent has nothing to do with it and definitely blame. On the plot, Woody seemed obsolete, but there is still a single line. I found his latest movie mentions interesting ... Come to humor, laugh and be happy. <br /> <br /> Is not it that you see what Allen works you enjoy? If you do not see something else ...
