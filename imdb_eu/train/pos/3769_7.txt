Oh, come on, learn to have a little fun. When I had a baby, oh, this movie Oscar was worthy of me. I thought it was mystical. I saw one of the best films. <br /> <br /> Now, it's a bit stupid, but continue. If you enjoyed "Excellent Adventure", you should definitely enjoy "Bogus Journey". This was the movie "Dude, where's my car?" This is only fun. As I said, it's a good time. Should not be taken seriously and if you liked it, you'd like a "bad trip". It's just a fun movie with memorable characters. Just watch for your delight, leave it and remember that comedy is stupid. That's it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
