Halloween is one of those films that gets deep skin! In my opinion, it is a curious film of all time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever! It was so scary! What makes Halloween so unique is not a special effect, as it is an animated computer, that is, a small budget and got a note, but hell was able to repel people. 25 years and the film continues to be the same effect in '78. <br /> <br /> Michael Myers is about a boy, at the age of 6 he dies with his sister and a few years later he escapes from the mental institution. . Dr. Sam Loomis is following him and he can do something to get it back, Michael describes himself as "the evil one, because the black eyes, the eyes of the devil". Michael plays a role for his other sister, Laurie, to kill another, Jamie Lee Curtis. She needs a kindergarten in Halloween, her friends are partying and, of course, we know the rules, they get that! But Laurie will have a virgin. ; D <br /> <br /> Halloween pays homage to Psychos, Sam Loomis and another character named Jamie Lee Curis, daughter of Janet Leigh. Absolute Halloween is a terrific movie that breaks boundaries and blocks doors, shuts your windows and lights off! "They'll get you! They'll take it!" Halloween, the latest horror movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
