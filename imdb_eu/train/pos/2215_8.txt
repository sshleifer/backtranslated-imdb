I've bought "Festivals of Saints" and it's not a horrible movie, but there are many things that can be better. He has a great historical value, played by very talented actors and actors, and it is not a daily role for actors to play this role and be credible. There were a few pieces of doubt, but I would not say that the whole movie was horrible. If you think about it, capturing New Orleans in 1800, and taking something out, it's pretty hard, and it's much harder to get the actors that can strongly express them. But the only big problem that I had with the movies was the fact that most of the cast-and-roll musicians, most of all Africans with mild-skinned, were very unrealistic; still existing stereotypical style styles. In any case, casting could have a wider choice when it came to the nickname, even though several creatures are conscious of color. However, they were selected by actors who watched the whites. I could write it better and I found that, in general, the performances were incredibly incredible.
