What can I say, I grew up with Hum Saath Saath Hain, watching Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyar Kiya. Soraj has always been different. Films that are part of our lives during periods of evolution Sorai creates something that is difficult. Love and great love for the family together. Vivah is a trip to a couple who arranges marriage and loves marriage. Shahid has done a great job. Anupamji is always excellent. Amrita Rao has made a difference, even if someone else did not adapt to this task. We have seen Ish in Vishk and Ab ke Baras, and in Main ho Na. So, exit from different roles. It's excellent Na and Ish in Vishk's Main Ho, but maybe it's a bit smaller. However, Barjatya's great work. The film rebuilds the values ​​we've forgotten. Sweet movie of the year Great music and lyrics. I am not sure of a new but original story. Sorajen films have always been a great way, so we always expect something different. All drawings are a great job and all of us. Enjoy a beautiful family movie with your parents, siblings, friends and love. I give 10 to 10.
