Torrent was the first and last for Greta Garbo. His first American film, MGM, was the only studio in the United States. On the other hand, someone else was paid over credit, that is, he was the head of Ricardo Cortez. <br /> <br /> Torrent is based on the popular Spanish writer, Entre Naranjos. Garbo and Cortez are partners with different lovers, they can not get together, especially by the mother of Cortez, Marta Mattox's machining. <br /> <br /> Mattox has some ideas that she should marry the wicked woman. Remember that in Spain there were even weddings organized during these times. Mattox considers Gertrude Olmstead as her child, a wealthy man growing up by Mack Swain. Swain sometimes offers some comical reliefs to his tender concerns for pigs, before becoming the old pigs to be murdered. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Before the novel, he had four knights of the Apocalypse and blood and intestines. He shot with Rudolph Valentino. It might be interesting if Valentin had done it with Garbo, but he could do it out of the movies. In any case, one of the Wannabese Ricardo Cortez Valentino will be in the mood. It may be a reason that Valentino does not like the movie, because the aforementioned character is unlike the other two mentioned works by Garbo. . When Cortez encourages Matthew and his adviser banker to make a dirt on what they were told by Tully Marshall, he leaves Spain and goes to France where he becomes an opera opera star. And it leads to a scandalous lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Returning to Spain and trying to recover things, Mattox is even more angry. He has a career in his career for his son. Cortez is currently governed by the Spanish Parliament, which is very curious by the Cortes. <br /> <br /> The title demolishes a flood and a dam in rural disaster. Cortez, in fact, is trying to dump Torrent on a ship trying to find a way to rescue Garbo from Garbo. When they get together, they have a sincere discourse, the brutality of Garbo. <br /> <br /> Now it seems special effects, although they are primitive, they stand out for their time. It seems very similar to 20th Century Fox's The Rains Came shots in 1939, which won the Academy Award for Oscar Effects. Unfortunately Torrent has made a year before the Oscars debut. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to end at last, so you'll have to watch the movie to see whether Cortez and Garbo came together. at last Garbo earned a fairly straightforward operation, and excessive gestures were normal at a time when it was played on the screen. Therefore, it would be the rest of his career, his faces were remarkable. <br /> <br /> Although Greta Garbo continues to be a much better job than Torrent, this film continues its debut. It's very good for the American big screen and today's audience.
