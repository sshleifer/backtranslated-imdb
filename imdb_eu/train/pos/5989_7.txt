The film begins with a child for reformist children and is aimed at a boy called 'Gabe', apparently working to gain conditional freedom. Neither and her sister go to a new neighborhood to get a new start, and soon Gabe comes with Dead End Kids. The children are small punks in this movie, but they are deeply antisocial, deep and inadequate, as they are in nonsense. However, there are some criminals who are making insurance in this neighborhood and Gabe is a wild-proof revelation. In short, he reformed the school and believed that he was not innocent. So when Gabe's "The Big House" is ready to be sent again, it's up to the rest of the gangs to keep up and reveal real crocuses. <br /> <br /> "Dead End Kids" appeared in several Warner Brothers films, at the end of the 1930s, and films were very good (especially ANGELS FOR DIRY FACES). However, after the extinction of the boys' contracts, they went to Monogram Studios and films, honestly, very weak and formulated - Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey almost completely show and Bowery Boys with the "name change". ANGELS WASH THEQUE FACES writing and had excellent production values, AND Hall and Gorcey did not have a camera for a continuous cameras, a fairly good movie that almost reached 7 points (REAL closed), although this is not an excellent cosmetic film, it is sure to I'm going to give it a lot to watch a lot, so I'm going to give it to the 7th! Without a doubt, especially when it was late, when children took their laws into their hands, Reagan accepted the Bill of Rights, but it was very entertaining, The Dead End Kids are doing their best performances Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan offered great help. Surely the part of the film did not make sense and impossible, but it was somehow fun and charming in; So if you can interrupt credibility, it works well.
