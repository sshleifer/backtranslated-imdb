The movie is great! Most of us have seen Jurassic Park where the Chaos theory summarizes what is said about the wings of a butterfly, causing a tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, Bug is all that (or at least something, do not worry, this is not a spoiler), I certainly do not have a type of religion and I do not think it's pre-targets, fate, etc., but you're sure to ask about this movie casually It really exists ... <br /> <br /> Even more, acting and excellent cameras, other evidence is still possible to make a good movie without a million dollars
