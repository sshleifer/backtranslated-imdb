Joseph L. Mankiewicz is not one of today's most famous directors of Hollywood history, but this film proves. He has been successful in sophisticated American drama, such as A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve, and Shakespeare's Julius Caesar's adaptation. Mankiewicz makes Broadway a wonderful job of shooting and style. Marlon Brando is perfect for Sky Masterson, though he could not sing well. It is the only actor that can throw away his activity and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and works well in Nathan Detroit mode. Jean Simmons is very good with Sarah Brown and Brando mixes her scenes with great chemistry. All the supporters participate, especially as Sheldon Leonard Harry the Horse is very funny. However, Mankiewicz would consider a beautiful musician on his screen, which is why he has a lot of scenes, but he still has a story in his world. In the end, Guys and Dolls is a great music and it usually does not work on many levels.
