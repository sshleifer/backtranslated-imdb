If you delete the first thirty minutes of this film, you will be left with a fantastic comedy. As of right now, I think it's still a good movie, I do not know what's in it, I opened the scene. To be honest, this film has a dull beginning, because it is not a fun or even optimal distance. When things get sillier, you have a comedy that goes well after more than three decades. Without a doubt, we are worthy of Lemmon and Matthau's younger passion, if you want to see the work done earlier.
