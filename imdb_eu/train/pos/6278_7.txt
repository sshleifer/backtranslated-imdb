I saw this in the flight to the United States, and it was first skeptical at the outset, that a few people said they did not even mention so many of these characters. However, I did not find it. The movie is fast, but for the character of the director and the star. The coins are great and can be expected, but it is not true in most of the films. The evil wizard is weak, Christopher Eccelston is not as compelling as it is, but that's still a good movie.
