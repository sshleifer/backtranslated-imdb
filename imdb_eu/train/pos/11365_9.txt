Okay, this movie is not the exact legal interpretation of Andrei Chikatillo's prosecution and prosecution. Although politburo could be an "official policy", SESB did not have serial killers, it was truly a legal system to handle others and "Killer X" (as it was actually called) was already looking for Fetisov to bring Burakov. case Indeed, as soon as the authorities were aware of numerous murders, the authorities assigned dozens of dozens of civil servants to end the series of murders of a man who is not perceived as a normal killer. parameters It is good for the directors and writers to always remind the audience that the story is "based on real events", this is not a drastic document. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS Continue **** <br /> <br /> That's a good example of a quick Hollywood thriller that meets the basics of what happened. It's easy to follow and the truth behind the events version is just to be credible. Yes, Chikatilo has raped and killed both children, adults, men and women. Yes, he has released short lab work for many years to continue dying. Yes, they accused the murder of innocent people and they "confessed" the crimes they demanded from the police. Yes, while the gay community was being harassed by harassment (if Burakov had an affirmative engagement). And yes, Chikatilo acknowledged that Gorbunov was not proclaiming the prosecutor's office, but he was alleviating the understanding of a psychiatrist called Bukhanovsky (although Gorbunov did not like the most beautiful martin in this film). Except for truth and truthfulness, all these events tighten the tension and fear consistently, <br /> <br /> Chris Gerolmo, director and co-writer, do not throw any bare feet. . Stephen Reak develops ongoing emotions to sneer and apprehend traces to detect traces, including subtle manipulation and subtle manipulation by Donald Sutherland of the Soviet Party, a horrible rage that frightens Jeffrey DeMunn. Von Sydow's honest investigation of a young research, improves rigorous dialogue and crisp editing in ways that can not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> The "Citizen X" is almost perfect (that is, "Citizen X"), "almost" because of the moment of happiness, so it's NOT ACCOMPANIED. It's highly recommended that fiction be well-spoken, not presented ... but considering Hollywood's "serial killer" movies, it's usually what Hollywood is saying to me.
