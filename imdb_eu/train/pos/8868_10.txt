I have to say that Higher Education is one of the 3 best films I have ever seen. He has a brilliant management and excellent director. Singleton shows how the University lives. There are 3 main stories, skinheads, African-Americans and homosexuals. I was fascinated by all the stories, but the one that got me most was Kristen's story, his feelings were struggling with another girl. The end was great. After seeing 25 times more movie, still cry. I would give this movie 11, but I have to set 10/10.
