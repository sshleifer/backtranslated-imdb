Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, the Hollywood dancers' first dance band, who had been dressed for the past nine years and articulated Art Deco heavyweight designs in the 1930s. However, for the departure of 1936, the fifth of ten musicians together, they do less. On this occasion, Astaire named his "Bake" Baker for his hat, white tie and tails. and Rogers plays the entertainer of the Sherry Martin Dancing Room, he was a pair of Bake - dancing and otherwise - he was previously enlisted. As a result, in the majority of previous parities, unlike personality and erroneous romance, it is already a pair from the beginning of the film. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In fact, Randolph Scott plays in two other films, that is, "Bilge" the hair of being a member of Smith Bake. With Harriet Hilliard, it's not that Irene Dunne (that's who she's completely admitted) has no partner. Married to Ozzie Nelson, married to Ozzie & Harriet for decades, Hillie, Connie, plays Sherry's flower sister. On a stupid ground, a young blonde blonded by Lucille Ball turns a makeover and Hilliard, Ball and Kewpie-doll adorable are three classic films of Betty Grable in front of a mirror. <br /> <br /> What was being discussed about the story will be given to Allan Scott and Dwight Taylor and it's something like this ... Peace and Bilge are in San Francisco, where they end up at a dance floor. by boat bad. Bake works by Sherry, while Bilge joins Connie, is a liberator and later appears as a glamor girl. Romantic blooms for two pairs of couples. Connie and Sherry inherit their father's steam, but they need money to continue floating. Two misunderstandings occur in two ways, but everything works well, when the ship returns to the theater and when they put music into a collection musician. They are as absurd as sounds, but it's a good excuse for the triple trio of Irving Berlin and Astaire-Rogers trio. <br /> <br /> The first two are different shades - the dance contest set. "Let Yourself Go", they reveal themselves without confrontation and the routine comedy routine on a toe tapping "I put my eggs" on. However, the latest dance formality is a classic return, with a melodramatic piece with a stunning arrangement called "Come with music and dance". Oddly enough, this movie, apart from solo Astaire dance, is one of the only moments in which Rogers's only solo dance movie "intense touch" is called "Let Yourself Go". Marinel satin creamy, sings the same song song, close to the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Astaire and Rogers have a typical comic book here. While Scott plays his brand, while Hilliard plays his role, he is very brave and as an ancient singer Hilliard, he plays Berlin's two love songs in a frustrated way. However, this magic look is made by Astaire and Rogers. The 2005 DVD has several minutes, with a good thirteen minute feature, "Follow the Fleet: The Origin of That Dancing Feet of", Astaire and Rogers. "Master melody: Jimmie Lunceford and his orchestra dance" also includes a soundie, a cartoon theme called "Let It Be Me" and the original trailer.
