I had small hopes for this movie, but I was looking for a doubtful afternoon. I came out of the theater and was very happy and surprised. Baseball's tribute is a very fine movie and nice things to get your dreams. Dennis Quaid works hard on his role, and I've touched on his performance. Without a doubt, the whole price card and worth a couple of hours!
