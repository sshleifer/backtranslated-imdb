This film features a spectacular snow-covered mountain with spectacular heights, which offers a very good Stallone performance and an exciting plot. The performance of the main movie, it will really surprise you with its evil ways. The movie does not play all the time, as the screen is playing poorly. Argument and story for this movie shouts to make Stallone a special man. Pictures of Rambo or Rocky or Bond. Stallon's character decided to do it right, but, taking into account the style of drawing, it lessens the illusion factor. It was also a cursy conversation and carelessly condescending timesville. realistic and less "talky". Another weakness was the realistic scenes of shooting. Filmmakers should be more responsible for how filming and losing their infections. They should follow. The quality of the sequel to the movie sequences. He was initially attacked at the beginning of the film. Then, they decided to drop a lot of the sequence of filming (al-A "group" series) as soon as the criminals walked. Mountaintops. This was a great potential all the time. The sequences of action, a better conversation and Stalkon's Rambo / Rocky style emotion / determination would take this film to a higher level. I know that this was not the fault of Stallone. In this sense, the director's film wanted to lower the Stallone's character and tried to steal the movie, which was not very good at his conductor.
