It's amazing. The play was very fun, the script was very fun, the music was fun cheesie, it was a fun little plot. This film was very fun and was able to rest your brain. I found the plot and quotes very creative. 10 out of 10. It was worth 10 out of 10. You do not have to compare with an alleged arthouse movie or a slasher of a bloody movie.
