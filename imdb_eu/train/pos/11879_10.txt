This is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> If the movie is in error, it's like a bull. It's not so much attacking the attacker. Scarface is so noisy and Tony Montana himself produces. The imagination of the audience is nothing left. <br /> <br /> Morody's weak symptom fits an action to a camera. Like a Greek tragedy chorus, he makes a sink and silence, reflection and tug-of-war, a remembrance of Tony's misfortunes. <br /> <br /> There is not much to be careful about a story that is taking place in a disaster, '' Scarface '' is scrolling across the screen with the unstoppable power of an unstoppable train.
