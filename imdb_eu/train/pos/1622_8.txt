I saw this picture for the first time and I've had cartoons of famous black entertainment ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, was white), Thomas "Fats" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson Stepin Fetchit Also) Louis Armstrong and the choirs have come out of the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. It's true ... there are stereotypes, but that was so ... and cartoons were understood as adults for entertainment before your feature film in your local cinema. <br /> <br /> Harmann & Ising's cartoons are "drunk" and scaly (ultimately ... we're talking about MGM), animated standard made by Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox than Low RKO or Columbia. Although Disney was very fond of Mickey's early beginnings, Uncle Waltek washed the "Technicolor" before going. <br /> <br /> Disney also had some cartoons with cartoons with black animators ... for example, the 1937 Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe". But we must remember that these films are part of a certain time and place. From now on the age of 50 ... will also be analyzed by Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park clips, will be analyzed ... and will be released by future audiences.
