John Garfield plays a Navy, a grenade that blinds Guadalcanal and has to learn to live with his own disability. It has all the stereotypical ideas on blindness and it is surely that it will be charged for everyone. The hospital staff and its injured soldiers can not go to him. The little girl can not return home to Eleanor Parker. He is frightened by fears, mercy and prejudices. Garfield has a complex role, and is an excellent performance that keeps the moment amazing, despite its bright melodrama today. The best scene is located in Guadalcanal. In it, the Japanese Japanese soldier is trying to find a nightmare in hell, and then there is a sequence of hospital dreams, which he sees as white with a train platform. With a cane, dark glasses, and a cup of tin, his girlfriend retreated from one camera to another.
