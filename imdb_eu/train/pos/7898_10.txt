This movie got awesome reviews but it was very different and because critics usually do not get "extravagant" films, I thought I tried. Unfortunately, they were very good in this case. <br /> <br /> The film feels poorly, with no excess. The feeling that is impossible to describe, but not good. If you want to confuse things, the script is just a different interest. <br /> <br /> Thurman is just a huge mess of talent. Hurt and Bracco try to get away with the movie, but there's nothing in the script. They might not be ashamed when they decided to go out with it as Thurman. <br /> <br /> It's really a film that left the film "critically" estimated by film critics. quite fun Satira is a time of specific or unrealistic moments, cowgirls of the dead murderer of their ranch with their unclean aroma ... down the front. <br /> <br /> That's why it gets across the chortles, I would not recommend this movie, but it's been a bit of entertainment and even Cowgirls Get Blues is something different.
