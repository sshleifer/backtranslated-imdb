I have always been a fan of "Homicide: Life On The Street", so I heard a meeting movie I could not wait. <br /> <br /> Let me say, I was not disappointed. It was one of the most powerful 2 hours I ever watched. It was lovely to see everyone again, but the greatest pleasure was to have Andre Braugher back, since the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always a great show together.
