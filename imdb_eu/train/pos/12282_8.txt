Although I did not like it in the beginning, I liked it a lot. They did not enter into the third generation Trueba, the love between Blanca and Pedro did not work well and the actor was different than what I imagined. <br /> <br /> I realized later, if the movie had been more loyal to the book, it would last for five hours and it would be boring. I like it now, as my favorite characters are here as I was portrayed. Clara directly looks like Angel, and the story of the film was fantastic, loyal and short. Glenn Close Ferula da. It seemed to me that way, not just through all the mourning. Esteban is just enough. I have never liked his character, and although he was interested in it, I liked it a lot, especially when Clara hit her. As in the book, the last part is very exciting and has a real story. <br /> <br /> The film is very good, especially considering that it was a Latin-American gringo movie. book. It's amazing how many stars are famous, do not you think?
