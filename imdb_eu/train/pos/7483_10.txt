Vanilla Sky 1997 Opens The Eyes (Open Your Eyes) is a remake of the movie. And in my opinion, much human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays with David Aames, who is the same emotion of others, gives them the emotions of others and thinks about themselves. Jason Lee plays with Brian Shelby, David's best and in many ways with a single friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend, to attend David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz Julie Gianni, David's former friend's theater. Kurt Russell is a PhD by Curtis McCabe, interviewing a David psychologist. All their interactions, and their consequences, are Vanilla Sky's most-ever thriller. I will not explain the plot anymore, because it's much more credible, the less you know it. Do not ignore all the people who call abuse to this movie. If you pay attention, you will not be confused. The movie is very complex, but it is not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best films ever made.
