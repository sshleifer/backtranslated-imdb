I do not know how the IMDb fixes reviews, but I know, as is often the case in Amazon.com, there are many negative opinions for this movie, because they are almost negatively repeating the same points that speak. Campaign? Only one member knows. <br /> <br /> In regards to this movie: it's OK. The movie is funny, nice and very correct. <br /> <br /> I've been working for more than a decade in Brooklyn, I lived in Queens, and I visited South Bronx's relatives. But I did not find anything about real or exploitative about these children. Is Grandma a curious nature? Yup. Are the interviews and plots allowed? Yes, fortunately, they do it. Are LES movies other films and children in Puerto Rico / Puerto Rico? You betcha. Is this film a crime? (for my eyes, astroturf), as they would suggest some comments? Barely Thousands of plastic gardens will flourish. <br /> <br /> This is better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or Degrassi. On the contrary, I wanted to compare it, but we never had anything like it, and I was basically touched by the purpose of this film and the humble spirit that is humble. <br /> <br /> That said, I'd like to know the story behind this backbiting! :-D
