I have no word to describe this movie. Only a genius like Amrita Pritam could write a real representation of partition days. The film lasted for many days. <br /> <br /> In this film, Urmila played a role in her life. Purook and Manoj Vajpai set the role of Rashid in life. It's hard to think of Puroo and Rashid's role as these two people. Punjabi costumes looked so natural in Urmilan and Manojon as a natural Punjabi Mussalmaan. <br /> <br /> <br /> Sandhali Sinha Lajjo and Suri Ramchand did a wonderful job. Priyanshu Chattarjee did good work like Triloki. <br /> <br /> You just can not take out some of your scenes. When Puro knows it for the first time Lajos, it brings tears to his eyes. Only Klimax is a killer. I expected a wonderful end, but fortunately, the end was wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras, etc.
