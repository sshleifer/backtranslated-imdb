Okay, clearly. I'm not getting into science fiction, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neil brought his team SG-1 through a Stargate. A circular device that generates a wide range. It gives you the ability to travel to remote worlds. It might seem like your ordinary science fiction series, but it's not! The plot does not have as many millions of millions of stars similar to science fiction series. I'll find it great. It gives you things, events and things that you relate, and you can jump at any time without having to learn the new terms and names of all gadgets. Of course, O'Neil likes to keep a simple terminology, not many. <br /> <br /> This series has a delightful mix of actions, humor and drama. If you enjoy a lot of special effects, you will not find here. They do not use bad, but a limited number of well-made special effects.
