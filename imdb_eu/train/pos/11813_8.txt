Love or not, it's hard not to put Warren Beatty in the "Dick Tracy" movie, the adaptation of the famous 1990's Chester Gould's comic book, a short classic. The superhero films have appeared in recent years in woodworking and will soon become a genre of their own. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < First-class colors, and thus trigger-happy mutants gangsters and loose, this popular female woman still acquainted with this universe giving it a visual tone of luxury and tone. <br /> <br /> It can be said that the film's visual aesthetics is absolutely short-lived, and I think the characters and their acting skills can not be true. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" enjoys his appearance and incredible characters, and Beatty himself plays. a non-intricate detective against the title, is stoic and at every cost that is ready to attack evil. <br /> <br /> Exceptional visual treatments and Oscars, there is a plot of land and Big Boy. Caprice (Al Pacino, top performer at the top-of-the-top Oscar) seeks to get rid of Tr in a well-planned move, but also to control all of the city's criminal actions, combining all the gangs found under him. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tracy faces his relationship with Tess Trueheart. Glenn Headly), as his name continues next to him, and is in charge of The Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who finally finds his father's image in search of the heroine of our rebellion. Tracyk Tess's fidelity Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) tries to squeeze Big Boy by her tempting progress. While all this goes down, things get hot when a new punishment arrives in the village and decides to go half aside. <br /> <br /> The performances are good, because it was a vision of Beatty. Relationships between roots and romances, between them, become the center of the material, taking into account pure actions and special effects. Pacino shows a varied landscape that really stands out from the rest. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is one of the best genres of the comic movie. As Chester Gould was alive, I think he was proud of the beloved detective against Warren Beatty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
