This movie is not your typical horror movie. Some humorous tournaments and some scenes of death may be comical. Personally I liked the movie thanks to its humor. Certainly not a super scary movie, that is, if you're not afraid and then paranoid. Hillbilly guy and Lester performance ... I really liked it. I think my hair will be reddish as beautiful as the Scarlet girl! However, it is worth the hassle of general humor and terrific horror experience.
