This movie was very entertaining. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive Brian Adams makes all French songs. The score is also exemplary and dramatic. <br /> <br /> The movie is a mix of traditional animation, combined with computer-generated images. The result is really amazing. I watch this movie at least once a week with my children, and we're never so tired. The story is compelling and well-known. <br /> <br /> I do not understand anyone who shoots this movie less than 7.
