Having passed the title of the film, "Pecker" is an excellent movie, perhaps best of John Waters. A great work directed by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci's performances is a very funny and real story. There are some amazing scenes for children, but they have some goals. Unfortunately the movie is not produced, and most people will be denied the chance to see it. If it plays an opportunity, go to this movie.
