Fever Pitch is a fun movie. It has many fun moments (including a spectacular shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, it has a "dead zone" in the middle, where all the "heavy breaking" things happen, but this is only fun until it's over. <br /> <br /> Although plots are around the fan club for Sox Sox, it's not charging too much. You have no fun to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's easy for me to say: I've been a Red Sox since I was a boy. <Br /> <br /> 10 to 10 <br /> <br /> Barked
