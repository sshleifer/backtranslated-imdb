I can not remember who recommended it, but he was one of his favorite films. It's certainly strange - like watching on a road accident. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Actually, I can not understand how this documentary's fictional account will be published this year. How can you improve this one? Jackie Kennedy's aunt and cousin go out of New York society and hide in Hampton. In the process, they are detained and described by name "cats mad". They would be hidden when condemned by dirt and did not move Jackie's rescue. The film was made after this rescue. Meanwhile, you can not help thinking, "how bad it was before?" It is a socially superior look, in the darkest, and very wonderful.
