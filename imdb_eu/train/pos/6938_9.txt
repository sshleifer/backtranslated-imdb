After creating the viewer, "Winchester '73" has something similar to "Casablanca". While you see it, you get this feeling so often that you are watching the string of topical finders in the genre; then you realize that the clich√©s have only become part of that particular movie, and they copied so rigorously that this film was so great. In other words, it is a basic task. Watching "Winchester '73" is a joy. The plot's broad lines are confronting us, but especially because we've seen that we have copied them in later movies and yet still amazes you. Conversation, pause, and Mann are excellent. Stewart particularly shines, and if you're a fan, it's "must see," but it's not just a good performance. It is noteworthy that the most thoughtful and / or delightful lines are small characters. These characters make more than just cardboard cuts, they add extra realism to the movie. <br /> <br /> This remarkable film is an irritional one, and it is worth keeping an eye on it. The DVD also has a conversation with Stewart.
