This is where there is more beauty in the chain of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox. The film introduces the story of the stars of the interspersed stars in modern Tel Aviv (an Israeli, Palestinian). The effectiveness of the film is not only the representation of ethnic conflicts, but also the personal and political conflicts of ethnic groups. For example, a secondary character, clearly a gay visitor at the hospital, is a significant moment that her boy has flowers, and tries to visit the family in front of us, and suddenly we see a confused discomfort. to clean the room. It is clear that the young man is not as open as openness, and the family does not accept it, as might be desired, while the boyfriend is confused and rejected. Many complexities are included in a short moment. As we know from Yossi and Jagger, Fox is a master who effectively combines emotional and psychological complexity in a short sequence. The film is also effective in combating Israeli-Palestinian conflict with each other. If you are not heartbroken, you will cry the third in the final third. Although the land is melodramatic, it writes and understands that it reminds us of how good melodrama it is to bring it to fruition.
