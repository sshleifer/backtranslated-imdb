With an amazing cinematography and Kafkesko's nonsense thread, this movie was a simple but wonderful opening. The film plays like a dream and I think why people hate or love. The characters are drawn from the surface, and the story itself is small and maybe not a bit. But they are flaws of the movie, but they are conscious. The movie does not try to work like history, but the 1940s movie warfare is being disassociated. <br /> <br /> I would argue that there was a lot of real-life film, but the amazing movie is that I was totally eliminated. This is one of the most beautiful movies, and in his style there is a wild imagination. I fully understand why people hate it, but I give it 9/10.
