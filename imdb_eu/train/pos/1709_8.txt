Classical adaptation of classic WAR OF THE WORLDS After Halloween's recital, for a real invasion of Martyrs, a group of Earthly martyrs appears on Earth to conquer only their plans. element and reality alone. <br /> <br /> This is really quite good and fun, often with some decent lines (just check the most relevant quotes). It's probably for fans of Sci-Fi. This has proven time for me as I have seen again, much better than I expected. Even though it's a cast of unnamed creatures, it might be the funniest invasion that makes this film marian. Interestingly, Martziano seems to represent virtually heroic action / Sci-Fi heroes in almost all stereotypes (fresh 50s teenage girls, rioters, horror astronaut, brave soldier and scientist). Fun for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Prepare World Scum!"
