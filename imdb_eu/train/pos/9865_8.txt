I watched the two children with them. Although it was not as fast as Shrek, I thought it was pretty good. There were no sounds in the movie theater that was surrounded by children in the spring, so kids liked it. Parents also seemed to be in charge of it. The death and apparent deaths of the characters have led to agitations and good comments. Fortunately, people realize that this movie was made for kids. That's why it was a success, although I liked it. Personally I like Scrat !!
