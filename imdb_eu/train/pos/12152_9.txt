I watched this movie in HBO and it was really good ... indeed, a tragic story of love! I really appreciated that in the heart of the story the guy lost his legs using an accident. It's strange to see a love story that is physically impaired. The love depicted in this character and in her life meant that love could well be thought to cure someone's heart. Laura Leighton ... when she made this movie she was 27 years old ... when she was able to revive this heart, a woman with a great life. Unfortunately, since his family is rich, and that's not, they're developing "problems." <br /> <br /> He is playing HBO for months.
