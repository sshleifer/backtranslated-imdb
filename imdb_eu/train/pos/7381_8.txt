IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) have partnered with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the former contract a professional ANISIO killer at ESTEVÃO (respectively at least at the plot). why explain it well enough He makes a guy and, after receiving his money, has begun to make a couple of two partners, saying that he wants to appear on his company and want a job there (as a supervisor or something?). MARINA (Mariana Ximenes) also finds her daughter ESTEVÃO and she starts with it! <br /> <br /> In a story like this, the crime, corruption, betrayal and blackmail work go hand in hand when no one is innocent or victimized, MARINA, that is, no one excepted. Do you know what happens and I do not denounce anyone? <br /> <br /> This film depicts the sad and cruel reality that exists in the great metropolitan areas of Sao Paulo, as crime is a day of presence. We feel irony, but also the authenticity of the characters such as ANISIO (the characters who play brilliantly Paulo Miklos), who cheers on scrupulously, and even the man who killed the man! It really has to be a monster to do something like that, but of course I know people like there in Brazil or elsewhere? <br /> <br /> Is the film very good, cruel but true, about a sad reality? The play is excellent and the sound too.
