New York, I Love You is a collective work of eleven short films, each segment lasting approximately 10 minutes. Short films are not exactly related, but everyone has something in common, love. In short, it's all about finding love, whether it's just a couple or two of a stranger. The film belongs to Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci and Irrfan. Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. Through this star star and an interesting premise, I expected a horrible movie; I love the problem in New York. You do not add it. It remains the sum of its parts. Some segments are fun, original and interesting, but others are less meaningful (Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q segments). The movie is different and has a very experimental tone. According to the story, it seems that some students can do something. That said, the film also has some great moments, Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman are one of the best segments of an old couple, when they are celebrated in Brooklyn's 67th anniversary. And such moments are, as I am the viewer, I want the films to be more consistent, because here is a great potential. But overall, as the story ends, for me, cinematography and soundtrack has kept everything. The editing was perfect, the film shot was very impressive and the eternal soundtrack could not be better. In the end, you feel like I am a New York City experimental cinema, and like most experiences, there is a fall and a drop. Whether he likes to enjoy the movie in general, or not, he decides. It may be worthwhile for others to lose and lose their time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
