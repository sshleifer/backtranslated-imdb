"My Left Foot" Christy Brown tells the story of an artist who was mixed with cerebral palsy and he studied with his left body to paint his body, the only one on his body. Daniel Day-Lewis earned his first Oscar as the best actress movie, but I'm not sure about it, but it's still outstanding. Day-Lewis makes Brown realistic and occasionally humorous. Brenda Fricker, Brown's generous mother, earned an Oscar for her credible and moving paper. With this movie my problem is sometimes real. When Brown is disappointed and someone needs to help and do everything to the left, the movie is hard to see. This often feels the feeling that the viewer can turn off some time. However, if you look beyond you will see a sense of hope and inspiration, for those who overcome difficulties and other difficulties. We are not guilty of any fault or trouble, we are inspired by this movie, because if we overcome conditions that are much worse than us, we can certainly do the same. Good-natured, sometimes pleasant, but difficult to see. It can not be everyone, but it's not bad. <br /> <br /> *** outside ****
