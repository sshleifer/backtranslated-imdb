This fantastic whodunit is the first prototype of what became the genre of film genres. I was glad that William Powell managed a detective storyline of charisma and charm and a stupid position of Nick Charles's character ("Thin Man" series). Although the story is good for themselves, I think watching this movie really fun is that Michael Curtiz is a fantastically imaginative direction. From a perspective point of view, the film is rich and shows Curtiz commercial support. From screen caption images, camera curly angles and imaginative flashbacks, Curtiz proves that it was one of Hollywood's best directors. It is highly recommended if you are a fan of this kind of film.
