When my son was 7 years old, he is now in the Russian fishing vessel and said that he has had a more rocky film in the 39 years he has considered The Legend of the movie. Boy and eagle He asked me if he asked me. I am sure that a lot of things go through their minds, because it only has 3 hours a day and it has been in this ship for 3 months and the contract will have 3 months to expire. Since Indian blood, it connects with this film. On January 27, he's 47 years old and I'd like to get this movie for me. He lives in Thailand and is a commercial fisherman for the last 17 years and we all know that he is one of the most dangerous jobs. Did you help me get this movie? Thanks in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
