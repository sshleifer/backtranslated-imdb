This movie seemed to be a wonderful investigation of a family in a crisis. Leo, when he says that he is the elder, is the only reaction from family members, and it's a bit stingy and strange. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a family as unmistakable as ever; neither shout to each other. I did not know why it felt that the youngest family could not face the news, but it was difficult to find a very productive movie. <br /> <br /> <br />
