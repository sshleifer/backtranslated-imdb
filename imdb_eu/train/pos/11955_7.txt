Let yourself take the old school to a different storyteller. Scoop is the classic Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> Scarlett Johansson's latest Allen Museum (also featured in Allen's Match Point show last year) was amazing to be able to attract and rely on his sexual conflict. The normal appearance of the student, with the help of nerdish glasses and costumes, still fails as the viewer can take on the same nature as Hugh Jackman's goddess, thanks to the background of the kings (do not worry, there's no disaster here). There is not a great deal of transformation in Johansson here, as the character does consistently, despite the script that he says. Despite apologizing for his logically absent nature, his relationship with the series murderer, his Hotman Royal Jackman, is refreshing to see the symbols of sans Wolverine. <br /> <br /> In any case, consistency Allen is 70 years old. He always tells the stories of cellulose; in front of the modern movie that has not sworn, surely attracts its quiet and simple films. They do not seem to ever want a specific market; Allen likes to make films just like everyone else likes.
