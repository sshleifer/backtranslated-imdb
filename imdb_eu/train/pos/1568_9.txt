Catscratch is the best thing to get out of Nickeloden, including Wayne Knight. This show does not like Maorira and PI. It loves people and they are all Aussies. For the first time, I admit that it seems a bit crude, but it grows tremendously. To correct something that one of the other critics have said, In_Correct (Tv.com) did not say "Is this homo?" He says: "Does that mean you are a man?" This is his phrase in the show. Mr Blik is the funniest thing about Peww-Weww's, I think <br /> <br /> First, I admit that the first episode was good. But after a while, great episodes became! And in the surrealist series, when he found out his insolence ... He abolished Nickelodeon! <br /> <br /> I know Nick is leading the kids, but adolescents appear to be a great show from time to time. and adults. Among these shows, Mr. Bean Animated Series, Charlie Brown, Pelswick, Rocko's Modern Life (sometimes) and Invader Zim. All of them were considered very good, with the exception of CatDog, that Nick felt the need to cancel. <br /> <br /> What I like the last episode, where Gordon fought a duck. <Br> /> <br /> I'd also like to have a DVD, DVDs with many audio commentaries and background papers, and the last episode. <br /> <br /> But, of course, what I am. I would definitely like to see the show return to the air. NICK woke up! <br /> <br /> Your list would be on the Internet somewhere, all closing wait. That would be great.
