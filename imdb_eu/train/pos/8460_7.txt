Gundam Wing is a fun show. I appreciate Gundam and my overall anime. However, I've found the Wing Gundam Lite to be the first to watch, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam and even G Gundam. <br /> <br /> Characters: For a long time, Gundam has a party with his characters. They get into difficulties and grow into adulthood. This is not happening in Wing. Heero is the dog at the beginning and he is finally a dog. Personality does not change, growth is never achieved. The best character is Zechs, that is, the series is the heroine in most cases. But, suddenly, the series betrays it, and turns it into an evil one without apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Mecha: the wing has good outfits. Gundams are super cool, as Epyon is my favorite. Although some OZ dress designs were even paired with classic Zeon costumes. But the design of the sweet outfits is not quite a series to keep the characters bored. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: In the end, Wing has a great fight scene, although it is squeezed with recycled animations, but with plots and shallow superficial development. Nice, but not like previous Gundam departures.
