Fragile Meat, before its great time. HOTEL DU NORD is full of charm and beauty full of French fabled 1930s, although the director has an unusual touch. Here are his great virtues: the interior stairs, wing, and camera with complex and delicious movements. melancholic expansion of light and shadow; The remarkable and brave sets by Alexander Trauner are so inspiring, as the title suggests, to fit themselves; Maurice Jaubert's quiet and sad music; a seemingly temporary plot, a love that throws on her characters, tragedy and fatalism; Great performances of some of the greatest players of all time, in this case, Louis Jouvet and Arletty. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake in the movie, and I was surprised (usually, didactically, a person who diminishes). its importance) to recognize it, its a script. He has many spirits and mischiefs, but without the poetry and irony of the regular collaborator Carne Prevert for his best films, he can not avoid clinking (even if they are still behind). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < emotional, metaphysical and real. The condemned love is at least well functioning. Annabella is very beautiful, but it is not very good to do it, but Aumont's divinity, although appropriate, depending on her nature, is any real, long-lasting, romanticism. Perhaps I'm not alone, but I find it difficult for young couples, so attractive, in just a few months, to be disappointed that they have to shoot at each other. Their sweet lines are also shameful. Of course, this affair is not to be compelling - young people, hope and symbolic opportunity to crush France, or perhaps France, desperate, disappointed, waiting for death. To make the symbols really powerful, they have to convince them at the level of narrative, which is because they think they do not quite here. <br /> <br /> This land saves the story of M. Edmond's story. A character related to the great French gangster tradition. Although we gradually learn, it is a murderous hiding place, a prostitute who lives in Arletty, who is in a close relationship with her compliments. His previous "role" - and the representation of his position is essential - he had a set of characteristics; He has hidden his opposite. When living a fairly live lifestyle, he is trembling by the lover's covenant, and becomes a fatalist, realizing the stupidity of trying to deceive his death. <br /> <br /> That way, accepting less than one person. a collection of signs, and death is an essential reality, the most powerful masculinity must be succumbed - it's like a romantic prototype of Edmond Melville's killer. Exceptionally, it gives a brief hope, which only strengthens, if it has an unbearable irony or a serious solution. <br /> <br /> If all this were a lie, Louis Jouvet's amazing reality. I studied college theater, but this was the first flavor of my screen talents, and revealed that it was worth it to the greatest - Grant, Mastroianni, Clift, Mason, Mitchum, Cotten - giving a quiet nobility, this is a more conceptive concept (saying who is also an allegoric) than a real person. Edmond starts the character of the little movies, but is the protagonist of a tragic force. Like all of the major actors, it's what hides Jouvet's splendor. <br /> <br /> Formally, she is impressed by the flourishing of Carne's ten years before flourishing techniques of the great Hollywood melodrama of Sirk. Ophuls, Ray and Minnelli. Although the German melodrama of Sierck gives its performance to the fluency and appearance of the contemporary (see NEU UFERN and LA HABENERA masterpieces), the style of Carne really adapts to its theme: capture, paralysis, resignation. <br /> <br /> The main principle of the film is water - the credits float and dismantle, the hotel is next to a canal - but Renoir replaces the open river, channel, stop and man. The film starts at the end and the setting never changes, except for a short interlude condemned by two escapators. The characters can escape through death - emphasizes the narrow rooms occupied by their capture, the walls and frames that keep captive, windows that can not run away. So, in the end, the hope is deep, if it is romantic.
