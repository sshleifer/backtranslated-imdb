LOVE AT THE TOP - The American title, "I think It's The Rabid Sheep", which is a highly malicious American film for "Le Mouton Enrage". It's the original movie. more surprising This movie was very close; According to current high standards, it also seems rich and new. Michel Deville is very much valued by the director, but does not create a description that generates social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire, becoming a completely original mix. He suddenly went dull and more understandable. It's a great treat, writing and theme. But Deviller's sweet tone, keeping him in balance but keeping it constantly, because you keep this "lost" movie at a very high level. (Write a dialogue with the director in the DVD "Special Features" section is definitely worth a visit.)
