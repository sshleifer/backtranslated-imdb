Nice surprise! I expected another online discount: The Rock (9) -> With Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for an overhyped movie. Perhaps this type of little-for-fee Bruckheimer rate has been approved. Fast conversations instead of single line guns, backgrounds / motivation, instead of shaking stereotypes, and when the persecution arrived. Armageddon rollercoaster awaits Fanboys: sleep. This is for lovers of smart action. I did not even worry about Jolie so little appeared to me.
