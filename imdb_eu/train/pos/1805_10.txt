I only saw this movie, I saw it for the first time at the age of 7 and I remember almost the end. So, I saw it 10 minutes ago, and (it seems like a baby like 12 ha), at the end I started crying, I forgot how sad it was. I think I was sad at Anne-Marie, she said: "I love Charlie," and also "I will lose Charlie," I cried, weeping. It must be a favorite movie of all time, it's just a movie that deserves it. Look at IT ha-ha, XD <br /> <br /> I can say, but I love this movie, its true classical. <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
