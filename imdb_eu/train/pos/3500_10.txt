Because this movie is very authentic. This story is simple and realistic, capturing all the pleasures and anxieties of adolescents and most loved adolescents and sexuality. <br /> <br /> Actors are as natural as imagery of a documentary, but as convincing and charismatic. The conversation is fresh and honest ... and fortunately it's not about pop culture references. At the same time cinematography is also wonderful and beautiful, bringing the Lower East Side life in a very clear way. <br /> <br /> At art level, I like this movie, because it reminds me of the great Italian neo-Italian. -Realism, such as Bicycle Thief and La Strada. Films do not feel like "real", like this ... or as a Bicycle Robber. And the only other movie that deals with sexual sex is Elia Kazan's grass. The writer and director Peter Sollett deserves tremendous praise. This movie is a great achievement. <br /> <br /> Personally, I'm always glad that the American ethnic group is lovingly and lovingly treating the movie. As an Italian American, my people hate the way they are watching (racist, emotional, criminals in dramatic country drama), and I feel the gravity of this amount with other groups and a huge silver screen. representations Hispanics and Asians, especially, seem damned in westerns and in action movies. (Actually, Gong Liek did not try to become a celebrity in America!) <br /> <br /> Of course, we're seeing a lot more images, like indie photos and Miramax. Here and their ethnic characters ... but Victor Vargas is the easiest to lift. I really like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but a cool change is that Victor Vargas is straightforward (with fewer characters and cartoons), but it's really fun on his own. Finally! Latin characters to be taken into account. Let's remember it's a movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, I think it's a wonderful picture about a Dominican Republic family, which will help Peter Sollett get himself. Soon movies about the Italians! :) - Marc DiPaolo
