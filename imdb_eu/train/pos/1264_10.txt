It is a good reason to face the death penalty. Everyone in Europe would think about it. Everything in the United States is different. It seems that films have demonstrated in the first phase that justice is against the death penalty against American American justice against the racial crime. A young man was released from the death row, in this particular case, a defense lawyer was returned thanks to a lawyer. But the movie is a sequel. The United States Justice is fully governed by the purpose of revenge. The crossroads between justice are governed by revenge. A local Public Attorney has sued the child for false charges. The civil servant of this public prosecutor posts some time for free and the young goes free. He loses a college scholarship and some revenge grabs and without smoking any smoke. He conceals his shame and promises to revenge him. However, he needs to satisfy sexual needs more mentally than hormones, but he is even stronger with headaches and no longer hormonal, and this can only be done with the girls. Apparently, it is associated with another killer in the series of similar predators. One day, the intuition of the local police continues, some vague circumstantial elements of the slaughter of a young girl, and arrest the youth we are talking about. They struck him for 22 hours, blows, blows and phone books, and guns and Russian roulette. He confesses Arriving in the row of death, her grandmother asks him to go to the Massachusetts Massachusetts court-appointed representative to go to Massachusetts teacher's teacher who cheated him a few years ago and is now on vengeful races. He will fail, but it shows that he is far from the illegal line that dictates justice, police and other security forces, which can lead to worse or worse actions that could ruin the best case of accusation. the deepest pursuit of revenge. Someone charged with circumstantial items is very bad for the police or justice to leave the ruin. Better intentions for the police force destroys personal and involuntary disaster destruction; such as the circumstantial elements inflamed by measures of evidence of a person's life can be jeopardized, if at all the risk is compromised. With just a good lawyer, you just have to get junky out of the ordinary. Then, when the film is respected by the police and the rules and rules around justice, it is a profound reflection, if we do not want to make a mistake, of course, because it does not justify the death penalty, it goes against it. The deepest belief in the Americans: "We believe that these truths are obvious, that all men are equal, that their Creators are endowed with inalienable rights, including Life, Freedom, and Search. Happiness." (Declaration of Independence) Life is a human right that is given by its Creator, that is, irrevocable, which means that no one gives it, but that can lead to it. God can only take away the life of a person. It is a supposedly proud pride of not having the punishment of death. Even though we do not remember God, we can not justify justification of death as a vengeance act, and here the film is revenge, it is the worst motivation for the achievement of justice and the peace of the public. Apart from this revenge, there is no justification for this death penalty. And there can always be a mistake in happiness but not with revenge. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Denis, Paris 12 CrÃ©teil University, CEGID
