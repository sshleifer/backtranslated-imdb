Alice Walker's 1983 great and influential novel (written by the letters of the main character Celie to God) was a success that was very successful and honestly Oscar. <br /> <br /> Abandoned and played the role of Celie, Whoopi Goldberg gave her the best screen performance for more than a thousand kilometers. It was not like Oprah Winfrey Sofia in the back, a passionate woman who frightened her fate. Among others, Walker clearly showed the characters on the page - Danny Glover, Albert, Celie's abusive husband; Margaret Avery, Shug, the strength of change, for the sake of good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian Corrine, the wife of the preacher; and Carl Anderson (who was known in 1973 as Jesus Christ the Superstar in 1973) as a preacher as Samuel. <br /> <br /> Beautifully rhythm and sensibly written, 'Color purple' directs its source. Meanwhile, the story is spreading to the audience's drama.
