This is a bad thing; It is not the perfection of any imagination, but it is close, competent and disturbing. An excellent example of a simple idea of ​​a 90-minute write-up. <br /> <br /> Settings do not have the bell and need to whistle; there is no story or a long story; Kate (Franka Pontente) is a young German business woman living in London while waiting for the last hanging train. It wakes up to find the place empty, but it soon happens that it is only far away. Someone, or something, is with him and the intentions are utterly malicious. <br /> <br /> In fact, he met other characters to look for work to survive, including colleagues, homeless couples and a cage. Sanitation worker, all add rhythm and substance to the course. A bit of a rhythm changes somewhere in the middle of the movie, when voltage thrills return to the gore festive, but there is nothing that slows down fast pace. For those with poor leadership, it's probably a great journey; You should click on the right buttons to enjoy yourself in vain. <br /> <br /> The key to the movie may be less successful than the body of the movie, but it's rated. The pleasant moment of an unexpected social commentary, which gives an encouraging conclusion. <br /> <br /> Some may be deceived by a clear explanation of the threat that Kate and her confederates will encounter. However, it was not for me that happened. A horror movie writer should not even be forced to cross it, as a political thriller might expect. There are enough clues here to give the idea of ​​this evil that has existed to make it clear enough, so that the exact and decisive solution is useless. A sense of mystery is welcome and reminds us that this film would be more important than the precise destination. <br /> <br /> My understanding is a quote for this movie. at least, it was the minimum; In this case, our horror applause should be louder, because it does not have the impression of corners to be cut and there will be no effect. <br /> <br /> If this is your movie, it's probably.
