I thought it was a very clear film. I was very happy and I could not ask for more. I did not translate someone I did not really own the movie ... What I needed to do, but I'd really like the amount I love to save. Also, I do not have too many foreign films and this is the first one. Now, I personally like Finnish things, definitely, I added to what I liked. But, in general, it's worth watching. However, if you try to understand Finnish in general or if you try to read some subtitles, this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> You are sure.
