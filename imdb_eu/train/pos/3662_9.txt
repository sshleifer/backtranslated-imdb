This movie is very strange and that's not bad. Homemade HOUSE is a neo-realistic and fairytale movie. Some people think that this movie is pretty curious, but I love it. Once again, this director picks up a beautiful cast of everyday people (not actors) and achieves the performance of a large theater group. Although not as sad as Umberto D, both films have a very similar point, which is very absurd. Do not overlook the special effects of the cursory - it was ultimately done at the beginning of the 1950s and the special effects are not very important (or at least they should not be in the movies). Instead, sit back and enjoy a strange and strange walk. If you do not have it, you will have a ball. <br /> <br /> By the way, for the first time I have reviewed this movie, I've seen another movie from DeSica, which is essential, and that's it. CHILDREN ARE BASED ON. Though MIRACLE IN MILAN's fantasy or light film is not an excellent movie.
