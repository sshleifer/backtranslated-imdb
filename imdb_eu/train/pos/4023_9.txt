This is a very well-done movie. Premiere, script and camera works are primary. It's a good music, especially in the beginning of the movie, when things are still pretty. There are no real superstars cast, although there are some familiar faces. The whole piece is an excellent work with the script. <br /> <br /> But it is difficult to see because there is no similar situation presented. Now it is fashionable to establish the hordes and Muslims who blame British people, and then cruelly distribute them in both countries. There are some merits in this perspective, but it is true that no one has treated the Hindu and Muslims in the region for abuse during the partition. The British are likely to see the tensions between religions and seem to be quite intelligent because they seem to be seen in their goals. To remember very unpleasant and to see on screen. But it's not painted as black and white. On both sides there is forestry and nobility, as well as the hope of changing generations. <br /> <br /> In the end, there is a certain depreciation when Puro manages to make it hard. Who has spoiled his life, but he also really loved him, and his family's creature then came to look for him. But from that point on, there is no chance of a pain. <br /> <br /> This film has a message that Muslims and Hindus give their most serious mistakes and that they can be both decent and caring. The reality of partitioning is much worse than implementing it, because it can never be a real reconciliation across India / Pakistan. In that sense, it's similar to "Mr & Mrs Iyer". <br /> <br /> In the end, we were pleased to see the movie, even though the resolution was heartbroken. If the United Kingdom and the United States are confronted with their history of racism, how honest it would be, would be better.
