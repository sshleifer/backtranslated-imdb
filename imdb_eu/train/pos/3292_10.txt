Paperhouse is a moving and poignant movie that I have ever seen. Often, it is classified as a "horror movie", I think it's a serious mistake. A few days ago they thought "the nightmare that you think about Elm Street," and while I accept its logical conclusion, I can not help it, it's a label that is well deserved and misleading. Those who only see horror watching really lack them and they really prove that they just do not think about it. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's just a bad idea to try to classify this wonderful job. Paperhouse is simply perfect in every detail, and it will always have a special place in my heart. For me, as I said, it was more wise than I was to say, "the movie is playing in a totally emotional level," which explains why my comments are taking place. Honestly, I do not apologize for this, so if you feel too excited about my words to your taste, stop reading because it's something else to come by now. <br /> <br /> It's so strange to find a movie here. his heart struggling to overcome the terrible feeling of childhood and heart disease and isolation and loneliness, which overwhelms us in this fragile age of our lives. It is more unusual to look for children's actors to play their roles with the minds and minds they need to function properly. We have inspired the castles of Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spires and the permanent impact of Paperhouse is due to an incredible and convincing childhood melancholy and alienation (often unfamiliar). <br /> <br /> However, these excellent young stars kept studying and somehow disappeared. <br /> <br /> Add all the talented director (Bernard Rose), imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and funniest soundtrack you can ever hear, and maybe it makes sense and honesty why I can tell you how many people can say anything about that movie. You can. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
