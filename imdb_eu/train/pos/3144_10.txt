This is one of the best comedies ever on television. It's been a fun season for most of the next seasons. The only reason I can give this show 9/10 is due to the unfortunate last season. The good part of last season was the last. The favorite part of this show was the scene of people's imaginations, often depicting the characters of the 70s of television or famous films. It's strange that every character likes (except last season ... too late to try to develop a new character and fez was not so funny). At Red's footsteps the comments never began to age, nor the stupidity of Kelso. Bravo to fox is a good show so long and even longer.
