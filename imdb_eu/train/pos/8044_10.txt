First of all, it's the funniest movie I've ever seen. It's time to fully slapstick, sexual humor, and light-minded stand-up. But he goes deeper than that. The opposite of Souler is the original love story (often we do not see that) I hope that love is; Two people who love each other can work in their misfortune; and, as such, a lively comedy (what we all think is what we should be) will be able to admit the people that are really important. Chris Meloni gave a conviction for Barry Singer to win an Oscar. It is a great movie and I hope that we will see more films of all those involved in the future.
