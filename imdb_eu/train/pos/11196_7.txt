One-Round is called Jack Sander, which is a carnival boxer in the carnival that fights any audience in the carnival. In the event of a round, they win a prize, a long-standing way of attracting customers to travel shows. Jack is in love with the card girl, Mabel, though he turns his head quickly, Bob Corby lets Jack enter his ring to test his options. No one knows about fighting, because Bob was a champion, so Jack allows him to overcome - although he has taken some jobs. As a result, Bob becomes a partner of Jack Sparring and will surrender the Carnival Circuit. Later, Jack improves so much that he also becomes a legitimate boxer. Gradually climbs up to the rankings, he prepares for almost a champion to get ready. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Champ and Mabel Jack start to walk behind their backs - although Mabel is now married to Jack. So, when the last fight between Jack and Bob is very personal, Jack is ready to die. Is it enough? Does Bob make the rage justifiably prevent or hinder his performance? Tune in and watch. This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and today's film seems to be well-known for the mysterious and suspicious films, although Hitchcock does not have a fixed genre. directed or written (both made for this film). In fact, the movie is, in a way, the silent style of Hitchcock, a similar plot emerged in his next silence, as MANXMAN (a protagonist of the same character as Carl Brisson). Therefore, although it seems like a standard day boxing standard, it was not a radical departure for a brilliant director, though the end was quite formulaic. <br /> <br /> In general, it seems predictable and a bit of a Ian Hunter tournament tournament sounds stupid, the movie works well. While away from the perfect silence, it's worth seeing and doing a nice drill.
