This film improved the opinion of Errol Flynn. Flynn, of course, is known for his knowledge and spreading (if he wants to cast a couple of European heights!), This movie allows him to extend himself (though a bit) as an actress in the theater. a social climber, a great ego and a strong nerve. The support works are excellent; Everyone seems to have a good job choice. <br /> <br /> The story is fast moving and, above all, it is not too deep (randomly, perhaps, necessarily, the massive income distribution is unbalanced in time), it definitely entertains and fills . As I know from Jim Corbett, the story is quite faithful throughout history. I liked the great representations of San Francisco in 1880. After all, it's not so much about this movie ... it's very well worth seeing.
