Well, if you're one of those nuts of Katana's film (like me), this metaphysical Katana will help you play the bloodstream samurai movies. <br /> <br /> Tadanobu Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) and Ryu. Daisuke (Kagemusha). The samurai warrior against the Geniki anti-Genik clan touches on the peak of the latest showdown at the Gojo Bridge. There is a lot of body counting. <br /> <br /> Demon, the magic sword, the Shinto priest, the rest of the Buddhist monks and the master Sogo Ishii. <br /> <br /> A good Japanese stormy summer rainy night.
