Anthony McGarten has adapted the play Satellite and has directed the best comedy movie for a long time. Chrissy Dunn (Danielle Cormack) is dropped. He has not achieved much in recent years, and has thanked his family since his father's declaration of death. Carol, her twin sister (portrayed by Danielle Cormack), is playing in the media, as she imagines New Zealand Olympics swim. The Director of Mid-Century, Desperate and Disappointed (Brian Sergent) and a cameraman with his personality - Chrissy's Nightly Evening Stands - Paul (Karl Urban) shoots the most amazing moment in Dunn's family; Carol saw the victory swim. This would not be so bad, but Chrissy's family is shy. First, Wellingtonian Dunns is Joyce (Donna Akerston). She sells fairy cakes and cocktails for all major movies and refuses to change. His eldest daughter, Jen (Rima Te Wiata), is disappointed to have something common. At home it's nice (walls with a painted "Blackberry Sorbet"), expensive tastes and a malignant parasitic attitude. At age 40 and a child is desperate. Ken's husband (Tim Balme) is an electrician and it is not necessary to carry out the jobs they are doing ... as well as doing the work, that is, Jen. Lyn's party daughter (Jodie Dorday - Best New Zealand Film Award for Best Feature Film for this portrait) is Ken's quarrelsome story. Both old sisters collide, mother is in a state; Ken Taylor is a very bad instrument by Tim Taylor, Carol fed his olympic desire and Chrissy is aware of the national television spraying. Why not be embarrassed? It's amazing to see some of New Zealand's favorite faces in the subway comedy with quirky lines. I love Spartan between Jen and Lyn. The other is like an Mona-my-clock-biological watch; The other, with another tramp that she has with her sister, is included in the oven. The film's climate is quite sensitive and well-made. The performances are a treat and the film works perfectly. An excellent way to spend an hour and a half. <br /> <br />
