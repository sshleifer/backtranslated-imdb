All the children there: it is like reading a book with just one single session to read the entire book. That said, I was a giant of BSG, I thought it was one of the best air ducts (not sci-fi). But the time was over and the story continued. "The Plan" I liked the BSG epiloba, but it created a lot of new answers, I expected "Caprica" ​​and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> I would not wait to try. I had another BSG, and I was glad that something different from "Caprica" ​​seemed to be a lot more exciting than the space battles, explosions, and special effects of science-fiction (do not miss me). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales give good performances and Alessandra was wonderful. I can not wait until next week.
