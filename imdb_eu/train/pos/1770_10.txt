In the previews, "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" has an image of another sex-erotic guy near Lonely Guy's 40-ish, because he suddenly feels no desire to make a deed. They have sharpened the illusion of past experience as they dullly prevent women. And it happens unexpectedly: he falls in love. In addition, the film is about it, and it is called "the name of the Virgin of 40 years". <br /> <br /> The title virgin Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), who is exactly 40 years old. an electronics store worker and old-fashioned images, to watch all of his own nice bachelor pad. He has a beautiful home theater system and sees "Survive" with two neighborhoods. Lonely Guy's definition is quite curious and more needs to go and talk more women. <br /> <br /> Now this is the real novelty of this photo: it's really impossible to tackle this issue. elegant and mature outfit This is a movie that could be very different from the most influential group of filmmakers. Endless sexes and jokes would end up, but fortunately this picture never goes down. Be sure to have sexual jokes here and there and a few are targeted at the gay community (that is, those who do not want to take gay-bashing), as each person exchanges mutual insults while playing. video game ("Mortal Kombat: scam, no less - the latest battle against testosterone in boys). <br /> <br /> As the approaching approach 20, McFarlane Toys includes action numbers. Act, this movie is fun and I found it moving, just like I did not have a similar-themed movie, and I was able to link up with more than one theater with the character of Andy Stitzer, I was the only teenager in this exhibition, the rest seemed to be 40. I have a bit of pride, but I ("italic "You" will still be able to connect "The 40 Year-Old Year" one afternoon to the Virgin "? <br /> <br /> Of course, Andy has never sexed and "waking up" (do not ask) every day wakes up, and his friends pressured them to strive for extravagant methods of winning. opposite sex When he discovered the first Andy virgin, at the age of 40, three colleagues and colleagues from David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) have assumed that this gay person had never been with a woman. which can not be far removed from the truth. In fact, Andy loves women, but the traumatic experience of the past (which is revealed afterwards by the excitement) is a success. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But you know that this getaway only ends with disaster, as Nicky (Leslie Mann) has shown, who drives Andy's worst drunken experience, I do not think he would not want and she has incredible encounters. The beautiful girl who works with Beth's (Elizabeth Banks) bookstore reveals that she is endearing in her entire sex life. <br /> <br /> When he finds out with Trish (Catherine Keener) Andy encourages things by kindness. People who work in the store that sells throughout the street to eBay. Hmmm. And with this image of wonderful action pictures, you might end up waiting for a great financial compensation, which is to say, "it can do it without a word." <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a slimming sex we're expecting. Lonely Guys deals with a real problem that goes wrong, there's nothing wrong with being virgin but looking at the big look: how many people do Lonely Guys want to be a lonely man forever? The most important thing that we teach in this photo is that it must be the same Lonely Guy. I do not think it should be a body wax, like Andy (that is to say, it is honestly abandoned, and, depending on the website and other articles, it was actually the blood of the T-shirt of Carell.) "The 40-year-old Virgin" was directed by Judd Apatow and was written by Carell and originated from Carell's theme. Carell is sweet and human nature, because its nature does not look like this plain that looks at this thing. This is probably one of the most intelligent romps ever seen (not very offensive) because the characters are treated with dignity and respect. Although Carell's friends, who report bad advice on insuring non-contact, may be related to the basic level. <br /> <br /> The "40 year old Virgin" theater is a fun way at the end, but I will leave it to the viewer to observe. Surely, Andy can go through all the things he does when Andy has the strength to attract a woman as sexy as Catherine Keener, and then it's true: it's never too late! <br /> <br /> 10/10
