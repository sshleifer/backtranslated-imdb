Why should you consider the capturing "Earth" documentary? How long does it take you on the floor to explain this? Okay, I do not review my review on "Earth's" infinite exploration, but why should I have to see "see". The documentary takes three trips of nature to the migratory paths of three animal families: a polar bear and a paternal life with his father's buckets, the only way to find a way to get courage, a baby with a whale, is taking a baby migratory whale. Elephant mothers migrate to Africa (perhaps not so small, they are elephants). Directors Alastair Forthegill and Mark Linfield worked "out of this land" to capture the survival capabilities of other animal species as well as the magnetic plane of our three animal family protagonists. Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch and Andrew Shillabeer were cinematographically trained to watch camera animals, shooting wonderful nature scenes and instinctive animal behavior; Not to mention, the slo-mo lands of prey of animals were only a few. "Land" is also a lesson on the impact of global warming on animals; father polar is a credit rumor. Earthlings such as Earth, is the time to take a documentary trip to "Earth" today! **** Good
