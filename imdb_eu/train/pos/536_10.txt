A few films can be seen 60 years later, but this is still as compelling. Technological advances do not dated to this classic love story. The special effects used are in 1946. The play is excellent. David Niven, Kim Hunter and, above all, Roger Livesey do a great job. Using black and white / color adds the creative nature of the movie. It has not been seen on TV for 20 years, so few people know its existence. It's my favorite movie of my time. Waiting for the release of the DVD version of this movie for a while is "Life and Death Problem".
