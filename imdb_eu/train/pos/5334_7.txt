Look, if we do not want to admit it, we all have to be frightened to live up to the events that take place in this movie. You know, you come in your car and think about it: "Oh, today I hope that my accelerator is not stuck at a speed of 55 (55 mph), the main brake and the emergency fails, the ignition switch can not be switched off and the gas- I have a whole bucket, all of them at the same time. "Fortunately, for many of us, Thorazin has decided to start the car as a bad idea. It's not so scary, the white elbow, the action-juggernaut of the edge of your seat (even if you're leaving it in the room), "Runaway Car", but they're still moving forward! <br /> </ Totally happy (thanks to imdb) this movie is a real one and I have not only dreamed of finding it. <br /> <br /> This film is at least one of the most spectacular shows you will discover in your trip to El Dorado. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended.
