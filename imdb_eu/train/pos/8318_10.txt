Excellent movie It is directed by a young lady, Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas and Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in Satin's role. This movie was one of the last "black" films of the 70s, and unlike the "blaxploitation" of that era, this film had a plot and it did very well. The sound of the song Aretha Franklin was known in the R & B charts at that time.
