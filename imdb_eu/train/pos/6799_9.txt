This episode is pretty confusing. Some people say that you have to start from the beginning, but I must say that it was in the beginning! Institution and fun to believe that he is a superhero. Clark tells them that all life was on his head. Delusional He also finds some unusual things: he is married to Martha Lionel; Lex is bound to a wheelchair, after the accident on his limb; and it's dedicated to Lana Clark. But he finds a knowledge; Another person dedicated to Clark: Chloe. Also, there is also a sick person in the world of Smallville. And the doctor is a Phantom Zone fugitive. <br /> <br /> This section reminds me of a passage called "Normal Again" by Buffy, where Buffy starts to dream of living asylum. The doctor convinced that all his knowledge was the source of his imagination, he thought he was crazy. His parents were still married, they still lived in the LA, his friends did not exist, Angel was never his boyfriend and he had no sister named Dawn. Demons and vampires also did not exist. Both sections have a tremendous sadness because the doctors do not tell the characters that they are the image of their imagination, but they really tell us what it is: it returns fiction and reality. But it is good to have a real sense of reality, but we see these shows to escape from reality. Again, it is nice that the characters must overcome new challenges.
