I watched a preview of this movie several years ago, and outside of the theater, I was faced with a television television camcorder group. At that time, the only words that fled in my mouth were "Awesome. Just awesome." I like to think that I can better shape myself, but it was not at that time. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting story and a sense of thinking, and acting is the first principle of all. The first film directed by Terry Gilliam was not in the hands of writing. After returning with a long and laborious struggle with Universal with "Brazil", Terry got what he wanted; "last cut". Terry is a master craftsman, and each shot is a beautifully conceived paint, as decided carefully and with belief. It is only a justice that this individual should forbid the conception of a concept. Sadly, however, there are still such limits. <br /> <br /> The DVD edition of the Universal DVD edition of this collection is amazing, although most bonus features are not listed in the box. He has a commentary on director / producers' audio and 90-minute documentary information, and has a great deal about the movie called "The Hamster Factor and 12 Monkeys 12 Stories". He tells some of the creative creations of filmmaking, when the previous tests were badly tested, the group finds their own doubts and feelings of despair. Fortunately, all of us decided to change the movie and were very successful. <br /> <br />
