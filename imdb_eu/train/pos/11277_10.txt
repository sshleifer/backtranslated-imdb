Tarzan and Jane are happy in the jungle. Some men come to look for ivory and bring Jane to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and does not want to refuse. A man has fallen in love with Jane and has decided to take him back ... even though Tarzan wants to kill him. <br /> <br /> This is a curious thing: a sequel better than the original. The "Tarzan, Ape Man" of 1932 was good, but it had tremendous effects and dragged on. This is a much better effect and more mature. There is a lot of strange racism (the black man is taken to death and nobody cares for it), but this was in 1934. There are also plenty of blood, gore and violence (for a 1934 movie) and unpainted images. Underwater long swims perfectly naked! Sexual content is clear and Tarzan and Jane have nothing to wear and sleep together and sexually (without getting married). This would not have any problem today, but in 1934 it was quite extreme. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the movie is well-directed, very fast and full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Weissmuller is seen in this gentle lining cloth for eye-view and Jane's outfit is also revealed. I think Maureen O'Sullivan is a bad Jane, but Weismuller is as perfect as Tarzan. Everyone else is ok <br /> <br /> This is the easiest Weismuller - the best O'Hara Tarzan. Must see, but not for children!
