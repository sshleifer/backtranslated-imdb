First of all, I would like to say that this movie has made more than just the harsh outgrowth that Hollywood has made. McBain is a real movie action that has more violence than most viewers. At the end of the 80's and all the classic elements of the action of the 90's ... violent random free actions (ie, Walkenek and crew to face and kill money to deal with drug traffickers). Instead of instead of going to live and only taking money, the arrest of the collisions, the firefighters, the exterminators of the buildings and, of course, the fires that fire. Walken, in his best form, provides memorable lines, for example, "let's sit ... on the back." and to enjoy the publication tool for this video through the video store that makes another video. If you have a blood invalidity, take unnecessary violent actions to meet this movie today and your thirst.
