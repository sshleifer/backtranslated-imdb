In April 1965, CBS first gave the television monuments of Barbra Streisand. The show was not a huge success, but it won 5 Emmy Awards. It's one of the most memorable moments of television in the 1960s and (unfortunately) they do not have the kind of television they already produce. Wonderful songs and spectacular performances by Barbra, this is a must for any fan of Streisand and anyone interested in any TV.
