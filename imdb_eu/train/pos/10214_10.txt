For me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like to watch movies that do not seem to me to be a favorite, so many other reviews in this movie think spoilers! <br /> <br /> I just saw the movie again and I must confirm it I have the best end of each movie. Then Then Then The actual translation, "Butterfly wing bumps", is not used as a translated title. I think most Americans do not know what Chaos Theory is (except those who have seen or read "Jurassic Park"). The film is based on the theory of chaos, and a small event that may have an incident that does not seem to have a seemingly unrelated event will be returned to a single event. The movie is a whirlwind of stunning effects and causes, following the chaos chain we continue with the chaos of some of the characters (20?). Somehow, at the end, however, it is essential, but if you think, the end is perfect. Think of yourself, "what else should be said"? At the same time it is a very courageous end. We need to be bad to get a treasure like this, but such an end would never appear from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> <br />
