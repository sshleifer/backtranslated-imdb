Leave me out of the blocks, I said that I am a zombie fan, so I do not speak clearly of the aforementioned statements. Second, let's say Italian-Italian film, Fulci has directed Bruno (Rats, Night Of Terror) only 15 minutes to Mattei. This is not the love of dead people. <br /> <br /> That said, I am one of the most entertaining zombie movies ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is horrible. Check that two scientists are trying to find an antidote ("Try to put these two molecules together"). <br /> <br /> There are all varieties of zombies. From moan disadvantaged, with mania of machetes, birds! <br /> <br /> Gore is abundant. Legs are coarse, with arms removed, their stomachs open. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is fast, bringing zombies from one attack to the other. <br /> <br /> Then the head is in the fridge. Oh head in the fridge! One of the greatest moments of horror, when Ash put him in the hands of Evil Dead, get some friends and beer, and you'll have a fun night. <br /> <br /> Did you mention the head in the refrigerator?!?!?
