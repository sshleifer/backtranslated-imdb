It was the worst day of my life. Then I was pretty, I saw, and now I'm ready to get ready and kiss a lighthouse. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I have only seen 2 reasons: VERA-ELLEN'S LEGS. But it's really much more. The plot is pretty clever and creatively woven. Shakespeare's comedy is almost similar, with its misunderstood misunderstandings. And, of course, there ... VERA-ELLEN'S LEGS. <br /> <br /> The unfortunate part of this film is unique to the fact that Mill Mill Entertainment's version of "100 Famous Families" has not been purchased. The best video quality, and the same as the Alpha version. Brightness and contrast are very high, so the scene seems to be a lot when peeled, especially when Vera dancing in a white dress. But I think it could be offset by your television control. I can not imagine how he saw it in the big screen in 51. Scenes, costumes and colors are fascinating and terribly creepy - a doctor at Caligari's cabinet. <br /> <br /> With regard to religion, this is perfect. Not sappy, not invented, or melodramatic. Only 100% ahhhhh. Bad, poor, your wonderful life will never be as wonderful as ever. Take it Wait, what am I laughing about? My life is as bad as yours. Oh the hell Time to watch the movie again.
