Some are still alive and very well, Octavia is brighter and more beautiful than ever, Willi Ninja is very full and gives a great deal of support to the gay community as a whole, Pepper Labeija overcomes the natural cause of last year. he will rest in peace. After Anjiri, Carmen became the mother of the Xtravaganza (a scene on the beach) and it is becoming increasingly beautiful. They have categories dedicated to those who have passed the ball, so they can all be quiet. Another project is "How Do I Look?" You can check the website www.howdoilooknyc.org.
