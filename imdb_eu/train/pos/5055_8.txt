I did not expect much when I saw the DVD cover. I mean, as Pierce Brosnan Gray Owl? <br /> <br /> Oh ... but then the story started, released in a well-lit and pompous movie. I was surprised and was very happy (basically) the real story. He wanted me to read more about this fascinating character, that is, the director fulfilled his purpose and he had a great success!
