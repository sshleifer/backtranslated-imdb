Bugs Bunny is a very early cartoon. As a result, the character is still in the transition period: it is not drawn later, and the voice is not very good. It's also an unusual chemistry between Elmer and Bugsen. Elmer is a bad buyer from the animal shop, Bugsak, with little sauce; There's no gun or mind, he's going to burst to Bunny! However, however, it is still very nice. The first Bugs was definitely sassy and cruel to her later incarnations. Later in the movies, he mixed with Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others, when they started - along with the rabbit. But in this movie, Daffy Duck is much more at the end of the 30s and the beginning of the 40s - those that irritate others! It's true that the "anarchist", instead of the cartoon hero. Although Bug Bunny is not one of the best cartoons, it's fun to watch, and it's interesting to see how much has changed over the years.
