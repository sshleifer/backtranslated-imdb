I bought so much DVD and novel at the same time. Acting chemistry (including Arthur Little) is amazing and exciting. <br /> <br /> With Frederick Lawrence (he considered James Purefoy) he could use a bit more on the screen. And since Gilbert Markham surprisingly "began" the movie. <br /> <br /> I was surprised when Rupert Graves surprised me with Arthur Huntingdon and surprised me with Rupert Graves. I loved Forsyte Saga and I saw all the others. But Arthur surpasses more than here. In my darkest dreams I could not imagine playing a psycho crazy like Arthur Huntingdon. But no. And I love it. And I love it.
