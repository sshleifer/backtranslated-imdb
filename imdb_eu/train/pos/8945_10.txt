It's an honest attempt to make a wonderful and sweet love story. The inspiration behind the "Bewitched" successful TV series, this lovely rom-com is a timeless treasure. comparisons are obvious. jimmy stewart plays badly but "correct". Kim Novac plays a voluptuous blonde witch, captivating him with love witchcraft. When this witch breaks up a stronger witch, she fills her own store and fills her with her beloved pirate (her family feline) caring for her aunt. You will meet aunt by "Death." This movie is a fun and sweet touch with a wonderful show and sorcery. it's worth a look.
