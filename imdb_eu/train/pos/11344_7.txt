Pufnstuf is what it is. I watched at the age of 4 at the cinema and I have a lively and vivid memory of them. Seeing it as an adult, it allows capturing references above the heads of the recipients - like the gray witch of Jimmy's witch is ripped off and Witch Hazel (Cass) peels. It is obvious that the influence of flower culture in that period is sometimes quite progressive. A different track, for example, sends clear messages to young audiences about yourself, about not walking and what's different. This can be a hymn for a gay community. The track should be excellent. <br /> <br /> Martha Raye, Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are just as beautiful as all the witchcraft, and everything given by Living Island has the limitations of the costumes of their characters, such as Billy Barty, Felix Silla and other famous names some). Over a million people in this film - it's nothing subtle, and when Little Jack Wild is concerned about the lives of Living Island, it's a bit more than shouting. It extends with drama and comedy cloth. While I'm thinking - I'll never notice the flute. <br /> <br /> I love the soundtrack, above all, the aforementioned but also with Zap The World, Pufnstuf and even Jack Wild. Additionally, there is a CD from London's El Records populate. See here for more information: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
