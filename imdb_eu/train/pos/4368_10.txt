This film is very exciting and romantic. I've seen them several times and I'm not bored with that. Everything is realistic and is a good plot. The great actors are Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> Really, Braveheart prefers this movie with Braveheart. There are many exciting scenes - Be careful with Bridge Scen and the latest scene. The scene is amazing and amazing. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful music ... the movie fits well. Setup is amazing.
