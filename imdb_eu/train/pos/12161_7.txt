"What Jane Happened to Baby Jane?" Writing by the writer. and "Hush .. Hush, Sweet Charlotte," this endless horror cycle of the 60's has fun and fun. Micheál Macliammóir does a bit of Victor Buono, but the movie is often dangerous in front of a bad music ... it's a terrific recital for children at halfway. Debbie touches, tricks and a trick Harlow, the Winters' religious fanatic has a lesbian limit. Agnes Moorehead names evangelists. Weaver does not have to do anything, and she even has to pay a scam to dance with Debbie.
