This is one of the best episodes of the second season of MOH. I think Mick Garris has a problem with women ... Everything has died, they are often victims (Screwfly Solution, Pro-life, Valerie Stairs, Argentes season, etc. I do not remember Argent. I think the woman burned, tortured, boyfriend and I do not know how to watch it. It's never the best "death right", alternating and good graphic scenography, with suspense (especially wonderful photos of the cell). The performance is like the whole series, the most common one could be "Pro-life" or "Screaming weird" I think that it can be done on a plot for a movie, not just for a section. The series's ideology is horrible, when women die and finish, cutting animals and again ... the first cycle was better than the second one, "Cigarrette Burns" best "), with episodes such as" Homecoming ", funniest)," Imprint "(really moving).
