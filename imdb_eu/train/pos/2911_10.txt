This is one of the best music concerts ever seen and heard. I grew up with All My Lovin 'brand and today's artist listens again to the spelling of Sir P Mc's age spells. This document is left behind to show your way to life, not just for the group, but all of us on the roads. This genre was seen in Aussie in 1975 and the performance of this DVD is guaranteed by less than 30 years ago. 5.1 I have a great surround sound system for doing this justice and would recommend it to anyone, especially the Beatles fan. This is the Beatles concert today. Singer, songwriter, rhythm / bass, piano, ukulele, pure genius. There are few animators that can only hold a single instrument and they can have people in their hands. If you want to see the perfect music, buy a studio-recorded CD. If you want to hear raw music directed at people and spontaneous, with all the excitement and emotion of the crowd - this DVD is for you.
