When I sat down on the floor, I felt comfortable and I did not want to change it. This movie is a dramatic powerhouse. I was sweating and then I needed a shower. What are we? Theoretically, the story of a Turkish teenage girl who lives in Copenhagen (Denmark). Soon it seemed to me that there was a loan in the plot, "Bend it like Beckham", where we had an Indian girl playing football and spoiled her sister's wedding. Here he has been transferred to a Turkish girl who is spreading her brother's wedding by making Kung Fu. And we also have a love story and of course competition. After accepting this, I really felt the emotional drama and shows a beautiful Kung Fu (but I'm not an expert). The main actress of Semra Turan is not only the Danish women's champion, but also gives her an excellent performance, so she thinks there are no autobiographical impressions that she thinks she's not here for her first movie. educational actress The rest of the work helps, a good camera, the intense Kung Fu. Sidenotes: - Public male Turks showed respect, because they had to do something right. - The audience encouraged our heroes to finally go back and attack the boys who were severely struck by his brother's revenge. - Xian Gao, a Chinese cinematic Kung Fu (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon) was the main protagonist <br /> <br /> If you can watch this movie, do it most likely. A good and lively experience and I do not know how this works in the small screen too
