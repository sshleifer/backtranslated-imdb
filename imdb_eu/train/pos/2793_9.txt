Pena is a title that prevents the movie from hating the movie. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cursesy sports film. Although the story line was intelligent and intelligent, the jokes were laughing, they were very funny and the characters were fine. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are excellent young Jess and Jules, bringing excellent performances both on the field and on the outside. Anupam Kher is fascinated by the worried father of Jess, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so wickedly surprised that "The Devil's Ride" would be so welcome once his kind boy, using his beautiful Irish accent! If you do not like football, watch this movie. Anyway, he will smile to you.
