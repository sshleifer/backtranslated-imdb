Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) has trouble in her marriage and otherwise - to see a psychologist. When it comes to problems with his disorder, Liz Blake (Nancy Allen) also participates in the investigation to get to know the identity of a psychopassist. <br /> <br /> Dying outfit is somewhat historically important. Thriller is one of the previous examples of contemporary style, which includes Hide and Seek (2005) with this writing. It is curious that the director Brian De Palma was basically trying to test Hitchcock's birth. For example, De Palma literally raises the parts of Vertigo (1958), to get the evil Dressed to Kill scene of the museum. Watching Kill's shower scene, as well as his evil and death method with Psycho (1960). De Palma also uses recitals of Hirsch's favorite composer Bernard Herrmann. The similarities do not end there. <br/> <br /> <br /> But Palma, accidentally or skillfully, has exceeded its influence or perhaps exceeds its position, structure and dress. a great influence on the flow It may be part of that effect, Dressed to Kill too deep when it is seen at this time. Many of the following directors have taken Hammcock as De Palma and has improved in almost every element, and has been doing so for 25 years with thrilling thrills, Dressed to Kill is much more disturbed, a rude and plaintive scholar. . <br /> <br /> An aspect of the unfortunate improvement movie, Kill and sex scenes have been dressed. Both Dickinson and Allen treat us with their previous nudity (Allen's very wrong angle) and De Palma throws Dickinson's breasts, implicit masturbation, and current movies for rocks. Various scenes are approaching soft-core porn. I am not a fan of wisdom - the opposite. The puritanical, monogamous and protected attitude of our culture is focused on sex and nudity. From my point of view, it's wonderful to put Dressed to Kill out of the flesh and his pleasures to others who have not followed each other forever or have made the movie. They may have wanted to, but they do not have permission to keep t-shirts full of conservative cultural control. <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It's hard to do something like the same style as Palma. He has a strange and curious way of approaching the locals, and he likes drawing planes from interesting angles, such as anecdotal views and similar to James Whale. Of course, later the directors were brighter, but it was hard to say they were better. With regard to film capability, at least, the museum's scene is remarkable for its hand-held gloves and a capacity for building a rather tense over two or two-stroke view of the buckets through the Metropolitan Museum of Art Metropolis Kubo. <Br /> <br /> On the other hand, looking at the story, especially if you want to see a thriller, it seems that the whole scene of the museum seems a little too bad and bad. Due to the first concern about the removal of the main genre of the film and the director-general (as well as the cultural events outside the film), the opening is not very intense as an essay and is incredibly intense. After the first murder, things get better, but due to the impact of the film, the improvement seems a bit more topical and occasional. <br /> <br /> The performances are especially good, although Michael Caine is underestimated, and Dickinson needs to leave before leaving (but the departure is necessary and very effective). Dressed to Kill is at least until you finish your interest, but it's not the events that it has received in the image, it does not exactly look good for years. At this point, it is possible that the film is mainly seen as a historical relic and an example, but it is not the best, at that time, among the flair directors of De Palma.
