'Presque Rien' is the first work of writer and excellent director, Sébastien Lifshitz ("Come Undone") (with the help of Stéphane Bouquet, later "Wild Side"). As Lifshitz's storybook comes along, each of his works becomes more lifelong. In order to develop the affectionate and sensitive stories of love in the same random fashion that has been mixed and insecure youth, now time is spent, reflective time, time spent, only time - Lifshitz makes his stories more personal, involving the viewer. with all the characters' responses. It takes a bit of work to get into his method, but if he goes through his technique, he takes us deeper into the film. <br /> <br /> The beautiful and elegant Jérémie Elkaïm travels to the sea on a holiday, leaving her mother (Dominique Reymond) struggling with her defined illness, Annick (Marie Matheron) and wise man and Sarah's sister (Laetitia Legrix) accompanied: his father was far from home for business reasons. Just getting out of the movie's first moments, just imagine Mathieu, who seems depressed, riding on trains, talking to someone in a small recorder. We wonder if the actions of mind are contemporary memory or action. <br /> <br /> When it comes to sunbathing on the beach, a handsome young man plays a beautiful young man, and Mathieu's feelings are full of misunderstanding. Young Cédric (Stéphane Rideau) follows Mathieu and his sister at the mystery of the attraction. Soon Cédric approaches Mathieu, and a gentle entry leads to a kiss that begins with passionate love. Mathieu is horrified when he is taking the lead, diverting Cédric's public approaches, but continuing to make shipments. Both young people continue to be in love and the enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship, which is necessary to understand this story, is shared with the audience in very erotic and sensual scenes. However, in summer, Mathieu, being a committed student, is aware that Cédric is a drifter involved in the carnival. It is evident that Cédric is a Dionysian partner, while Mathieu is in Apollonia: Mathieu's architectural ruin tells us the beauty of history and space while Cédric is interested as a new place in love. <br /> </ p> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Mathieu is a complex person, who is facing a family relationship with serious illnesses and a father, a fear of his sexuality and passion for Cédric. Cédric's admission of infidelity and the impossibility to face Mathieu and finally share it in a way, these moments are pleased. Time goes by, family changes are made, and Mathieu depression is included in the suicide attempt. Mathieu finds himself struggling and confronted with all these challenges. Cédric's past lovers make Pierre (Nils Ohlund) an ambitious yet successful hit. <br /> <br /> After watching, the feeling of identifying the characters with these characters is so strong that the beginning film is a powerful desire to start the story with full knowledge. Lifshitz has given us a passionate film meditation, a passionate passion for love, and silent silence and silent films. The whole piece is excellent and the direction is smooth and provocative. Lifshitz is probably one of the bright lights of cinematography. With English subtitles. Highly recommended Grady Harpa
