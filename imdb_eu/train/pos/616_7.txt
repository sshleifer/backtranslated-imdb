If any kind of cinema was called my "pleaser of guilt", it would be a generic type of fantasy. However, the culprit is an incorrect word, because I am glad for being occasionally fleeing. "Stardust" is a good fantasy stock, similar to that expected by Neil Gaiman (or Gaiman adaptation). Mirrormaske's dream is not a sight, it's not the adult's Pan's maze, and it's not a classic, but fantastic-fantasy princess Bride knows. Perfect for the whole view. Fantasy lovers should rejoice - the work of special effects has become sufficiently cheap and inexpensive when it comes to conventional production. <br /> <br /> The story of Stardust gets a young man named Tristan to win. The love and approval of the most beautiful little town of Wall is still an adventure to recover a fallen star. To make things difficult, Tristan's fallen star is a woman called Yvaine, and she does not look for her ... Some witches have an eye on the immortality that the star's heart can give and a lie against his brother. the kingdom of magic leads the dead princes who direct themselves. <br /> <br /> From there everything is quite predictable, but it's a fantastic appealing element, the warmth of love and Robert DeNiro. as a gay pirate In this note, DeNiro's play is not there ... it's not the abuse of most actors by gay characters, but it is seen as a character that is surprisingly effective, a nasty character. a constant joke, joining his character, with the opening of DeNiro, in alternative performances. DeNiro does not have Brazil's own image so special, and that's what he's saying. <br /> <br /> Stardust is perhaps a kind of movie that will last for children and fantasy lover shelves. . I can not say what is new, but there really is. In fact, they know who they like most. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
