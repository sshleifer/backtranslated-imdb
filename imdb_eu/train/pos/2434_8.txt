I have often wondered how much CASPER was for children ... with all his personality issues (we believe this is a dead child spirit, because his house is a plot of cemetery), as well as a disturbing message given by this film. Perhaps Casper's morality was more like the theater, or Famous Studios felt like a new "reality" cartoon base. <br /> <br /> It's a good BOOS TONIGHT project, no doubt. But with the Azeri (who is Casper's friend, but a tragic ending), the development of land is disturbing. <br /> <br /> Give Credits to Famous Studios - they are respectful of death ... but it is wonderful that Casper's mourning is graphic and disturbing for children (even happy ending, but I will not end), and violence is pretty steep , even in the 1940 standards. <br /> </> This may be a good cartoon for parents to help children to explain death - but I would not enter the player for the player's break.
