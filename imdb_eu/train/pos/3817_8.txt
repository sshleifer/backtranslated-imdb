If you had a theater in your life, with you or someone close, the woman (but, in my opinion, as a man could be easily), this pain phase is very real. It's a movie that is not capable of coping with your pain, not knowing what to do, to help you get it. Of course, someone is not a movie that does not help you to stop playing next to you. You realize that this film has only been borne by everyone. The movie is like a movie that someone can push ... it seems like a recommendation. I do not know anyone would recommend me to watch this movie, especially with someone close, but for me ... it's a movie that plays a thing that shows real pain, so it's very important to stay alive. You realize, well, that you or the people around you have been experiencing pain, that's all, all the things that you worry about are so insignificant.
