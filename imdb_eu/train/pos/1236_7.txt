Eddie Murphy has lost time for lost children, so when a very special magic of children is being kidnapped by Tibet, Charlotte Lewis will ask for help from the evil boy. <br /> <br /> Although the story is a bit stupid, it never gets very tidy, despite the darkness of the comedy; Charles Dance sets his comedy with the serious and dark character character of his kidnapped child. <br /> <br /> The Golden Baby is very fun, action overflowing and very compelling, charming, almost magical. way <br /> <br /> 7/10 Excellent for all generations.
