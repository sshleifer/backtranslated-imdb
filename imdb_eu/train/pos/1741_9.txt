This is a dramatic movie in the whole sense of the word. Greece tells us here, in Greece, that we live as a habit in everyday life, without realizing that we are very sad. It's certainly extreme ... but occasionally it surpasses real life pain art. It is a profound challenge to achieve the goals we want to achieve and the whole social structure around them. The film understands the Greek lifestyle, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most Greek films, such as Fast-food-mainstream audiences, this does not have any specific purpose, but do you think someone describes feelings as well as thinks the best words and images. I'm not a fan of traditional music, but I do not listen when I hear another movie. <br /> <br /> I would have defined someone who would say I would say something against this movie. It is this: sometimes the transition between scenes suddenly or slightly shattered. I think the edition has been cut for two hours and a bit of theater. <br /> <br /> However, I can write more about my thoughts about it, but I think I need to see it and discuss it with a friend. It must be seen
