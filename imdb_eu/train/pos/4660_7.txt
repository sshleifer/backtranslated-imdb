"Hot Millions" is a well-written and stealing story (about a stolen ax), according to Peter Ustinov's main character, London's "million-strong" office. A United States corporation, creating corporate continent corporations and transferring funds to secure your company's safe computer. (Remember, the spoiler police, this is a comedy, not a mystery.) Since 1968, the representation of movie computers seems to me nasty for people who are currently literate with computers. But I would like to say that one of the computers that worked with this computer before making this movie was also written by illiterate writers, probably to increase the comedy aspects of this British film. <br /> <br /> If you have little taste for this entertainment, you can drag your movie places. Fortunately, it is well-tucked away; Unfortunately, the latest credits are not classical music that they use: the final symphonic piece and the central piano flute pair. I just remember the song that Luluk sings.
