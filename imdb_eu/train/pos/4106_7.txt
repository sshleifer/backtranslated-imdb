It's definitely NOT an intellectual film with a profound mission; So, I do not really think that there is no abuse if you're not a Czech. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy. Humor is very easy, quite fun and sometimes, perhaps, a little bit of a morbid. Actors and characters are very similar to Samotari (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Troia, Vladimír Dlouhý), so they are the authors. But it does not matter, the genre is really different and these two films would not compare. Jedna Ruka Netleska does not try to give a lesson, she tries to laugh and she will succeed with some chances. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, not a simple one, but I liked it. . Some scenes are really seen.
