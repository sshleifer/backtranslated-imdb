It was an interesting opportunity to use Buster Keaton at the end of his career. It may be a great comedy of silent ages. This allows the talents to be shown in a short story on a journey time. It is linked to a man who lives today, and it is obvious that we should leave ourselves with the best sight of Keaton. I heard the voice before. I think that Beach Party has made some of these films, playing some empty characters for just a few dollars. Serling seemed to respect him and thus figured. It's not a bad story. It shows how it reacts when we want to get something we do not want.
