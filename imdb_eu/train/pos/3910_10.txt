So I'm talking about home, the channels that we're going to turn over a night, and I'll find that man and wearing a heel and makeup, he was in front of a HBO color background. Of course, I made it double and I decided to see it a bit. I did not change the channel until it was so ridiculous. When it happened next, I hung up to hang up and watch again, and one of my favorite shows remained. In the first minutes, the viewers are not sure what to think about, but soon he has gained his humor and incredible spirit. In my brain, many stand-up comedians get together, but it's best Eddie Izzard. His style is very refreshing, and it's nice to hear jokes like stories and puberty when most comedies adhere to current events. His show stayed with me. In summer I went to Italy and, as I was able to think, I was "Italians are always CIAO ..." You will not regret it.
