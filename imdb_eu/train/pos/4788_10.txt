This is one of the biggest films ever I have ever watched: I shot the whole movie. According to music and cinematography, there was little on the screen with sorcery. The slow pace was set according to the way of travel (with grassland grasshopper with trailer) and kept backgrounds and sounds and the slow life of other people. <br /> <br /> The story really happened; Alvin Straight died at the age of 76 in 1996. everything was real, because the actors became a character. Sissy Spacek offered her a bad performance as her daughter was disabled, she suffered a lot but, as she moved on, she always wanted to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was perfectly fine, and Alvin Straight, an elderly and hard-loving man, became the best, because he travels throughout Iowa to visit his unknown brother, Lyle, to stroke his stroke. Alvin learned a lot of wisdom all his life and seemed to bestow him to the best people he found on the way. <br /> <br /> The film emphasizes the importance of man to the man and, fortunately, to all. ours I hope to see you again and again. Directed by David Lynch, this film proves its managerial skill. Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor; The 79-year-old player who received the award was.
