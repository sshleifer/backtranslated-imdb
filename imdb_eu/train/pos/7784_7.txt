It was very wonderful! They combine photography, editing, cinematography and music to the dangerous side of the tourist destination. He was able to enjoy "strenuous" without making a fair passion. We were there! The dream sequences and the flashback sequences were fresh. He spoke to me. Follow the good work! Another of this kind is the People of God. Also, do not laugh! - Comedy, Desperately Seeking Susan. Beautiful sets, all with good performances. I'm sorry, I think that Training Day meets this genre, with excellent performances of theatrical team. I had to change the channel in one of the most beautiful sequences, but all-in-all, an excellent movie!
