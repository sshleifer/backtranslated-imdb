I recently saw Sundance on the channel. The film's idea, the production of several famous films in its country, was the creation of eleven shorts in one single film focusing on one theme: September 11. <br /> <br /> Wacthing This movie could tell why this filmmakers were excellent in their country, because it had all the elements of a great movie. <br /> <br /> The movie Iran begins a film where teachers are struggling to teach students. They did not realize what happened later on September 11. <br /> <br /> The second French film depicts a lover of love with a deaf woman who does not know what's happening on television. theater <br /> <br /> The next Egyptian movie filmmaker talks about the latest incidents with a dead soldier about the 11/11 terrorists but in other places with bombings. <br /> <br /> The Bolivian is studying about the events of September 11th and believes that he must march. <br /> <br /> Next in a country in Africa. There is a man who thinks Bin Laden is a boy. <br /> <br /> The next one comes from Mexico and only shows that day. <br /> <br /> Next Israel, buying a report, but joining the reporter in the field of bombings that are often told about attacks. <br /> <br /> I have other films too. At this time I remember them but they are all powerful. From that moment on he will bring emotions. <br /> <br /> 10/10
