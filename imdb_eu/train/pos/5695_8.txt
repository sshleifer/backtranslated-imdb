Some movies can only survive almost exclusively - it's one of the "Wonderland" movies. Script gets everything to go well but without being inconsistent. The speed of this thriller is not the one chosen to cover the weak script, but rather to fully reflect the reality of the drug. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> James Cox as a special way of working with his actors. Most of the characters are constantly on the edges and many people are quite ugly. Val Kilmer has described John Holmes as a hustler, manipulation, and controller. Kilmer was not to blame, but Holmes's version is not enough to control himself. However, it is a wonderful performance. In comparison to Kilmer's "Hollywood" roles, it seems that "Indian books" prove that they are much more at home. <br /> <br /> The actors are the main forces that work together. There are several small screenings, especially women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow have a limited screen time on the back of the men, but they are very wonderful. Together with Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give their curious and astonishing energy for their work. <br /> <br /> I originally watched "Wonderland", because I supposed it was a movie about the porn actor. sense Yes, the story is about John Holmes, but it does not literally relate to his professional career. Basically, this movie is a mystery of murder, so it's great. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating: from 7.5 to 10
