We're talking about a low budget movie, and it's understandable to understand some weaknesses (without spoilers, sudden explosives and alcohol). But in general the story is interesting, most of the characters are nice and there are situations. <br /> <br /> I like movies that surprise you with people you really like, then draw them and turn them in on the plot ... I'm applauding about that. <br /> <br /> Even if I mean, try to see the "Nueve Reinas" (Nine Queens) Argentine film.
