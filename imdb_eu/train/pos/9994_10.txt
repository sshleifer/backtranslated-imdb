"Life is bitter" is the parody of life and death, happiness and depression. Black and white is always in our lives. Mel Brooksen is always just as good as performance, and other actors are also working. This movie has Capra flavor, which is why it's so good. <br /> <br /> There are some unforgettable gag, such as Brooks tries to dancing money, dancing across the street and everything that people spend. just ignore it or get in touch with a wonderful, fun-filled man who believes in Paul Getty and when he starts arguing and stealing together. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen, you do not know what you are? I do not lack <br /> <br /> This movie tells the rich old and eternal fight against the poor. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this film and reality is that this movie has a happy ending and no reality. <br /> <br /> Yes, indeed, Life Stinks.
