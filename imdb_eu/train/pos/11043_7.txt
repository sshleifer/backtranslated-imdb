Malefique, much more than the spectator, has finished its exciting atmosphere. Nearly all of the movie is collected in about 4 characters in a jail stamp. There, Marcus and his little boy are depressed. Soon, the prisoners found a newspaper of the previous detainee behind a brick, obsessed with hidden and black magic. From here, the secret of the book and escape from jail. This happens when a light comes out of the cell leads to accidents on the way. <br /> <br /> I am honestly thinking that the story is pretty weak and it's a great tour, but it's just for me to end up falling apart. In any case, I was fascinated by the last moment, because the film's atmosphere is unique and on a minimal stage. They die, raw and mysterious ... it does not creep on your spine, and hidden issues are very well done and reminded me of hellcraft issues in Hellraiser. Malefique has a claustrophobic and cold feeling with green color. Sometimes you wonder what the real or hidden world in the world is here ... when the lost boy gets lost with his fingers and when Marcus gets sucked to suck, it is normal, then, how strange the bright doors can be awful? With the budget, the movie creates a unique atmosphere and the viewer is very different from most genres. I want to make the story a more consistent end. With the visitor some camera-type items, other prisoners are not obsessed with books obsessed with the doll and doll-like toys. In any case, I will be open to other film directors of Valette, even if the remake of a Hollywood remake of "One missed call" is imbalanced and unnecessary in Miike's version.
