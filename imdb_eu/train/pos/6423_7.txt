This film is not uncomplicated, including all the usual components of Rihan's Dawid Dhawan comedy: hero bumbling, cute buffoon characters, heroes dolls, evil, actors, choreography and small dose of action. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda are police and abuse. Amitabh's policeman's hero is Ramya Krishnan and is in front of Raveena Govinda. As usual, the heroines are full of red. Conmen have no heroes. Paresh Rawal is performing his evil action at DAUD (he also played a similar role in KHOOBSURAT). Asrani stands out in a brief role. She returns to her play, "Angrezon ke Zamaane ke Jailer", in her play at Sholay. <br /> <br /> Govinda is always cared for - Pyaare Mohan, a police officer, senseless and pretty, with Chhote Miyaan. Bihari style Hindi imitated the hilarious outcomes. Amitabh Bachchan, whether he believes it or not, joins him. But AB is ok too. Madhuri Dixit made his own "Makhna" song. Dancing like a wind. <br /> <br /> Viju Shah's great music. Check out "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and the title track. <br /> <br /> Do not go in search of LOGIK, it's a comedy and the script is totally comfortable. Enjoy yourself.
