Many people might be hard to use with Hollywood production styles. Direction is inspired, apparently it's just a stage shoot, and the quality of the audio is bad here and there (sometimes, people's clothing fractures compete with their voices, etc.). Friends and I did not know what to expect, and the first scene almost revealed to us. It seemed very stagy and cheesy. Then we received the tone of the content and we really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> It's really fun, though it's a few traces. Certainly, if you are grateful for an excellent interview. Helena Bonham Carter is, of course, adorable.
